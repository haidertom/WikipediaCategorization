'''Automation bias''' is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated [[decision support system|decision-making systems]] and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.2514/6.2004-6313 |chapter=Automation Bias in Intelligent Time Critical Decision Support Systems |title=AIAA 1st Intelligent Systems Technical Conference |year=2004 |last1=Cummings |first1=Mary |isbn=978-1-62410-080-2 |chapter-url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20141101113133/http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/CummingsAIAAbias.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101113133/http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/CummingsAIAAbias.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-01 |df= |url=http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/CummingsAIAAbias.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automation bias stems from the social psychology literature that found a bias in human-human interaction that people believe assign more positive evaluations to decisions made by humans than to a neutral object.&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S., &amp; Tagiuri, R. (1954). The perception of people. HARVARD UNIV CAMBRIDGE MA LAB OF SOCIAL RELATIONS.&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of positivity bias has been found for human-automation interaction, where the automated decisions are rated more positively than neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Dzindolet, M. T., Peterson, S. A., Pomranky, R. A., Pierce, L. G., &amp; Beck, H. P. (2003). The role of trust in automation reliance. International journal of human-computer studies, 58(6), 697-718.&lt;/ref&gt; This has become a growing problem for decision making as [[intensive care units]], [[nuclear power plants]], and aircraft [[cockpit]]s have increasingly involved computerized system monitors and decision aids. Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making is dependent on computers or other automated aids and the human is in an observatory role. Examples of automation bias range from urgent matters like flying a plane on automatic pilot to such mundane matters as the use of [[spell-checking]] programs.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skitka|first1=Linda|title=Automation|url=https://lskitka.people.uic.edu/styled-7/styled-14/index.html|website=University of Illinois|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disuse and Misuse==

An operator's trust in the system can also lead to different interactions with the system, including system use, misuse, disuse, and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parasuraman|first1=Raja|last2=Riley|first2=V|title=Humans and automation: Use, misuse, disuse, abuse.|journal=Human factors|date=1997|volume=39|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency toward overreliance on automated aids is known as "automation misuse".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Parasuraman, R., &amp; Riley, V. (1997). Humans and automation: Use, misuse, disuse, abuse. Human factors, 39(2), 230-253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosier|first1=Kathleen|last2=Skitka|first2=Linda|last3=Heers|first3=Susan|last4=Burdick|first4=Mark|title=Automation Bias: Decision Making and Performance in High-Tech Cockpits|journal=International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=February 1997|volume=8|issue=1|pages=47–63|doi=10.1207/s15327108ijap0801_3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11805395_Automation_Bias_Decision_Making_and_Performance_in_High-Tech_Cockpits|accessdate=17 January 2017|pmid=11540946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse of automation can be seen when a user fails to properly monitor an automated system, or when the automated system is used when it should not be. This is in contrast to disuse, where the user does not properly utilize the automation either by turning it off or ignoring it. Both misuse and disuse can be problematic, but automation bias is directly related to misuse of the automation through either too much trust in the abilities of the system, or defaulting to using heuristics. Misuse can lead to lack of monitoring of the automated system or blind agreement with an automation suggestion, categorized by two types of errors, errors of omission and errors of commission, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. science, 185(4157), 1124-1131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Automation use and disuse can also influence stages of information processing: information acquisition, information analysis, decision making and action selection, and action implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wickens|last2=Hollands|last3=Banbury|last4=Parasuraman|title=Engineering psychology &amp; human performance.|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, information acquisition, the first step in information processing, is the process by which a user registers input via the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wickens|first1=Christopher|last2=Hollands|first2=Justin|last3=Banbury|first3=Simon|last4=Parasuraman|first4=Raja|title=Engineering Psychology and Human Performance|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automated engine gauge might assist the user with information acquisition through simple interface features—such as highlighting changes in the engine's performance—thereby directing the user's selective attention. When faced with issues originating from an aircraft, pilots may tend to overtrust an aircraft's engine gauges, losing sight of other possible malfunctions not related to the engine. This attitude is a form of automation complacency and misuse. If, however, the pilot devotes time to interpret the engine gauge, and manipulate the aircraft accordingly, only to discover that the flight turbulence has not changed, the pilot may be inclined to ignore future error recommendations conveyed by an engine gauge—a form of automation complacency leading to disuse.

== Errors of commission and omission ==
Automation bias can take the form of commission errors, which occur when users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information. Conversely, omission errors occur when automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems and the user does not notice because they are not properly monitoring the system.&lt;ref name="Sagepub"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosier|first1=Kathleen|last2=Dunbar|first2=Melisa|last3=McDonnell|first3=Lori|last4=Skitka|first4=Linda|last5=Burdick|first5=Mark|last6=Rosenblatt|first6=Bonnie|title=Automation Bias and Errors: Are Teams Better than Individuals?|journal=PROCEEDINGS of the HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS SOCIETY|date=October 1, 1998|pages=201–205|url=http://pro.sagepub.com/content/42/3/201.abstract|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors of omission have been shown to result from cognitive vigilance decrements, while errors of commission result from a combination of a failure to take information into account and an excessive trust in the reliability of automated aids.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt; Errors of commission occur for three reasons: (1) overt redirection of attention away from the automated aid; (2) diminished attention to the aid; (3) active discounting of information that counters the aid's recommendations.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parasuraman|first1=Raja|last2=Manzey|first2=Dietrich|title=Complacency and Bias in Human Use of Automation: An Attentional Integration|journal=The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|date=June 2010|volume=52|issue=3|pages=381–410|doi=10.1177/0018720810376055|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47792928_Complacency_and_Bias_in_Human_Use_of_Automation_An_Attentional_Integration|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omission errors occur when the human decision-maker fails to notice an automation failure, either due to low vigilance or overtrust in the system.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt; For example, a spell-checking program incorrectly marking a word as misspelled and suggesting an alternative would be an error of commission, and a spell-checking program failing to notice a misspelled word would be an error of omission. In these cases, automation bias could be observed by a user accepting the alternative word without consulting a dictionary, or a user not noticing the incorrectly misspelled word and assuming all the words are correct without reviewing the words.

Training that focused on the reduction of automation bias and related problems has been shown to lower the rate of commission errors, but not of omission errors.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

==Factors==
The presence of automatic aids, as one source puts it, "diminishes the likelihood that decision makers will either make the cognitive effort to seek other diagnostic information or process all available information in cognitively complex ways." It also renders users more likely to conclude their assessment of a situation too hastily after being prompted by an automatic aid to take a specific course of action.&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;

According to one source, there are three main factors that lead to automation bias. First, the human tendency to choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making, which is called the [[cognitive miser]] hypothesis. Second, the tendency of humans to view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own. Third, the tendency of humans to reduce their own effort when sharing tasks, either with another person or with an automated aid.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Other factors leading to an over-reliance on automation and thus to automation bias include inexperience in a task (though inexperienced users tend to be most benefited by automated decision support systems), lack of confidence in one's own abilities, a lack of readily available alternative information, or desire to save time and effort on complex tasks or high workloads.&lt;ref name=goddard2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=K.|last2=Roudsari|first2=A.|last3=Wyatt|first3=J. C.|title=Automation bias: a systematic review of frequency, effect mediators, and mitigators|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=2012|volume=19|issue=1|pages=121–127|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089|pmid=21685142|pmc=3240751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberdi2009"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04468-7_3|chapter=Why Are People's Decisions Sometimes Worse with Computer Support?|title=Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security|volume=5775|pages=18–31|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2009|last1=Alberdi|first1=Eugenio|last2=Strigini|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Povyakalo|first3=Andrey A.|last4=Ayton|first4=Peter|isbn=978-3-642-04467-0|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goddard2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=Kate|last2=Roudsari|first2=Abdul|last3=Wyatt|first3=Jeremy C.|title=Automation bias: Empirical results assessing influencing factors|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=2014|volume=83|issue=5|pages=368–375|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.01.001|pmid=24581700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been shown that people who have greater confidence in their own decision-making abilities tend to be less reliant on external automated support, while those with more trust in decision support systems (DSS) were more dependent upon it.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=Kate|last2=Roudsari|first2=Abdul|last3=Wyatt|first3=Jeremy|title=Automation bias: a systematic review of frequency, effect mediators, and mitigators|journal=J Am Med Inform Association|date=June 16, 2011|volume=19|issue=1|pages=121–127|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089|pmc=3240751|pmid=21685142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screen design===
One study, published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association]]'', found that the position and prominence of advice on a screen can impact the likelihood of automation bias, with prominently displayed advice, correct or not, is more likely to be followed; another study, however, seemed to discount the importance of this factor.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; According to another study, a greater amount of on-screen detail can make users less "conservative" and thus increase the likelihood of automation bias.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; One study showed that making individuals accountable for their performance or the accuracy of their decisions reduced automation bias.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

===Availability===

"The availability of automated decision aids," states one study by [[Linda Skitka]], "can sometimes feed into the general human tendency to travel the road of least cognitive effort."&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

===Awareness of process===

One study also found that when users are made aware of the reasoning process employed by a decision support system, they are likely to adjust their reliance accordingly, thus reducing automation bias.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

===Team vs. individual===
The performance of jobs by crews instead of individuals acting alone does not necessarily eliminate automation bias.&lt;ref name="The International Journal of Aviation Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosier|first1=Kathleen|last2=Skitka|first2=Linda|last3=Dunbar|first3=Melisa|last4=McDonnell|first4=Lori|title=Aircrews and Automation Bias: The Advantages of Teamwork?|journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=November 13, 2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/S15327108IJAP1101_1?needAccess=true&amp;|accessdate=17 January 2017|doi=10.1207/S15327108IJAP1101_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagepub"/&gt; One study has shown that when automated devices failed to detect system irregularities, teams were no more successful than solo performers at responding to those irregularities.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

===Training===
Training that focuses on automation bias in [[aviation]] has succeeded in reducing omission errors by student pilots.&lt;ref name="The International Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagepub"/&gt;

===Automation failure and "learned carelessness"===
It has been shown that automation failure is followed by a drop in operator trust, which in turn is succeeded by a slow recovery of trust. The decline in trust after an initial automation failure has been described as the first-failure effect.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt; By the same token, if automated aids prove to be highly reliable over time, the result is likely to be a heightened level of automation bias. This is called "learned carelessness."&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

=== Provision of system confidence information ===
In cases where system confidence information is provided to users, that information itself can become a factor in automation bias.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

=== External pressures ===
Studies have shown that the more external pressures are exerted on an individual's cognitive capacity, the more he or she may rely on external support.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

===Definitional problems===
Although automation bias has been the subject of many studies, there continues to be complaints that it remains ill-defined and that reporting of incidents involving automation bias is unsystematic.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyell|first=David|last2=Coiera|first2=Enrico|date=August 2016|title=Automation bias and verification complexity: a systematic review|url=https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/2/423/2631492/Automation-bias-and-verification-complexity-a|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|volume=24|issue=2|pages=424–431|doi=10.1093/jamia/ocw105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of various automation bias studies categorized the different types of tasks where automated aids were used as well as what function the automated aids served. Tasks where automated aids were used were categorized as monitoring tasks, diagnosis tasks, or treatment tasks. Types of automated assistance were listed as Alerting automation, which track important changes and alert the user, Decision support automation, which may provide a diagnosis or recommendation, or Implementation automation, where the automated aid performs a specified task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generalizing the effects of automation bias may undermine the development of specific and effective solutions.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Automation-induced complacency==
The concept of automation bias is viewed as overlapping with automation-induced complacency, also known more simply as automation complacency. Like automation bias, it is a consequence of the misuse of automation and involves problems of attention. While automation bias involves a tendency to trust decision-support systems, automation complacency involves insufficient attention to and monitoring of automation output, usually because that output is viewed as reliable.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; "Although the  concepts  of complacency  and automation bias have been discussed separately as if they were independent," writes one expert, "they share several commonalities, suggesting they reflect different aspects of the same  kind of automation misuse." It has been proposed, indeed, that the concepts of complacency and automation bias be combined into a single "integrative concept" because these two concepts "might represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena" and because "automation-induced complacency and automation bias represent closely linked theoretical concepts that show considerable overlap with respect to the underlying processes."&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Automation complacency has been defined as "poorer detection of system malfunctions under automation compared with under manual control." [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Aviation Safety Reporting System]] (ASRS) defines complacency as "self-satisfaction that  may result in non-vigilance based on an unjustified assumption of satisfactory system state." Several studies have indicated that it occurs most often when operators are engaged in both manual and automated tasks at the same time. In turn, the operators' perceptions of the automated system's reliability can influence the way in which the operator interacts with the system. Endsley (2017) describes how high system reliability can lead users to disengage from monitoring systems, thereby increasing monitoring errors, decreasing situational awareness, and interfering with an operator's ability to re-assume control of the system in the event performance limitations have been exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Endsley|first1=Mica|title=From Here to Autonomy Lessons Learned From Human–Automation Research|journal=Human Factors|volume=59|issue=1|pages=5–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complacency can be sharply reduced when automation reliability varies over time instead of remaining constant, but is not reduced by experience and practice. Both expert and inexpert participants can exhibit automation bias as well as automation complacency. Neither of these problems can be easily overcome by training.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

The term "automation complacency" was first used in connection with aviation accidents or incidents in which [[Aircraft pilot|pilots]], [[Air traffic controller|air-traffic controllers]], or  other workers failed to check systems sufficiently, assuming that everything was fine when, in reality, an accident was about to occur. Operator complacency, whether or not automation-related, has long been recognized as a leading factor in air accidents.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

As such, perceptions of reliability, in general, can result in a form of automation irony, in which more automation can decrease cognitive workload but increase the opportunity for monitoring errors. In contrast, low automation can increase workload but decrease the opportunity for monitoring errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Lisanne|title=Ironies of automation|journal=Analysis, Design and Evaluation of Man–Machine Systems|date=1983|pages=129–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take, for example, a pilot flying through inclement weather, in which continuous thunder interferes with the pilot's ability to understand information transmitted by an air traffic controller (ATC). Despite how much effort is allocated to understanding information transmitted by ATC, the pilot's performance is limited by the source of information needed for the task. The pilot therefore has to rely on automated gauges in the cockpit to understand flight path information. If the pilot perceives the automated gauges to be highly reliable, the amount of effort needed to understand ATC and automated gauges may decrease. Moreover, if the automated gauges are perceived to be highly reliable, the pilot may ignore those gauges to devote mental resources for deciphering information transmitted by ATC. In so doing, the pilot becomes a complacent monitor, thereby running the risk of missing critical information conveyed by the automated gauges. If, however, the pilot perceives the automated gauges to be unreliable, the pilot will now have to interpret information from ATC and automated gauges simultaneously. This creates scenarios in which the operator may be expending unnecessary cognitive resources when the automation is in fact reliable, but also increasing the odds of identifying potential errors in the weather gauges should they occur. To calibrate the pilot's perception of reliability, automation should be designed to maintain workload at appropriate levels while also ensuring the operator remains engaged with monitoring tasks. The operator should be less likely to disengage from monitoring when the system's reliability can change as compared to a system that has consistent reliability (Parasuraman, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parasuraman|first1=Raja|title=Performance Consequences of Automation Induced Complacency|journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=1993|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree, user complacency offsets the benefits of automation, and when an automated system's reliability level falls below a certain level, then automation will no longer be a net asset. One 2007 study suggested that this automation occurs when the reliability level reaches approximately 70%. Other studies have found that automation with a reliability level below 70% can be of use to persons with access to the raw information sources, which can be combined with the automation output to improve performance.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

==Sectors==
Automation bias has been examined across many research fields.&lt;ref name=goddard2012/&gt; It can be a particularly major concern in aviation, [[medicine]], [[process control]], and [[military]] [[command-and-control]] operations.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

===Aviation===
At first, discussion of automation bias focused largely on aviation. Automated aids have played an increasing role in cockpits, taking a growing role in the control of such flight tasks as determining the most fuel-efficient routes, navigating, and detecting and diagnosing system malfunctions. The use of these aids, however, can lead to less attentive and less vigilant information seeking and processing on the part of human beings. In some cases, human beings may place more confidence in the misinformation provided by flight computers than in their own skills.&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;

An important factor in aviation-related automation bias is the degree to which pilots perceive themselves as responsible for the tasks being carried out by automated aids. One study of pilots showed that the presence of a second crewmember in the cockpit did not affect automation bias. A 1994 study compared the impact of low and high levels of automation (LOA) on pilot performance, and concluded that pilots working with a high LOA spent less time reflecting independently on flight decisions.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

In another study, all of the pilots given false automated alerts that instructed them to shut off an engine did so, even though those same pilots insisted in an interview that they would not respond to such an alert by shutting down an engine, and would instead have reduced the power to idle. One 1998 study found that pilots with approximately 440 hours of flight experience detected more automation failures than did nonpilots, although both groups showed complacency effects. A 2001 study of pilots using a cockpit automation system, the [[Engine-indicating and crew-alerting system]] (EICAS), showed evidence of complacency. The pilots detected fewer engine malfunctions when using the system than when performing the task manually.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

In a 2005 study, experienced air-traffic controllers used high-fidelity simulation of an [[Air traffic control|ATC]] (Free Flight) scenario that involved the detection of conflicts among "self-separating" aircraft. They had access to an automated device that identified potential conflicts several minutes ahead of time. When the device failed near the end of the simulation process, considerably fewer controllers detected the conflict than when the situation was handled manually. Other studies have produced similar findings.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Two studies of automation bias in aviation discovered a higher rate of commission errors than omission errors, while another aviation study found 55% omission rates and 0% commission rates.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; Automation-related omissions errors are especially common during the cruise phase of When a [[China Airlines]] flight lost power in one engine, the autopilot attempted to correct for this problem by lowering the left wing, an action that hid the problem from the crew. When the autopilot was disengaged, the airplane rolled to the right and descended steeply, causing extensive damage. The 1983 shooting down of a Korean Airlines 747 over [[Soviet]] airspace occurred because the Korean crew "relied on automation that had been inappropriately set up, and they never checked their progress manually."&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;

===Health care===
[[Clinical decision support system]]s (CDSS) are designed to aid clinical decision-making. They have the potential to effect a great improvement in this regard, and to result in improved patient outcomes. Yet while CDSS, when used properly, bring about an overall improvement in performance, they also cause errors that may not be recognized owing to automation bias. One danger is that the incorrect advice given by these systems may cause users to change a correct decision that they have made on their own. Given the highly serious nature of some of the potential consequences of AB in the health-care field, it is especially important to be aware of this problem when it occurs in clinical settings.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

Sometimes automation bias in clinical settings is a major problem that renders CDSS, on balance, counterproductive; sometimes it is  minor problem, with the benefits outweighing the damage done. One study found more automation bias among older users, but it was noted that could be a result not of age but of experience. Studies suggest, indeed, that familiarity with CDSS often leads to desensitization and habituation effects. Although automation bias occurs more often among persons who are inexperienced in a given task, inexperienced users exhibit the most performance improvement when they use CDSS. In one study, the use of CDSS improved clinicians' answers by 21%, from 29% to 50%, with 7% of correct non-CDSS answers being changed incorrectly.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

A 2005 study found that when [[Primary care physician|primary-care physicians]] used electronic sources such as [[PubMed]], [[Medline]], and [[Google]], there was a "small to medium" increase in correct answers, while in an equally small percentage of instances the physicians were misled by their use of those sources, and changed correct to incorrect answers.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Studies in 2004 and 2008 that involved the effect of automated aids on diagnosis of [[breast cancer]] found clear evidence of automation bias involving omission errors. Cancers diagnosed in 46% of cases without automated aids were discovered in only 21% of cases with automated aids that failed to identify the cancer.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

===Military===
Automation bias can be a crucial factor in the use of intelligent decision support systems for military command-and-control operations. One 2004 study found that automation bias effects have contributed to a number of fatal military decisions, including [[friendly-fire]] killings during the [[Iraq War]]. Researchers have sought to determine the proper LOA for decision support systems in this field.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

==Correcting bias==
Automation bias can be mitigated by the design of automated systems, such as reducing the prominence of the display, decreasing detail or complexity of information displayed, or couching automated assistance as supportive information rather than as directives or commands.&lt;ref name=goddard2012 /&gt; Training on an automated system, which includes introducing deliberate errors has been shown to be significantly more effective at reducing automation bias than just informing users that errors can occur.&lt;ref name=bahner2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bahner|first1=J. Elin|last2=Hüper|first2=Anke-Dorothea|last3=Manzey|first3=Dietrich|title=Misuse of automated decision aids: Complacency, automation bias and the impact of training experience|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|date=2008|volume=66|issue=9|pages=688–699|doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, excessive checking and questioning automated assistance can increase time pressures and complexity of tasks thus reducing the benefits of automated assistance, so design of an automated decision support system can balance positive and negative effects rather than attempt to eliminate negative effects.&lt;ref name=Alberdi2009 /&gt;

{{Italic title}}
In [[France]], the '''''cabinet noir''''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[black room]]") was the office where the letters of suspected persons were opened and read by public officials before being forwarded to their destination. However, this had to be done with some sophistication, as it was considered undesirable that the subjects of the practice know about it, and "that the black chamber not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service."&lt;ref name=everything2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Black%20Chamber |title=Black Chamber |publisher=Everything2 |date=2001-01-14 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice had been in vogue since the establishment of posts, and was frequently used by the ministers of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]; but it was not until the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] that a separate office for this purpose was created. This was called the ''cabinet du secret des postes'', or more popularly the ''cabinet noir''. Although declaimed against at the time of the [[French Revolution]], it was used both by the revolutionary leaders and by [[Napoleon]].

== Outside France ==
By the 1700s, cryptanalysis was becoming industrialized, with teams of government cryptanalysts working together to crack the most complex monoalphabetic ciphers. Each European power had its own so called black chamber, a nerve centre for deciphering messages and gathering intelligence. The most celebrated, disciplined and efficient was the Geheime Kabinettskanzlei in Vienna. It operated according to a strict timetable, because it was vital that its activities should not interrupt the smooth running of the postal service. Letters which were supposed to be delivered to embassies in Vienna were first routed via the black chamber, arriving at 7 am. Secretaries melted seals, and a team of stenographers worked in parallel to make copies of the letters. Within three hours the letters had been resealed and returned to the central post office to be delivered to their intended destination. As well as supplying the emperors of Austria with vital intelligence, the Viennese black chamber sold the information it harvested to other European powers. In 1774, for example, an arrangement was made with Abbot Georgel, the secretary in the French embassy, who had access to a biweekly package on information for 1,000 [[ducat]]s.

Black chambers were also employed by the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Leeuw|first=Karl|date=1999|title=The Black Chamber in the Dutch Republic during the War of the Spanish Succession and Its Aftermath, 1707-1715|jstor=3020898|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=42|issue=1|pages=133–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' took the view that the ''cabinet noir'' had disappeared{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, but that the right to open letters in cases of emergency still appeared to be retained by the French government; and a similar right was occasionally exercised in [[England]] under the direction of a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]. In England, this power was frequently employed during the eighteenth century{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and was confirmed by the [[Post Office Act 1837]]; its most notorious use was, perhaps, the opening of [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]]'s letters in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cabinet Noir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[postal censorship]] became common during [[World War I]]. Governments claimed that the [[total war]] which was waged required such censorship to preserve the civilian population's [[morale]] from heart-breaking news up from the front. Whatever the justification, this meant that not a single letter sent from a soldier to his family escaped previous reading by a government official, destroying any notion of [[privacy]] or of [[secrecy of correspondence]]. Post censorship was retained during the [[interwar period]] and afterwards, but without being done on such a massive scale.

The opening of international mail outgoing and incoming from the United States by US Customs&lt;ref name=schneier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/us_customs_open.html |title=U.S. Customs Opening International Mail |publisher=Schneier.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Trade Act of 2002]] occurs under the [[border search exception]] to the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=volokh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/posts/1156897163.shtml |title=Feds Use Border Search Exception to Nab Pedophile |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2006-08-29 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice has had some criticism (including allegations that it adds to the expense of conducting the Postal Service and can thus affect [[History of United States postage rates|postage rates]]),&lt;ref name=mininggazette&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103406/http://www.mininggazette.com/stories/articles.asp?articleID=3659 mininggazette.com]&lt;/ref&gt; of which the USPS apparently informed Congress before passage of the legislation.&lt;ref name=committee&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of the  Mailers' Technical Advisory Committee|url=https://ribbs.usps.gov/files/mtac/MAY02-MTAC-MIN.DOC|publisher=United States Postal Service|accessdate=2012-12-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115041637/http://ribbs.usps.gov/files/mtac/MAY02-MTAC-MIN.DOC|archivedate=2009-01-15|format=Word document|date=2002-05-02|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this criticism may be tempered by the fact that the act prohibits agents searching for contraband from reading mail incidentally included in the package or envelope including it, or allowing others to read it.&lt;ref name=schneier/&gt;  The [[Intelligence Authorization Act]] of 2004 has also been characterized as unconstitutionally permitting the opening of domestic mail.&lt;ref name=schneier/&gt;

'''Causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It has been abolished in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Statute==
This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/35 section 35] of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (drivers of carriages injuring persons by furious driving):

{{blockquote|"Whosoever, having the charge of any carriage or vehicle, shall by wanton or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, do or cause to be done any bodily harm to any person whatsoever, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years ..."}}

This section is printed as amended by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] and of the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]].

This section was repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0025/sec0070.html section 70(a)] of the [[Road Traffic Act 2010]]. In the Republic of Ireland, a person liable to be charged an offence under section 53 of the [[Road Traffic Act, 1961]] was not liable, by reference to the same occurrence, to be charged with an offence under this section.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Act, 1961]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0053.html section 53(5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Misdemeanour"'''

The reference to a [[misdemeanour]] must now be construed as a reference to an offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], section 12(5)(a); the [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Bodily harm"'''

See [[bodily harm]]

In England and Wales, this offence is now used to prosecute:
*drivers of horse-drawn carriages and vehicles
*motorists who cannot be prosecuted for [[dangerous driving]] because they were driving elsewhere than on a road or public place, or because they were not warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]]
*cyclists who cannot be prosecuted for [[dangerous cycling]] because they were cycling elsewhere than on a road, or because they were not warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-248b at page 1626&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used in 2009 to prosecute a death caused by a cyclist collision, which would have fallen outside other laws as it is the closest equivalent to [[dangerous driving]] for cyclists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyclist jailed for pavement death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8197430.stm |date=12 August 2009 |work= BBC News |accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was used again in 2017 for similar reasons&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41028321&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Mode of trial==

In England and Wales, this is an [[indictable-only offence]].

==Sentence==
In England and Wales, this offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], section 35; the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], section 35; the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]], section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempt==
The offence of [[attempt]]ing to cause bodily harm by wanton driving requires an [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to cause bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohan [1976] QB 1, [1975] 2 WLR 859, [1975] 2 All ER 193, 60 Cr App R 272, [1975] RTR 337, [1975] Crim LR 283, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caux Palace Hotel''' is a former palace hotel located in [[Caux, Switzerland|Caux]], above [[Montreux]] in the [[Vaud]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]], in [[Switzerland]].

Built on the Caux Mount by the Swiss architect Eugène Jost, it was inaugurated on 7 July 1902. The building rests on a 400-meter long terrace and is decorated with an abundance of towers and turrets with coloured tiles, which make it a remarkable feature of the Montreux landscape, visible from the whole [[Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut District|Montreux Riviera region]]. It soon became an international venue first in the early 20th century as a luxury hotel, then from 1946 on as an international conference centre dedicated to the rebuilding of Europe under the leadership of the Swiss [[Initiatives of Change]] team. It is now also the seat of the [[Swiss Hotel Management School]] (SHMS) which uses the premises during the school semesters while Initiatives of Change keeps organising summer conferences there each year. The Caux-Palace Hotel is listed as a [[List of cultural property of national significance in Switzerland: Vaud|cultural property of national significance in Switzerland]].

==History==

===Caux before the palace hotel===
Until 1875, the area around Caux was only sparsely populated. The "Caux mountains" had always been used as a [[pasture]] for local farmers while the road to the Jaman pass was the shortest route towards the Sarine and Simmental valleys. In 1875 taking into account the rapid development of tourism on the lakeside where the first hotels had opened in 1837 in [[Montreux]] and in 1841 in [[Territet]], Emile Monnier decided to transform his chalet on the Caux Mountain into an inn with a view to welcome the ramblers who started to explore the mountainside. This development had first affected the village of [[Glion]], halfway between [[Montreux]] and Caux: a road to [[Glion]] was opened in 1850 and a cable-car service was opened between Territet and Glion in 1883.

About the same time local entrepreneurs became aware of the potential of Caux, almost 1000 meters above Glion. Philippe Faucherre, born in 1844 and his wife Louise Vauthier, both from hotel management background, were among them. In 1890 Faucherre bought a stone career in the area and built the Caux Grand Hotel in three years, all the needed material being brought to the construction site by [[mule]]s for lack of other means of transportation.

The railway from Glion to Caux and to the [[Rochers-de-Naye]] summit was built at the same time and inaugurated in 1892 after only 15 months of works, a technical tour-de-force realized under the famous railway engineer Laubi. The extension of this railway between Montreux and Glion would wait 27 more years. The road to Caux was also opened at the same time by public works contractor Pierre Botelli.

The immediate success of the Grand Hotel, which attracted many prominent people to Caux, led other entrepreneurs to conceive the Caux Palace Hotel.&lt;ref name = Mottu&gt;The informations in this section are drawn from Philippe Mottu’s historic book: Caux from Belle Epoque to Moral Rearmament, published by La Baconnière, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The  construction of the Caux palace hotel===
[[File:Caux Palace 1902.jpg|thumb|Newspaper announcing the inauguration of the Caux Place Hotel in 1902.|alt=Une reproduction de la une d'un journal professionnel suisse relatant l'ouverture du Caux-Palace en 1902.]]
Five years after the Grand Hotel opening, [[Ami Chessex]], who was the owner of the lakeside Territet Grand Hotel, decided to build a new hotel on a piece of land he owned at Caux, just under the Caux Grand Hotel – although the area was rather sloppy. Early in 1899 a joint venture company was founded by Chessex and Faucherre with a capital of 2.5 million Swiss Francs. At the start of 1900 this company issued 3 million worth of bonds (and issued 500,000 francs more in 1903).

The first round of works consisted of an additional floor on top of the Grand Hotel, which immediately increased its capacity by 80 beds. Then in 1900 the construction works of the Caux Palace started. The main requirement was to make it the most advanced, most luxurious and biggest hotel ever built in Switzerland. As imagined by chief architect [[Eugène Jost]], the construction started by a 400-meter long supporting wall along the hotel’s site, allowing for the creation of a nice garden at the foot of the future hotel and for a promenade along this belvedere from which future Caux Palace Hotel customers would enjoy a unique sight on the grand landscape of [[Lake Geneva]] and of the [[Alps]].

Alfred Daulte, one of Jost’s deputies, was to lead the works on site. It was difficult job given that there were up to 800 workers on site and that the progress of the construction was under close personal scrutiny from Ami Chessex, who used to walk up from Territet twice a week and did not hesitate to issue orders contradicting Daulte’s. Nevertheless, the building and decoration works were completed in a little over two years, and on 7 July 1902, the Caux Palace Hotel was officially inaugurated in presence of the president of the Canton’s executive, Mr Cossy, and of the whole [[Vaud]] government. The books of the ''Société immobilière de Caux'' showed a total cost of construction of 2,555,949 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The Belle Epoque===
Like its predecessor, the Caux Grand Hotel, the Caux Palace Hotel was blessed with instant success. Visitors included celebrities such as [[Sacha Guitry]], [[Paul Morand]], [[Romain Rolland]], [[Edgar Wallace]], prince [[Ibn Saud]], future king of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[John D. Rockefeller]] and the [[maharajah of Baroda]]. The latter stayed frequently in Caux, using most of the fourth floor. His personal room at the south-west angle of the building enjoyed an outstanding view and was furbished in lemon-tree wood furniture, especially designed for the maharajah. This exceptional furniture and the initial decoration of this room have been preserved to this day.

Two to three weeks of waiting time were sometimes necessary before the privilege of staying at the Caux Palace Hotel could be granted to the customers. Several smaller hotels were therefore built in Caux in the wake of the opening of the Caux Palace Hotel, such as the “Pavillon des Fougères” (later “Hotel Alpina”) or the “Hotel Maria”. A school was opened in Caux in 1905, an Anglican chapel was built in 1906 and a Catholic one in 1907. Many private chalets were also built around the same years. Winter sport facilities included ski and sledge slopes, three ice rinks for skating and a bobsleigh track. The world [[bobsleigh]] federation and the world [[ice hockey]] federation were be created in Caux.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The dark years===
1 August 1914 spelt the end of the golden years of luxury tourism in Switzerland. In a matter of a few days most of the customers had left the hotels, which would remain empty for the next five years. On 10 August, the few remaining Grand Hotel customers were transferred to the Caux Place Hotel and the Grand Hotel was then closed down. In 1917, Ami Chessex passed away after having struggled for three years to keep the company afloat. The cumulated loss at the end of the war would be of 1 million.

In 1919, war had at last stopped and everything could have returned to normal, but exchange rates were high for the Swiss Francs and the Caux hotels did not completely correspond with the new expectations of the customers. Therefore, in spite of a financial restructuration of the company in 1919, business remained disappointing. In 1925, the Grand Hotel was renovated and renamed Hotel Regina, in memory of [[Empress Sissi]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] who had resided there in 1898 just before being assassinated in Geneva.

The years 1927 and 1928 brought at last sizeable improvement for the Caux hotels. A second financial restructuration took place in 1929 in order to raise 1 million francs to renovate the Caux Palace Hotel. The bobsleigh world cup was organised in Caux in 1930. Unfortunately, the years 1930 to 1935 were most difficult as a result of the worldwide financial crisis. The value of the individual share of the ''Société immobilière de Caux'' had sunk from around 200 francs in 1900 to 1 francs in 1936. A fourth financial restructuration was insufficient to mend the situation and the board put the hotels up for sale as the losses piled up.

In 1938 the railway was converted from steam to electricity and the ski fashion reignited interest for Caux. The Caux Palace Hotel was renamed Hotel Esplanade and now targeted a less exclusive audience. However, in 1939 it had to stop all activities for good.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===World War II===
After the Caux Palace Hotel, most other hotels also had to gradually close down. In 1941, Hotel Regina was declared bankrupt and sold twice in a row. The Caux Palace Hotel reopened in May 1944 as a detention centre for [[RAF|English]] and [[American Air Force]] pilots escaped from Italian prisoner's camps. Then from November 1944 to July 1945 they were replaced by Italian civilian refugees and from December 1944 by [[Jewish]] Hungarian refugees. This last group consisted of 1670 people coming from the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] where they had been briefly detained by the SS administration in spite of the payment of a handsome ransom for their freedom. This episode is known as the [[Kasztner train]] story, by the name of the main Jewish negotiator for this evacuation. Last minute negotiations on the background of an impending German defeat allowed the train to be finally redirected to Switzerland as initially planned and to save its passengers from an almost certain death. Orthodox Jews were put up at the Regina Hotel and all other in the former Caux Palace Hotel. An oak tree was planted on the Caux terrace in memory of this convoy and a plaque was inaugurated there in 1999. It reads: “In memory of the Jewish refugees accommodated here during WWII, and in memory of those who were driven back by the Swiss borders. We shall not forget them.”&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journaldesidonie.blogspot.com/ the diary of a Hungarian refugee from the Kasztner train], [http://www.musee-cauxexpo.ch/en/krise.php the historic exhibition in the Caux bookshop] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830203056/http://www.musee-cauxexpo.ch/en/krise.php# |date=2011-08-30 }} and the [http://www.caux.iofc.org/fr/refugies document on refugees on the CAUX-Initiatives of Change website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045549/http://www.caux.iofc.org/fr/refugies |date=2014-04-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These various visitors of Caux degraded the buildings a lot. Everything that could have a market value like door knobs, locks, taps, etc. was dismantled and sold. This completed the ruin of the creators of the Caux Palace Hotel. Apart from the ground and of the building’s shell, nothing was left of the 9 to 10 million Swiss Francs which had been invested there since 1890. It later turned out, however, that the caretaker of the Caux Palace Hotel, Robert Auberson, had been able to hide and store a lot of valuable pieces of furniture, as well as crockery and cutlery.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The salvage of the Caux Palace Hotel===
In 1946, the derelict Caux Palace Hotel as well as the former Grand Hotel and other smaller hotel buildings in Caux looked like near their end. The bankrupt ''Société Immobilière de Caux'' had fallen into the hands of its main banker, ''Banque populaire de Montreux'', who were looking for a quick way out and had put the whole lot on the market at a very low price. The most likely outcome was the demolition of the building in order to reuse its material.

But in an unexpected move, [[Geneva]]-born diplomat [[Philippe Mottu]] bid for the building with a small group of Swiss people. A graduate in theology and political science from Geneva university, Philippe Mottu had been associated with [[Frank Buchman]] and the [[Oxford Group]] since the mid-1930s and in 1943 he had had the recurring thought: "If Switzerland is spared by war, our task will be to put at the disposal of Frank Buchman a place where Europeans, torn apart by hatred, suffering and resentment, will be able to meet each other. Caux is the place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=588526 Story of the birth of the conference centre in Caux, by Philippe Mottu, 1997, in Cantonal Archives index, Lausanne, Vaud]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bankers as well as the [[Montreux|city of Montreux]] [[Mayor (Switzerland)|mayor]] understood full well the positives of having an international conference centre in the area of Montreux and offered a "discount" price of 1.050.000 Swiss francs, giving [[Moral Rearmament]] a priority over other bidders. The ''Caux Foundation'', which would administer the Caux Palace Hotel in the coming decades, being not yet in place, the sale contract was signed on 25 May 1946 by Philippe Mottu and Robert Hahnloser in their own name. It would take 95 individual Swiss donors to be able to reach the 450,000 Francs amount requested as first [[down payment]] on 1 July 1946. In-kind donations such as furniture, carpets also converged from all over Switzerland to help refurbish the former palace.

During six weeks, a team of international volunteers toiled day and night under the guidance of Swiss engineer Robert Hahnloser and his deputy, Dutch architect Jap de Boer, in order to repair the inside of the house. On 9 July 1946 the first meal cooked in the just enabled new kitchen was served to 150 guests. During that 1946 summer, 3000 people visited the new Caux conference centre. Dormitories were installed and some of the participants had to be allocated in nearby hotels. In 1946 and 1947 a series of needed transformations were performed in order to adapt the building to its new destiny: conversation of the ball room into a theater, new, larger entrance hall, etc. Lacking the adequate number of beds, the ''Caux Foundation'' bought the Grand Hotel and the Maria Hotel in 1947 and the Alpina Hotel in 1949, plus various smaller buildings.

===The Caux Conference Centre===
In the course of the next 50 years, the Caux Palace Hotel did not undergo any other significant modifications. Its history is marked by a long string of meetings organised by [[Moral Re-Armament|MRA]], which in certain cases had political repercussions.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the more recent years, see the presentation by the Caux Foundation’s president on 8 July 2012, inaugurating the 5th Caux Forum for Human Security with the participation of former Swiss President Mrs [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] {{cite web |url=http://www.caux.iofc.org/sites/all/files/Official%20Day%202012_Jaulmes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108223944/http://www.caux.iofc.org/sites/all/files/Official%20Day%202012_Jaulmes.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1946–1950: numerous meetings associating [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] participants, among whom the future protagonists of the [[Coal and Steel Community]] agreements, who found a mutual trust relationship through Caux. French [[Member of parliament|MP]] [[Irène Laure]] led groups from Caux through Germany to ask for forgiveness and engage in dialogue. 
*1950: visit by a 60-people strong delegation of Japanese political and union leaders among whom several future cabinet members. They brought as a gift a small wooden cross made from the wood of a tree trunk found in the midst of the devastated city of [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://protestinfo.ch/201508077540/7540-une-fondation-suisse-a-influence-la-reconstruction-pacifique-du-japon.html#.Ve2xvJf4YsY French article from News Agency Protestinfo, published on 7 August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1950: visit by a group of [[Ruhr]] miners, all [[Communist Party of Germany]] members or leaders, who wanted to add respect for moral values and personal change to the body of thought of the Party, and were expelled from it, remaining strongly rooted in Moral Rearmament.
*1950–1956: launched from Caux, an action against [[corruption]] in [[Brazil]]ian harbours was led by an international MRA team. This action spread to [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[favela]]s.  
*1950–1953: numerous visits by workers, managers and employers delegations, particularly from France, who created in Caux the necessary conditions for successful [[collective bargaining]], resulting in the signing on 1 February 1951 of the first [[collective agreement]] in [[France]]. 
*1953–1960: Caux became a platform for contacts between leaders from African and other [[Colonies|colonised nations]] and the representatives of colonial powers. It achieved dialogue for peaceful [[decolonisation]] in [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]], and reconciliation in [[Kenya]] after the [[Mau Mau Rebellion]].
*1961: death of [[Frank Buchman]]. The transition years which followed impaired the progress of MRA activities, including in Caux, but the Caux Foundation succeeded in maintaining the Caux conferences. 
*1964: international agreement on jute rates’ stabilisation, reached thanks to the active, principles-based lobbying of French industrialist Robert Carmichael, a member of the Council of the Caux Foundation.
*1967: opening of the MRA centre in [[Panchgani]] (India), which widened the outreach of MRA towards Asia.
*1968–1969: visit of seven delegations from [[South Tyrol]] / Alto Adigio, which enabled a peaceful resolution of the hardened conflict there between the German-speaking and the Italian-speaking communities. 
*1977–1980: in close link with Caux, action for peaceful independence of former [[Rhodesia]] (currently [[Zimbabwe]]).
*1986: launching of the [[Caux Round Table]], a joint initiative of executives from presidents of European, Japanese and American companies, among whom Ryuzaburo Kaku ([[Canon Inc.|Canon]]) and [[Frits Philips]] ([[Philips]]).
*1986–1995: interpersonal meetings between representatives of opposing groups enhanced reconciliation efforts in [[Lebanon]], [[Cambodia]], [[Somaliland]], [[South Africa]] as well as among ethnic communities of large cities in [[OECD]] countries.  
*1993: launch of the "Foundations For Freedom" programme: thanks to their contacts in Eastern Europe, the West-European MRA teams launched a series of trainings to the ethical preconditions for a sound democracy. This programme evolved into a [[Ukraine]]-based organisation some years later.  
*1994: launching of an international ethical code of conduct for companies called "Caux principles for Business" by the [[Caux Round Table]], followed by the development of a self-evaluation method for company ethics.
*2000–2010: actions for peace and reconciliation in [[Burundi]] and in the [[African Great Lakes]] region, in partnership with the FDFA (Swiss foreign ministry). Meetings between government officials and rebellion leaders took place alternatively in Caux and on the ground.
*2002: a federation of about 30 national sister associations, the [[Initiatives of Change]] International Association was founded, with its seat set in Caux.
*2008–2012: at the initiative of [[Mohamed Sahnoun]], the Caux Forums for Human Security brought together diplomats, politicians and NGOs around the great human security issues: conflicts, natural resources management, unsustainable economic policies, etc.
*2013–2015: the Children as Actors of Transformation in Society (CATS) conferences gathered in Caux specialists of [[Children's rights]], educators and delegations of children and teenagers from around the world.

==Architecture and Style==
The Caux-Palace Hotel building surprises the observer both by its size and by its eclectic style.&lt;ref name = Lüthi&gt;Dave Lüthi, Eugène Jost, architecte du passé retrouvé, Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes, Lausanne, 2001, pp. 52-54, {{ISBN|2880744563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General style===
The [[Architectural style|building’s style]] is often considered as [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medieval]] and has earned the Caux Palace Hotel the nickname of "[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]", whereas

:"in reality it is by no means an archeological reconstruction. Architect Eugène Jost used only some elements with a medieval resemblance – possibly inspired by nearby [[Château de Chillon|Chillon Castle]], a castle which Jost knew well, having restored it: [[bartizan]]s, [[machicolation]]s and the two towers supported by [[corbel]]s which punctuate the apartments building … Their style is barely medieval: granted, it includes a few [[hood mould]]s and a few [[ogee]] arches, but also Florentine neo-Renaissance semi-circular arches with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s, dual colours in French [[Louis XIII style]], adding to that pieces of carved wood and coloured glazed tiles which belong as much to [[seaside resort]] style as to Victorian 'Heimatstil' … Therefore, you could say that the Caux Palace Hotel is not neo-medieval but 'post-neomedieval'. Its architect quoted freely Middle Ages models (castles) which he couldn’t really imitate because they were too distant from his own typology. He reused a few details only, bringing to life a whole medieval or even neomedieval imagery."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

===Enlivenment of the façade===
Studying the façades of all hotels built by Eugène Jost, Professor Dave Lüthi from the [[University of Lausanne]] observed that, in order to avoid the hotel to look like barracks as could result from long rows of aligned hotel rooms windows, Jost contrived to counterbalance the horizontal deployment of the façades by an almost brutal articulation of vertical volumes and by the use of a few ornate bays which create a dynamic in the various sections of the façades (accentuation of [[dormer]]s and roofs, contrasting with angles left free of any decoration).

In the case of the Caux Palace Hotel, which can probably be regarded as Jost’s masterpiece,&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt; the South façade, which contains 271 windows, is ingeniously split in five parts and patterned by numerous protruding elements such as [[balconies]], [[bow window]]s or a [[corbel]]ing gallery on the last floor. In contrast to this part of the building, the common areas rooms is equipped with very large [[bay window]]s which somewhat blur the visitor’s perception of the building from the gardens: these brutal scale changes are typical of [[eclectic architecture]]; they indicate the function of each part of the building and by bringing them together, oppose them, so as to warn the visitor about his own subjectivity: big or small are relative values.

Seen close by, the Caux Palace Hotel is an imposing sight because of its monumental size (which may be its main similarity with its so-called medieval models), yet it nevers "crushes" the observer; seen from afar only its [[cornice]], roof and [[turret]]s can be seen: the Caux Palace Hotel, like a [[diadem]] set on top of the Caux Mount, becomes the giant advertisement for the site.&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt; The Caux Palace Hotel is therefore quite representative of the new trend launched by Eugène Jost:

:"Playing with various loose elements such as balconies, loggias, carved decors, the architect assembles them in a composition which breaks with the academic approach of classic styles. Giving up gradually classic structures built around [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]], [[cornice]]s and [[pilaster]]s which characterise most of the production at the time, Jost gave this hotel a façade which in 1900 belonged only to this type of architecture."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

===Functionality===
In the case of the Caux Palace Hotel as in his other hotel projects, Eugène Jost foremost concentrated on the general layout and on the façades. He unfolded his monumental buildings beyond the point where dimension became detrimental to usage.

:"The customer must then cope with a long walk between the hotel’s entrance and his room (in difference with traditional hotels) but he is led to many discoveries on the way. The dimensions of the spaces he walks across, the diversity of the light sources, the luxury of the decors are as many surprises. Although room distribution may not be 'rational' in the sense which a [[Viollet-le-Duc]] or a [[Julien Guadet|Guadet]] would have had it, it is thought through as an architectural stroll around which the parallel world of services and servants revolves."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

==Renovations==
The Caux Foundation made several renovations in the course of the years, the most spectacular being in the course of the 1980s the complete renovation of the roofs; appropriate coloured glazed tiles could only be found in the region of [[Dijon]] ([[France]]) and they were bought with the financial assistance of the French [[Initiatives of Change]] association. The dining room had been redone in 1959 and a fresco by [[Finland|Finnish]] painter [[Lennart Segerstråle]] was then added.

The arrival of the [[Swiss Hotel Management School]] (SHMS) in 1995 as a tenant outside the conference season has allowed the Caux Foundation to do more to maintain and improve the ageing building and its surroundings. In some cases it was a matter of compliance with more demanding new regulations: there was a revamping of the kitchen in line with the most advanced professional norms, the installation of required fire detector systems and fireproof doors at strategic locations, the installation of separate collection and evacuation systems for wastewater and rainwater, etc. Another key work is the gradual renovation of over 200 bathrooms which had more or less remained early 20th century bathrooms. In other instances, there was a need to adapt to the requirements of the teaching activity of SHMS: creation of classrooms and of a new amphitheater, addition of an internet café. Some structures, such as the ground floor [[pergola]], also received needed renovations.

However, from the cultural heritage viewpoint, the most interesting piece of work was the renovation of the great hall and of some historic rooms in 2007 and 2008 with support from Foundation Pro Patria, Loterie Romande and JP Morgan Chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.propatria.ch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=29&amp;sobi2Id=651&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=fr# |title=Brief note in Pro Patria site (in French) |access-date=2015-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082411/http://www.propatria.ch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=29&amp;sobi2Id=651&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=fr# |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Batir&gt;See detailed article in the Swiss professional periodical "Bâtir", journal romand de la construction suisse, novembre 2007, pages 17 to 22. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was to clean up and to restore the wall and ceiling frescoes of the great hall which had been created by [[Bern]]ese painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Haberer|fr}} in 1902. The ceiling was particularly important as one of the largest ever painted in Switzerland and as the only one still in its original state. It is also unique by its decoration in Swiss [[Art deco]] style and by its [[cupola]] shape. The restoration works of the [[frescoes]] allowed reducing the visual impact of the various alterations they endured in time, to keep in place as much as possible the initial decorations’ substance and to bring to light two additional frescoes adorning the great Hall’s decorative [[fireplace mantel]]s.&lt;ref name = Batir/&gt;

These renovation works were led by specialists Olivier Guyot et Julian James and supervised by the “Monuments and Sites” section of the Vaud state, as well as by Swiss architect Eric Jaeger for the Caux Foundation.&lt;ref name = Batir/&gt;

At the end of 2015, the CAUX-Initiatives of Change Foundation had the heating system replaced, moving from oil to (local) wood heating. [[Fossil fuel]]'s [[CO2]] emissions were lowered by 590 tons per year as a result. The fuel oil boilers and tanks had been installed in the early 1960s to replace the original 1902 six coal firing boilers&lt;ref&gt;Le Caux-Palace change ses grandes chaudières, article in the [[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 heures]] daily newspaper [https://www.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/riviera-chablais/cauxpalace-change-grandes-chaudieres/story/18626281]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Cremieux 136.jpg|thumbnail|The decree]]
The '''Crémieux Decree''' ({{IPA-fr|kʁemjø|lang}}) was a law that granted [[French citizenship]] to the majority of the Jewish population in [[French Algeria]] (around 35,000), signed by the [[Government of National Defense]] on 24 October 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was named after [[French-Jewish]] lawyer and Minister of Justice [[Adolphe Crémieux]], who had founded the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] a decade earlier.

It was signed as Decree 136 of 1870&lt;ref&gt;({{cite French decree|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 136|date in French=24 octobre 1870|lower case=yes}})&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Adolphe Crémieux]] as Minister of Justice, [[Léon Gambetta]] as Minister of the Interior, [[Alexandre Glais-Bizoin]] and [[:fr:Martin Fourichon|Martin Fourichon]] as a naval and colonial minister. The ministers were members of the military government in Tours, the Gouvernement de la Défense nationale, since France was still at war, and the provisional government had its seat in Tours.

At the same time the naturalization regime in French Algeria was confirmed in Decree 137, determining that Muslims are not French citizens in the French colony of Algeria. The aim was to maintain the status quo, the sovereignty of France over its North African colonies. Five years later, in 1875, this was confirmed in the framework of the Code de l'indigénat.

The decree allowed for native [[Jews]] to automatically become [[French citizens]] while [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]] were excluded and remained under the second-class indigenous status outlined in the [[Indigénat|Code de l'Indigénat]]. They could, on paper, request French citizenship, but requests were very seldom accepted. That set the scene for deteriorating relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities and proved fateful in the [[Algerian War of Independence]], after which the vast majority of the French Jews of Algeria emigrated to France.

Decrees 136 and 137 were published in Official Gazette of the City Tours (''Bulletin officielle de la ville de Tours'') on 7 November 1870.

From 1940 to 1943, the Crémieux Decree was abolished under the Vichy regime.

==Text of the decree==
{|class="messagebox"
|
French Republic
No. 136. - Declaring the indigenous Jews of Algeria French citizens.
24 October 1870.

The Government of National Defense Decrees:

The indigenous Jews of the departments of Algeria are declared French citizens; therefore, their actual status and personal status will, after the promulgation of this decree, be settled by French law, any rights acquired to date remaining inviolable.

Any legislative provision, any [[Sénatus-consulte]], decree, regulation or ordinance to the contrary is abolished.

'''Culture theory''' is the branch of comparative [[anthropology]] and [[semiotics]] (not to be confused with [[cultural sociology]] or [[cultural studies]]) that seeks to define the [[heuristic]] concept of [[culture]] in [[operationalism|operational]] and/or [[scientific method|scientific]] terms.

==Overview==
In the 19th century, "[[culture]]" was used by some to refer to a wide array of [[human]] activities, and by some others as a synonym for "[[civilization]]".  In the 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] began theorizing about culture as an object of scientific analysis.  Some used it to distinguish human [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptive strategies]] from the largely [[instinct]]ive adaptive strategies of [[animal]]s, including the adaptive strategies of other [[primate]]s and non-human [[Hominidae|hominid]]s, whereas others used it to refer to symbolic [[representation (arts)|representations]] and expressions of human experience, with no direct adaptive value.  Both groups understood culture as being definitive of [[human nature]].

According to many [[theory|theories]] that have gained wide acceptance among anthropologists, culture exhibits the way that humans interpret their [[biology]] and their [[social environment|environment]]. According to this point of view, culture becomes such an integral part of human [[existentialism|existence]] that it ''is'' the human environment, and most cultural [[Social change|change]] can be attributed to human adaptation to [[history|historical events]].  Moreover, given that culture is seen as the primary adaptive mechanism of humans and takes place much faster than [[human evolution|human biological evolution]], most cultural change can be viewed as culture adapting to itself.

Although most anthropologists try to define culture in such a way that it separates human beings from other animals, many human traits are similar to those of other animals, particularly the traits of other primates.  For example, [[chimpanzee]]s have big [[brain]]s, but human brains are bigger.  Similarly, [[bonobo]]s exhibit complex [[non-human animal sexuality|sexual behaviour]], but human beings exhibit much more complex [[human sexuality|sexual behaviours]].  As such, anthropologists often debate whether [[human behaviour]] is different from [[ethology|animal behaviour]] in degree rather than in kind; they must also find ways to distinguish cultural behaviour from sociological behaviour and [[psychological]] behavior.

Acceleration and amplification of these various aspects of culture change have been explored by complexity economist, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123150543/http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Papers.html W. Brian Arthur]. In his book, ''The Nature of Technology'', Arthur attempts to articulate a [[theory of change]] that considers that existing technologies (or material culture) are combined in unique ways that lead to novel new technologies. Behind that novel combination is a purposeful effort arising in human motivation. This articulation would suggest that we are just beginning to understand what might be required for a more robust theory of culture and culture change, one that brings coherence across many disciplines and reflects an integrating elegance.

'''Digital fashion''' is the interplay between digital technology and couture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been deeply integrated both into the fashion industry as well as within the experience of clients and prospects. Such interplay has happened at three main levels.
# ICTs are used to design and produce fashion products, while also the industry organization leverages onto digital technologies
# ICTs impact marketing, distribution and sales
# ICTs are extensively used in communication activities with all relevant stakeholders, and contribute to co-create the fashion world

== Design, Production, and Organization ==
Among the many applications available to fashion designers to model the fusion of creativity with digital avenues, the Digital Textile Printing can be mentioned here.

===Digital Textile Printing===
Digital printing is a process in which prints are directly applied to fabrics with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing textile waste. The main advantage of digital printing is the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion-marketer.com/2014/06/12/digital_printing/ Fashion Marketer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital Textile printing is “probably the greatest innovation of 21-st century fashion, “ Christina Binkley declared in the Wall Street Journal. The “vastly improved digital printing technologies allow designers to innovate while beefing up their brands“.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/industry/b--digital-printing-and-fashion-23077.html/ Digital Printing and fashion ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand such as Prada, Pucci or Jil Sander are using this technology to invent their design ideas on fabric.

== Marketing, Distribution, and Sales ==
While all digital channels can be used in order to market and sell fashion completely online ([[eCommerce]]), they usually are implemented in connection with offline channels (so-called "omni-channel"). Here Virtual and Augmented reality is playing a crucial role.

=== Online services ===
Prospects and clients can use ICTs - own computers, tablets and smart phones - to skip fitting rooms and cosmetics counters, and instead virtually see how they look in specific outfits and makeup via in-store kiosks, mobile phones or tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/new-tech-lets-retailers-give-head-to-toe-virtual-makeovers/ Retail Customer Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; Modiface is a  web application that anyone can use to give them a virtual makeover. Customers can give any look and decide on what to suits and buy products.

[[Sephora]], the beauty specialty retailer, and ModiFace, an augmented reality virtual makeover technology provider, today announced the launch of a 3D Augmented Reality Mirror that can simulate cosmetics on a user's face in real-time and in 3D. The new patented technology, created by ModiFace, tracks the precise location of a user's facial features and applies eye shadow colors directly on the video feed from a camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modiface.com/news.php/ ModiFace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/101727503/ CNBC: “Sephora brings augmented reality to real-life shop”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes beauty retailers will feature virtual fitting rooms to allow users to experience the look of their product before committing to a purchase. Some examples are color contact retailers Freshlook, which allows users to simulate contact lens wear in their color contacts studio before purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshlookcontacts.com/color-studio/|title=Freshlook Color Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful Eyes also offers a virtual color contact lens try on room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorfuleyes.org/eye-color-changer|title=Eye Color Changer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Dressing Room===
A virtual dressing room&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/13/business/la-fi-virtual-dressing-room-20120714/ LA Times on virtual dressing room]&lt;/ref&gt; (also often referred to as virtual fitting room and virtual changing room although they do perform different functions) is the online equivalent of the near-ubiquitous in-store changing room – that is, it enables shoppers to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically.

The multimedia communication company Eyemagnet developed the Virtual Dressing Room for the Hallensteins menswear chain. The changing room is transformed to a single panel which reflects the user. These users can then use simple arm and hand gestures to ‘try on’ any apparel in the store, take a photo of any selected outfit and have it sent to their mobile phone. Newer versions of the technology eliminate the arm-waving altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/virtual-dressing-rooms-eyemagnet/ Trendhunter - Virtual Dressing Room]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion retailer Topshop installed a Kinect-powered virtual fitting room at its Moscow store. Created by AR Door, the Augmented Fitting Room system overlays 3D augmented reality clothes on the customer. Simple gestures and on-screen buttons let users "try on" different outfits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/11/kinect-dressing-room_n_860740.html/ Huffingtonpost - Kinect Dressing room]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the high variability of virtual fit platforms to predict consumer clothes sizes called into question the accuracy of these systems in their current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=Monika|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|last4=Gill|first4=Simeon|title=Online Virtual Fit is not yet Fit for Purpose: An Analysis of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces|journal=3DBODY.TECH 2017|pages=210-217|doi=10.15221/17.210|url=http://www.3dbody.tech/cap/abstracts/2017/17210januszkiewicz.html|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication and Experience Co-Creation ==
Fashion is also a matter of socially negotiating what is "in" or "out", fashionable or not. In other words, fashion items do not only play on the economic market of physical goods, but also - and sometimes even pore importantly - on the semiotic market of the production of social tastes and customs.

Thanks to social media, and to all services offered by the so-called web2.0, laypeople can contribute to co-create the fashion world, shaping tastes, customs, and fashion-related values.

== Digital Fashion Education and Research ==
Nowadays, the fashion industry needs experts in digital fashion, equipped with the above-sketched knowledge and competences. Several Bachelor and Master programs in Fashion have in recent years integrated Digital Fashion courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalfashion.ch/programmes/|title=Master Programmes  {{!}}  Digital Fashion Communication Research|last=|first=|date=|website=digitalfashion.ch|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are not (yet) dedicated scientific journals devoted to the topic, several research activities have been done in the field. Among them, a dedicated Conference has taken place in 2015 in Seoul, South Korea (see its Proceedings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalfashionsociety.org/DFC/|title=Digital Fashion Conference|website=www.digitalfashionsociety.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2017, SComS - Studies in Communication Sciences, a Swiss-based Communication Journal, has launched a call for papers in the field of Fashion Communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hope.uzh.ch/scoms/pages/view/cfp|title=Call for Papers|website=www.hope.uzh.ch|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; stressing the role of Digital Fashion Communication.

Fashion is closely related with Art and Heritage: among the most important initiatives to digitize fashion history, thus making such heritage available to researchers, practitioners and all interested people, two projects can be mentioned: Europeana Fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion|title=Europeana Fashion|website=www.europeana.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and We Wear Culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/project/fashion|title=We Wear Culture - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Google Arts and Culture.

{{for|back-and-forth disagreements in wiki editing|edit war}}
An '''edit conflict''' is a computer problem that may occur when multiple editors edit the same [[File (computer science)|file]] during a short time period. The problem is encountered on [[wiki]]s, distributed data systems, and [[revision control]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Antonovich (2010).
   [https://books.google.com/books?id=rSygoG-FhcAC&amp;pg=PA321 &lt;!--
   --&gt;''Office and SharePoint 2010 User's Guide: Integrating SharePoint''].
   p. 321 (752 pages), quote: "Edit conflict on a list linked to SharePoint".
&lt;/ref&gt; To save the file while minimizing edits, the conflict must be resolved.

== Description ==
An edit conflict is a computer problem that may occur when multiple editors edit the same [[File (computer science)|file]] during a short time period. The conflict occurs when an editor gets a copy of a shared document file, changes the copy, and attempts to save the changes to the original file, which has been altered another editor after the copy was obtained. To save the original file, the edit conflict must be resolved.

== Resolution ==
The simplest way to resolve an edit conflict is to ignore intervening edits and overwrite the current file. This may lead to a substantial loss of information, and alternative methods are often employed to resolve or prevent conflicts.
* Manual resolution, where the editor determines which version to retain and may manually incorporate edits into the current version of the file.
* Store [[Backup|backups]] or [[File comparison|file comparisons]] of each edit, so there are backups changes of the file once the original is overwritten
* [[File locking]], which limits the file to one editor at a time to prevent edit conflicts. Computer writer Gary B. Shelly notes that many [[wiki]] systems "will block the contributor who is attempting to edit the page from being able to do so until the contributor currently editing the page saves changes or remains idle on the page for an extended period of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYSP0ll6ftcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Edit+conflict%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZQ_QTfvBJYKcsQOE0Yz9DA|title=Web 2.0: Concepts and Applications|last=Shelly|first=Gary B.|author2=Frydenberg, Mark|date=2010|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1-4390-4802-3|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Merge (version control)|Merge]], by determining if the edits in unrelated parts of the file and combining without user intervention.

{{for|the physiological term|Compliance (physiology)}}
'''Electrical elastance''' is the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of [[capacitance]].  The [[SI]] unit of elastance is the inverse [[farad]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The concept is not widely used by electrical and electronic engineers.  The value of [[capacitor]]s is invariably specified in units of capacitance rather than inverse capacitance.  However, it is used in theoretical work in network analysis and has some niche applications at [[microwave]] frequencies.

The term ''elastance'' was coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] through the analogy of a capacitor as a spring. The term is also used for analogous quantities in some other energy domains.  It maps to [[stiffness]] in the mechanical domain, and is the inverse of [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] in the fluid flow domain, especially in [[physiology]].  It is also the name of the generalised quantity in [[bond-graph]] analysis and other schemes analysing systems across multiple domains.

==Usage==
The definition of capacitance (''C'') is the charge (''Q'') stored per unit voltage (''V'').

:&lt;math&gt; C = {Q \over V} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

Elastance (''S'') is the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of capacitance, thus,

:&lt;math&gt; S = {V \over Q} \ . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camara, p.16–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressing the values of [[capacitor]]s as elastance is not done much by practical electrical engineers, although it is sometimes convenient for capacitors in series.  The total elastance is simply the sum of the individual elastances in that case.  However, it is used by network theorists in their analysis.  One advantage is that an increase in elastance increases [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  This is in the same direction as the other two basic passive [[Electrical element|elements]], [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[inductance]].  An example of the use of elastance can be found in the 1926 doctoral thesis of [[Wilhelm Cauer]].  On his path to founding [[network synthesis]] he formed the [[mesh analysis|loop matrix]] '''A''',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}= s^2 \mathbf{L} + s \mathbf{R} + \mathbf{S} = s \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''L''', '''R''', '''S''' and '''Z''' are the network loop matrices of inductance, resistance, elastance and impedance respectively and ''s'' is [[complex frequency]].  This expression would be significantly more complicated if Cauer had tried to use a matrix of capacitances instead of elastances.  The use of elastance here is merely for mathematical convenience, in much the same way as mathematicians use [[radian]]s rather than the more common units for angles.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, Mathis &amp; Pauli, p.4&lt;br/&gt;The symbols in Cauer's expression have been modified for consistency within this article and with modern practice&lt;/ref&gt;

Elastance is also used in [[microwave engineering]].  In this field [[varactor diode]]s are used as a voltage variable capacitor in [[frequency multiplier]]s, [[parametric amplifier]]s and variable [[electronic filter|filters]].  These diodes store a charge in their [[p-n junction|junction]] when [[reverse bias]]ed which is the source of the capacitor effect.  The slope of the voltage-stored charge curve is called ''differential elastance'' in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Harrison &amp; Lippens, pp.29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
The [[SI]] unit of elastance is the reciprocal [[farad]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The term ''[[daraf]]'' is sometimes used for this unit, but it is not approved by SI and its use is discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Michell, p.168|Mills, p.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is formed by writing ''farad'' backwards, in much the same way as the unit ''[[mho]]'' (unit of conductance, also not approved by SI) is formed by writing ''[[ohm]]'' backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.466&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''daraf'' was coined by [[Arthur E. Kennelly]].  He used it from at least 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kennelly &amp; Kurokawa, p.41|Blake, p.29|Jerrard, p.33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The terms ''elastance'' and ''elastivity'' were coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  Heaviside coined a great many of the terms used in [[circuit analysis]] today, such as [[electrical impedance|impedance]], [[inductance]], [[admittance]], and [[electrical conductance|conductance]].  Heaviside's terminology followed the model of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[resistivity]] with the ''-ance'' ending used for [[extensive properties]] and the ''-ivity'' ending used for [[intensive properties]].  The extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they are the "values" of components) and the intensive properties are used in [[field (physics)|field analysis]].  Heaviside's nomenclature was designed to highlight the connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Yavetz, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;  Elastivity is the intensive property of a material corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance.  It is the reciprocal of [[permittivity]].  As Heaviside put it,
{{blockquote|Permittivity gives rise to permittance, and elastivity to elastance.&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;|Oliver Heaviside}}
Here, ''permittance'' is Heaviside's term for capacitance.  He did not like any term that suggested that a [[capacitor]] was a container for holding charge.  He rejected the terms ''capacity'' (capacitance) and ''capacious'' (capacitive) and their inverses ''incapacity'' and ''incapacious''.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms current in his time for a capacitor were ''condenser'' (suggesting that the "electric fluid" could be condensed out) and ''leyden''&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Leyden jar]], an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage.  Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring.&lt;ref&gt;Yavetz, pp.150–151&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference was a result of Heaviside following [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it.  In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the [[electromotive force]] and is the analogue of [[velocity]] caused by a mechanical [[force]].  At the capacitor, this current causes a "[[displacement current|displacement]]" whose rate of change is equal to the current.  The displacement is viewed as an electric [[deformation (mechanics)#Strain|strain]], like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring.  The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates.  This is replaced with the concept of [[divergence]] of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.&lt;ref&gt;Yavetz, pp.150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, some authors followed Heaviside in the use of ''elastance'' and ''elastivity''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Peek, p.215, writing in 1915&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the reciprocal quantities ''capacitance'' and ''permittivity'' are almost universally preferred by electrical engineers.  However, elastance does still see some usage by theoretical writers.  A further consideration in Heaviside's choice of these terms was a wish to distinguish them from mechanical terms.  Thus, he chose ''elastivity'' rather than ''[[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]''.  This avoids having to write ''electrical elasticity'' to disambiguate it from ''mechanical elasticity''.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside carefully chose his terms to be unique to [[electromagnetism]], most especially avoiding commonality with [[mechanics]].  Ironically, many of his terms have subsequently been borrowed back into mechanics and other domains in order to name analogous properties.  For instance, it is now necessary to distinguish ''[[electrical impedance]]'' from ''[[mechanical impedance]]'' in some contexts.&lt;ref&gt;van der Tweel &amp; Verburg, pp.16–20&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Elastance'' has also been borrowed back into mechanics for the analogous quantity by some authors, but often ''[[stiffness]]'' is the preferred term instead.  However, ''elastance'' is widely used for the analogous property in the domain of [[fluid dynamics]], especially in the fields of [[biomedicine]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;see for instance Enderle &amp; Bronzino, pp.197–201, especially equation 4.72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical analogy==
[[Mechanical-electrical analogies]] are formed by comparing the mathematical description of the two systems.  Quantities that appear in the same place in equations of the same form are called ''analogues''.  There are two main reasons for forming such analogies.  The first is to allow electrical phenomena to be explained in terms of the more familiar mechanical systems.  For instance, an electrical [[RLC circuit|inductor-capacitor-resistor circuit]] has [[differential equation]]s of the same form as a mechanical mass-spring-damper system.  In such cases the electrical domain is converted to the mechanical domain.  The second, and more important, reason is to allow a system containing both mechanical and electrical parts to be analysed as a unified whole.  This is of great benefit in the fields of [[mechatronics]] and [[robotics]].  In such cases the mechanical domain is most often converted to the electrical domain because [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]] in the electrical domain is highly developed.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp.17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Maxwellian analogy===
In the analogy developed by Maxwell, now known as the [[impedance analogy]], [[voltage]] is made analogous to [[force]].  The voltage of a source of electric power is still called [[electromotive force]] for this reason.  Current is analogous to [[velocity]].  The [[time derivative]] of distance (displacement) is equal to velocity and the time derivative of momentum is equal to force.  Quantities in other energy domains that are in this same differential relationship are called respectively ''generalised displacement'', ''generalised velocity'', ''generalised momentum'', and ''generalised force''.  In the electrical domain, it can be seen that the generalised displacement is charge, explaining the Maxwellians' use of the term ''displacement''.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Since elastance is the ratio of voltage over charge, then it follows that the analogue of elastance in another energy domain is the ratio of a generalised force over a generalised displacement.  Thus, an elastance can be defined in any energy domain.  ''Elastance'' is used as the name of the generalised quantity in the formal analysis of systems with multiple energy domains, such as is done with [[bond graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vieil, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other analogies===
Maxwell's analogy is not the only way that analogies can be constructed between mechanical and electrical systems.  There are any number of ways to do this.  One very common system is the [[mobility analogy]].  In this analogy force maps to current instead of voltage.  Electrical impedance no longer maps to mechanical impedance, and likewise, electrical elastance no longer maps to mechanical elastance.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistical mechanics]], '''entropy''' is an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Extensive properties|extensive property]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]. It is closely related to the number {{math|Ω}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]]s) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;S = k_{\mathrm{B}} \ln \Omega \text{ (assuming equiprobable microstates)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Macroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|Ω}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  Roughly twenty liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and atmospheric pressure]] has {{math|''N'' ≈ {{val|6|e=23}}}} ([[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]).  At equilibrium, each of the {{math|Ω ≈ ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely. 

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided  their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.

Because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].

Boltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]—either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822–1888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]
{{Main|History of entropy}}

The French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''. In other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever "[[caloric theory|caloric]]" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He made the analogy with that of how water falls in a [[water wheel]]. This was an early insight into the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/CarnotSadi.html|title=Carnot, Sadi (1796–1832)|accessdate=2010-02-24|publisher=Wolfram Research|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th century "Newtonian hypothesis" that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of [[Count Rumford]] who showed (1789) that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Richard, S.|title=Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Applications to the Steam-Engine, etc.|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state at the end of a complete [[engine cycle]], that "no change occurs in the condition of the working body".

The [[first law of thermodynamics]], deduced from the heat-friction experiments of [[James Joule]] in 1843, expresses the concept of energy, and its [[conservation of energy|conservation]] in all processes; the first law, however, is unable to quantify the effects of [[friction]] and [[dissipation]].

In the 1850s and 1860s, German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] objected to the supposition that no change occurs in the working body, and gave this "change" a mathematical interpretation by questioning the nature of the inherent loss of usable heat when work is done, e.g. heat produced by friction.&lt;ref name="Clausius"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clausius|first=Rudolf|title=On the Motive Power of Heat, and on the Laws which can be deduced from it for the Theory of Heat|publisher=Poggendorff's ''Annalen der Physick'', LXXIX (Dover Reprint)|year=1850|isbn=0-486-59065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clausius described entropy as the ''transformation-content'', i.e. dissipative [[energy]] use, of a [[thermodynamic system]] or [[working body]] of [[chemical species]] during a change of [[thermodynamic state|state]].&lt;ref name="Clausius" /&gt; This was in contrast to earlier views, based on the theories of [[Isaac Newton]], that heat was an indestructible particle that had mass.

Later, scientists such as [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] gave entropy a statistical basis. In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy to be proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in [[statistical thermodynamics]], i.e. according to [[Erwin Schrödinger]], has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy E over N identical systems.
[[Carathéodory]] linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.

== Definitions and descriptions ==
{{quote box|align=left|width=30em|quote=Any method involving the notion of entropy, the very existence of which depends on the second law of thermodynamics, will doubtless seem to many far-fetched, and may repel beginners as obscure and difficult of comprehension.|source=[[Willard Gibbs]], ''Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The scientific papers of J. Willard Gibbs in Two Volumes|url=https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers01gibbuoft#page/11/mode/1up|accessdate=2011-02-26|volume=1|year=1906|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are two related definitions of entropy: the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] definition and the [[statistical mechanics]] definition. Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the system is composed of very large numbers of constituents (atoms, molecules) and the state of the system is described by the average thermodynamic properties of those constituents; the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered, but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties, e.g. temperature, pressure, entropy, heat capacity. The early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium. The classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]]. Later, the thermodynamic properties, including entropy, were given an [[Statistical mechanics|alternative definition]] in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system — modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.). The statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics becomes an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state of a system that is subject to some process.

=== Function of state ===
There are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. McGovern,{{cite web|url=http://theory.phy.umist.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node29.html |title=2.5 Entropy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923080936/http://theory.phy.umist.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node29.html |archivedate=2012-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that entropy is a function of state is one reason it is useful. In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.

=== Reversible process ===
Entropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ``Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.  An irreversible process increases entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lower|first1=Stephen|title=What is entropy?|url=http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/thermeq/TE2.html|website=www.chem1.com|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnot cycle ===
The concept of entropy arose from [[Rudolf Clausius]]'s study of the [[Carnot cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavenda|first1=Bernard H.|title=A new perspective on thermodynamics|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1430-9|edition=Online-Ausg.|chapter=2.3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Carnot cycle, heat {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} is absorbed isothermally at temperature {{math|&lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}  from a 'hot' reservoir  and given up isothermally as heat {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} to a 'cold' reservoir at {{math|&lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}. According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}). Carnot did not distinguish between {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, since he was using the incorrect hypothesis that [[caloric theory]] was valid, and hence heat was conserved (the incorrect assumption that {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} were equal) when, in fact, {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} is greater than {{math|&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carnot|first1=Sadi Carnot|editor1-last=Fox|editor1-first=Robert|title=Reflexions on the motive power of fire|date=1986|publisher=Lilian Barber Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-936508-16-0|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Truesdell|first1=C.|title=The tragicomical history of thermodynamics 1822–1854|date=1980|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-90403-0|pages=78–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the efforts of Clausius and [[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin]], it is now known that the maximum work that a heat engine can produce is the product of the Carnot efficiency and the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;W=\left(\frac{T_H-T_C}{T_H}\right)Q_H = \left(1-\frac{T_C}{T_H} \right) Q_H&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

To derive the Carnot efficiency, which is {{math|1-(&lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;)}} (a number less than one), Kelvin had to evaluate the ratio of the work output to the heat absorbed during the isothermal expansion with the help of the Carnot-Clapeyron equation which contained an unknown function, known as the Carnot function. The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;W=Q_H-Q_C&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Since the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle. The state function was called the internal energy and it became the [[first law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Clausius1867"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rudolf Clausius|title=The Mechanical Theory of Heat: With Its Applications to the Steam-engine and to the Physical Properties of Bodies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LIEAAAAYAAJ|year=1867|publisher=J. Van Voorst|isbn=978-1-4981-6733-8|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now equating ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) gives

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_H}{T_H}-\frac{Q_C}{T_C}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_H}{T_H}=\frac{Q_C}{T_C} &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that there is a function of state which is conserved over a complete cycle of the Carnot cycle. Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of [[energy]] arose.

Clausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality

: &lt;math&gt; W&lt;\left(1-\frac{T_C}{T_H}\right)Q_H&lt;/math&gt;

When the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get

: &lt;math&gt; Q_H-Q_C&lt;\left(1-\frac{T_C}{T_H}\right)Q_H&lt;/math&gt;
: or
: &lt;math&gt; Q_C&gt;\frac{T_C}{T_H}Q_H&lt;/math&gt;

So more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}&lt;var&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy

:&lt;math&gt;S_H-S_C&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
: or
:&lt;math&gt;S_H&lt;S_C&lt;/math&gt;

The entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.

The Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.

=== Classical thermodynamics ===
{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}

The thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system. 

While Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.

According to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:
&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{\delta Q_\text{rev}}{T} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This means the line integral &lt;math&gt;\int_L \frac{\delta Q_\text{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt; is [[State function|path-independent]].

So we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies
&lt;math&gt;d S = \frac{\delta Q_\text{rev}}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clausius coined the name ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) for {{mvar|S}} in 1865. He gives "transformational content" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his "thermal and ergonal content" ({{lang|de|Wärme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of ''energy'', formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|ἔργον}} "work" by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:τροπή|τροπή]]}} "transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene für die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen Wärmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

Da ich es aber für besser halte, die Namen derartiger für die Wissenschaft wichtiger Gröſsen aus den alten Sprachen zu entnehmen, damit sie unverändert in allen neuen Sprachen angewandt werden können, so schlage ich vor, die Gröſse ''S'' nach dem griechischen Worte ἡ τροπὴ, die Verwandlung, die ''Entropie'' des Körpers zu nennen.  Das Wort ''Entropie'' habei ich absichtlich dem Worte ''Energie'' möglichst ähnlich gebildet, denn die beiden Gröſsen, welche durch diese Worte benannt werden sollen, sind ihren physikalischen Bedeutungen nach einander so nahe verwandt, daſs eine gewisse Gleichartigkeit in der Benennung mir zweckmäſsig zu seyn scheint." (p. 390).&lt;/ref&gt; 

To find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=0-19-870072-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=0-8053-3842-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the entropy change of the surroundings will be different.

We can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.

From a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy Δ''E'', and its entropy falls by Δ''S'', a quantity at least ''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; Δ''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].

=== Statistical mechanics ===
The statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant number which has since been known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.

The [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of "disorder" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).&lt;ref name=McH&gt;{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethna78" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Specifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:

:&lt;math&gt;S = -k_{\mathrm{B}}\sum_i p_i \log p_i,&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate will be occupied

:&lt;math&gt;S = -k_{\mathrm{B}} \operatorname{E}_i(\log p_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.
The summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.&lt;ref name="Perplexed"&gt;[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. "Entropy – A Guide for the Perplexed"]. In Probabilities in Physics; Beisbart C. and Hartmann, S.
Eds; Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This definition assumes that the basis set of states has been picked so that there is no information on their relative phases. In a different basis set, the more general expression is

:&lt;math&gt;S = -k_{\mathrm{B}} \operatorname{Tr}(\widehat{\rho} \log(\widehat{\rho})),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density matrix]], &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}&lt;/math&gt; is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.

In what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/Ω, where Ω is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the previous equation reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;S = k_{\mathrm{B}} \log \Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

In thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).

The most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.

The interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier "for a given set of macroscopic variables" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E. T., "The Gibbs Paradox," In Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods; Smith, C. R; Erickson, G. J; Neudorfer, P. O., Eds; Kluwer Academic: Dordrecht, 1992, pp. 1–22 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entropy can be defined for any [[Markov process]]es with [[reversible dynamics]] and the [[detailed balance]] property.

In Boltzmann's 1896 ''Lectures on Gas Theory'', he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics.

=== Entropy of a system ===

The vertical axis represents uniform temperature, and the horizontal axis represents specific entropy. Each dark line on the graph represents constant pressure, and these form a mesh with light gray lines of constant volume. (Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]

Entropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.

In a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.

As an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.

However, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the "universe" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.

Thermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="McH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley91"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.&lt;ref name="McQuarrie817"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

Unlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the [[standard molar entropy]] from [[absolute zero]] (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the [[dimension (physics)|dimension]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the [[International System of Units]]. While these are the same units as [[heat capacity]], the two concepts are distinct.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. McGovern,{{cite web|url=http://theory.phy.umist.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node50.html |title=Heat Capacities |accessdate=2013-01-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819175243/http://theory.phy.umist.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node50.html |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.

One dictionary definition of entropy is that it is "a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.

A special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work – the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.  At a statistical mechanical level, this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Naim|first1=Arieh|title=On the So-Called Gibbs Paradox, and on the Real Paradox|journal=Entropy|date=21 September 2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=132–136|doi=10.3390/e9030133|url=http://www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e9030132.pdf|bibcode=2007Entrp...9..132B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second law of thermodynamics ==
{{Main|Second law of thermodynamics}}
{{See also|Thermodynamic Equilibrium| Non-equilibrium thermodynamics}} 
The second law of thermodynamics requires that, in general, the total entropy of any system can't decrease other than by increasing the entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.

It follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.

In mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].&lt;ref name="Daintith"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-19-280628-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''δq''
in a reversible way, is given by ''δq''/''T''. More explicitly, an energy {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''}} is not available to do useful work, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the coldest accessible reservoir or heat sink external to the system. For further discussion, see ''[[Exergy]]''.

Statistical mechanics demonstrates that entropy is governed by probability, thus allowing for a decrease in disorder even in an isolated system. Although this is possible, such an event has a small probability of occurring, making it unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Entropy production theorems and some consequences|pages=1–10 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=80 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.80.011117 |year=2009 |last1=Saha |first1=Arnab |last2=Lahiri |first2=Sourabh |last3=Jayannavar |first3=A.

== Applications ==

=== The fundamental thermodynamic relation ===
{{Main|Fundamental thermodynamic relation}}
The entropy of a system depends on its internal energy and its external parameters, such as its volume. In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''P'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:

: &lt;math&gt;dU = T \, dS - p \, dV&lt;/math&gt;

Since both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).

The fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].

=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===
Thermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] – the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings – increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of δ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;/''T'' = Δ''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, Δ''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems – always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.

The thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).

Thermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: {{gaps|J|kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;|K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of {{gaps|J|mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;|K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Thus, when one mole of substance at about {{gaps|0|K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{gaps|298|K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{gaps|298|K}}.&lt;ref name="ctms"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Entropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions. For such applications, Δ''S'' must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings, Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;universe&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;surroundings&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''S'' &lt;sub&gt;system&lt;/sub&gt;. This expression becomes, via some steps, the [[Gibbs free energy]] equation for reactants and products in the system: Δ''G'' [the Gibbs free energy change of the system] = Δ''H'' [the enthalpy change] −''T'' Δ''S'' [the entropy change].&lt;ref name="ctms" /&gt;

=== Entropy balance equation for open systems ===
[[File:First law open system.svg|thumb|300px|During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] continuous operation, an entropy balance applied to an open system accounts for system entropy changes related to heat flow and mass flow across the system boundary.]]
In [[chemical engineering]], the principles of thermodynamics are commonly applied to "[[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]]", i.e. those in which heat, [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], and [[mass]] flow across the system boundary. Flows of both heat (&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}&lt;/math&gt;) and work, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\dot{W}_S&lt;/math&gt; ([[Work (thermodynamics)|shaft work]]) and ''P''(''dV''/''dt'') (pressure-volume work), across the system boundaries, in general cause changes in the entropy of the system. Transfer as heat entails entropy transfer &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}/T,&lt;/math&gt; where ''T'' is the absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]] of the system at the point of the heat flow. If there are mass flows across the system boundaries, they also influence the total entropy of the system. This account, in terms of heat and work, is valid only for cases in which the work and heat transfers are by paths physically distinct from the paths of entry and exit of matter from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Late Nobel Laureate Max Born|title=Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=er85jgEACAAJ|date=8 August 2015|publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=978-1-298-49740-6|pages=44, 146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haase|first1=R.|title=Thermodynamics|date=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-245601-7|pages=1–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To derive a generalized entropy balanced equation, we start with the general balance equation for the change in any [[extensive quantity]] Θ in a [[thermodynamic system]], a quantity that may be either conserved, such as energy, or non-conserved, such as entropy. The basic generic balance expression states that dΘ/dt, i.e. the rate of change of Θ in the system, equals the rate at which Θ enters the system at the boundaries, minus the rate at which Θ leaves the system across the system boundaries, plus the rate at which Θ is generated within the system. For an open thermodynamic system in which heat and work are transferred by paths separate from the paths for transfer of matter, using this generic balance equation, with respect to the rate of change with time ''t'' of the extensive quantity entropy ''S'', the entropy balance equation is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sandler|first=Stanley, I.|title=Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1989|isbn=0-471-83050-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name=overdot&gt;The overdots represent derivatives of the quantities with respect to time.&lt;/ref&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^K  \dot{M}_k  \hat{S}_k = {} &lt;/math&gt; the net rate of entropy flow due to the flows of mass into and out of the system (where &lt;math&gt;\hat{S} = {}&lt;/math&gt; entropy per unit mass).

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{S}_\text{gen} = {} &lt;/math&gt; the rate of [[entropy production]] within the system. This entropy production arises from processes within the system, including chemical reactions, internal matter diffusion, internal heat transfer, and frictional effects such as viscosity occurring within the system from mechanical work transfer to or from the system.

Note, also, that if there are multiple heat flows, the term &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}/T&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\sum \dot{Q}_j/T_j,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}_j&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flow and &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at the ''j''th heat flow port into the system.

== Entropy change formulas for simple processes ==
For certain simple transformations in systems of constant composition, the entropy changes are given by simple formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/ideal_gases_under_constant.htm |title=GRC.nasa.gov |publisher=GRC.nasa.gov |date=2000-03-27 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isothermal expansion or compression of an ideal gas ===
For the expansion (or compression) of an [[ideal gas]] from an initial volume &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; and pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; to a final volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; at any constant temperature, the change in entropy is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = n R \ln \frac{V}{V_0} = - n R \ln \frac{P}{P_0} .&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of gas and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ideal gas constant]]. These equations also apply for expansion into a finite vacuum or a [[throttling process (thermodynamics)|throttling process]], where the temperature, internal energy and enthalpy for an ideal gas remain constant.

=== Cooling and heating ===
For heating or cooling of any system (gas, liquid or solid) at constant pressure from an initial temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; to a final temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the entropy change is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = n C_P \ln \frac{T}{T_0}.&lt;/math&gt;
provided that the constant-pressure molar [[heat capacity]] (or specific heat) C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; is constant and that no [[phase transition]] occurs in this temperature interval.

Similarly at constant volume, the entropy change is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = n C_v \ln \frac{T}{T_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where the constant-volume heat capacity C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is constant and there is no phase change.

At low temperatures near absolute zero, heat capacities of solids quickly drop off to near zero, so the assumption of constant heat capacity does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Franzen|first1=Stefan|title=Third Law.|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~franzen/public_html/CH433/lecture/Third_Law.pdf|publisher=ncsu.ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since entropy is a [[Functions of state|state function]], the entropy change of any process in which temperature and volume both vary is the same as for a path divided into two steps – heating at constant volume and expansion at constant temperature. For an ideal gas, the total entropy change is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/entropy.html |title=GRC.nasa.gov |publisher=GRC.nasa.gov |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = nC_v \ln \frac{T}{T_0} + nR \ln \frac{V}{V_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly if the temperature and pressure of an ideal gas both vary,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = nC_P \ln \frac{T}{T_0} - nR \ln \frac{P}{P_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Phase transitions ===
Reversible [[phase transition]]s occur at constant temperature and pressure. The reversible heat is the enthalpy change for the transition, and the entropy change is the enthalpy change divided by the thermodynamic temperature. For fusion ([[melting]]) of a solid to a liquid at the melting point ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[entropy of fusion]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{fus} = \frac{\Delta H_\text{fus}}{T_\text{m}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, for [[vaporization]] of a liquid to a gas at the boiling point ''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[entropy of vaporization]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{vap} = \frac{\Delta H_\text{vap}}{T_\text{b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Approaches to understanding entropy ==
As a fundamental aspect of thermodynamics and physics, several different approaches to entropy beyond that of Clausius and Boltzmann are valid.

=== Standard textbook definitions ===
The following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:
* a measure of [[energy dispersal]] at a specific temperature.
* a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gribbin|first1=John|editor1-last=Gribbin|editor1-first=Mary|title=Q is for quantum : an encyclopedia of particle physics|date=1999|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-684-85578-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a measure of a system's [[thermal energy]] per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful [[work (thermodynamics)|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entropy: Definition and Equation|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189035/entropy|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Consistent with the Boltzmann definition, the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time, though the underlying principle remains the same.

=== Order and disorder ===
{{Main|Entropy (order and disorder)}}
Entropy has often been loosely associated with the amount of [[wikt:order|order]] or [[Randomness|disorder]], or of [[Chaos theory|chaos]], in a [[thermodynamic system]]. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of "molecular disorder" and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another. In this direction, several recent authors have derived exact entropy formulas to account for and measure disorder and order in atomic and molecular assemblies.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Daniel R.|last2=Wiley|first2=E. O.|title=Evolution as entropy : toward a unified theory of biology|date=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [etc.]|isbn=0-226-07574-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landsberg-A"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landsberg | first1 = P.T. | year = 1984 | title = Is Equilibrium always an Entropy Maximum? | url = | journal = J.

He argues that when constraints operate on a system, such that it is prevented from entering one or more of its possible or permitted states, as contrasted with its forbidden states, the measure of the total amount of "disorder" in the system is given by:&lt;ref name="Landsberg-A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landsberg-B" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Disorder}={C_D\over C_I}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the total amount of "order" in the system is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Order}=1-{C_O\over C_I}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

In which ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the "disorder" capacity of the system, which is the entropy of the parts contained in the permitted ensemble, ''C&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the "information" capacity of the system, an expression similar to Shannon's [[channel capacity]], and ''C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the "order" capacity of the system.&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt;

=== Energy dispersal ===
{{Main|Entropy (energy dispersal)}}

The concept of entropy can be described qualitatively as a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert |first1=Frank L. |title=A Student's Approach to the Second Law and Entropy |url=http://entropysite.oxy.edu/students_approach.html |website=entropysite.oxy.edu |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717175331/http://entropysite.oxy.edu/students_approach.html |archivedate=17 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terms have been in use from early in the history of [[classical thermodynamics]], and with the development of [[statistical thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or "spreading" of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantized energy levels.

Ambiguities in the terms ''disorder'' and ''chaos'', which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium, contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=J.R.|last2=Carson|first2=E.M.|title=Undergraduate students’ understandings of entropy and Gibbs free energy.|journal=University Chemistry Education|date=May 2002|volume=6|issue=1|page=4|url=http://www.rsc.org/images/Vol_6_No1_tcm18-7042.pdf|issn=1369-5614}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[second law of thermodynamics]] shows, in an [[isolated system]] internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium. A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the [[first law of thermodynamics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=Frank L.|title=Disorder – A Cracked Crutch for Supporting Entropy Discussions|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=February 2002|volume=79|issue=2|pages=187|doi=10.1021/ed079p187|bibcode=2002JChEd..79..187L}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare discussion in next section). Physical chemist [[Peter Atkins]], for example, who previously wrote of dispersal leading to a disordered state, now writes that "spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|title=The Second Law|publisher=Scientific American Library|year=1984|isbn=0-7167-5004-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relating entropy to energy ''usefulness'' ===
Following on from the above, it is possible (in a thermal context) to regard entropy as an indicator or measure of the ''effectiveness'' or ''usefulness'' of a particular quantity of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Book Review of "A Science Miscellany"|journal=Khaleej Times|publisher=Galadari Press, UAE|date=23 February 1993|page=XI|author=Sandra Saary (Head of Science, Latifa Girls’ School, Dubai)|url=http://dlmcn.com/entropy2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because energy supplied at a high temperature (i.e. with low entropy) tends to be more useful than the same amount of energy available at room temperature. Mixing a hot parcel of a fluid with a cold one produces a parcel of intermediate temperature, in which the overall increase in entropy represents a "loss" which can never be replaced.

Thus, the fact that the entropy of the universe is steadily increasing, means that its total energy is becoming less useful: eventually, this will lead to the "[[heat death of the Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lathia|first=R|last2=Agrawal|first2=T|last3=Parmar|first3=V|last4=Dobariya|first4=K|last5=Patel|first5=A|date=2015-10-20|title=Heat Death (The Ultimate Fate of the Universe)|url=http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.4158.2485|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4158.2485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entropy and adiabatic accessibility ===
A definition of entropy based entirely on the relation of [[adiabatic accessibility]] between equilibrium states was given by  [[Elliott H. Lieb|E.H.Lieb]] and [[Jakob Yngvason|J. Yngvason]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieb|first1=Elliott H.|last2=Yngvason|first2=Jakob|title=The physics and mathematics of the second law of thermodynamics|journal=Physics Reports|date=March 1999|volume=310|issue=1|pages=1–96|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(98)00082-9|arxiv=cond-mat/9708200|bibcode=1999PhR...310....1L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of [[Constantin Carathéodory]] from 1909&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carathéodory|first1=C.|title=Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|journal=Mathematische Annalen|date=September 1909|volume=67|issue=3|pages=355–386|doi=10.1007/BF01450409|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the monograph by R. Giles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Giles|title=Mathematical Foundations of Thermodynamics: International Series of Monographs on Pure and Applied Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oK03BQAAQBAJ|date=22 January 2016|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4831-8491-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the setting of Lieb and Yngvason one starts by picking, for a unit amount of the substance under consideration, two reference states  &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa. Defining the  entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the largest number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in the state &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and a complementary amount, &lt;math&gt;(1-\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, in the state &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;. A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.

=== Entropy in quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|von Neumann entropy}}

In [[quantum statistical mechanics]], the concept of entropy was developed by [[John von Neumann]] and is generally referred to as "[[von Neumann entropy]]",

: &lt;math&gt;S = - k_\mathrm{B}\operatorname{Tr} ( \rho \log \rho ) \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the [[density matrix]] and Tr is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] operator.

This upholds the [[correspondence principle]], because in the [[classical limit]], when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy,

: &lt;math&gt;S = - k_\mathrm{B}\sum_i p_i \, \log \, p_i,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.

Von Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik''. He provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of [[wave function collapse]] is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). Using this concept, in conjunction with the [[density matrix]] he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.

=== Information theory ===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=I thought of calling it "information", but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it "uncertainty". [...] Von Neumann told me, "You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, nobody knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage."|source=Conversation between [[Claude Shannon]] and [[John von Neumann]] regarding what name to give to the [[attenuation]] in phone-line signals&lt;ref&gt;M. Tribus, E.C. McIrvine, Energy and information, Scientific American, 224 (September 1971), pp. 178–184&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Main|Entropy (information theory)|Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory|Entropic uncertainty}}

When viewed in terms of information theory, the entropy state function is simply the amount of information (in the Shannon sense) that would be needed to specify the full microstate of the system. This is left unspecified by the macroscopic description.

In [[information theory]], ''entropy'' is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as ''Shannon entropy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger |last=Balian |chapter=Entropy, a Protean concept|editor-last=Dalibard|editor-first=Jean|title=Poincaré Seminar 2003: Bose-Einstein condensation – entropy|year=2004|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-7116-6|pages=119–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics|thermodynamics]]. It was originally devised by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i) \log p(x_i).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.&lt;ref name="Perplexed" /&gt;

The question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic. While most authors argue that there is a link between the two,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brillouin|first=Leon|title=Science and Information Theory|year=1956|isbn=0-486-43918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgescu-Roegen 1971"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Georgescu-Roegen|first=Nicholas|title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1971|isbn=0-674-25781-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chen|first=Jing|title=The Physical Foundation of Economics – an Analytical Thermodynamic Theory|publisher=World Scientific|year=2005|isbn=981-256-323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalinin | first1 = M.I. | last2 = Kononogov | first2 = S.A. | year = 2005 | title = Boltzmann's constant | url = | journal = Measurement Techniques | volume = 48 | issue = 7| pages = 632–636 | doi=10.1007/s11018-005-0195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ben-Naim|first1=Arieh|title=Entropy demystified the second law reduced to plain common sense|date=2008|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=9789812832269|edition=Expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few argue that they have nothing to do with each other.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
The expressions for the two entropies are similar. If ''W'' is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate, and each microstate has the same ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' probability, then that probability is {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 1/''W''}}. The Shannon entropy (in [[Nat (unit)|nats]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;H = -\sum_{i=1}^W p \log (p)= \log (W)&lt;/math&gt;

and if entropy is measured in units of ''k'' per nat, then the entropy is given&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/node1.html|title=Edwin T. Jaynes – Bibliography|publisher=Bayes.wustl.edu|date=1998-03-02|accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;H = k \log (W)&lt;/math&gt;

which is the famous [[Boltzmann's entropy formula|Boltzmann entropy formula]] when ''k'' is Boltzmann's constant, which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat. There are many ways of demonstrating the equivalence of "information entropy" and "physics entropy", that is, the equivalence of "Shannon entropy" and "Boltzmann entropy". Nevertheless, some authors argue for dropping the word entropy for the ''H'' function of information theory and using Shannon's other term "uncertainty" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Tom, DELILA system (Deoxyribonucleic acid Library Language), (Information Theory Analysis of binding sites), Laboratory of Mathematical Biology, National Cancer Institute, FCRDC Bldg. 469.

===Experimental measurement of entropy===
Entropy of a substance can be measured, although in an indirect way. The measurement uses the ''definition of temperature''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=88|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of entropy, while limiting energy exchange to heat (&lt;math&gt;dU \rightarrow dQ&lt;/math&gt;).

: &lt;math&gt;T := \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V,N} \Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow \; dS=dQ/T&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting relation describes how entropy changes &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; when a small amount of energy &lt;math&gt;dQ&lt;/math&gt; is introduced into the system at a certain temperature&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

The process of measurement goes as follows. First, a sample of the substance is cooled as close to absolute zero as possible. At such temperatures, the entropy approaches zero—due to the definition of temperature. Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25°C). The obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature. This value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Entropy|url=https://www.chem.wisc.edu/deptfiles/genchem/netorial/modules/thermodynamics/entropy/entropy04.htm|website=www.chem.wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arrow of time ===
{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}
Entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]]. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.

=== Cosmology ===
{{Main|Heat death of the universe}}

Since a finite universe is an isolated system, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that its total entropy is continually increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in which all the [[energy]] ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.

If the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then – as [[Roger Penrose]] has pointed out – [[gravity]] plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into [[black hole]]s. [[Black hole entropy|The entropy of a black hole]] is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's [[event horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=von Baeyer|first=Christian, H.|title=Information–the New Language of Science|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-674-01387-5}}{{Cite journal|author=Srednicki M|title=Entropy and area|journal=Phys.

This makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} However, the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity (see [[Hawking radiation]]).

The role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject since the time of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. Recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general. Although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe, the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly, moving the universe further from the heat death with time, not closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Layzer|first=David|title=Growth of Order in the Universe|publisher=MIT Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chaisson|first=Eric J.|title=Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-674-00342-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last1=Lineweaver|editor-first1=Charles H.|editor-last2=Davies|editor-first2=Paul C.

A '''feud''' {{IPAc-en|f|juː|d}}, referred to in more extreme cases as a '''blood feud''', '''vendetta''', '''faida''', '''beef''', '''clan war''', '''gang war''', or '''private war''', is a long-running argument or fight, often between [[social group]]s of people, especially [[family|families]] or [[clan]]s. Feuds begin because one party (correctly or incorrectly) perceives itself to have been attacked, insulted or wronged by another. Intense feelings of [[resentment]] trigger the initial [[Retributive justice|retribution]], which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and [[revenge|vengeful]]. The dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory [[violence]]. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members or associates, can last for [[generation]]s, and may result in extreme acts of [[violence]]. They can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in [[family honor]].

Until the [[early modern period]], feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manaraefan.co.uk/index_files/Page3400.htm |title=Revenue, Lordship, Kinship &amp; Law |publisher=Manaraefan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were regulated to some degree. For example, [[Serbs|Serb]] culture calls this ''krvna osveta'', meaning "blood revenge", which had unspoken{{dubious|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- if people didn't talk about the rules of ''krvna osveta'', how did they know about them? --&gt; but highly valued rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=Christopher|title=Blood Revenge: The Anthropology of Feuding in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies|year=1984|publisher=The University of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas|isbn=0-7006-0245-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tribal societies, the blood feud, coupled with the practice of [[blood money (term)|blood wealth]], functioned as an effective form of social control for limiting and ending conflicts between individuals and groups who are related by [[kinship]], as described by anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]] in his article "The Peace in the Feud"&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman, Max. "The Peace in the Feud". ''Past and Present'', 1955, 8(1):1-14&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955.

== Blood feuds ==
{{Redirect|Blood feud||Blood Feud (disambiguation)}}
A '''blood feud''' is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or [[honor|dishonored]] seeking vengeance by killing or otherwise physically punishing the culprits or their relatives. In the [[English-speaking world]], the Italian word '''''vendetta''''' is used to mean a blood feud, but in reality it means (personal) "vengeance" or "revenge", originating from the [[Latin]] ''vindicta'' ([[wikt:vengeance|vengeance]]), while the word ''[[:wiktionary:faida|faida]]'' would be more appropriate for a blood feud. In the English-speaking world, "vendetta" is sometimes extended to mean any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. Sometimes, it is not mutual, but rather refers to a prolonged series of hostile acts waged by one person against another without reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vendetta |title=Definition of vendetta |work=Merriam-Webster dictionary online|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Blood feuds were common in societies with a weak rule of law (or where the state does not consider itself responsible for mediating this kind of dispute), where family and kinship ties are the main source of [[authority]]. An entire family is considered responsible for the actions of any of its members. Sometimes two separate branches of the same family have even come to blows, or worse, over some dispute.

[[File:1673 Heintz Wettstreit auf der Ponte dei Pugni in Venedig anagoria.JPG|thumb|Ponte dei Pugni ("Bridge of Fists") in [[Venice]] was used by rival clans to stage fist fights]]
The practice has mostly disappeared with more centralized societies where [[law enforcement]] and [[criminal law]] take responsibility for punishing lawbreakers.

In [[Homeric]] [[ancient Greece]], the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: "Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vengeance... Feud is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of revenges; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John Gwyn |last=Griffiths |title=The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions |year=1991 |page=90 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-09231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ancient Israel|ancient Hebraic]] context, it was considered the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil on behalf of God. The executor of the law of blood-revenge who personally put the initial killer to death was given a special designation: ''[[go'el haddam]]'', the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer ([[Book of Numbers]] 35: 19, etc.). Six [[Cities of Refuge]] were established to provide protection and [[due process]] for any unintentional manslayers. The avenger was forbidden from harming the unintentional killer if the killer took refuge in one of these cities. As the ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' states: "Since life was viewed as sacred ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9.6), no amount of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be [[lex talionis|'life for life']] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21.23; [[Deuteronomy]] 19.21)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |first1=Bruce M. |last1=Metzger |first2=Michael D. |last2=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=68 |isbn=0-19-504645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Marc Bloch]]:
{{bquote|
The [[Middle Ages]], from beginning to end, and particularly the [[feudal]] era, lived under the sign of private [[revenge|vengeance]]. The [[Blame|onus]], of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the ''faide'' (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe — 'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call ''faida''', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a [[chieftain]], took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Bloch]], trans. L. A. Manyon, ''Feudal Society'', Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:hoher atlas dadestal.jpg|thumb|A [[kasbah]] in the Dades valley, [[High Atlas]]. Historically, tribal feuding and banditry were a way of life for the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of Morocco.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} As a result, hundreds of ancient kasbahs were built.]]
[[Rita of Cascia]], a popular 15th-century Italian saint, was canonized by the [[Catholic Church]] due mainly to her great effort to end a feud in which her family was involved and which claimed the life of her husband.

The blood feud has certain similarities to the ritualized warfare found in many [[pre-industrial]] tribes. Thus, for instance, more than a third of [[Ya̧nomamö]] males, on average, died from [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the [[enslavement]] of neighboring tribes such as the [[Marueta people|Macu]] before the arrival of European settlers and government.&lt;ref name="Keeley"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. ''[[War Before Civilization|War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage]]'' Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan's feudal past, the [[samurai]] class upheld the honor of their family, clan, and their lord by ''katakiuchi'' ({{lang|ja|敵討ち}}), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the [[Forty-seven Ronin]], others were given official permission with specific targets.

At the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Diet of Worms (1495)|''Reichstag'' at Worms in 1495 AD]], the right of waging feuds was abolished. The [[Imperial Reform]] proclaimed an "eternal [[public peace]]" (''[[Ewiger Landfriede]]'') to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s, and it defined a new [[standing army|standing imperial army]] to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted.&lt;!-- non-reliable source &lt;ref&gt;{{NNDB|id=399/000096111|name=Maximilian I|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed a family rival in [[Prague]], and the town councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed.

In Greece, the custom of blood feud is found in several parts of the country, for instance in [[Crete]] and [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]. Throughout history, the [[Maniots]] have been regarded by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice [[Maniots#Vendettas|blood feuds]], known in the Maniot dialect of Greek as "Γδικιωμός" (Gdikiomos). Many vendettas went on for months, some for years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and, when they got the chance, would murder members of the opposing family. The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} it has led to entire family lines being wiped out. The last vendetta on record required the [[Greek Army]] with [[artillery]] support to force it to a stop. Regardless of this, the Maniot Greeks still practice vendettas even today. Maniots in America, Australia, Canada and [[Corsica]] still have on-going vendettas which have led to the creation of [[Mafia]] families known as "Γδικιωμέοι" (Gdikiomeoi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta |publisher=Mani.org.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

In [[Corsica]], vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorovius, Ferdinand. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=udhEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Wanderings in Corsica: Its History and Its Heroes]''. (1855). p.&amp;nbsp;196. Retrieved 2015-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] was ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In [[Navarre]], these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In [[Biscay]], the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (''Cf.'' the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures ("towers") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, and sometimes by royal decree.

Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the [[Caucasus]], wrote in the mid-19th century: "Among the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|mountain people]] the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion." In the [[Dagestan]]i ''[[aul]]'' of Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/chechen-society-and-mentality |title=Chechen society and mentality |author=Souleimanov, Emil Aslan |work=Prague Watchdog |date=2003-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ushguli1.JPG|thumb|The defensive towers built by feuding clans of [[Svaneti]], in the [[Caucasus]] mountains]]

The [[Celts|Celtic]] phenomenon of the ''blood feud'' demanded "an eye for an eye," and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between [[clan]]s might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland.

Due to the Celtic heritage of many people living in [[Appalachia]], a series of prolonged violent engagements in late nineteenth-century [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]], both of whom had written [[historical fiction|semihistorical]] accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]], were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the [[Reconstruction Era]] and the early twentieth century, and are seen by some as linked to a [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|Southern culture of honor]] with its roots in the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] forebears of the residents of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' (2008), Chapter 6, citing, for example, [[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent example is the [[Regulator–Moderator War]], which took place between rival factions in the [[Republic of Texas]]. It is sometimes considered the largest blood feud in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/AllThingsHistorical/The-Worst-Feud-BB1006.htm |title=The Worst Feud |publisher=TexasEscapes.com |author=Bowman, Bob|date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to feud was ''[[blood money (term)|blood money]]'' (or ''[[weregild]]'' in the [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death, even an accidental one. If these payments were not made, or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.

===Feuds in modern times===
Blood feuds are still practised in some areas in:
* France (especially [[Corsica]] and within [[Sinti|Manush]] communities)
* Ireland (especially [[Dublin]] and [[Limerick]])
* In Northern Ireland between [[Republican movement (Ireland)|Irish republican]] and [[Loyalist|Ulster loyalism]] communities; particularly during [[The Troubles]]
* [[Southern Italy]] (especially [[Sicily]],  [[Campania]], [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]] and other areas of the same territory)&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html Police search Calabrian village as murders are linked to clan feud]", ''The Independent'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226231852/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood feuds also have a long history within the White [[Southern United States|Southern]] population of the U.S., where it is called the "[[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]]", and still exist to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://untpress.unt.edu/catalog/3376|author=Parsons, Chuck|title=The Sutton-Taylor Feud: The Deadliest Blood Feud in Texas|publisher=University of North Texas Press|year=2013|pages=400|accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Albania====
{{main|Gjakmarrja}}
In [[Albania]], ''[[gjakmarrja]]'' (blood feuding) is a tradition. They have returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by [[Enver Hoxha]], and more than 3000 Albanian families are currently engaged in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There are now more than 1,600 families who live under an ever-present death sentence because of them, and since 1992, at least 10,000 [[Albanians]] have been killed in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0625/p01s02-woeu.html |title=Peacemaker breaks the ancient grip of Albania's blood feuds |work=The Christian Science Monitor |author=White, Jeffrey|publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood feuds in Albania trace back to the Kanun, this custom is also practiced among the Albanians of Kosovo

A feud may develop into a vicious circle of further [[murder|killings]], retaliation, [[counterattack]]s, and all-out [[war]]fare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====Kosovo====
Blood feuds have also been part of a centuries-old tradition in [[Kosovo]], tracing back to the [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]], a 15th-century codification of Albanian customary rules. In the early 1990s, most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017"/&gt;

====Republic of Ireland====
Criminal gang feuds also exist in [[Dublin]], Ireland and in the Republic's third-largest city, [[Limerick]]. [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] feuds are also common in towns across the country. Feuds can be due to personal issues, money, or disrespect, and grudges can last generations. Since 2001, over 300 people have been killed in feuds between different drugs gangs, [[dissident republican]]s, and [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-suspect-dublin-drug-feud-link-in-double-killing-1.477711 |title=Gardaí suspect Dublin drug feud link in double killing |author=Lally, Conor |work=The Irish Times |publisher=IrishTimes.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

====Philippines====
Family and clan feuds, known locally as ''[[rido]]'', are characterized by sporadic outbursts of retaliatory violence between families and kinship groups, as well as between communities. It can occur in areas where the government or a central authority is weak, as well as in areas where there is a perceived lack of justice and security. ''Rido'' is a [[Maranao language|Maranao]] term commonly used in [[Mindanao]] to refer to clan feuds. It is considered one of the major problems in Mindanao because, apart from numerous casualties, ''rido'' has caused destruction of property, crippled local economies, and displaced families.

Located in the southern Philippines, Mindanao is home to a majority of the country’s Muslim community, and includes the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. Mindanao "is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 in the last three decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/2007/10/31/in-the-philippines-conflict-resolution-in-mindanao/ |title=In the Philippines: Conflict in Mindanao |author=Wilfredo Magno Torres III |accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a widely held stereotype that the violence is perpetrated by armed groups that resort to terrorism to further their political goals, but the actual situation is far more complex. While the Muslim-Christian conflict and the state-rebel conflicts dominate popular perceptions and media attention, a survey commissioned by [[The Asia Foundation]] in 2002 — and further verified by a recent [[Social Weather Stations]] survey — revealed that citizens are more concerned about the prevalence of ''rido'' and its negative impact on their communities than the conflict between the state and rebel groups.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007" /&gt; The unfortunate interaction and subsequent confusion of ''rido''-based violence with [[secession]]ism, [[communist]] [[insurgency]], banditry, military involvement and other forms of armed violence shows that violence in Mindanao is more complicated than what is commonly believed.

''Rido'' has wider implications for conflict in Mindanao, primarily because it tends to interact in unfortunate ways with separatist conflict and other forms of armed violence. Many armed confrontations in the past involving insurgent groups and the military were triggered by a local ''rido''. The studies cited above investigated the dynamics of ''rido'' with the intention of helping design strategic interventions to address such conflicts.

=====Causes=====
The causes of ''rido'' are varied and may be further complicated by a society's concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|honor and shame]], an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The triggers for conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of ''rido''. Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of ''rido''.

=====Statistics=====
Studies on ''rido'' have documented a total of 1,266 ''rido'' cases between the 1930s and 2005, which have killed over 5,500 people and displaced thousands. The four provinces with the highest numbers of ''rido'' incidences are: [[Lanao del Sur]] (377), [[Maguindanao]] (218), [[Lanao del Norte]] (164), and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] (145). Incidences in these four provinces account for 71% of the total documented cases. The findings also show a steady rise in ''rido'' conflicts in the eleven provinces surveyed from the 1980s to 2004. According to the studies, during 2002–2004, 50% (637 cases) of total ''rido'' incidences occurred, equaling about 127 new ''rido'' cases per year. Out of the total number of ''rido'' cases documented, 64% remain unresolved.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Torres, Wilfredo M. (ed) |year=2007 |title=Rido: Clan Feuding and Conflict Management in Mindanao |location=[[Makati]] |publisher=[[The Asia Foundation]] |pages=348 |isbn=978-971-92445-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Resolution=====
''Rido'' conflicts are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccurring. Although the majority of these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases can utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups. Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"/&gt;

'''Field dependence''' is a concept in the field of [[cognitive styles]]. It is a [[cognitive style#Bipolar.2C one-dimensional models and measures|one-dimensional model]] of variation in cognitive style. The concept was first proposed by American psychologist [[Herman Witkin]] in 1962. Field dependence/independence was the earliest studied area in the study of cognitive styles.

In general, people who exhibit field dependence tend to rely on information provided by the outer world, the field or frame of a situation and their cognition (toward other things) is based on this overall field.

== Measures ==
Field Dependence or Independence is indicated by the Tilting Rod and Frame Test and the Tilting Room, Tilting Chair Test. The tilt of the frame or room provided a field and the degree of independence from it was shown by the accuracy with which the subject had the experimenter adjust the rod or chair. Their interpretation and the concept of field dependence/independence was initially presented by Witkin and his group in his book ''Personality Through Perception''. As its title suggests, other tests were studied and reported on. A field dependence/independence factor was reported in his later book, ''Psychological Differentiation''.

Later, Witkin and his group developed an Embedded Figure Test and did more work with human development. The EFT figured prominently in ''Psychological Differentiation''. Differentiation was shown by an ability to trace a figure "embedded" within a more complex figure. Field-independent people were generally more differentiated, but differentiation was a broader concept than field dependency.

Witkin's group participated in developing their concepts and were given coauthor credit in their two books. The group included the psychoanalyst Helen Block Lewis, the psychologist Hanna Fatterson, and the experimental psychologist Don Goodenough.

More independently, Witkin wrote a ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' review of relationships between Field Dependency/Psychological Differentiation and types of psychopathology. For example, field-independent people appeared to be more likely to develop delusions while field-dependent people were more likely to have scattered hallucinations.

Educational Testing Service (ETS) produced a [[Group Embedded Figures Test]], suited for testing a classroom of students. It correlated with the EFT to an extent, but was not exactly the same in some correlations. After his work on the books and review, Witkin went to ETS and published some ETS reviews of the thousands of studies related to Field Dependency/Psychological Differentiation.

A rating scale was developed for the Draw a Person Test by Witkin's clinicians, described in ''Psychological Differentiation'', and was widely used as another measure of psychological differentiation. In it, greater psychological differentiation was shown by more sophisticated detail, demonstrating more specific identity.

Less differentiated people were usually also more field-dependent and were more inclined to use what Witkin's clinicians in ''Psychological Differentiation'' called "massive global repression." Since his experienced clinicians could also recognize field dependence and lack of psychological differentiation upon meeting subjects, however, their conclusion about subjects' use of repression was open to possible contamination.

Their repression hypothesis was more objectively supported for group extremes by studies of "perceptual defense"—the tendency to recognize emotionally significant, disturbing words less easily than more neutral words. Such "defense" had been shown by numerous studies to be correlated with a tendency to repress as shown by measures such as the MMPI.

Those average in Differentiation/Field Independence had been given little specific attention since it was assumed they would simply be intermediate in repression.

In their perceptual defense, however, they were not intermediate. People who were average (statistically "normal") were more able to recognize words if they were emotionally significant. That was defended as making more sense in evolutionary/survival terms. (Minard, et. al. in various publications). It seems reasonable to suppose that average ("normal") subjects can confuse the results of a study that includes them without recognizing their particular contribution.

=== Rod and Frame Test (RFT) ===
{{main|Rod and frame test}}
To be more specific, in the RFT, examinees are required to sit in a completely dark room without reflecting surfaces where a 3.5 foot luminous square frame with one inch wide sides contains a rod much like one of the sides. The test is properly given after brief (120-second) dark adaptation and the large glowing RFT is seven feet from the subject so it is a dramatic visual display filling much of the visual field. If the test is given with insufficient dark adaptation, many subjects will see the luminous stimulus disappear or fragment when they fixate it visually and a large proportion of them will not happen to report that. The test's validity then is not known. Hebb and others have written about the fragmentation phenomenon.

The RFT is presented with the tilt of rod and tilt of frame in every possible order (RR, LL, RL, LR). The examinee is then asked to tell the examiner how to adjust the rod to "straight up and down like the flagpole outside." Scores are based the number of degrees away from 90.

A less commonly used task was the tilting-room-tilting-chair test, which was similar to the RFT but involved rotating the participant in a chair within a room that also rotated.&lt;ref name="Kirton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael|last=Kirton |year=1978 |title=Field dependence and adaptation-innovation theories|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47 |pages=1239–1245 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2466/pms.1978.47.3f.1239 |doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.3f.1239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Embedded Figures Test (EFT) ===
Examinees are shown a simple geometric figure and then asked to find the simple figure embedded or hidden in a relatively complex figure. Examinees may circle the figure and are scored based on identifying the full, correct figure.&lt;ref name="Goodstein"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodstein |first=L. D. |chapter=Review of Group Embedded Figures Test  |editor-last=Buros |editor-first= Oscar K. |title=[[The Eighth Mental Measurements Yearbook]] |year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying learning style theory is that field-independent people can better ignore the influence of the background image and find the hidden figure, while field-dependent people will find it harder to ignore the irrelevant field and will be slower to locate the figure. The Witkin EFT was first developed by [[Herman Witkin]] as suggested by the figures of [[Kurt Gotschaldt]] and described in his book ''Psychological Differentiation'' by Witkin's group. Thurston had an earlier Hidden Figures Test which correlated with the EFT but had a different pattern of other correlations.

Researchers since Witkin's group have extended the use of this measure to other concepts, including components of memory and logic.&lt;ref name="EFT CA"&gt;{{citation |title=Embedded Figures Test (Cognitive Atlas) |url= http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/term/id/trm_4b749b8829eee }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures may also be sensitive to traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder, where individuals with ASD are quicker to solve EFT tasks.&lt;ref name="Pheno"&gt;{{citation |title=Embedded Figures Test (PhenoWiki) |url=http://149.142.158.188/phenowiki/wiki/index.php/Embedded_Figures_Test |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118091207/http://149.142.158.188/phenowiki/wiki/index.php/Embedded_Figures_Test |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism''' ('''FAIR''') is a [[London]]-based [[Muslim]] [[advocacy]] and [[lobbying]]&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/world/2002/islamic_world/2188307.stm&lt;/ref&gt; group which campaigns against [[discrimination]] in the form of [[Islamophobia]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="S106"&gt;T. Modood in: Spencer (2003) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2001 as an independent [[charitable organization]] with the aim of monitoring media coverage of [[Islam]] and Muslims, and challenging examples of Islamophobia through dialogue with media organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh (2006) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, it has produced numerous publications relating to Islamophobia in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fairuk.org/pressreleases.htm Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism]" official website, "Press releases."&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.trend.az/news/politics/1500402.html&lt;/ref&gt; Navid Akhtar and Samar Mashadi have been directors of FAIR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/2009/02/05/news-opinion/world/fear-and-loathing-in-europe-islamophobia-and-the-challenge-of-integration&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and activities==

According to the group's mission statement, it was set up "for the purpose of raising awareness of and combating Islamophobia and racism, monitoring specific incidents of Islamophobia and racism, working towards eliminating religious and racial discrimination, campaigning and lobbying on issues relevant to Muslim and other multi-ethnic communities in Britain."&lt;ref name="S106"/&gt;

FAIR was active in campaigning for passing of the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]] which outlawed the incitement towards religious hatred in Britain. They issued a [[memorandum]] in 2002 entitled "''The Religious Offences Bill: A Response''" to the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee in which they raised a number of publications by the far-right [[British National Party]] inciting hatred against Islam and the Muslim community in Britain, stating that this exposed a loophole in British law wherein some communities were protected from incitement to hatred whilst others were not.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee (2005) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, FAIR reported 29 incidents of assault or attacks against Muslims for that year, though they believe many went unreported. This included attacks on Muslim women and people wearing [[Hijab|traditional Muslim clothes]], as well as vandalism of [[mosque]]s and Islamic centers. Also reported were desecration of Muslim graves.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35492.htm Annual Report on International Religious Freedom]'' (2005). Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; [[US Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the FAIR carried out a survey in association with the Muslim College and the Al-Khoei Foundation which found that since the [[September 11 attacks]], 80 percent of Muslims surveyed reported being subjected to Islamophobia; 68 percent believed they had been treated and perceived differently; and 32 percent reported being discriminated against at [[List of airports in the United Kingdom|airports in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

'''French Cerdagne''' ({{lang-ca|Alta Cerdanya}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈaltə səɾˈðaɲə|IPA}}) is the northern half of [[Cerdanya]], which came under French control as a result of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, while the southern half remained in [[Spain]] (as part of [[Catalonia]]). [[Catalans]] often refer to French Cerdagne as '''Upper Cerdanya''' ({{lang-ca|Alta Cerdanya}}). It is the only French territory in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as it is on the south side of the [[Pyrenees]] range between Spain and [[France]].&lt;ref name="Sahlins1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Sahlins|title=Boundaries: The Making of France and Spain in the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPLEOKM1CI8C&amp;pg=PA49|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91121-5|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilstach1931"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Wilstach|title=Along the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpw-AAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22stretches%20off%20southwest%22|year=1931|publisher=Robert M. McBride Company|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray1837"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Erskine Murray|title=A Summer in the Pyrenees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA92|year=1837|publisher=J. Macrone|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] river, which goes west and then south to meet the [[Ebro]], has its source in the French Cerdagne. An inadvertent result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees is the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[exclave]] of [[Llivia]] (the small uncolored area in the map) which is sovereign Spanish territory completely surrounded by French Cerdagne.  

French Cerdagne has no special status inside France, simply forming an area within the ''[[departments of France|department]]'' of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], unlike the Spanish part of Cerdanya, which is officially a [[comarques of Catalonia|Catalan ''comarca'']] called simply [[Cerdanya (comarca)|Cerdanya]]. In France, the French area is referred to as either ''Cerdagne française'' (i.e. "French Cerdagne"), ''Haute Cerdagne'' (i.e. "Upper Cerdagne") or just ''Cerdagne''.

French Cerdagne has a land area of 539.67 km² (208.37 sq. miles). Its 1999 population was 12,035, resulting in a density of only 22 people per km² (58 per sq. mile).

French Cerdagne has the most cloud-free days in [[France]], and was therefore chosen as the place to build:

'''Hanja''' ({{Korean|한자|{{lang|ko|漢字}}}}; {{IPA-ko|ha(ː)nt͈ɕa}}) is the [[Korean language|Korean]] name for [[Chinese characters|Han Chinese characters]] ({{zh|t=漢字|p=hànzì}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The writing systems of the world|year=1991|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-18028-9|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOywmavmZ3UC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, it refers to those Chinese characters borrowed from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and incorporated into the [[Korean language]] with Korean [[pronunciation]]. ''Hanja-mal'' or ''[[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Hanja-eo]]'' (the latter is more used) refers to words that can be written with Hanja, and ''hanmun'' ({{lang|ko|한문}}, {{lang|ko|漢文}}) refers to [[Classical Chinese]] writing, although "Hanja" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because Hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to [[traditional Chinese]] and ''[[kyūjitai]]'' characters, though the [[Stroke order|stroke orders]] for some characters are slightly different. For example, the characters {{script|Hant|教}} and {{script|Hant|研}} are written as {{lang|ko|敎}} and {{lang|ko|硏}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sayjack.com/korean/hanja/characters/|title=Korean Hanja Characters » SayJack|website=www.sayjack.com|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small number of Hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]], and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding Hanja characters.

Although a phonetic [[Hangul|Korean alphabet]], now known as Chosŏn'gŭl or Hangul, had been created by [[Sejong the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=알고 싶은 한글|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/setting/002.html|website=국립국어원|publisher=National Institute of Korean Language|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not come into widespread official use until the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Stephen Roger|title=A History of Writing|publisher=Reaktion Books|series=Globalities|pages=189–194|isbn=978-1-86189-101-3|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ywo0M9OpbXoC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=2009-04-03|date=2004-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing Hanja to be literate, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most other Korean documents were written in [[Literary Chinese]], using Hanja as its primary script. Today, a good working knowledge of Chinese characters is still important for anyone who wishes to study older texts (up to about the 1990s), or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities. Learning a certain number of Hanja is very helpful for understanding the [[etymology]] of Sino-Korean words, and for enlarging one's Korean vocabulary. Today, Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in Hangul, and even words of Chinese origin—''Hanja-eo'' ({{lang|ko|한자어, 漢字語}})—are written with the Hangul alphabet most of the time, with the corresponding Chinese character often written next to it to prevent confusion with other characters or words with the same phonetics.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==History==
A major motivation for the introduction of [[Chinese character]]s into [[Korea]] was the spread of [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]]. The major Chinese text that introduced Hanja to Koreans, however, was not a religious text but the Chinese text [[Thousand Character Classic|''Cheonjamun'']] ({{lang|ko|천자문; 千字文}}; ''Thousand Character Classic'').{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Although Koreans had to learn [[Classical Chinese]] to be properly literate for the most part, some additional systems were developed which used simplified forms of Chinese characters that [[phonetic]]ally transcribe Korean, including [[hyangchal]] ({{lang|ko|향찰; 鄕札}}), [[gugyeol]] ({{lang|ko|구결; 口訣}}), and [[idu script|idu]] ({{lang|ko|이두; 吏讀}}).{{fact|date=December 2017}}

One way of adapting Hanja to write Korean in such systems (such as Gugyeol) was to represent native Korean [[grammatical particle]]s and other words solely according to their pronunciation. For example, Gugyeol uses the characters {{lang|ko|爲尼}} to transcribe the Korean word "hăni", which in modern Korean means "does, and so". In Chinese, however, the same characters are read as the expression "wéi ní", meaning "becoming a nun". This is a typical example of Gugyeol words where the radical ({{lang|ko|爲}}) is read in Korean for its meaning (hă—"to do"), whereas the suffix {{lang|ko|尼}}, ni (meaning "nun"), is used phonetically.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Hanja were the sole means of writing Korean until [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong the Great]] promoted the invention of [[Hangul]] in the [[15th century]]. Even after the invention of Hangul, however, most Korean scholars continued to write in ''hanmun''.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Hangul effectively replaced Hanja only in the 20th century. Since June 1949, Hanja have not officially been used in [[North Korea]], and, in addition, all texts are now written horizontally instead of vertically.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Many words borrowed from Chinese have also been replaced in the North with native Korean words. Nevertheless, a large number of Chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the North (although written in Hangul), and Hanja still appear in special contexts, such as recent North Korean [[dictionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2003/200305/news05/29.htm#6 | title= New Korean-English Dictionary published | date= 2003-05-28 | publisher= [[Korean Central News Agency]] | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012114938/http://kcna.co.jp/item/2003/200305/news05/29.htm#6 | archivedate= 2007-10-12 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{OR|date=May 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2017}}&lt;!-- This is not a source that says "hanja still appear in special contexts, such as recent North Korean dictionaries"; it is a news article about a single North Korean dictionary that happens to include hanja. ~Hijiri88, May 2016. --&gt; The replacement has been less total in South Korea where, although usage has declined over time, some Hanja remain in common usage in some contexts.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Character formation==
Each Hanja is composed of one of 214 [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]s plus in most cases one or more additional elements. The vast majority of Hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character, but a few Hanja are purely pictographic, and some were formed in other ways.

==''Eumhun''==
To aid in understanding the meaning of a character, or to describe it orally to distinguish it from other characters with the same pronunciation, character dictionaries and school textbooks refer to each character with a combination of its sound and a word indicating its meaning. This dual meaning-sound reading of a character is called ''eumhun'' ({{lang|ko|음훈; 音訓}}; from {{lang|ko|音}} "sound" + {{lang|ko|訓}} "meaning," "teaching").

The word or words used to denote the meaning are often&amp;mdash;though hardly always&amp;mdash;words of native Korean (i.e., non-Chinese) origin, and are sometimes archaic words no longer commonly used.

==Education==

===North Korea===
Though North Korea rapidly abandoned the general use of Hanja soon after independence,&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 67. "By the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, the major newspaper ''Nodong sinmun'', mass circulation magazine ''Kulloja'', and similar publications began appearing in all-''hangul''. School textbooks and literary materials converted to all-''hangul'' at the same time or possibly earlier (So 1989:31)."&lt;/ref&gt; the number of Hanja taught in primary and secondary schools is actually greater than the 1,800 taught in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 68. "Although North Korea has removed Chinese characters from its written materials, it has, paradoxically, ended up with an educational program that teachers more characters than either South Korea or Japan, as Table 2 shows."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Il-sung]] had earlier called for a gradual elimination of the use of Hanja,&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 67. "According to Ko Yong-kun, Kim went on record as early as February 1949, when Chinese characters had already been removed from most DPRK publications, as advocating their ''gradual'' abandonment (1989:25)."&lt;/ref&gt; but by the 1960s, he had reversed his stance; he was quoted as saying in 1966, "While we should use as few Sinitic terms as possible, students must be exposed to the necessary Chinese characters and taught how to write them."&lt;ref name="Hannas 1997: 67"&gt;Hannas 1997: 67&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a Chinese-character textbook was designed for North Korean schools for use in grades 5–9, teaching 1,500 characters, with another 500 for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 67. "Between 1968 and 1969, a four-volume textbook appeared for use in grades 5 through 9 designed to teach 1,500 characters, confirming the applicability of the new policy to the general student population. Another five hundred were added for grades 10 through 12 (Yi Yun-p'yo 1989: 372)."&lt;/ref&gt; College students are exposed to another 1,000, bringing the total to 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 2003: 188-189&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
South Korean primary schools abandoned the teaching of Hanja in 1971, although they are still taught as part of the mandatory curriculum in 6th grade. They are taught in separate courses in [[Education in South Korea|South Korean high schools]], separately from the normal Korean-language curriculum. Formal Hanja education begins in grade 7 (junior high school) and continues until graduation from senior high school in grade 12. A total of 1,800 Hanja are taught: 900 for junior high, and 900 for senior high (starting in grade 10).&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 71. "A balance was struck in August 1976, when the Ministry of Education agreed to keep Chinese characters out of the elementary schools and teach the 1,800 characters in special courses, not as part of Korean language or any other substantive curricula. This is where things stand at present"&lt;/ref&gt; Post-secondary Hanja education continues in some [[liberal-arts]] [[universities]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 promulgation of [[Basic Hanja for educational use|basic Hanja for educational purposes]] changed on December 31, 2000, to replace 44 Hanja with 44 others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suneung.re.kr/boardCnts/fileDown.do?fileSeq=59692112e521efa80d2af27916704082 한문 교육용 기초 한자 (2000)], page 15 (추가자: characters added, 제외자: characters removed)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Debate flared again in 2013 after a move by South Korean authorities to encourage primary and secondary schools to offer Hanja classes. Officials said that learning Chinese characters could enhance students' Korean-language proficiency; protesters called the program "old-fashioned and unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130703000818 "Hangeul advocates oppose Hanja classes"], ''The Korea Herald'', 2013-07-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Because many different Hanja—and thus, many different words written using Hanja—often share the [[Homophone|same sounds]], two distinct Hanja words (''Hanjaeo'') may be spelled identically in the [[phonetic]] Hangul [[alphabet]]. Hanja's language of origin, Chinese, has many homophones, and Hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into Korean, since Korean lacks a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal system]], which is how Chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophonic. For example, while 道, 刀, and 島 are all phonetically distinct in Mandarin (pronounced ''dào'', ''dāo'', and ''dǎo'' respectively), they are all pronounced ''do'' (도) in Korean. For this reason, Hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent Hangul spelling or in parentheses after the Hangul spelling as a kind of gloss. Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs, for example the banner at the funeral for the [[Republic of Korea Navy|sailors]] lost in the sinking of [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)]].&lt;ref name="Korea bids farewell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/photo/2010-04/29/c_13272696_4.htm|title=S. Korea bids farewell to warship victims|last=Yang|first=Lina|date=2010-04-29|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304224747/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/photo/2010-04/29/c_13272696_4.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=true|publisher=[[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print media===
In South Korea, Hanja are used most frequently in ancient literature, legal documents, and scholarly monographs, where they often appear without the equivalent Hangul spelling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Usually, only those words with a specialized or ambiguous meaning are printed in Hanja.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  In mass-circulation books and magazines, Hanja are generally used rarely, and only to gloss words already spelled in Hangul when the meaning is ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Hanja are also often used in newspaper headlines as abbreviations or to eliminate ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1990: 120&lt;/ref&gt; In formal publications, personal names are also usually glossed in Hanja in parentheses next to the Hangul. In contrast, North Korea eliminated the use of Hanja even in academic publications by 1949, a situation that has since remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="Hannas 1997: 67"/&gt; Hanja are often used for advertising or decorative purposes, and appear frequently in athletic events and cultural parades, dictionaries and [[atlas]]es.  For example, the Hanja {{lang|ko|辛}} (''sin'' or ''shin'', meaning sour or hot) appears prominently on packages of [[Shin Ramyun]] noodles.

===Dictionaries===
In modern Korean dictionaries, all entry words of Sino-Korean origin are printed in Hangul and listed in Hangul order, with the Hanja given in parentheses immediately following the entry word.

This practice helps to eliminate ambiguity, and it also serves as a sort of shorthand etymology, since the meaning of the Hanja and the fact that the word is composed of Hanja often help to illustrate the word's origin.

As an example of how Hanja can help to clear up ambiguity, many homophones are written in Hangul as {{lang|ko|수도}} (sudo), including:&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://hanja.naver.com/search?query=수도 Naver Hanja Dictionary query of sudo]&lt;/ref&gt;

# {{lang|ko|修道}}: spiritual discipline
# {{lang|ko|囚徒}}: prisoner
# {{lang|ko|水都}}: "city of water" (e.g. Venice or Suzhou)
# {{lang|ko|水稻}}: [[paddy rice]]
# {{lang|ko|水道}}: drain, rivers, path of surface water
# {{lang|ko|隧道}}: [[tunnel]]
# {{lang|ko|首都}}: capital (city)
# {{lang|ko|手刀}}: hand knife

Hanja dictionaries (''Jajeon'' ({{lang|ko|자전, 字典}}) or ''Okpyeon'' ({{lang|ko|옥편, 玉篇}})) are organized by [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] (the traditional Chinese method of classifying characters).

===Personal names===
[[Korean name|Korean personal names]] are generally based on Hanja, although some exceptions exist. On business cards, the use of Hanja is slowly fading away, with most older people displaying their names in Hanja while most of the younger generation uses [[Hangul]]. Korean personal names usually consist of a one-syllable family name (seong, {{lang|ko|성, 姓}}) followed by a two-syllable given name (ireum, {{lang|ko|이름}}). There are a few two-syllable family names (e.g. {{lang|ko|남궁, 南宮}}, Namgung), and the holders of such names—but not only them—tend to have one-syllable given names. Traditionally, the given name in turn consists of one syllable unique to the individual and one syllable shared by all people in a family of the same sex and generation (see [[Generation name]]). During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese administration]] of Korea (1910–1945), Koreans [[Sōshi-kaimei|were encouraged to adopt Japanese-style names]], including [[kun'yomi|polysyllabic readings]] of the Hanja, but this practice was reversed by post-independence governments in Korea. Since the 1970s, some parents have given their children [[given names]] that break the Chinese generation style, and are simply native Korean words. Popular ones include ''Haneul''—meaning "sky"—and ''Iseul''—meaning "morning dew".  Nevertheless, on official documents, people's names are still recorded in both Hangul and in Hanja (if the name is composed of Hanja).

===Toponymy===
Due to standardization efforts during [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] eras, native Korean [[placenames]] were converted to Hanja, and most names used today are Hanja-based.  The most notable exception is the name of the capital, [[Seoul]], a native Korean word meaning "capital" with no direct Hanja conversion; the Hanja ''gyeong'' ({{lang|ko|경, 京}}, "capital") is sometimes used as a back-rendering.  For example, disyllabic names of railway lines, freeways, and provinces are often formed by taking one character from each of the two locales' names; thus,
* The [[Gyeongbu]] ({{lang|ko|경부, 京釜}}) corridor connects Seoul (''gyeong'', {{lang|ko|京}}) and [[Busan]] (''bu'', {{lang|ko|釜}});
* The [[Gyeongin]] ({{lang|ko|경인, 京仁}}) corridor connects Seoul and [[Incheon]] (''in'', {{lang|ko|仁}});
* The former [[Jeolla]] ({{lang|ko|전라, 全羅}}) Province took its name from the first characters in the city names [[Jeonju]] ({{lang|ko|전주, 全州}}) and [[Naju]] ({{lang|ko|나주, 羅州}}) ("Naju" is originally "Raju," but the initial "r/l" sound in South Korean is simplified to "n").

Most atlases of Korea today are published in two versions: one in Hangul (sometimes with some English as well), and one in Hanja.  Subway and railway station signs give the station's name in Hangul, Hanja, and English, both to assist visitors (including Chinese or Japanese who may rely on the Hanja spellings) and to disambiguate the name.

===Academia===
Hanja are still required for certain disciplines in academia, such as [[Oriental Studies]] and other disciplines studying Chinese, Japanese or historic Korean literature and culture, since the vast majority of primary source text material are written in [[Hanzi]], [[Kanji]], Hanja, etc.

===Popular usage===
{{See also|Korean mixed script}}
[[File:8239th AU leaflet 2508.png|thumb|right|300px|This [[Korean War]] propaganda leaflet created by the US Army as part of [[Operation Moolah]] uses Hangul–Hanja [[Korean mixed script|mixed script]].]]
Opinion surveys in South Korea regarding the issue of Hanja use have had mixed responses in the past. Hanja terms are also expressed through [[Hangul]], the standard script in the Korean language. Hanja use within general Korean literature has declined significantly since the 1980s because formal Hanja education in South Korea does not begin until the seventh year of schooling, due to changes in government policy during the time. In 1956, one study found mixed-script Korean text (in which [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] nouns are written using Hanja, and other words using Hangul) were read faster than texts written purely in Hangul; however, by 1977, the situation had reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Taylor 1983: 90&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 80% of one sample of people without a college education "evinced no reading comprehension of any but the simplest, most common hanja" when reading mixed-script passages.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1990: 119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gukja ==
{{See also|Kokuji|Chữ Nôm}}
A small number of characters were invented by Koreans themselves. These characters are called ''gukja'' ({{lang|ko|국자, 國字}}, literally "national characters"). Most of them are for proper names (place-names and people's names) but some refer to Korean-specific concepts and materials. They include {{lang|ko|[[:wikt:畓|畓]]}} ({{lang|ko|답}}; ''dap''; "paddyfield"), {{lang|ko|[[:wikt:欌|欌]]}} ({{lang|ko|장}}; ''jang'', "wardrobe"), {{lang|ko|[[:wikt:乭|乭]]}} ({{lang|ko|돌}}; ''Dol'', a character only used in given names), {{lang|ko|[[:wikt:㸴|㸴]]}} ({{lang|ko|소}}; ''So'', a rare surname from [[Seongju County|Seongju]]), and {{lang|ko|[[:wikt:怾|怾]]}} ({{lang|ko|기}}; ''Gi'', an old name referring to [[Mount Kumgang|Kumgangsan]]).

Further examples include {{lang|ko|巭}} ({{lang|ko|부}} ''bu''), {{lang|ko|頉}} ({{lang|ko|탈}} ''tal''), {{lang|ko|䭏}} ({{lang|ko|편}} ''pyeon''), and {{lang|ko|哛}} ({{lang|ko|뿐}} ''ppun''),{{lang|ko|&amp;#x6927;}} ({{lang|ko|명}} ''myeong'').

Compare to the parallel development in Japan of {{Nihongo||国字|[[kokuji]]}}, of which there are hundreds, many rarely used—these were often developed for native Japanese plants and animals.

=== Yakja ===
[[Image:Eopseul mu yakja.png|thumb|Yakja ({{lang|ko|약자, [[wikt:略字|略字]]}}) simplification of {{lang|ko|[[wikt:無|無]]}}]]

Some Hanja characters have simplified forms ({{lang|ko|약자}}, [[wikt:略字|略字]], ''yakja'') that can be seen in casual use. An example is [[Image:Eopseul mu yakja.png|17px]], which is a cursive form of {{lang|ko|無}} (meaning "nothing").

==Pronunciation==
Each Hanja character is pronounced as a single syllable, corresponding to a single composite character in Hangul. The [[pronunciation]] of Hanja in Korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern Chinese, particularly [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], although some Chinese dialects and Korean share similar pronunciations for some characters. For example, {{lang|ko|印刷}} "print" is ''yìnshuā'' in Mandarin Chinese and ''inswae'' ({{lang|ko|인쇄}}) in Korean, but it is pronounced ''insue'' in [[Shanghainese]] (a [[Wu Chinese]] dialect). One obvious difference is the complete loss{{Dubious|reason=It is questionable whether Old Chinese had a tone system in 2nd–1st century BC, when the importation of hanja started.  The notion of losing something that doesn't exist is absurd.|date=June 2011}} of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] from Korean while most Chinese dialects retain tone. In other aspects, the pronunciation of Hanja is more conservative than most northern and central Chinese dialects, for example in the retention of [[labial consonant]] [[syllable coda|coda]]s in characters with [[labial consonant]] [[syllable onset|onset]]s, such as the characters {{lang|ko|法}} ({{lang|ko|법}} ''beop'') and {{lang|ko|凡}} ({{lang|ko|범}} ''beom''); [[Labial consonant|labial]] codas existed in [[Middle Chinese]] but do not survive intact in most northern and central Chinese varieties today, and even in many southern Chinese varieties that still retain labial codas, including [[Cantonese]] and [[Hokkien]], labial codas in characters with labial onsets are replaced by their [[dental consonants|dental]] counterparts.

Due to divergence in pronunciation since the time of borrowing, sometimes the pronunciation of a Hanja and its corresponding [[hanzi]] may differ considerably. For example, {{lang|ko|女}} ("woman") is ''nǚ'' in Mandarin Chinese and ''nyeo'' ({{lang|ko|녀}}) in Korean.  However, in most modern Korean dialects (especially [[South Korea]]n ones), {{lang|ko|女}} is pronounced as ''yeo'' ({{lang|ko|여}}) when used in an initial position, due to a systematic [[elision]] of initial ''n'' when followed by ''y'' or ''i''.

Additionally, sometimes a Hanja-derived word will have altered pronunciation of a character to reflect Korean pronunciation shifts, for example mogwa {{lang|ko|모과 木瓜}} "quince" from mokgwa {{lang|ko|목과}}, and moran {{lang|ko|모란 牡丹}} "Paeonia suffruticosa" from mokdan {{lang|ko|모단}}.

There are some pronunciation correspondence between the onset, rhyme, and coda between [[Cantonese]] and Korean.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Chun Kau Chu. (2008). [http://www.patrickchu.net/uploads/9/0/5/3/9053324/2008_prfl_ppt.pdf Onset, Rhyme and Coda Corresponding Rules of the Sino-Korean Characters between Cantonese and Korean]. Paper presented at the 5th Postgraduate Research Forum on Linguistics (PRFL), Hong Kong, China, March 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

When learning how to write Hanja, students are taught to memorize the native Korean pronunciation for the Hanja's meaning and the Sino-Korean pronunciations (the pronunciation based on the Chinese pronunciation of the characters) for each Hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular Hanja. For example, the name for the Hanja {{lang|ko|水}} is {{lang|ko|물 수}} (mul-su) in which {{lang|ko|물}} (mul) is the native Korean pronunciation for "water", while {{lang|ko|수}} (su) is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character. The naming of Hanja is similar to if "water" were named "water-aqua", "horse-equus", or "gold-aurum" based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names. Other examples include {{lang|ko|사람 인}} (saram-in) for {{lang|ko|人}} "person/people", {{lang|ko|큰 대}} (keun-dae) for {{lang|ko|大}} "big/large//great", {{lang|ko|작을 소}} (jakeul-so) for {{lang|ko|小}} "small/little", {{lang|ko|아래 하}} (arae-ha) for {{lang|ko|下}} "underneath/below/low", {{lang|ko|아비 부}} (abi-bu) for {{lang|ko|父}} "father", and {{lang|ko|나라이름 한}} (naraireum-han) for {{lang|ko|韓}} "Han/Korea".

{{Hedonism}}
'''Hedonism''' is a school of thought that argues that the pursuit of [[pleasure]] and [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic goods]] are the primary or most important goals of human life.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ |title=Hedonism |website=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus [[pain]]). However upon finally gaining said pleasure, happiness may remain stationary.

Ethical hedonism is the idea that all people have the right to do everything in their power to achieve the greatest amount of pleasure possible to them.  It is also the idea that every person's pleasure should far surpass their amount of pain. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, a student of [[Socrates]]. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|page=567|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and lexicon==
The name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "delight" ({{lang|grc|ἡδονισμός}} ''hēdonismos'' from {{lang|grc|ἡδονή}} ''[[hedone|hēdonē]]'' "pleasure", cognate via [[Proto-Indo-European]] swéh₂dus through [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡδύς}} with English ''sweet'' + suffix -ισμός ''-ismos'' "[[-ism|ism]]"). An extremely strong aversion to hedonism is [[hedonophobia]].

==History of development==

===Sumerian civilization===
In the original Old Babylonian version of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which was written soon after the invention of writing, [[Siduri]] gave the following advice: "Fill your belly. Day and night make merry. Let days be full of joy. Dance and make music day and night [...] These things alone are the concern of men." This may represent the first recorded advocacy of a hedonistic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Дробович |first=Антон |title=Вчення про насолоди і задоволення: від історії значень до концептуалізації понять | publisher=Практична філософія |pages=184–185|year=2012|volume=№2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
Scenes of a harper entertaining guests at a feast were common in [[ancient Egypt]]ian tombs (see [[Harper's Songs]]), and sometimes contained hedonistic elements, calling guests to submit to pleasure because they cannot be sure that they will be rewarded for good with a blissful afterlife. The following is a song attributed to the reign of one of the pharaohs around the time of the 12th dynasty, and the text was used in the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|nineteenth]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=John A. | title=Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament | publisher=Princeton University Press | chapter=Egyptian Secular Songs and Poems | authorlink=John A. Wilson (Egyptologist) | year=1969 | location=New Jersey | page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Дробович |first=Антон |title=Вчення про насолоди і задоволення: від історії значень до концептуалізації понять | publisher=Практична філософія |page=185|year=2012|volume=№2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Let thy desire flourish, 
In order to let thy heart forget the [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|beatifications]] for thee.
Follow thy desire, as long as thou shalt live.
Put [[myrrh]] upon thy head and clothing of fine linen upon thee,
Being anointed with genuine marvels of the gods' property.
Set an increase to thy good things;
Let not thy heart flag.
Follow thy desire and thy good.
Fulfill thy needs upon earth, after the command of thy heart,
Until there come for thee that day of mourning.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Classic schools of antiquity===
[[Democritus]] seems to be the earliest philosopher on record to have categorically embraced a hedonistic philosophy; he called the supreme goal of life "contentment" or "cheerfulness", claiming that "joy and sorrow are the distinguishing mark of things beneficial and harmful" ([[Diels-Kranz|DK]] 68 B 188).&lt;ref&gt;p. 125, C.C.W. Taylor, "Democritus", in C. Rowe &amp; M. Schofield (eds.), ''Greek and Roman Political Thought'', Cambridge 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyrenaic school ====
{{main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[File:Aristippus.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristippus of Cyrene]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BC, supposedly by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, [[Aristippus the Younger]]. The school was so called after [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest [[Socrates|Socratic]] schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable momentary sensations. Of these, physical ones are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation, and that pleasure could be gained from [[altruism]]{{Citation needed|reason=by whom?|date=March 2011}}. [[Theodorus the Atheist]] was a latter exponent of hedonism who was a disciple of [[Aristippus the Younger|younger Aristippus]],&lt;ref name="diog86"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 86&lt;/ref&gt; while becoming well known for expounding [[atheism]]. The school died out within a century, and was replaced by [[Epicureanism]].

The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical [[Epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reale|Catan|1986|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate [[Empirical evidence|sense-experiences]] (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet).&lt;ref name="copleston121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reale|Catan|1986|pp=274–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All knowledge is immediate sensation. These sensations are motions which are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil or gentle.&lt;ref name="copleston121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annas230"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, they are entirely individual and can in no way be described as constituting absolute objective knowledge. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct.&lt;ref name="copleston121"/&gt; Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure.

Cyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.&lt;ref name="annas230"/&gt; Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable.&lt;ref name="annas231"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans. However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.&lt;ref name="copleston122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regard should be paid to law and custom, because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others.&lt;ref name="annas231"/&gt; Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide.&lt;ref name="annas231"/&gt; Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behaviour.

==== Epicureanism ====
{{main article|Epicureanism|Epicurus}}
Epicureanism is a system of [[philosophy]] based upon the teachings of [[Epicurus]] (''c''. 341–''c''. 270 BC), founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]]. His [[materialism]] led him to a general stance against superstition or the idea of divine intervention. Following [[Aristippus]]—about whom very little is known—Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable "pleasure" in the form of a state of tranquility and freedom from fear  ([[ataraxia]]) and absence of bodily pain ([[aponia]]) through knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of our desires. The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, insofar as it declares pleasure as the sole intrinsic good, its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from "hedonism" as it is commonly understood.

[[Image:Epicurus bust2.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Epicurus]]&lt;/center&gt;]]In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures, by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, verging on [[asceticism]]. He argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived but had a unique version of the [[Golden Rule]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly (agreeing "neither to harm nor be harmed"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tim |last=O'Keefe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugI3eRmNJrcC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Epicurus on Freedom|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Epicurus/princdoc.html ''Epicurus Principal Doctrines''] tranls. by Robert Drew Hicks (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]], though later it became the main opponent of [[Stoicism]]. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by [[Hermarchus]]; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]] and [[Ercolano]]). The poet [[Lucretius]] is its most known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist [[Pierre Gassendi]], who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.

Some writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean [[Philodemus]].

===Yangism===
{{main article|Yangism}}
Yangism has been described as a form of psychological and ethical egoism. The Yangist philosophers believed in the importance of maintaining self-interest through "keeping one's nature intact, protecting one's uniqueness, and not letting the body be tied by other things." Disagreeing with the Confucian virtues of li (propriety), ren (humaneness), and yi (righteousness) and the Legalist virtue of fa (law), the Yangists saw wei wo, or "everything for myself," as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation. Individual pleasure is considered desirable, like in hedonism, but not at the expense of the health of the individual. The Yangists saw individual well-being as the prime purpose of life, and considered anything that hindered that well-being immoral and unnecessary.

The main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of xing, or human nature, a term later incorporated by Mencius into Confucianism. The xing, according to sinologist A. C. Graham, is a person's "proper course of development" in life. Individuals can only rationally care for their own xing, and should not naively have to support the xing of other people, even if it means opposing the emperor. In this sense, Yangism is a "direct attack" on Confucianism, by implying that the power of the emperor, defended in Confucianism, is baseless and destructive, and that state intervention is morally flawed.

The Confucian philosopher Mencius depicts Yangism as the direct opposite of Mohism, while Mohism promotes the idea of universal love and impartial caring, the Yangists acted only "for themselves," rejecting the altruism of Mohism. He criticized the Yangists as selfish, ignoring the duty of serving the public and caring only for personal concerns. Mencius saw Confucianism as the "Middle Way" between Mohism and Yangism.

=== Judaism ===

[[Judaism]] believes that mankind was created for pleasure, as [[God]] placed [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]—Eden being the Hebrew word for "pleasure." In recent years, Rabbi [[Noah Weinberg]] articulated five different [http://www.aish.com/sp/f/Five_Levels_of_Pleasure.html levels of pleasure]; connecting with God is the highest possible pleasure. The Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament proclaims, "There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God..." (Ecclesiastes 2:24)

=== Christianity ===
{{main article|Christian hedonism}}
Ethical hedonism as part of [[Christian theology]] has also been a concept in some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] circles, particularly in those of the [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] tradition.&lt;ref name="desiringgod1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TopicIndex/85_Christian_Hedonism/1538_Christian_Hedonism/|title=Christian Hedonism|website=Desiring God}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Christian Hedonism]] was first coined by [[Reformed Baptists|Reformed Baptist]] theologian [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] in his 1986 book ''Desiring God'': “My shortest summary of it is: God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. Or: The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever. Does Christian Hedonism make a god out of pleasure? No. It says that we all make a god out of what we take most pleasure in.” &lt;ref name="desiringgod1"/&gt;  Piper states his term may describe the theology of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], who in 1812 referred to “a future enjoyment of him [God] in heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edwards, ''A treatise concerning religious affections'' (Dublin: J. Ogle, 1812)[https://books.google.com/books?id=99cHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0(accessed on Google Book on July 26, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the 17th century, the atomist [[Pierre Gassendi]] had adapted Epicureanism to the Christian doctrine.

===Hinduism===

The concept of hedonism is also found in [[Nastika]] (heterodox) philosophy such as the [[Charvaka]] school. However, Hedonism is critcized by [[Astika]]  (orthodox) schools of thought on the basis that it is inherently egoistic and therefore detrimental to spiritual liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy: An Exposition of the Principle [sic] Religio-philosophical Systems and an Examination of Different Schools of Thought|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=hinduism+vedas+Hedonism#v=onepage&amp;q=hinduism%20vedas%20Hedonism&amp;f=false|page=252|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=9788177552034|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|page=464|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
{{main article|Utilitarianism}}
Utilitarianism addresses problems with moral motivation neglected by [[Kantianism]] by giving a central role to happiness. It is an ethical theory holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes the overall good of the society.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;, Salters-Nuffield Advanced Biology for Edexcel A2 Biology 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus one form of [[consequentialism]], meaning that the moral worth of an [[action (philosophy)|action]] is determined by its resulting outcome. The most influential contributors to this theory are considered to be the 18th and 19th-century British philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Conjoining hedonism—as a view as to what is good for people—to utilitarianism has the result that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest total amount of happiness (see [[Hedonic calculus]]). Though consistent in their pursuit of happiness, Bentham and Mill's versions of hedonism differ. There are two somewhat basic schools of thought on hedonism:&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

* One school, grouped around Bentham, defends a quantitative approach. Bentham believed that the value of a pleasure could be quantitatively understood. Essentially, he believed the value of pleasure to be its intensity multiplied by its duration - so it was not just the number of pleasures, but their intensity and how long they lasted that must be taken into account.
* Other proponents, like Mill, argue a qualitative approach. Mill believed that there can be different levels of pleasure - higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure. Mill also argues that simpler beings (he often refers to pigs) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures; since they do not see other aspects of life, they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures. The more elaborate beings tend to spend more thought on other matters and hence lessen the time for simple pleasure. It is therefore more difficult for them to indulge in such "simple pleasures" in the same manner.
=== Libertinage ===
{{main article|Libertine}}
An extreme form of hedonism that views moral and sexual restraint as either unnecessary or harmful. Famous proponents are [[Marquis de sade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-marquis-de-sade-180953980/|title=Who Was the Marquis de Sade?|first=Tony|last=Perrottet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20141006-marquis-de-sade-still-shocking|title=Who’s afraid of the Marquis de Sade?|first=Jason|last=Farago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Wilmot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virginia-anthology.org/drama/rochester/?print=print|title=John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester - The Open Anthology of Literature in English|website=virginia-anthology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Contemporary approaches ===
Contemporary proponents of hedonism include [[Sweden|Swedish]] philosopher [[Torbjörn Tännsjö]],&lt;ref&gt;Torbjörn Tännsjö; ''Hedonistic Utilitarianism''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Feldman (philosopher)|Fred Feldman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Feldman (philosopher)|Fred Feldman]](2006). ''Pleasure and the Good Life: Concerning the Nature, Varieties, and Plausibility of Hedonism.'' Oxford University Press and (1997). ''Utilitarianism, Hedonism, and Desert: Essays in Moral Philosophy. Cambridge University Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish ethic philosopher [[Esperanza Guisán]] (published a "Hedonist manifesto" in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Manifiesto_hedonista.html?id=75OJV9DAGegC|title=Manifiesto hedonista|website=google.com|isbn=9788476582213|last1=Guisán|first1=Esperanza|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Michel Onfray ====
{{main article|Michel Onfray}}
[[File:Michel Onfray 2009 2.jpg|thumb|Michel Onfray, contemporary hedonist philosopher]]

A dedicated contemporary hedonist philosopher and writer on the history of hedonistic thought is the French [[Michel Onfray]]. He has written two books directly on the subject (''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'invention du plaisir. : Fragments cyrénaïques Le Livre de Poche Biblio: Amazon.es: Michel Onfray: Libros en idiomas extranjeros|work=amazon.es|id= {{ASIN|2253943231|country=es}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''La puissance d'exister : Manifeste hédoniste'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/2290054526/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=479289967&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=2253083976&amp;pf_rd_m=A1X6FK5RDHNB96&amp;pf_rd_r=055JCMT72GK8V673HPSR|title=Manifeste hédoniste: Amazon.fr: Michel Onfray: Livres|website=amazon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines hedonism "as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1421|title=Atheism à la mode|website=newhumanist.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous [[utilitarianism]], and a generalized [[aesthetic]] of sensual [[materialism]] that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent -- while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions."&lt;ref name="wpunj.edu"&gt;[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Ireland40.htm Introductory Note to Onfray by Doug Ireland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427113134/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Ireland40.htm |date=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onfray's works "have explored the philosophical resonances and components of (and challenges to) science, painting, gastronomy, sex and sensuality, bioethics, wine, and writing. His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume Counter-history of Philosophy,"&lt;ref name="wpunj.edu"/&gt; of which three have been published. For him "In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought, hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others; the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other. Obtaining this balance – my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others – presumes that we approach the subject from different angles – political, ethical, aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, pedagogical, historiographical…."

For this he has "written books on each of these facets of the same world view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=39991&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Archives from 1948 - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy aims for "micro-revolutions", or "revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainfos.ca/06/dec/ainfos00234.html|title=A-Infos (en) France, Media, Michel Onfray, A self labeled Anarchist Philosoph|website=ainfos.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abolitionism ====
{{main article|David Pearce (philosopher)}}
[[File:David Pearce (transhumanist).jpg|thumb|David Pearce, transhumanist philosopher]]
The [[Abolitionist Society]] is a [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] group calling for the abolition of [[suffering]] in all sentient life through the use of advanced [[biotechnology]]. Their core philosophy is [[negative utilitarianism]]. [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] is a theorist of this perspective and he believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of [[suffering]] in all [[Sentience|sentient]] life. His book-length internet manifesto ''The Hedonistic Imperative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hedonistic Imperative|url=http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how [[technology|technologies]] such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[neurosurgery]] could potentially [[technological convergence|converge]] to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals, replacing suffering with gradients of well-being, a project he refers to as  "[[paradise engineering]]".&lt;ref name="bodhissatva"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Genomic Bodhisattva |publisher=H+ Magazine |date=2009-09-16 |url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/09/16/genomic-bodhisattva/ |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[transhumanist]] and a [[vegan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |title=Criação animal intensiva. Um outro Holocausto? |publisher=Revista do Instituto Humanitas Unisinos|url=http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3811&amp;secao=359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearce believes that we (or our future posthuman descendants) have a responsibility not only to avoid [[cruelty to animals]] within human society but also to alleviate the suffering of animals in the wild.

In a talk David Pearce gave at the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] and at the [[Charity International]] 'Happiness Conference' he said "Sadly, what ''won't'' abolish suffering, or at least not on its own, is socio-economic reform, or exponential economic growth, or technological progress in the usual sense, or any of the traditional panaceas for solving the world's ills. Improving the external environment is admirable and important; but such improvement can't recalibrate our hedonic treadmill above a genetically constrained ceiling. Twin studies confirm there is a [partially] heritable set-point of well-being - or ill-being - around which we all tend to fluctuate over the course of a lifetime. This set-point varies between individuals. [It's possible to ''lower'' an individual's hedonic set-point by inflicting prolonged uncontrolled stress; but even this re-set is not as easy as it sounds: suicide-rates typically go down in wartime; and six months after a quadriplegia-inducing accident, studies{{Citation needed|reason=Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence|date=November 2016}} suggest that we are typically neither more nor less unhappy than we were before the catastrophic event.] Unfortunately, attempts to build an ideal society can't overcome this biological ceiling, whether utopias of the left or right, free-market or socialist, religious or secular, futuristic high-tech or simply cultivating one's garden. Even if ''everything'' that traditional futurists have asked for is delivered - eternal youth, unlimited material wealth, morphological freedom, superintelligence, immersive VR, molecular nanotechnology, etc - there is no evidence that our subjective quality of life would on average significantly surpass the quality of life of our hunter-gatherer ancestors - or a New Guinea tribesman today - in the absence of reward pathway enrichment. This claim is difficult to prove in the absence of sophisticated neuroscanning; but objective indices of psychological distress e.g. suicide rates, bear it out. ''Un''enhanced humans will still be prey to the spectrum of Darwinian emotions, ranging from terrible suffering to petty disappointments and frustrations - sadness, anxiety, jealousy, existential angst. Their biology is part of "what it means to be human". Subjectively unpleasant states of consciousness exist because they were genetically adaptive. Each of our core emotions had a distinct signalling role in our evolutionary past: they tended to promote behaviours that enhanced the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abolitionist.com/|title=The Abolitionist Project|last=admin@abolitionist.com|website=abolitionist.com|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hedonism as a scientific basis for long-term future forecasting ====

Russian physicist and philosopher Victor Argonov argues that hedonism is not only a philosophical but also a verifiable scientific hypothesis. In 2014 he suggested "postulates of pleasure principle" confirmation of which would lead to a new scientific discipline, hedodynamics. Hedodynamics would be able to forecast the distant future development of human civilization and even the probable structure and psychology of other rational beings within the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=The Pleasure Principle as a Tool for Scientific Forecasting of Human Self-Evolution |journal=Journal of Evolution and Thechnology |volume=24 |year=2014 | pages=63–78 | url=http://jetpress.org/v24/argonov.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to build such a theory, science must discover the neural correlate of pleasure - neurophysiological parameter unambiguously corresponding to the feeling of pleasure (hedonic tone).

According to Argonov, posthumans will be able to reprogram their motivations in an arbitrary manner (to get pleasure from any programmed activity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Artificial programming of human motivations: A way to degradation or rapid development? |journal=Questions of Philosophy (in Russian) |volume=12 |year=2008 | pages=22–37 | url=http://transhumanism-russia.ru/content/view/392/144}}&lt;/ref&gt; And if pleasure principle postulates are true, then general direction of civilization development is obvious: maximization of integral happiness in posthuman life (product of life span and average happiness). Posthumans will avoid constant pleasure stimulation, because it is incompatible with rational behavior required to prolong life. However, in average, they can become much happier than modern humans.

Many other aspects of posthuman society could be predicted by hedodynamics if the neural correlate of pleasure were discovered. For example, optimal number of individuals, their optimal body size (whether it matters for happiness or not) and the degree of aggression.

==Criticisms==
Critics of hedonism have objected to its exclusive concentration on pleasure as valuable.

In particular, [[G. E. Moore]] offered a thought experiment in criticism of pleasure as the sole bearer of value: he imagined two worlds—one of exceeding beauty and the other a heap of filth. Neither of these worlds will be experienced by anyone. The question, then, is if it is better for the beautiful world to exist than the heap of filth. In this Moore implied that states of affairs have value beyond conscious pleasure, which he said spoke against the validity of hedonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hedonism/#SH3c%7ctitle=Hedonism%7cwork=utm.edu%7ctitle=Hedonism%7cwork=utm.edu|title=Hedonism|website=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic criticisms===
In [[Islam]], God admonished mankind not to love the worldly pleasures, since they are related with greed and sources of sinful habits. He also threatened those who prefer worldly life rather than hereafter with [[Hell]]. Few Muslim scholars believe that God doesn't ask for the renunciation of all pleasure, but rather for the deliverance of corresponding responsibilities which come with pleasure.

{{blockquote|''Those who choose the worldly life and its pleasures will be given proper recompense for their deeds in this life and will not suffer any loss. Such people will receive nothing in the next life except Hell fire. Their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and their efforts will be in vain.''|[http://almubin.tripod.com/mdsarwar.htm Quran 11:15-16, (Muhammad Sarwar translation)]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.islamkingdom.com/en/quran-translation/sarwar/hood/15 Quran chapter 11:15, translated by Muhammad Sarwar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.islamkingdom.com/en/quran-translation/sarwar/hood/16 Quran chapter 11:16, translated by Muhammad Sarwar]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14060">'''Informatization''' or '''informatisation''' refers to the extent by which a geographical area, an economy or a society is becoming information-based, i.e. the increase in size of its information labor force. Usage of the term was inspired by [[Marc Porat]]’s categories of ages of human civilization: the Agricultural Age, the Industrial Age and the Information Age (1978). Informatization is to the Information Age what industrialization was to the Industrial Age. It has been stated that:

:The Agricultural Age has brought about the agriculturization of the planet. The Industrial Age has caused among other things the industrialization of agriculture. The Information Age has resulted to the informatization of the agricultural industry (Flor, 1993).

The term has mostly been used within the context of national development. [[Everett Rogers]] ([[#Rogers2000|2000]]) defines informatization as the process through which new communication technologies are used as a means for furthering development as a nation becomes more and more an [[information society]]. However, some observers, such as Alexander Flor ([[#Flor1986|1986]]) have cautioned about the negative impact of informatization on traditional societies.

Recently, the [[technological determinism]] dimension has been highlighted in informatization. [[Randy Kluver]] of Texas A&amp;M University defines informatization as the process primarily by which information technologies, such as the World Wide Web and other communication technologies, have transformed economic and social relations to such an extent that cultural and economic barriers are minimized. Kluver expands the concept to encompass the civic and cultural arenas. He believes that it is a process whereby information and communication technologies shape cultural and civic discourse.

[[G. Wang]] describes the same phenomenon (1994) which she calls "informatization" as a "process" of change that features (a) the use of informatization and IT (information technologies) to such an extent that they become the dominant forces in commanding economic, political, social and cultural development; and (b) unprecedented growth in the speed, quantity, and popularity of information production and distribution."

==Origin of the term==
The term informatisation was coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in their publication ''L'Informatisation de la société: Rapport à M. le Président de la République''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=L'informatisation de la société|journal=La Documentation française|date=1978|pages=901|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/154000252/index.shtml|accessdate=23 February 2016|ref=nora-minc|isbn=2020049740}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated in English in 1980 as ''The Computerization of Society: A report to the President of France''.&lt;ref name="nora-minc-en"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nora|first1=Simon|last2=Minc|first2=Alain|title=The computerization of society : a report to the President of France0-262-64020-1|date=1981|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262640201|pages=208|edition=2. pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]) However, in an article published in 1987 Minc preferred to use informatisation and not [[Digital Revolution|computerization]].

After the 1978 publication the concept was adopted in French, German and English subject literatures and was broadened to include more aspects than only computers and [[telecommunication]]s ([[#SAOUG|SAOUG]]).

==Social impact of informatization==
Informatization has many far-reaching consequences in society. Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) observes that these include repercussions in economics, politics and other aspects of modern living. In the economic sphere, for example, information is viewed as a focal resource for development, replacing the centrality of labor and capital during the industrial age. In the political arena, there are increased opportunities for participative democracy with the advent of [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) that provide easy access to information on varied social and political issues.

==Informatization in economic systems==
[[Industrialization]] propelled transformation of the economic system from agricultural age to modernized economies, and so informatization ushered the industrial age into an information-rich economy. Unlike the agricultural and industrial ages where economics refers to optimization of scarce resources, the information age deals with maximization of abundant resources. Alexander Flor ([[#Flor2008|2008]]) wrote that informatization gives rise to information-based economies and societies wherein information naturally becomes a dominant commodity or resource. The accumulation and efficient use of knowledge has played a central role in the transformation of the economy ([[#Linden2004|Linden 2004]]).

==Globalization and informatization==
Over the years, [[globalization]] and informatization have "redefined industries, politics, cultures, and perhaps the underlying rules of social order" ([[#Friedman|Friedman 1999]]). Although they explain different phenomena, their social, political, economic, and cultural functions remarkably overlaps. "Although globalization ultimately refers to the integration of economic institutions, much of this integration occurs through the channels of technology. Although international trade is not a new phenomenon, the advent of communications technologies has accelerated the pace and scope of trade" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::a) Globalization and Informatization will have great impact on cultural and social consequences of society.

::b) "Globalization and informatization are likely to diminish the concept of the national as a political institution" ([[#Poster|Poster 1999]]). Friedman ([[#Friedman|1999]]) argues that as nation states decline in importance, [[multi-national corporation]]s, [[nongovernmental organizations]], and "superempowered individuals" such as [[George Soros]] gain influence and importance. As these non-political organizations and institutions gain importance, there are inevitable challenges to political, economic, and cultural processes.

::c) On the other hand, globalization and informatization allow for efficient flow of information.  Individuals and societies are, therefore, greatly empowered to engage in international arena for economic, political, and cultural resources.

::d) "There is proliferation of information about lifestyles, religions, and cultural issues.  The telecommunications and computer networks also allow for unprecedented global activism.  This democratization of information increases the potential for international harmony, although it by no means guarantees it" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

::e) These twin forces greatly affects "centuries of tradition, local autonomy, and cultural integrity."

::f) "Finally, one of the potentially most devastating impact of the forces of globalization and informatization is that there is created an insidious conflict between the new global economic order and the local, or even tribal, interests" ([[#Kluver2008|Kluver]]).

==Measurement of informatization==
Kim ([[#Kim2004|2004]]) proposed to measure the informatization in a country using a composite measure made up of the following extraneous variables: Education, R&amp;D Expenditure, Agricultural Sector and [[Intellectual Property]]. Kim also relates increasing democracy as evidence of social informatization.  It supposedly take into consideration the three approaches to conceptualizing informatization namely the economic, technological, and stock. Each can be measured with economic data (e.g. GDP), ICT data (e.g. number of computers per population), and amount of information (e.g. number of published technological journals) respectively.

Such composite measure is similar to the [[World Bank]]'s Knowledge Assessment Methodology (KAM) Variables ([[#Worldbank1|2008]]) which are clustered into: overall performance of the economy, economic incentive and institutional regime, innovation system, education and human resources, and information and communication technology.

==The Problem of Measuring Informatization==
The measurement for the level of informatization is an ongoing area of development. Among the issues are the ambiguity of the definition of “information” and whether this entity can be quantifiable in contrast to the tangible products of industrialization.

Taylor and Zang ([[#TaylorAndZang2007|2007]]) explored the issues behind the limitations of current theoretical models in terms of quantifying the positive impacts of ICT projects, and provided critiques of the information indicators used to gauge and justify informatization projects.

International organizations such as the United Nations, through its World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also recognize this challenge and have initiated efforts to improve the methodologies for measuring an “information society”.

==National laws on informatization==
Informatization is recognized by states as important to national development. Some states have created laws implementing or regulating informatization.

In [[Russia]] the State [[Duma]] enacted the ''Federal Law on Information, Informatization, and the Protection of Information'' on January 25, 1995. It was signed into law by President Boris Yeltsin on February 20, 1995.

[[Azerbaijan]] had a ''Law on Information, Informatization and Protection of Information'' in 1998.

'''International human rights law''' ('''IHRL''') is the body of [[international law]] designed to promote [[human rights]] on social, regional, and domestic levels. As a form of international law, international human rights law are primarily made up of [[treaties]], agreements between [[sovereign states]] intended to have binding legal effect between the parties that have agreed to them; and [[customary international law]]. Other [[international human rights instruments]], while not legally binding, contribute to the implementation, understanding and development of international human rights law and have been recognized as a source of ''political'' obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Human rights, A very short introduction  replace this with a better reference later&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between international human rights law and [[international humanitarian law]] is disputed among international law scholars. This discussion forms part of a larger discussion on fragmentation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law? Postmodern Anxieties|journal=Leiden Journal of International Law|date=September 2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=553–579|doi=10.1017/S0922156502000262|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156502000262|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pluralist scholars conceive international human rights law as being distinct from international humanitarian law, proponents of the constitutionalist approach regard the latter as a subset of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yun|first1=Seira|title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law – The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|date=2014|volume=5|issue=1-2|pages=213–257|ssrn=2556825|accessdate=|doi=10.1163/18781527-00501008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nutshell, those who favors separate, self-contained regimes emphasize the differences in applicability; international humanitarian law applies only during armed conflict. 

On the other hand, a more systemic perspective explains that international humanitarian law represents a function of international human rights law; it includes general norms that apply to everyone at all time as well as specialized norms which apply to certain situations such as armed conflict between both state and military occupation (i.e. IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (e.g. the [[1951 Refugee Convention]]), children (the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]), and prisoners of war (the 1949 [[Third Geneva Convention]]).

== United Nations system ==
The [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] adopted the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] in 1993, in terms of which the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] was established.

In 2006, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] was replaced with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] for the enforcement of international human rights law.

== International Bill of Human Rights ==

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) is a UN General Assembly declaration that does not in form create binding international human rights law. Many legal scholars cite the UDHR as evidence of customary international law.

More broadly, the UDHR has become an authoritative human rights reference. It has provided the basis for subsequent [[international human rights instruments]] that form non-binding, but ultimately authoritative international human rights law.

== International human rights treaties ==
{{Main|International human rights instruments}}
Besides the adoption in 1966 of the two wide-ranging Covenants that form part of the [[International Bill of Human Rights]] (namely the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]), other treaties have been adopted at the international level. These are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant include the following:

* the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] ('''CPCG''') (adopted 1948 and entered into force in 1951);
* the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] ('''CSR''') (adopted in 1951 and entered into force in 1954);
* the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted in 1965 and entered into force in 1969);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm |title=OHCHR |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530072459/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm |archivedate=30 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (entered into force in 1981);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/index.html |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted in 1984 and entered into force in 1987);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm |title=OHCHR |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=9 March 2008 |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309145458/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm |archivedate=9 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted in 1989 and entered into force in 1990);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/crc |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families]] ('''ICRMW''') (adopted in 1990 and entered into force in 2003);
* the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] ('''CRPD''') (entered into force on 3 May 2008);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml |title=Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities |publisher=United Nations  |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] ('''ICPPED''') (adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2010).

== Regional protection and institutions ==
Regional systems of international human rights law supplement and complement national and international human rights law by protecting and promoting human rights in specific areas of the world. There are three key regional human rights instruments which have established human rights law on a regional basis:

* the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] for Africa of 1981, in force since 1986;
* the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] for the Americas of 1969, in force since 1978; and
* the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] for Europe of 1950, in force since 1953.

=== Americas and Europe ===
The [[Organisation of American States]] and the [[Council of Europe]], like the UN, have adopted treaties (albeit with weaker implementation mechanisms) containing catalogues of [[economic, social and cultural rights]], in addition to the aforementioned conventions dealing mostly with [[civil and political rights]]:

* the [[European Social Charter]] for Europe of 1961, in force since 1965 (whose complaints mechanism, created in 1995 under an Additional Protocol, has been in force since 1998); and
* the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional protocols|Protocol of San Salvador]] to the ACHR for the Americas of 1988, in force since 1999.

===Africa ===
{{Main|Human rights in Africa}}
The [[African Union]] (AU) is a supranational union consisting of 53 African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm |title=AU Member States |publisher=African Union |accessdate=3 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105082457/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm |archivedate=5 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, the AU's purpose is to help secure Africa's democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, in particular by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|title=AU in a Nutshell|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] is the region's principal human rights instrument. It emerged under the aegis of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) (since replaced by the [[African Union]]). The intention to draw up the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was announced in 1979. The Charter was unanimously approved at the OAU's 1981 Assembly.

Pursuant to Article 63 (whereby it was to "come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority" of the OAU's member states), the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights came into effect on 21 October 1986, in honour of which 21 October was declared [[African Human Rights Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the [[African Union]], tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples') rights throughout the African continent, as well as with interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. The Commission has three broad areas of responsibility:&lt;ref name=mandate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|title=Mandate of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# promoting human and peoples' rights;
# protecting human and peoples' rights; and
# interpreting the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].

In pursuit of these goals, the Commission is mandated to "collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples' rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments."&lt;ref name=mandate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the creation of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the Commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|title=Protocol to the African Charter on human and peoples' rights on the establishment of an African court on human and peoples' rights|accessdate=3 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302212249/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice.

The [[African Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the African Union]] is intended to be the "principal judicial organ of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union, Article 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Treaties_%20Conventions_%20Protocols/Protocol%20to%20the%20African%20Court%20of%20Justice%20-%20Maputo.pdf|title=Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union|publisher=African Union|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has not yet been established, it is intended to take over the duties of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, as well as to act as the supreme court of the African Union, interpreting all necessary laws and treaties. The Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights entered into force in January 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/alfresco_asset/dc501e2c-a5f9-11dc-bc7d-3fb9ac69fcbb/ior630082004en.pdf|title=Open Letter to the Chairman of the African Union (AU) seeking clarifications and assurances that the Establishment of an effective African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights will not be delayed or undermined|publisher=Amnesty International|date=5 August 2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its merging with the Court of Justice has delayed its establishment. The Protocol establishing the Court of Justice will come into force when ratified by fifteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=African International Courts and Tribunals|url=http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_conti/acj/acj_home.html|title=African Court of Justice|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many countries in Africa accused of human rights violations by the international community and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/doc/?t=africa|title=Human Rights Watch Africa|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inter-American system ===
{{See also|Human rights in North America|Human rights in South America}}
The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, DC. Its members are the thirty-five independent nation-states of the Americas.

Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in Latin America,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and the thrust toward [[globalisation]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/key_issues/eng/default.asp|title=OAS Key Issues|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* strengthening democracy;
* working for peace;
* protecting human rights;
* combating corruption;
* the rights of indigenous peoples; and
* promoting sustainable development.

The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) is an autonomous organ of the [[Organization of American States]], also based in Washington, D.C. Along with the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/biographies.asp?group=hhrr|publisher=Organization of American States|title=Directory of OAS Authorities|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere. Its human rights duties stem from three documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/what.htm|title=What is the IACHR?|publisher=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the [[Charter of the Organization of American States|OAS Charter]];
# the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]]; and
# the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are therefore adjudicatory and advisory:

* Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it.
* Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?CFID=25331&amp;CFTOKEN=36922058|title=Inter-American Court on Human Rights homepage|publisher=Inter-American Court on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries in the Americas, including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} have been accused of human rights violations.

=== European system ===
{{Main|Human rights in Europe}}
The [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for European integration. It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law, and has observer status at the United Nations. The seat of the Council is in [[Strasbourg]] in France.

The Council of Europe is responsible for both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Gender and reproductive rights home page |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, although strict, is more lenient than that of the UN Charter on human rights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The Council also promotes the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Human_Rights/Esc/|title=Social Charter|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all European states which seek [[European integration]], accept the principle of the [[rule of law]], and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and [[freedom (political)|freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109045152/http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/|archivedate=9 January 2008|title=The Council of Europe in Brief|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe is separate from the [[European Union]], but the latter is expected to accede to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The Council includes all the member states of European Union. The EU also has a separate human rights document, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/actualite/2006/04/11conseil_europe/english_mod.pdf|title=Council of Europe – European Union: "A sole ambition for the European Continent"|author=Juncker, Jean-Claude|date=11 April 2006|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=4 January 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.&lt;ref name=EUCourt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/The+Court/The+Court/History+of+the+Court/ |title=Historical Background to the European Court of Human Rights |publisher=European Court of Human Rights |accessdate=4 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222001646/http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/The%20Court/The%20Court/History%20of%20the%20Court/ |archivedate=22 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All 47 member states of the Council of Europe have signed this Convention, and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.&lt;ref name=EUCourt/&gt; In order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment,&lt;ref&gt;Article 3 of the Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture|publisher=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe also adopted the [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] in May 2005, for protection against [[human trafficking]] and [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]], the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] in October 2007, and the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] in May 2011.

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] is the only international court with jurisdiction to deal with cases brought by individuals rather than states.&lt;ref name=EUCourt/&gt; In early 2010, the court had a backlog of over 120,000 cases and a multi-year waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2008_spr/roucounas.htm |title=Virginia Law |publisher=Law.virginia.edu |date=24 March 2008|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] article [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/4789300.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/Push_for_reform_of_backlogged_rights_court.html?cid=8314824 |title=Swiss info article|publisher=Swissinfo.ch |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one out of every twenty cases submitted to the court is considered admissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/11/european-court-of-human-rights |title=The Guardian|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the court issued 1,503 verdicts. At the current rate of proceedings, it would take 46 years for the backlog to clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2008/0123/world/human-rights-cases-have-46-year-backlog-in-eu-345706.html |title=Breaking news, Ireland |publisher=Breakingnews.ie |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monitoring, implementation and enforcement ==
There is currently no international court to administer international human rights law, but quasi-judicial bodies exist under some UN treaties (like the [[Human Rights Committee]] under the ICCPR). The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) has jurisdiction over the crime of [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] enforce regional human rights law.

Although these same international bodies also hold jurisdiction over cases regarding international humanitarian law, it is crucial to recognise, as discussed above, that the two frameworks constitute different legal regimes.&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on IHL"&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations human rights bodies do have some quasi-legal enforcement mechanisms. These include the treaty bodies attached to the seven currently active treaties, and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] complaints procedures, with [[Universal Periodic Review]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] (known as the 1235 and 1503 mechanisms respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = OHCHR
|title = Human Rights Council Complaint Procedure
|url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/complaints.htm
|accessdate = 6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enforcement of international human rights law is the responsibility of the [[nation state]]; it is the primary responsibility of the State to make the human rights of its citizens a reality.

In practice, many human rights are difficult to enforce legally, due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;See, REDRESS, [http://www.redress.org/downloads/publications/master_enforcement%2030%20May%202006.pdf Enforcement of Awards for Victims of Torture and Other International Crimes] May, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In over 110 countries, [[national human rights institutions]] (NHRIs) have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhri.net/ National Human Rights Institutions Forum] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915131117/http://www.nhri.net/ |date=15 September 2002 }} is the official portal for the National Human Rights Institutions and show a list of 119 institutions that can be found at [http://www.nhri.net/nationaldatalist.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhri.net/2007/List_Accredited_NIs_Nov_2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chart of the Status of National Institutions|publisher=National Human Rights Institutions Forum|quote=ACCREDITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS&lt;br&gt;In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the following classifications for accreditation are used by the ICC: A: Compliance with the Paris Principles;&lt;br&gt;A(R): Accreditation with reserve – granted where insufficient documentation is submitted to confer A status;&lt;br&gt;B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination;&lt;br&gt;C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles.|date=November 2007|accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number and effect of these institutions is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huridocs.org/ HURIDOCS] has developed extensive methodologies for monitoring and documenting human rights violations, and more resources can be found at [http://www.huridocs.org/research-development/ Human Rights Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Principles]] were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris from 7 to 9 October 1991, and adopted by UN Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for [[national human rights institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Human Rights Institutions – Implementing Human Rights", Executive Director Morten Kjærum, The Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal jurisdiction ===
{{Main|universal jurisdiction}}
[[Universal jurisdiction]] is a controversial principle in international law, whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over people whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence or any other relationship to the prosecuting country. The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorised to punish. The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]''.

In 1993, [[Belgium]] passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries. In 1998, [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] under the universal-jurisdiction principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is supported by [[Amnesty International]] and other [[List of human rights organisations|human rights organisations]], which believe that certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole, and that the community has a moral duty to act.

Others, like [[Henry Kissinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger has himself been subject to calls for prosecution under universal jurisdiction. See Hitchens, Christopher, and David Rieff. "[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/pinochet-milosevic-henry-kissinger-christopher-hitchens/]." ''Prospect'', 28 June 2001 (accessed 11 June 2013); Hitchens, Christopher. ''The Trial of Henry Kissinger''. London: Verso, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that "widespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of the proper role of international courts. Universal jurisdiction risks creating universal tyranny—that of judges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitfall of Universal Jurisdiction|journal=Foreign Affairs|author=Kissinger, Henry|date=July–August 2001|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114024521/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaal or {{IAST|Kāla}}''' ({{lang-sa|काल}} {{IPA-sa|kɑːˈlə|}}; {{lang-ta|காலம்}}{{IPA audio link|Ta-காலம்.ogg}} '''kaalam'''  or '''kaala''') is a word used in [[Sanskrit]] to mean "[[time]]".&lt;ref name="Dalal2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=19 December 2012|date=5 October 2011|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=185–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil word ''kaalam'' refers to duration (an interval) in time.{{fact|date=April 2018}} It is also the name of a deity, in which sense it is not always distinguishable from ''{{IAST|kāla}}'', meaning "black".  It is often used as one of the various names or forms of [[Yama]]. Kaal/Kaala is also referred to the concept of [[Spacetime]]. In the Yogic System the concept of SpaceTime was referred to as one word rather than two separate concepts of Space (darkness) and Time.

==Etymology==

[[Monier-Williams]]'s widely used Sanskrit-English dictionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/ Sanskrit and Tamil Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; lists two distinct words with the form ''{{IAST|kāla}}''.

* ''{{IAST|kāla}}'' 1 means "black, of a dark colour, dark-blue ..." and has a feminine form ending in ''{{IAST|ī}}'' – ''{{IAST|kālī}}'' – as mentioned in {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} 4-1, 42. 
* ''{{IAST|kāla}}'' 2 means "a fixed or right point of time, a space of time, time ... destiny, fate ... death" and has a feminine form (found at the end of compounds) ending in ''{{IAST|ā}}'', as mentioned in the ''{{IAST|ṛgveda}}'' ''{{IAST|Prātiśākhya}}''. As a [[Hindu units of measurement|traditional Hindu unit of time]], one ''kālá'' corresponds to 144 seconds.

According to Monier-Williams, ''{{IAST|kāla}}'' 2 is from the verbal root ''{{IAST|kal}}''  "to calculate", while the root of ''{{IAST|kāla}}'' 1 is uncertain, though possibly the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/ Sanskrit and Tamil Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a deity==

As applied to gods and goddesses in works such as the ''{{IAST|Devī}}'' ''{{IAST|Māhātmya}}'' and the ''Skanda'' ''{{IAST|Purāṇa}}'', ''{{IAST|kāla}}'' 1 and ''{{IAST|kāla}}'' 2 are not readily distinguishable. {{IAST|Swāmī}} {{IAST|Jagadīśvarānanda}}, a Hindu translator of the ''{{IAST|Devī}}'' ''{{IAST|Māhātmya}}'', renders the feminine compound ''{{IAST|kāla-rātri}}'' (where ''{{IAST|rātri}}'' means "night") as "dark night of periodic dissolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Jagadīśvarānanda}} trans; ''Devi Mahatmyam'' (Sanskrit and English); Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, 1953; chapter 1 verse 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Time personified]], destroying all things, Kala is a god of [[death]] sometimes identified with [[Yama]].

=== In the epics and the Puranas ===
Kala appears as an impersonal deity within the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Ramayana]], and the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. In the Mahabharata, [[Krishna]], one of the main characters, reveals his identity as Time personified. He states to [[Arjuna]] that both sides on the battlefield of the [[Kurukshetra War]] have already been annihilated. At the end of the epic, the entire [[Yadu]] dynasty (Krishna's family) is similarly annihilated. The story ends with [[Yudhishthira]], the last of the [[Pandava]] brothers, entering Heaven in his human form, thereby closing the link. In Heaven, Yudi sees everyone within the story, both people whom he hated, and people whom he loved, and is happy to see them all. He then sees their transcendent cosmic forms, Krishna as Vishnu, [[Draupadi]] as [[uma (goddess)|uma]], and realizes that the participants in the play were merely gods in human form, engaging in pastimes and working out their karma. Yudi then abandons his bitterness and spends the rest of eternity in Heaven, it is a happy ending.

Kala appears in the [[Uttara Kanda]] of the Ramayana, as the messenger of Death (Yama). At the end of the story, Time, in the form of inevitability or necessity, informs [[Rama]] that his reign on Earth is now over. By a trick or dilemma, he forces the death of [[Lakshmana]], and informs Rama that he must return to the realm of the gods. Lakshmana willingly passes away with Rama's blessing and Rama returns to Heaven.

Time appears in the Bhagavata Purana as the force that is responsible for the imperceptible and inevitable change in the entire creation. According to the Purana, all created things are illusory, and thereby subject to creation and annihilation, this imperceptible and inconceivable impermanence is said to be due to the march of Time. Similarly, Time is considered to be the unmanifest aspect of God that remains after the destruction of the entire world at the end of a lifespan of [[Brahma]].

In the [[Chaitanya Bhagavata]], a [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavist]] text and biography of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], it is said that the fire that emerges from the mouth of [[Balarama|Sankarshana]] at the End of Time is the ''Kālānala'', or "fire of Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chaitanya-Bhagavata|last=Thakura|first=Vrndavana Dasa|publisher=|others=Translated by Sarvabhavana Dasa|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=203|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the names of Sankarshana is ''k''ā''l''ā''gni'', also "fire of Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/thousand_names_of_lord_balarama.htm|title=A Thousand Names of Lord Balarama|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|note=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana]] also states that Time (kala) is one of the four primary forms of Vishnu, the others being matter ([[Pradhana]]), visible substance (vyakta), and Spirit ([[Purusha]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vishńu Puráńa: A System of Hindu Mythology and Tradition|last=Wilson|first=Horace H.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=|pages=ix|chapter=Preface|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Avatāra and Divinity of Chaitanya|last=Roy|first=Janmajit|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|year=2002|isbn=|location=New Dehli|pages=66|chapter=Signs and Symptoms of Avatārahood|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Bhagavad Gita===
At [[Bhagavad Gita]] 11.32, [[Krishna]] takes on the form of ''kāla'', the destroyer, announcing to Arjuna that all the warriors on both sides will be killed, apart from the Pandavas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''कालो ऽस्मि''' लोकक्षयकृत् प्रवृद्धो लोकान् समाहर्तुम् इह प्रवृत्तः ।
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This verse means: "'''Time (kāla) I am''', the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people."&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-11-32/ text and translation]&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase is famous for being quoted by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] as he reflected on the [[Manhattan Project]]'s explosion of the first nuclear bomb in 1945.

===In other cultures===

In Javanese mythology, [[Batara Kala]] is the god of destruction.  It is a very huge mighty and powerful god depicted as [[giant (mythology)|giant]], born of the sperm of [[Shiva]], the kings of gods.

In [[Borobudur]], the gate to the stairs is adorned with a giant head, making the gate look like the open mouth of the giant. Many other gates in Javanese traditional buildings have this kind of ornament. Perhaps the most detailed Kala Face in Java is on the south side of [[Candi Kalasan]].

A '''legal doctrine''' is a framework, set of rules, procedural steps, or test, often established through [[precedent]] in the [[common law]], through which judgments can be determined in a given legal case. A doctrine comes about when a judge makes a ruling where a process is outlined and applied, and allows for it to be equally applied to like cases. When enough judges make use of the process, soon enough{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2017}} it becomes established as the ''[[de facto]]'' method of deciding like situations.

==Examples==

Her [[column (newspaper)|column]], formerly printed twice weekly in [[Fairfax Media]] newspapers ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', now appears in the News Limited newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', Melbourne's ''[[Sunday Herald Sun]]'' and Perth's ''[[Sunday Times]]''. She hosted ''The Miranda Devine Show'', a weekly syndicated radio show on Sydney station [[2GB]]. The show ended in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/miranda-devine-leaves-radio-2gb-341462|title=Miranda Devine pulls plug on Sunday night’s Radio 2GB ‘The Miranda Devine Show’|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=22 January 2016|publisher=Mumbrella|first=Nic|last=Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and career==
Devine is the daughter of journalist [[Frank Devine]]. She and her two younger sisters spent considerable parts of their youth overseas while their father was working as a foreign correspondent for Australian newspapers and, later, edited various American newspapers. While living in Tokyo, Devine attended an American [[International School]] and learned to speak Japanese fluently.&lt;ref name="BulletinBagnall"/&gt; A devout [[Roman Catholic]], she completed her high school education at [[Loreto Kirribilli]], a Catholic girls' private school in Sydney. After school, she completed a BSc in mathematics at [[Macquarie University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the [[CSIRO]] in their textile physics division, where she worked for four years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  She then completed a one-year graduate program at the Medill School of Journalism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/msj/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} 

On 6 August 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' announced that Devine would be returning as a columnist for both ''The Daily Telegraph'' and ''Sunday Telegraph''.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt;

She describes herself as "a Catholic and a mother".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/too-many-enemies-are-basking-in-george-pells-situation/news-story/7cb21419b9031dfb9d16a53797329944 Too many enemies are basking in George Pell’s situation], ''Daily Telegraph'', 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
=== White genocide ===
Devine has been accused by media of promoting the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] and described as pivotal in popularising the concept within Australian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/mar/22/white-australians-debate-fast-track-visas-afrikane/ |title=White Australians debate fast-track visas for Afrikaners fleeing land reform |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Amsterdam News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-03-22-aussie-minister-dutton-the-next-prime-minister-or-the-great-divider |title=Aussie Minister Dutton the next prime minister, or the great divider? |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |url=

== Commentary and controversy ==
Devine is a friend of fellow conservative columnist [[Tim Blair]], who said of her, "She's got good antennae. She can read people which is why she accurately predicts election results".&lt;ref name="BulletinBagnall"/&gt; When interviewed for an April 2007 article in ''[[The Australian]]'' about [[hate mail]] received by female columnists, Devine commented, "You are contesting ideas and you have to do it in a [[Polarization (politics)|polarising]] way. When you write a column, you can't sit on the fence".&lt;ref name="HateMail"/&gt;

In their book ''[[Silencing Dissent]]'' ([[Allen &amp; Unwin]]), [[Clive Hamilton]] and [[Sarah Maddison]] accuse Devine of belonging to a "syndicate of right-wing commentators who receive favour from the [[John Howard|Howard]] Government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21144760-7583,00.html "How a right-wing, pro-Howard cabal is stifling debate"], an excerpt from ''[[Silencing Dissent]]'', printed in ''[[The Australian]]'' on 31 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Devine used the news of Australian federal government minister [[Penny Wong]]'s decision to parent a child with her female partner as the basis of a column in which she argued that the [[2011 England riots|2011 riots in England]] were the result of a "fatherless society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devine |first=Miranda |title=The Problems of a Fatherless Society |url=http://blogs.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/mirandadevine/index.php/dailytelegraph/comments/its_a_myth_conception |accessdate=14 August 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deveny |first=Catherine |authorlink=Catherine Deveny |date=17 August 2011 |title=Why equal rights activists need Miranda Devine more than rallies |work=The Drum |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2842140.html |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Devine sparked considerable controversy after claiming that "women abusing welfare" were the main cause of [[domestic violence]]. According to Devine, "If you want to break the cycle of violence, end the welfare incentive for unsuitable women to keep having children to a string of feckless men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Noyes |url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/miranda-devine-column-prompts-domestic-violence-survivors-to-share-unsuitablewomen-stories-20150928-gjw8ua.html |title=Miranda Devine column prompts domestic violence survivors to share #UnsuitableWomen stories |newspaper=The Vine |date=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, she wrote that share bicycle schemes were a terror threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/city-share-bikes-are-a-terrorists-best-friend/news-story/e193af2dd3b08458e2a4ba8442a847e9 City share bikes are a terrorist’s best friend], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]], 28 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Devine advocated for the continuation of [[Fossil fuel power station#Coal|coal-fired electricity]] options; she has repeatedly [[Climate change denial|suggested]] that [[climate change]] is a political conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/...a.../b7eda462757d6e9ed4e91c8e6541b98b Smart meters energy crisis not reducing bills or...], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]], 7 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern Times''' is a 1936 American comedy film written and directed by [[Charlie Chaplin]] in which his iconic [[The Tramp|Little Tramp]] character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and financial conditions many people faced during the [[Great Depression]], conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization. The movie stars Chaplin, [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Henry Bergman]], [[Tiny Sandford]] and [[Chester Conklin]].

''Modern Times'' was deemed "culturally significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] in 1989, and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Fourteen years later, it was screened "out of competition" at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4075172/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Modern Times |accessdate=November 8, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Chaplin - Modern Times.jpg|thumb|right|The Tramp working on the giant machine in the film's most famous scene]]
[[File:Charlie Chaplin.jpg|thumb|269x269px|&lt;center&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/center&gt;]]
''Modern Times'' portrays Chaplin in his [[The Tramp|Tramp]] persona as a factory worker employed on an [[assembly line]]. There, he is subjected to such indignities as being force-fed by a malfunctioning "feeding machine" and an accelerating assembly line where he screws nuts at an ever-increasing rate onto pieces of machinery. He finally suffers a nervous breakdown and runs amok, throwing the factory into chaos. He is sent to a hospital. Following his recovery, the now unemployed factory worker is mistakenly arrested as an instigator in a [[Communist]] demonstration. In jail, he accidentally ingests smuggled [[cocaine]], mistaking it for salt. In his subsequent delirium, he avoids being put back in his cell. When he returns, he stumbles upon a jailbreak and knocks the convicts unconscious. He is hailed as a hero and given special treatment. When he is informed that he will soon be released due to his heroic actions, he argues unsuccessfully that he prefers it in jail.

Outside of jail, he applies for a new job but leaves after causing an accident. He runs into a recently orphaned girl, Ellen ([[Paulette Goddard]]), who is fleeing the police after stealing a loaf of bread. Determined to go back to jail and to save the girl, he tells police that he is the thief and ought to be arrested. A witness reveals his deception and he is freed. To get arrested again, he eats an enormous amount of food at a [[cafeteria]] without paying. He meets up with Ellen in a [[paddy wagon]], which crashes, and she convinces him to escape with her. Dreaming of a better life, he gets a job as a night watchman at a department store, sneaks Ellen into the store, and encounters three burglars: one of whom is "Big Bill", a fellow worker from the factory at the beginning of the film, who explains that they are hungry and desperate. After sharing drinks with them, he wakes up the next morning during opening hours and is arrested once more.

Ten days later, Ellen takes him to a new home – a run-down shack that she admits "isn't [[Buckingham Palace]]" but will do. The next morning, the factory worker reads about an old factory re-opening and lands a job there as a mechanic's assistant. His boss accidentally falls into the machinery, but the worker manages to extricate him. The other workers suddenly decide to go on strike. Outside, the worker accidentally launches a brick at a policeman and is arrested again.

Two weeks later, he is released and learns that Ellen is a café dancer. She gets him a job as a singer and waiter, where he goes about his duties rather clumsily. During his floor show, he loses his cuffs, which bear the lyrics to his song, but he rescues the act by improvising the lyrics using gibberish from multiple languages, plus some [[pantomime|pantomiming]]. His act proves a hit. When police arrive to arrest Ellen for her earlier escape, the two flee again. Ellen despairs that there's no point to their struggling, but the factory worker assures her that they'll make it somehow. At a bright dawn, they walk down the road towards an uncertain but hopeful future.

==Production==
[[File:Goddard-Modern-Times.jpg|thumb|231x231px|Paulette Goddard, the heroine of ''Modern Times'']]
During a European tour promoting ''[[City Lights]]'', Chaplin got the inspiration for ''Modern Times'' from both the lamentable conditions of the continent through the [[Great Depression]], along with a conversation with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in which they discussed modern technology. Chaplin did not understand why Gandhi generally opposed it, though he granted that "machinery with only consideration of profit" had put people out of work and ruined lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chaplin in the Sound Era: An Analysis of the Seven Talkies |chapter=3. Modern Times |first=Eric L. |last=Flom |publisher=McFarland |year=1997 |ISBN=9780786403257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first "talkie", and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects and sparse dialogue. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of his "Little Tramp" character would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen. Most of the film was shot at "silent speed", 18 frames per second, which when projected at "sound speed", 24 frames per second, made the slapstick action appear even more frenetic. The duration of filming was long for the time, beginning on October 11, 1934, and ending on August 30, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;As said in ''Chaplin Today: Modern Times'', a 2003 French documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference to drugs seen in the prison sequence is somewhat daring for the time (since the [[production code]], established in 1930, forbade the depiction of illegal drug use in films); Chaplin had made drug references before in one of his most famous short films, ''[[Easy Street (film)|Easy Street]]'', released in 1917.

==Music==
According to the official documents, the music score was composed by Chaplin himself, and arranged with the assistance of [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who had collaborated with Chaplin on the music score of his previous film [[City Lights]].  Newman and Chaplin had a falling out near the end of the Modern Times soundtrack recording sessions, leading to Newman's angry departure.  

The romance theme was later given lyrics, and became the pop standard "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]", first recorded by [[Nat King Cole]].

''Modern Times'' was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard as he performs [[Léo Daniderff]]'s comical song ''Je cherche après Titine''. Chaplin's version is also known as ''The Nonsense Song'', as his character sings it in [[gibberish]]. The lyrics are nonsensical but appear to contain words from French and Italian; the use of deliberately half-intelligible wording for comic effect points the way towards Adenoid Hynkel's speeches in ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.

According to film composer [[David Raksin]], he wrote the music as a young man wanting to make a name for himself. Chaplin would sit, often in the washroom, humming tunes and telling Raksin to "take this down". Raksin's job was to turn the humming into a score and create timings and synchronization that fit the situations. Chaplin was a violinist and had some musical knowledge, but he was not an orchestrator and was unfamiliar with synchronization. Raksin later created scores for such films as ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' and ''[[The Day After]]''.

==Reception==
[[Image:Grand Op Mod Times.jpg|thumb|World premiere of ''Modern Times'' (1936), New York]]

''Modern Times'' is often hailed as one of Chaplin's greatest achievements, and it remains one of his most popular films. It has a 100% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 53 critic reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "A slapstick skewering of industrialized America, ''Modern Times'' is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/modern_times/|title=Modern Times|author=|date=February 25, 1936|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary reviews were very positive. [[Frank Nugent]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "'Modern Times' has still the same old Charlie, the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet and prankish eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audience's funnybone or hold it still, taut beneath the spell of human tragedy ...

French philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merlau-Ponty]] named their journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', after it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa Appignanesi|Appignanesi, Lisa]], 2005, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', London: Haus, {{ISBN|1-904950-09-4}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film did not perform as well commercially at the US box office but returns in other countries meant it was profitable.&lt;ref name="tino"/&gt; It was the most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36.&lt;ref&gt;"The Film Business in the United States and Britain during the 1930s" by John Sedgwick and Michael Pokorny, ''The Economic History Review'' New Series, Vol. 58, No. 1 (Feb., 2005), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconic depiction of Chaplin working frantically to keep up with an assembly line inspired later comedy routines including [[Disney]]'s ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' ([[Donald Duck]] alternately assembling [[artillery shells]] and saluting portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]]) and an episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' titled "Job Switching" ([[Lucy Ricardo|Lucy]] and [[Ethel Mertz|Ethel]] trying to keep up with an ever-increasing volume of chocolate candies, eventually stuffing them in their mouths, hats, and blouses). The opening of a fantasy sequence in the film, in which the unemployed factory worker trips over a footstool upon entering the living room of his "dream home" with the Gamine, inspired a similar opening to ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.

This was Chaplin's first overtly political-themed film, and its unflattering portrayal of industrial society generated controversy in some quarters upon its initial release. Writing in ''The Liberal News'', the official magazine of the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], in October 1936, Willoughby Dewar observed '[Modern Times] should be seen by every Young Liberal. It is, among other things, a piece of first-class Liberal propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Kendal Archival Centre, WDSO 174/13: Willoughby Dewar, 'Modern Times' in ''The Liberal News'', No. 7, October 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The film exhibits slight similarities to a lesser known 1931 French film directed by [[René Clair]] entitled ''[[À nous la liberté]]'' (''Liberty for Us'')&amp;nbsp;– the assembly line sequence is an instance in that both films depict it, but in different ways. The German film company [[Tobis Film]], hungry for cash, sued Chaplin following the film's release to no avail. They sued again after World War II (considered revenge for Chaplin's anti-[[Nazi]] statements in ''[[The Great Dictator]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/biography/articles/6-modern-times|title=Charlie Chaplin : Filming Modern Times|author=|date=|work=charliechaplin.com|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, they [[settlement (litigation)|settled]] with Chaplin out of court. Clair, a huge admirer of Chaplin who was flattered that the film icon would depict similar subject, but was deeply embarrassed that Tobis Film would sue Chaplin, was never part of the case.

The film did attract criticism for being almost completely [[silent film|silent]], despite the movie industry having long since embraced the talking picture. Chaplin famously feared that the mystery and romanticism of the Tramp character would be ruined if he spoke, and feared it would alienate his fans in non-English speaking territories. His future films, however, would be fully fledged "talkies"&amp;nbsp;– although without the character of the Little Tramp.

Chaplin biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]] has written of the reception and legacy of this classic comedy, &lt;blockquote&gt;Modern Times is perhaps more meaningful now than at any time since its first release. The twentieth-century theme of the film, farsighted for its time—the struggle to eschew alienation and preserve humanity in a modern, mechanized world—profoundly reflects issues facing the twenty-first century. The Tramp's travails in ''Modern Times'' and the comedic mayhem that ensues should provide strength and comfort to all who feel like helpless cogs in a world beyond control. Through its universal themes and comic inventiveness, Modern Times remains one of Chaplin's greatest and most enduring works. Perhaps more important, it is the Tramp's finale, a tribute to Chaplin's most beloved character and the silent-film era he commanded for a generation.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Jeffrey (2003).

A '''molecular assembler''', as defined by [[K. Eric Drexler]],  is a "proposed device able to guide [[chemical reaction]]s by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision". A molecular assembler is a kind of [[molecular machine]].  Some biological molecules such as [[ribosome]]s fit this definition. This is because they receive instructions from [[mRNA|messenger RNA]] and then assemble specific sequences of [[amino acids]] to construct [[protein]] molecules.  However, the term "molecular assembler" usually refers to theoretical human-made devices.
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
Beginning in 2007, the British [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] has funded development of ribosome-like molecular assemblers.  Clearly, molecular assemblers are possible in this limited sense. A technology roadmap project, led by the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] and hosted by several [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|U.S. National Laboratories]] has explored a range of atomically precise fabrication technologies, including both early-generation and longer-term prospects for programmable molecular assembly; the report was released in December, 2007.&lt;ref name="RoadMap"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf|title=Productive Nanosystems: A Technology Roadmap|last=|first=|date=|website=Foresight Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council provided funding of 1.5 million pounds over six years for research working towards mechanized mechanosynthesis, in partnership with the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G007837/1 |title=Grants on the Web |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104152935/http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP%2FG007837%2F1 |archivedate=November 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the term "molecular assembler" has been used in [[science fiction]] and [[popular culture]] to refer to a wide range of fantastic atom-manipulating nanomachines, many of which may be physically impossible in reality. Much of the controversy regarding "molecular assemblers" results from the confusion in the use of the name for both technical concepts and popular fantasies. In 1992, Drexler introduced the related but better-understood term "molecular manufacturing," which he defined as the programmed "chemical synthesis of complex structures by [[mechanosynthesis|mechanically positioning reactive molecules]], not by manipulating individual atoms."&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html|title=C&amp;En: Cover Story - Nanotechnology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article mostly discusses "molecular assemblers" in the popular sense. These include hypothetical machines that manipulate individual atoms and machines with organism-like [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] abilities, mobility, ability to consume food, and so forth. These are quite different from devices that merely (as defined above) "guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision".

Because synthetic molecular assemblers have never been constructed and because of the confusion regarding the meaning of the term, there has been much controversy as to whether "molecular assemblers" are possible or simply science fiction. Confusion and controversy also stem from their classification as [[nanotechnology]], which is an active area of laboratory research which has already been applied to the production of real products; however, there had been, until recently, no research efforts into the actual construction of "molecular assemblers".

Nonetheless, a 2013 paper by [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]]'s group, published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', details a new method of synthesizing a peptide in a sequence-specific manner by using an artificial molecular machine that is guided by a molecular strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewandowski|first=Bartosz|last2=De Bo|first2=Guillaume|last3=Ward|first3=John W.|last4=Papmeyer|first4=Marcus|last5=Kuschel|first5=Sonja|last6=Aldegunde|first6=María J.|last7=Gramlich|first7=Philipp M. E.|last8=Heckmann|first8=Dominik|last9=Goldup|first9=Stephen M.|date=2013-01-11|title=Sequence-Specific Peptide Synthesis by an Artificial Small-Molecule Machine|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6116/189|journal=Science|language=en|volume=339|issue=6116|pages=189–193|doi=10.1126/science.1229753|issn=0036-8075|pmid=23307739|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This functions in the same way as a ribosome building proteins by assembling amino acids according to a messenger RNA blueprint. The structure of the machine is based on a [[rotaxane]], which is a molecular ring sliding along a molecular axle. The ring carries a [[thiolate]] group which removes amino acids in sequence from the axle, transferring them to a peptide assembly site. In 2018, the same group published a more advanced version of this concept in which the molecular ring shuttles along a polymeric track to assemble an oligopeptide that can fold into a [[Alpha helix|α-helix]] that can perform the enantioselective epoxidation of a [[chalcone]] derivative (in a way reminiscent to the [[ribosome]] assembling an [[enzyme]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Bo|first=Guillaume|last2=Gall|first2=Malcolm A.

In 2017 [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]]'s group reported a molecular robot that could be programmed to construct any one of four different stereoisomers of a molecular product by using a nanomechanical robotic arm to move a molecular substrate between different reactive sites of an artificial molecular machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kassem | first1 = S. | last2 = Lee | first2 = A.

==Nanofactories==
A '''nanofactory''' is a proposed system in which [[nanotechnology|nanomachines]] (resembling molecular assemblers, or industrial robot arms) would combine reactive molecules via [[mechanosynthesis]] to build larger atomically precise parts. These, in turn, would be assembled by positioning mechanisms of assorted sizes to build macroscopic (visible) but still atomically-precise products.

A typical nanofactory would fit in a desktop box, in the vision of [[K. Eric Drexler]] published in ''Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation'' (1992), a notable work of "[[exploratory engineering]]". During the 1990s, others have extended the nanofactory concept, including an analysis of nanofactory convergent assembly by [[Ralph Merkle]], a systems design of a replicating nanofactory architecture by [[J. Storrs Hall]], [[Forrest Bishop|Forrest Bishop's]] "Universal Assembler", the patented exponential assembly process by [[Zyvex]], and a top-level systems design for a 'primitive nanofactory' by Chris Phoenix (Director of Research at the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology). All of these nanofactory designs (and more) are summarized in Chapter 4 of ''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines'' (2004) by [[Robert Freitas]] and Ralph Merkle. The Nanofactory Collaboration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory|title=Nanofactory Collaboration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Freitas and Merkle in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm|title=Nanofactory Technical Challenges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development.

In 2005, a computer-animated short film of the nanofactory concept was produced by John Burch, in collaboration with Drexler. Such visions have been the subject of much debate, on several intellectual levels. No one has discovered an insurmountable problem with the underlying theories and no one has proved that the theories can be translated into practice. However, the debate continues, with some of it being summarized in the [[molecular nanotechnology]] article.

If nanofactories could be built, severe disruption to the [[world economy]] would be one of many possible negative impacts, though it could be argued that this disruption would have little negative effect if everyone had such nanofactories. Great benefits also would be anticipated. Various works of [[science fiction]] have explored these and similar concepts. The potential for such devices was part of the mandate of a major UK study led by [[mechanical engineering]] professor Dame [[Ann Dowling]].

==Self-replication==
"Molecular assemblers" have been confused with self-replicating machines. To produce a practical quantity of a desired product,  the nanoscale size of a typical science fiction universal molecular assembler requires an extremely large number of such devices. However, a single such theoretical molecular assembler might be programmed to [[self replication|self-replicate]], constructing many copies of itself.  This would allow an exponential rate of production. Then after sufficient quantities of the molecular assemblers were available, they would then be re-programmed for production of the desired product. However, if self-replication of molecular assemblers were not restrained then it might lead to competition with naturally occurring organisms. This has been called [[ecophagy]] or the [[grey goo]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/BD-Goo.htm|title=Nanotechnology: Grey Goo is a Small Issue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method to building molecular assemblers is to mimic evolutionary processes employed by biological systems. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants. Production of complex molecular assemblers might be evolved from simpler systems since "A [[complex system]] that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works."&lt;ref name="JohGall"&gt;
Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most published safety guidelines include
"recommendations against developing ... replicator designs which permit surviving mutation or undergoing evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html|title=Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most assembler designs keep the "source code" external to the physical assembler. At each step of a manufacturing process, that step is read from an ordinary computer file and "broadcast" to all the assemblers.
If any assembler gets out of range of that computer, or when the link between that computer and the assemblers is broken, or when that computer is unplugged, the assemblers stop replicating.
Such a "broadcast architecture" is one of the safety features recommended by the "Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology", and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm|title=Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous practical methods by which replicators can be safely controlled by good design.

==Drexler and Smalley debate==
{{main|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

One of the most outspoken critics of some concepts of "molecular assemblers" was Professor [[Richard Smalley]] (1943–2005) who won the [[Nobel prize]] for his contributions to the field of [[nanotechnology]]. Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections were termed the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem".  He believed these would exclude the possibility of "molecular assemblers" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms. Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.html|title=Institute for Molecular ManufacturingDebate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 2001 publication.

Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with "molecular assemblers" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"/&gt;

==Regulation==
Speculation on the power of systems that have been called "molecular assemblers" has sparked a wider political discussion on the implication of nanotechnology. This is in part due to the fact that nanotechnology is a very broad term and could include "molecular assemblers." Discussion of the possible implications of fantastic molecular assemblers has prompted calls for regulation of current and future nanotechnology. There are very real concerns with the potential health and ecological impact of nanotechnology that is being integrated in manufactured products. [[Greenpeace]] for instance commissioned a report concerning nanotechnology in which they express concern into the toxicity of nanomaterials that have been introduced in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/5886.pdf Future Technologies, Today’s Choices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414081108/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/5886.pdf |date=2006-04-14 }} Nanotechnology, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics; A technical, political and institutional map of emerging technologies. A report for the Greenpeace Environmental Trust&lt;/ref&gt; However, it makes only passing references to "assembler" technology. The UK [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] also commissioned a report entitled "Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm|title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies:opportunities and uncertainties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the larger social and ecological implications on nanotechnology. This report does not discuss the threat posed by potential so-called "molecular assemblers."

==Formal scientific review==
In 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11752.html|title=A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative - The National Academies Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study committee reviewed the technical content of ''Nanosystems'', and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:

:"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and [[Thermodynamic efficiency|thermodynamic efficiencies]] of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly [[Thermodynamic efficiency limit|exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies]] and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal."

==Grey goo==
{{Main|Grey goo}}

One potential scenario that has been envisioned is out-of-control self-replicating molecular assemblers in the form of [[grey goo]] which consumes carbon to continue its replication. If unchecked such mechanical replication could potentially consume whole [[ecoregion]]s or the whole Earth ([[ecophagy]]), or it could simply outcompete natural lifeforms for necessary resources such as [[carbon]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], or [[UV]] light (which some [[nanomotor]] examples run on). However, the [[ecophagy]] and 'grey goo' scenarios, like synthetic molecular assemblers, are based upon still-hypothetical technologies that have not yet been demonstrated experimentally.

==In fiction==
{{Main|Nanotechnology in fiction}}

Molecular assemblers are a popular topic in science fiction, for example, the matter compiler in [[Diamond Age|The Diamond Age]] and the cornucopia machine in [[Singularity Sky]]. The [[replicator (Star Trek)|replicator]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' might also be considered a molecular assembler. A molecular assembler is also a key element of the plot of the computer game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' (called a "universal constructor" in the game).

In the political sci-fi comic series [[Transmetropolitan]], written by [[Warren Ellis]], machines called "Makers" are used to replicate and reform matter. Each morning, Makers sweep the streets for garbage, gathering the matter to recycle it into more useful objects. The main character also uses a Maker in his apartment to instantly produce a pair of glasses which take photos, as well as other objects such as clothing.

In Dead Money, a DLC of the video game [[Fallout: New Vegas]], the player can obtain useful items from vending machines that use an unknown form of molecular assembly technology to transform casino chips that the player can find into any of several items.

In the cyberpunk visual novel [[Baldr Sky]], a nano machine simply given the name "Assembler" is present for the purpose of cleaning the polluted atmosphere.

'''Neuroheuristics''' (or '''Neuristics''') studies the dynamic relations between the complex knowledge acquired by [[neuroscience]] by means of an approach not reducible in an expertise since it is continuously renewed at every stage of progress towards scientific discovery.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek νεύρον ([[neuron]], which refers to the nerve cell&lt;ref name="Neuron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/410669/neuron|title=Neuron |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and εύρισκω ("euriskein" [[heuristic]], which refers to a [[problem-solving]] procedure that is often characterized by its informal, intuitive and speculative features&lt;ref name="Heuristics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/593468/thought/275926/Structures-of-problems|title=Structure of problems in thought |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Paradigm==
Neuroheuristics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Neuro Heuristic paradigm |publisher=Neuroheuristic Research Group  | url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/docs/def/NHparadigm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a [[scientific paradigm]] aimed to develop strategies that can be enabled to understand brain and mind following subsequent problems emerging from [[transdisciplinary studies]] including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[pharmacology]], [[physics]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[economics]] and [[mathematics]].

The neuroheuristic paradigm was presented for the first time at the conference ''Entrer dans le XXIe siècle : de l'apoptose à la métamorphose'', held in 1994 at the Centro Stefano Franscini [[Monte Verità]], under the auspice of the XV Videart Festival Locarno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davel.vd.ch/qfpdavel/0/D3963.pdf|title=Vers un nouveau paradigme en neurosciences|publisher=Archives cantonales vaudoises, document reference PP 525/806.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}

The research framework introduced by the neuroheuristic paradigm appears as an essential step for the investigation of the information processing effected by the brain because it is the outcome of [[nature and nurture]], at the crossing of [[top-down and bottom-up design]].

The neurobiologists apply a "bottom-up" research strategy in their studies. This strategy seems to prove necessary and sufficient to understand a brain in its entirety after the impressive achievements in studying the entire nervous system of a simple model organism, such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A database featuring behavioral and structural anatomy of ''Caenorhabditis elegans''|url=http://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/nervous/Neuroframeset.html}} {{cite web |title=Specification of the nervous system of ''C. elegans''| url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_specnervsys/specnervsys.html}} {{cite journal |last1=White |first1=J.G. |last2=Southgate |first2=E. |last3=Thomson |first3=J.N. |last4=Brenner |first4=S.|title= The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=314 |issue=1165 |pages=1–340 |year=1986 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0056 |pmid=22462104}} {{cite news|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|title=The Connectome Debate: Is Mapping the Mind of a Worm Worth It?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=c-elegans-connectome|newspaper=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is not wholly viable to actual experimentation considering the impossibility of simultaneously examining all cellular elements of the brain and all variables that affect those elements.

The "top-down" strategy with the assistance of [[black box theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botterill|first1=George|last2=Carruthers|first2=Peter|title=The Philosophy of Psychology|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521559157|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511037986}} {{cite journal|last=Von Hilgers| first=Philipp| title=The History of the Black Box: The Clash of a Thing and its Concept| journal=Cultural Politics| year=2011| volume=7| issue=1| pages=41–58| url=http://culturalpolitics.dukejournals.org/content/7/1/41.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  appears easier to bring to fulfillment but insufficient and irrelevant in understanding the mechanisms coordinating the local networks of cellular elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=Robert E.|title=Sir Charles Sherrington's the integrative action of the nervous system: a centenary appreciation|journal=Brain|year=2007|volume=130|issue=4|pages=887–894|doi=10.1093/brain/awm022|pmid=17438014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''neuroheuristic'' (or ''neuristic'') paradigm offers as a needed and possible distinct approach to the study of brain and mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=John G.|last2=Villa|first2=Alessandro E.P.|title=The "Conscious I": A Neuroheuristic Approach to the Mind| year=2001| volume=3| series=Frontiers of Life| pages=349–368| isbn=9780120773404 | url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/msps/_01cftv.zip }} {{cite journal| last=Villa| first=Alessandro E.P.| title=Neuroheuristics, a new paradigm in neuroscience|journal=Rev Med Suisse Romande| year=2000| volume=120| issue=9| pages=743–748| pmid=11094540 |url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/msps/_00v1.zip }} {{cite journal|last=Villa|first=Alessandro E.P.|title=Neural Coding in the Neuroheuristic Perspective| year=2008| volume=1| series=Biosemiotics| pages=357–377| doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6340-4_16}} {{cite journal|last1=Villa|first1=Alessandro E.P.|last2=Missonnier|first2=Pascal|last3=Lintas|first3=Alessandra|title=Neuroheuristics of Decision Making: From Neuronal Activity to EEG |year=2012| volume=28| series=Intelligent Systems Reference Library |pages=159–194| doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24647-0_7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this framework, a "result" cannot be simply positive or negative because the process itself cannot be reduced to proficiency as such. Dynamics is an essential feature of the neuroheuristic paradigm, but it cannot be merely considered as the neurobiological facet of [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]].

'''Organic clothing''' is clothing made from materials raised in or grown in compliance with [[Organic agriculture|organic agricultural]] standards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Organic clothing may be composed of [[Cotton]], [[Jute]], [[Silk]], [[Ramie]], or [[Wool]]. Textiles do not need to be 100% organic to use the organic label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Memorandum|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOP-PM-11-14-LabelingofTextiles.pdf|publisher=USDA (May 20 2011)|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more general term is ''organic textiles'', which includes both apparel and home textiles. The technical requirements in terms of certification and origin generally remain same for organic clothing and organic textiles.

[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], identified the Other as one of the conceptual bases of [[intersubjectivity]], of the relations among people.]]

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the terms '''the Other''' and '''the Constitutive Other''' identify the other human being, in their differences from the Self, as being a cumulative, constituting factor in the [[self-image]] of a person; as their acknowledgement of [[Reality|being real]]; hence, the Other is dissimilar to and the opposite of the Self, of Us, and of the Same.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Other", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, (1999) p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutive Other is the relation between the [[personality]] (essential nature) and the person (body) of a human being; it is the relation of [[Essentialism|essential]] and superficial characteristics of [[personal identity]] that corresponds to the relationship between opposite but correlative characteristics of the Self, because the difference is inner-difference, within the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hegel, G. W. F.|author2=Miller, A. V.|editor1-last=Hoffmeister|editor1-first=J.|title=Force and the Understanding: Appearance and the Supersensible World: Phenomenology of Spirit|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York &lt;!--|DUPLICATE_pages=517–18--&gt;|edition=5th|pages=98–9|quote=The relation of essential nature to outward manifestation in pure change ... to infinity ... as inner difference ...

V.|editor1-last=Hoffmeister|editor1-first=J.|title=Analysis of the Text: Phenomenology of Spirit|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=517–18|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition and quality of '''Otherness''', the characteristics of the Other, is the state of being different from and alien to the [[Identity (social science)|social identity]] of a person and to the [[identity (philosophy)|identity of the Self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Miller, J.|url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/view/research/n304.xml|title=Otherness|website=The SAGE encyclopedia of qualitative research methods.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2015|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=588–591|doi=10.4135/9781412963909.n304|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[discourse]] of philosophy, the term Otherness identifies and refers to the characteristics of ''Who?'' and ''What?'' of the Other, which are distinct and separate from [[the Symbolic]] order of things; from [[the Real]] (the authentic and unchangeable); from the [[Aesthetics|æsthetic]] ([[art]], [[beauty]], [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]); from [[political philosophy]]; from [[Norm (social)|social norm]]s and [[identity (social science)|social identity]]; and from the [[Self]]. Therefore, the condition of Otherness is a person's non-conformity to and with the social norms of society; and Otherness is the condition of [[disenfranchisement]] (political exclusion), effected either by the [[State (polity)|State]] or by the social institutions (e.g. the [[profession]]s) invested with the corresponding socio-political [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Therefore, the imposition of Otherness [[Social alienation|alienates]] the labelled person from the centre of society, and places him or her at the margins of society, for being the Other.&lt;ref&gt;"Otherness", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Othering''' describes the reductive action of labeling a person as someone who belongs to a subordinate social category defined as the Other. The practice of Othering is the exclusion of persons who do not fit the norm of the [[social group]], which is a version of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;"Othering", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in [[human geography]], to ''other'' an individual identifies and excludes them from the social group, placing them at the margins of society where social norms do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===European philosophy===
[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The idealist philosopher G. W. F. Hegel introduced the concept of the Other as constituent part of human preoccupation with the Self.]]
[[File:Emmanuel Levinas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ethical philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas associated the concept of the Other with the ethical systems proposed in scripture and tradition.]]
The concept of the [[Self]] requires the existence of '''the Other''' as the counterpart entity required for '''defining the Self'''; in the late 18th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) introduced the concept of the Other as a constituent part of [[self-consciousness]] (preoccupation with the Self),&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 1, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; which complements the propositions about [[self-awareness]] (capacity for introspection) proffered by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814).&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 8, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807)

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) applied the concept of the Other as a basis for [[intersubjectivity]], the psychological relations among people. In ''[[Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology]]'' (1931), Husserl said that the Other is constituted as an ''alter ego'', as an other self. As such, the Other person posed and was an epistemological problem—of being only a perception of the consciousness of the Self.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

In ''[[Being and Nothingness|Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]]'' (1943), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980) applied the dialectic of intersubjectivity to describe how the world is altered by the appearance of the Other, of how the world then appears to be oriented to the Other person, and not to the Self. The Other appears as a psychological phenomenon in the course of a person's life, and not as a radical threat to the [[existence]] of the Self. In that mode, in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) applied the concept of Otherness to Hegel's dialectic of the "[[Master–slave dialectic|Lord and Bondsman]]" (''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'') and found it to be like the dialectic of the Man–Woman relationship, thus a true explanation for society's treatment and mistreatment of women.

===European psychology===
The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) and the ethical philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995) established the contemporary definitions, usages, and applications of the Other, as the radical counterpart of the Self. Lacan associated the Other with language and with [[The Symbolic|the symbolic order]] of things. Levinas associated the Other with the ethical metaphysics of [[scripture]] and [[tradition]]; the ethical proposition is that the Other is superior and prior to the Self.

In the event, Levinas re-formulated the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter (wherein a person is responsible to the Other person) to include the propositions of [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) about the impossibility of the Other (person) being an entirely [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysical pure-presence]]. That the Other could be an entity of pure Otherness (of [[alterity]]) personified in a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] created and depicted with language that identifies, describes, and classifies. The conceptual re-formulation of the nature of the Other also included Levinas's analysis of the distinction between "[[the saying and the said]]"; nonetheless, the nature of the Other retained the priority of [[ethics]] over [[metaphysics]].

In the psychology of the mind (e.g. [[R. D. Laing]]), the Other identifies and refers to [[The unconscious|the unconscious mind]], to [[silence]], to [[insanity]], and to language ("to what is referred and to what is unsaid").&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999 )p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in such psychologic and analytic usages, there might arise a tendency to [[relativism]] if the Other person (as a being of pure, abstract alterity) leads to ignoring the commonality of [[truth]]. Likewise, problems arise from unethical usages of the terms The Other, Otherness, and Othering to reinforce [[Ontology|ontological divisions]] of reality: of [[being]], of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and of [[existence]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

===Levinas on ethics===
In ''[[Totality and Infinity|Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority]]'' (1961), Emmanuel Levinas said that previous philosophy had reduced the Other person to an object of consciousness, by not preserving its absolute ''[[alterity]]''—the innate condition of otherness, by which the Other radically transcends the Self and the totality of the human network into which the Other is being placed. As a challenge to self-assurance, the existence of the Other is a matter of ethics, because the ethical priority of the Other equals the primacy of ethics over ontology in real life.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

From that perspective, Levinas described the nature of the Other as "insomnia and wakefulness"; an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] (an exteriority) towards the Other that forever remains beyond any attempt at fully capturing the Other, whose Otherness is infinite; even in the murder of an Other, their Otherness remains uncontrolled and not negated. The infinity of the Other allowed Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to that ethic; thus:

{{quotation|The others that obsess me in the Other do not affect me as examples of the same [[genus]] united with my neighbor, by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block ... The others concern me from the first. Here, fraternity precedes the commonness of a genus. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others. |''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'' (1974), p. 159.&lt;ref&gt;Levinas, Emmanuel. ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===More recent critical theory===
Derrida proposed that the absolute ''[[alterity]]'' of the Other is compromised because the Other is ''other than'' the Self and the group. That logical problem has especially negative consequences in the realm of human geography when the Other person is denied ethical priority in geopolitical discourse. Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse ([[Oriental Studies]]) about Western encounters with non–Western cultures preserves the dominantor–dominated discourse of [[hegemony]], just as misrepresenting the feminine as Other reasserts [[male privilege]] as primary in social discourse.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), the geographer [[Derek Gregory]] said that the responses of U.S. President George W. Bush (2001–2009) to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 reinforced philosophic divisions of connotation and denotation that perpetuated the negative representation of the non-Western Other, when he rhetorically asked the U.S. populace ''Why do they hate us?'' as political prelude to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's rhetorical question led the U.S. populace to make an artificial, Us-and-Them division in the relations between the U.S. and the countries and cultures of the Middle East, which artifice is a basic factor of the perpetual war on [[terrorism]], and is a step away from eradicating the imaginary representations of the Self and the Other created with the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] geographies produced by [[Oriental Studies]]; about which the cultural critic [[Edward Saïd]] said that:

{{quotation|To build a conceptual framework around a notion of Us-versus-Them is, in effect, to pretend that the principal consideration is [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and natural—our civilization is known and accepted, theirs is different and strange—whereas, in fact, the framework separating us from them is belligerent, constructed, and situational.|''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imperialism and colonialism==
The contemporary, world system of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]], nation-states (with interdependent politics and economies) was preceded by the European imperial system of [[Colonialism|colonies]] (settler and economic) in which "the creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states, and often in the form of an empire, [was] based on [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] and [[Hierarchy|subordination]]."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R.J., ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 4th Edition Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; In the imperialist world system, political and economic affairs were fragmented, and the discrete empires "provided for most of their own needs ... [and disseminated] their influence solely through conquest [empire] or the threat of conquest [hegemony]."&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, James L. ''The Modern Middle East: A History'', 2nd ed. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
The imperial conquest of "non-white" countries was intellectually justified with the [[Fetishism|fetishization]] of the Eastern world, which was effected with cultural generalizations that divided the peoples of the world into the artificial, binary relationship of "The Eastern World and The Western World", the dichotomy which identified, designated, and subordinated the peoples of the Orient as the Other—as the non–European Self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 27 January 2016|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of fetishization of people and things is a function of [[Orientalism]], which the colonialist ideologue realises with three actions: (i) Homogenization (all Oriental peoples are the same folk); (ii) Feminization (Oriental people are the lessers in the East–West binary relationship); and (iii) Essentialization (a people reduced to the artificial essence of universal, innate characteristics); thus, the praxis of Othering reduced to cultural inferiority the people, places, and things of the Eastern world, which then justified colonialism by establishing the West as the superior standard of culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Patheon Books|year = 1978|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race ===
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific racism of the Other: In the late-19th century, H. Strickland Constable justified anti-Irish racism among white people by claiming similarity between the cranial features of "the Irish-Iberian" man (left) and "the Negro" man (right), as proof that each man is racially inferior to the Anglo-Teutonic man (centre) possessed of the cranial ideal.]]

The practice of Othering was the prevalent cultural perspective of the European imperial powers, which was supported by the fabrications of [[scientific racism]], such as the pseudo-intellectual belief that the size of the cranium of the non–European Other was indicative of the inferior intelligence of the coloured peoples designated as the non-white Other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the United Nations officially declared that the differences among the races were insignificant in relation to the anthropological sameness among the peoples who are the human race. Despite the facts, in the U.S., the artificial distinctions against the Other remain, especially in government forms that ask a U.S. citizen to identify and place him or herself into a racial category, as in the questionnaires of the census bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In practice of Othering, immigrants and refugees  are seen as "illegal immigrants" (from overseas) and "illegal aliens" (from Mexico).

===The subaltern native===
Maintaining an empire requires the [[Cultural imperialism|cultural subordination]] of the Other into the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern native]] (the colonized people), which facilitates the exploitation of their labour, of their lands, and of the natural resources of their country as a colony of the motherland. To realise those ends, the process of Othering culturally justifies the domination and subordination of the native people, by placing them (as the Other) at the social periphery of the geopolitical enterprise that is colonial imperialism. The colonizer creates the Other with a false dichotomy of "native weakness" (social and political, cultural and economic) against the "colonial strength" of imperial [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be resolved only with the ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' of racialism—the "moral responsibility" that psychologically authorizes the colonialist Self to unilaterally assume a [[civilizing mission]] to educate, convert, and culturally assimilate the Other into the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the praxis of [[colonialism]], the native populace constitute the Other whom the colonizers mean to dominate in order to civilise and save them in the course of exploiting the natural and human resources of the natives' homeland.&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"&gt;Mountz, A. (n.d.). ''The Other''. Key Concepts in Political Geography, pp. 328–338. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a colony is a way to dominate and dispose of two groups of people (colonists and colonised) who can be used to define the Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikiwash.metronews.ca/other/703349669-703223196|title=WikiWash|website=wikiwash.metronews.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Othering establishes the unequal relationship between the native people and the colonizers, who believe themselves essentially superior to the natives whom they reduced to inhuman inferiority, as "the Other".&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"&gt;Colonialism. (n.d.). Dictionary of Human Geography, pp. 94–98. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehumanisation of colonialism—the colonist "Self" against the colonised "Other"—is maintained with the false binary-relations of [[Class (social)|social class]] and [[race (human categorization)|race]], of [[sex]] and [[gender]], and of [[nation]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"/&gt; The proper, profitable functioning of a colony features continual protection of such cultural demarcations, which establish and enforce the socio-economic binary relation between "civilized man" (the colonist) and "savage man" (the colonial subaltern).&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"/&gt;

==Sex and gender==
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The existential philosopher Simone de Beauvoir applied the concept of The Other to the man–woman binary relation, in critical of the dominator–dominated relation, which historically characterised sexual inequality.]]

The existential philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]'s conception of "the Other" (as a constituent part of [[Self-awareness|self-consciousness]]) to describe a male-dominated culture that represents Woman as the sexual Other in relation to Man. In the cultural context of the Man–Woman binary relation, the sexual Other is a [[minority (philosophy)|minority]], the least-favoured social group, usually the women of the community, because "a man represents both the positive and the neutral, as indicated by the common use of [the word] ''Man'' to designate human beings in general; whereas [the word] ''Woman'' represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity" from the first sex, from Man.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949)

In 1957, [[Betty Friedan]] substantiated the ordinate–subordinate nature of the Man–Woman sexual relation as social identity. When queried about their post-graduate lives, the majority of women interviewed, at a university-class reunion, used binary gender language, and referred to and identified themselves as their roles (wife, mother, manager) in the private sphere. They did not identify their own achievements (career, job, business) in the public sphere of life. Unawares, the women had conventionally automatically identified themselves as the social Other. Although the nature of the social Other is influenced by the society's social constructs ([[social class]], [[sex]], [[gender]]), as a human organisation, society holds the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] (social and political) to formally change the social relation between the male-defined Self and ''Woman'', the non-male Other.&lt;ref&gt;Haslanger&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963)

The [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] [[Cheshire Calhoun]] deconstructed the concept of "the Other" as the female-half of the binary-gender relation of the "Man and Woman" concept. [[Deconstruction]] of the word ''Woman''—from subordinate in the "Man ''and'' Woman" relation—conceptually [[Reconstructivism|reconstructed]] the female Other as the Woman who exists independently of male definition ([[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]); independent of the patriarchy who formally realise female subordination with binary-gender usages of the word ''Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarojinisahoo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), Prof. Sarojini Sahoo said that despite equality with men, women possess a discrete identity that is independent of the male definition of ''woman''.]]
In the essay "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), the academic [[Sarojini Sahoo]], agrees with De Beauvoir's proposition that women can be free of social subordination by "thinking, taking action, working, creating, on the same terms as men; instead of seeking to disparage them, she declares herself their equal." Yet counters De Beauvoir that despite having the same human-being status as men, women have a unique sexual [[Gender identity|identity]] different from men. In feminist definition, Women are the Other (but not the Hegelian Other) and are not existentially defined by the demands of Man. Women are the social Other who unknowingly accept subjugation as part of [[subjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com|title=Sense &amp; Sensuality|website=sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the identity of woman is constitutionally different from the identity of man, as human beings, men and women are equal. Hence, the harm of Othering arises from the asymmetric nature of sex and gender roles, which arises accidentally and "passively" from natural and unavoidable [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jemmer, Patrick. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YlN_kz8th4cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Sarojini+Sahoo&amp;ots=EFtjSxyA3q&amp;sig=qa7R The O(the)r (O)the(r)], Engage Newcastle Volume 1 ({{ISSN|2045-0567}}; {{ISBN|978-1-907926-00-6}}) August 2010, Newcastle UK: NewPhilSoc Publishing, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social-exclusion function of Othering a person or a social group from society, for being different from the norm (of the Self), is understood in the socio-economic functions of gender (a [[social construct]]) and sex (biological reality). In a society where heterosexuality is the social norm, "the Other" refers to and identifies the same-sex orientation, lesbians (women who love women) and gays (men who love men), people identified as "deviant" from the binary socio-sexual norm.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt; Negative usages of "the Other" are applied to the lesbian and gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities to diminish their social status and political power by social Othering to the margins of society. To neutralise Othering, LGBT communities ''queer'' a city, create social spaces, that use the city's spatial and temporal plans to allow the LGBT community free expression of [[social identity]] (i.e. a gay-pride parade); as such, ''queering'' is a political means for the sexual Other to establish their [[reality]] as part of the urban body politic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge==

===Representations===
Regarding the production of [[knowledge]] about the Other, Michel Foucault and the [[Frankfurt School]] identified the process of '''Othering''' as everything to do with the creation and maintenance of imaginary representations—"knowledge of the Other"—in service to geopolitical [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]. The [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of the Other (metaphoric, metonymic, anthropomorphic) are manifestations of the Western cultural attitudes inherent to the European historiographies of the non–European peoples labelled as "the Other". Using analytical discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) the [[dominant ideology]] of the colonialist culture explains the Eastern world to the Western world, using the binary relationship of the European Self confronting the non–European Other from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th-century [[Historiography|historiographies]] of the [[Orient]] as a place, European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studied only what they argued was the [[high culture]]—the languages and literatures, the arts and philologies—of the Middle East as a cultural region, rather than as a geopolitical place inhabited by different peoples and societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; About such cultural misrepresentation, Saïd said that "the Orient that appears in Orientalism, then, is a system of representations framed by a whole set of forces that brought the Orient into Western learning, Western consciousness, and later, Western empire. If this definition of Orientalism seems more political than not, that is simply because I think Orientalism was, itself, a product of certain political forces and activities. Orientalism is a school of interpretation whose material happens to be the Orient, its civilisations, peoples, and localities. Its objective discoveries—the work of innumerable devoted scholars who edited texts and translated them, codified grammars, wrote dictionaries, reconstructed dead epochs, produced positivistically verifiable learning—are and always have been conditioned by the fact that its truths, like any truths delivered by language, are embodied in language, and, what is the truth of language?, Nietzsche once said, but":

{{quotation| A mobile army of [[metaphor]]s, [[metonym]]s, and [[anthropomorphism]]s—in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which, after long use, seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.|''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;ref name=Said&gt;Saïd, Edward W. ''Orientalism'', 25th Anniversary Ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202}}}}

Saïd concludes that Nietzsche's perspective might be too [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], but that it draws attention to the fact that, in so far as "the Orient" occurred in the [[Existentialism|existential]] awareness of the Western world, the Orient was a word that later accrued to it a wide field of meanings, associations, and connotations, which did not refer to the real Eastern world, but to the field of study surrounding "the Orient" as a word.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy===
In the Eastern world, the field of [[Occidentalism]], the investigation programme and academic curriculum of and about [[Essentialism|the essence]] of [[Western world|The West]]—i.e. geographic Europe as a culturally homogenous place—did not exist as a counterpart to Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Steven R. "The Historiography of the Modern Middle East: Transforming a Field of Study",  ''Middle East Historiographies: Narrating the Twentieth Century'', Israel Gershoni, Amy Singer, Y. Hakam Erdem, Eds. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2006. pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the Orientalist practices of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical negationism]], the writing of distorted history about the places and peoples of "The East" continue in the [[postmodern]] era, especially in contemporary journalism; e.g. in the Third World, political parties practice intra-national Othering with fabricated "facts", such as threat-reports about non-existent threats (political, social, military) that are meant to aggravate the character faults of the opponent political parties, which usually are composed of people from the social and ethnic groups identified and designated as the Other in that society.&lt;ref&gt;Sehgal, Meera. "Manufacturing a Feminized Siege Mentality." ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'' '''36''' (2) (2007): p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of Othering a person or a social group, by means of an ideal [[ethnocentricity]] (belief that one's ethnic group is the superior group), and the cultural tendency to evaluate and assign [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]] to Other ethnicities, which are negatively measured against the ideal standard of the Self—is realised through mundane methods of investigation, such as [[cartography]].&lt;ref name=Fellman&gt;Fellmann, Jerome D., et al. ''Human Geography: Landscapes of Human Activities'', 10th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

Historically, the drawing of maps emphasised and bolstered specific lands and the associated national-identities, the natural resources and cultures of the native inhabitants. In early cartography, the distortion (proportionate, proximate, and commercial) of actual places and true distances established the Western cartographer's [[Geopolitics|homeland]] as the centre of the ''mapamundi''; thus British cartographers centred Britain in their maps, and drew the British islands proportionally larger than the true geography might allow. In contemporary cartography, polar-perspective maps of the northern hemisphere, drawn by American cartographers, distort real geographic spatial relations (distance, size, mass) of and between the U.S. and Russia, to emphasise American superiority (military, cultural, geopolitical) and the inferiority of the Russian Other.&lt;ref name=Fellman/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Practical perspectives===
In ''Key Concepts in Political Geography'' (2009), Alison Mountz proposed concrete definitions of the Other as a philosophic concept and term within the field of phenomenology; when used as a noun, the Other identifies and refers to a person and to a group of persons; when used as a verb, the Other identifies and refers to a category and a label for persons and things.

Post-colonial scholarship demonstrated that, in pursuit of empire, "the colonizing powers narrated an 'Other' whom they set out to save, dominate, control, [and] civilize ... [in order to] extract resources through colonization" of the homeland of the people labelled as the Other.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"&gt;Gallagher, Carolyn, Dahlman, Carl T, Gilmartin, Mary, Mountz, Alison, Shirlow, Peter. ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As facilitated by [[Orientalism|Orientalist representations]] of the non–Western Other, [[Colonialism|colonisation]]—the economic exploitation of a people and their land—is misrepresented as being for the material, spiritual, and cultural benefit of the colonised peoples.

Counter to the post-colonial perspective of the Other as part of a Dominator–Dominated binary relationship, post-modern philosophy presents the Other and Otherness as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] progress for Man and society. Public knowledge of the [[social identity]] of peoples [[Social class|classified]] as "Outsiders" is ''de facto'' acknowledgement of their being [[reality|real]], and so they are part of the [[body politic]], especially in the cities. As such, "the post-modern city is a geographical celebration of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] that moves sites once conceived of as 'marginal' to the [social] centre of discussion and analysis" of the [[Intersubjectivity|human relations]] between the Outsiders and the Establishment.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt;

'''People-first language''' ('''PFL'''),&lt;ref name="CDC-NCBDDD_on_PFL"&gt;{{Citation |author=National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities |year=2017 |title=Communicating With and About People with Disabilities |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221060943/https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-21 |access-date=2017-12-21 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''person-first language''' ('''PFL'''), is a type of [[linguistic prescription]] to avoid [[social exclusion|marginalization]] or [[dehumanization]] (either [[consciousness|conscious]] or [[subconscious]]) when discussing people with a [[health]] issue or [[disability]]. It can be a type of [[disability etiquette]] but more often is applied to any group that would otherwise be defined or mentally categorized by a condition or trait (for example, [[disease]], age, disability, or appearance) rather than as a group of people who ''have'' that condition or trait. Rather than using a [[labeling theory|label]] or an [[adjective]] to define someone, person-first language puts the person before the [[diagnosis]] and describes what the person ''has'' (for example, "a person with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]" or "a person with [[alcoholism]]"), not an assertion of what the person ''is'' (for example, "a diabetic" or "an alcoholic"). Thus a person is foremost a person and secondly a person with some trait. Advocates of person-first language point out that failing to mentally separate the person from the trait tends to reinforce a sense (even if only subconsciously) that both the trait and the person are inherently bad or inferior and thus tends to marginalize or even dehumanize the person. It also tends to implicitly reinforce a sense of permanency even regarding issues that are temporary; for example, a person with a [[substance use disorder]] has a fair chance of achieving long-term [[cure#remission|remission]]—many years in which he is healthy and productive—but calling him a "substance abuser" reinforces an unspoken sense that he is inherently and permanently tainted and casts too much doubt on maintenance of remission.

==Definition==
People-first language is a type of [[linguistic prescription]] in [[English language|English]]. It aims to avoid perceived and subconscious [[dehumanization]] when discussing people with [[disabilities]] and is sometimes referred to{{By whom|date=April 2018}} as a type of [[disability etiquette]]. People-first language can also be applied to any group that is defined by a condition rather than as a people: for example, "those that are homeless" rather than "the homeless".

Rather than using labels to define individuals with a health issue, it is more appropriate to use terminology, which describes individuals as being diagnosed with an illness or disorder. People first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has not what the person is.&lt;ref name="Lynn, 2017"&gt;Lynn, V. A. (2017). Language and HIV communication. HIV/AIDS (Auckland, NZ), 9, 183." &lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea is to use a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example, "people with disabilities" rather than "disabled people" or "disabled," in order to emphasize that "they are people first." Because it is a common practice in English to place an adjective before a noun, the adjective might be replaced with a relative clause, e.g., from "an asthmatic person" to "a person who has asthma". Furthermore, the use of [[E-Prime|''to be'' is deprecated]] {{By whom|date=April 2018}}  in favor of using ''to have''.

By using such a sentence structure, the speaker articulates the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person's identity.

==History==
The term ''[[:wikt:people-first language|people-first language]]'' first appeared in 1988 as recommended by [[advocacy group]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059–3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];''Supportive housing needs of elderly and disabled persons: hearing before the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, One Hundred First Congress, first session on S. 566 ... the National Affordable Housing Act, June 2, 1989, Volumes 22–23'': "All references to 'handicapped individuals' in the Act must be changed to 'people with disabilities{{'"}} – We join with many of our fellow advocacy organizations in emphasizing the importance of using 'people first' language throughout the Act."&lt;/ref&gt; The usage has been widely adopted by [[speech-language pathologist]]s and researchers, with "person who stutters" (PWS) replacing "stutterer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folkins |first=John |url=http://www.asha.org/publications/journals/submissions/person_first.htm |title=Resource on Person-First Language |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |date=December 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511071056/http://www.asha.org/publications/journals/submissions/person_first.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it is believed that People-first language originated in the mental health community, its origin dates back to the Denver Principles (1983), which states, "We condemn attempts to label us as "victims," a term which implies defeat, and we are only occasionally "patients," a term which implies passivity, helplessness, and dependence upon the care of others. We are "People With AIDS."

Use has been recommended in other increasingly common chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Non-profit organizations, such as the Obesity Action Coalition have expanded advocacy for People-First Language to [[obesity]]. As of 2017, 5 U.S. medical societies had pledged for it, and use it in their communications: the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, American Society of Bariatric Physicians, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obesityaction.org/weight-bias-and-stigma/people-first-language-for-obesity People-First Language for Obesity] Obesity Action Coalition, April 2013 retrieved 13 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common alternative to person-first language is usually called identity-first language, as it places the identifying condition before the personal term. For example, while someone who prefers person-first language might ask to be called a "person with autism", someone who prefers identity-first language would ask to be called an "autistic person". There is no common term for use of identifying conditions as nouns, but it is not usually preferred apart from select communities, such as [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]]. Others have proposed "person-centered language", which, instead of being a replacement linguistic rule, promotes prioritizing the preferences of those who are being referred to and argues for greater nuance in the language used to describe people and groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://radicalcopyeditor.com/2017/07/03/person-centered-language |last=Kapitan |first=Alex |year=2017 |title=On "Person-First Language": It's Time to Actually Put the Person First |publisher=Radical Copyeditor.com |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
{{main|Linguistic prescriptivism|Language and thought}}
The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is the basis for ideologically motivated [[linguistic prescriptivism]]. The hypothesis states that language use significantly shapes perceptions of the world and forms ideological preconceptions.

In people-first language, preconceptions judged to be negative arise from placing the name of the condition before the term "person" or "people", such as "white person" or "Jewish people". Proponents of people-first language argue that this places an undue focus on the condition which distracts from the humanity of the members of the community of people with the condition.

In a 2008 publication about an experiment on teen's perception of people with disabilities, scientists gathered evidence to prove why people-first language, or word order, matters. the scientists divided teenagers from a summer camp into two groups; one group was asked questions using the term "people with epilepsy" and the other group was asked using the term "epileptics". They asked the teenagers questions such as "Do you think that people with epilepsy/epileptics have more difficulties at school?" and "Do you have prejudice toward people with epilepsy/epileptics?"  The studied showed that the teenagers had a higher "stigma perception" on the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy when it came to "epileptics", as opposed to "people with epilepsy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandes|first=Paula T.|last2=De Barros|first2=Nelson F.|last3=Li|first3=Li M.|date=2009-05-01|title=Stop saying epileptic|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01899.x/abstract|journal=Epilepsia|language=en|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1280–1283|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01899.x|issn=1528-1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage guidelines==
Some U.S. organizations like the United Spinal Association have published [[disability etiquette]] guides, which prescribe people-first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedspinal.org/pdf/DisabilityEtiquette.pdf |title=Disability Etiquette |publisher=United Spinal Association |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucp.org/media/tools-for-reporters |title=Tools for Reporters: Disability Etiquette |publisher=United Cerebral Palsy |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ''[[For Dummies]]'' guide to [[etiquette]] prescribed people-first language.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Sue (2007).

John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9781118051375}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the rules of people-first language have become normative in US governmental institutions on the federal (e.g. CDC) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf Communicating With and About People with Disabilities] CDC n.d., retrieved 13 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and on state levels in the heath departments' Developmental Disabilities Councils e.g. Michigan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/5_People_1st_Language_313302_7.pdf People First Language In Proposals for Michigan Developmental Disabilities Council Grants].

== Criticism ==
Critics have objected that people-first language is awkward, repetitive and makes for tiresome writing and reading. [[C. Edwin Vaughan]], a [[sociologist]] and longtime activist for the blind, argues that since "in common usage positive pronouns usually precede nouns", "the awkwardness of the preferred language focuses on the disability in a new and potentially negative way". According to Vaughan, it only serves to "focus on disability in an ungainly new way" and "calls attention to a person as having some type of 'marred identity{{'"}} in terms of [[Erving Goffman]]'s theory of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, C. Edwin (1997). [http://www.blind.net/a-philosophy-of-blindness/individual-articles/people-first-language.html "People-First Language: An Unholy Crusade"]. National Federation of the Blind.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[National Federation of the Blind]] adopted a resolution condemning people-first language. The resolution dismissed the notion that "the word 'person' must invariably precede the word 'blind' to emphasize the fact that a blind person is first and foremost a person" as "totally unacceptable and pernicious" and resulting in the exact opposite of its purported aim, since "it is overly defensive, implies shame instead of true equality, and portrays the blind as touchy and belligerent".&lt;ref&gt;Jernigan, Kenneth (March 2009). [http://www.nfb.org/images/nfb/Publications/bm/bm09/bm0903/bm090308.htm "The Pitfalls of Political Correctness: Euphemisms Excoriated"]. ''Braille Monitor'' '''52''' (3). "Be it resolved by the National Federation of the Blind in Convention assembled in the city of Dallas, Texas, this 9th day of July, 1993, that the following statement of policy be adopted: We believe that it is respectable to be blind, and although we have no particular pride in the fact of our blindness, neither do we have any shame in it. To the extent that euphemisms are used to convey any other concept or image, we deplore such use. We can make our own way in the world on equal terms with others, and we intend to do it."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[deaf culture]], person-first language has long been rejected. Instead, deaf culture uses deaf-first language since being culturally deaf is a source of positive identity and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lum |first=Doman |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMqGhHCxXUYC&amp;pg=PA441 |title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=441 |isbn=9780840034434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct terms to use for this group would be "Deaf person" or "hard of hearing person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc_center/information_and_resources/info_to_go/educate_children_(3_to_21)/resources_for_mainstream_programs/terminology.html |title=Terminology Describing Deaf Individuals |publisher=Gallaudet University |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605054809/http://www.gallaudet.edu/Clerc_Center/Information_and_Resources/Info_to_Go/Educate_Children_(3_to_21)/Resources_for_Mainstream_Programs/Terminology.html |archivedate=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "hearing impaired" is not acceptable to most Deaf or hard of hearing people because it emphasizes what they cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq |title=Community and Culture – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Association of the Deaf |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism activist [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]] rejects person-first language, on the grounds that saying "person with autism" suggests that autism can be separated from the person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Sinclair, Jim]].

Referring to me as “a person with autism,” or “an individual with ASD” demeans who I am because it denies who I am...When we say “person with autism,” we say that it is unfortunate and an accident that a person is Autistic. We affirm that the person has value and worth, and that autism is entirely separate from what gives him or her value and worth. In fact, we are saying that autism is detrimental to value and worth as a person, which is why we separate the condition with the word “with” or “has.” Ultimately, what we are saying when we say “person with autism” is that the person would be better off if not Autistic, and that it would have been better if he or she had been born typical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/identity-first-language/|title=Identity First Language|last=Brown|first=Lydia|date=|website=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Lydia Brown]]}}

[[File:Pitch clock! (16998109219).jpg|right|250px|thumb|A pitch clock displayed at [[Werner Park]] in 2015]]
A '''pitch clock''' is used in [[college baseball]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] to limit the amount of time a [[pitcher]] uses before he throws the ball to the [[Batting (baseball)|hitter]]. This is one measure that has been introduced to improve the [[pace of play]].

==Background==
In [[college baseball]], the [[Southeastern Conference]] experimented with using pitch clocks in 2010. Pitchers were given twenty seconds to throw the pitch, or a ball would be added to the [[Count (baseball)|count]]. Similarly, a batter stepping out of the [[batter's box]] with less than five seconds on the clock will be assessed an additional strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/05/pitch-clock-for-baseball-experiment-begins-in-sec/1|title=Pitch clock for baseball? Experiment begins in SEC|work=USATODAY.COM|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2010 season, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] sought to make the pitch clocks mandatory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ncaa-ready-pitch-clock-mandatory-003000470-ncaabb.html|title=NCAA ready to make pitch clock mandatory|date=July 24, 2010|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instituted it for the 2011 college baseball season, but only for when there are no [[baserunning|runners on base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2011/03/ncaa_rules_for_college_basebal.html |title=NCAA rules for college baseball are designed to speed up the game |publisher=NOLA.com |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitch clocks made their professional debut in the [[Arizona Fall League]] in 2014. On January 15, 2015, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) announced it would institute a 20-second pitch clock in [[Minor League Baseball]] for [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] and [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] teams during the 2015 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pitch clock for Double-A, Triple-A use|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12172716/mlb-use-pitch-clock-double-triple-games|website=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitchers were given twenty seconds to throw the pitch, with the punishment of a [[Ball (baseball statistics)|ball]] awarded to the batter if not followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20150324&amp;content_id=114596202&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=pr_milb&amp;sid=milb|title=Minor Leagues announce pace-of-game rules - MiLB.com News - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|work=MiLB.com|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other rule changes addressing the [[pace of play]], the clocks contributed to a 12-minute reduction in game times at those levels between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, compared to the leagues that did not use the clock, which saw game times change from an increase of three minutes per game to a decrease in five minutes per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20151009&amp;content_id=152478810&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=toolshed&amp;sid=milb|title=Minor League Baseball Toolshed: Pitch clocks do their job in debut season - MiLB.com News - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|work=MiLB.com|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game times increased in 2016 and 2017, but were still faster than games in 2014.&lt;ref name=opinions/&gt;

MLB and the [[MLB Players Association]] (MLBPA) discussed the possibility of introducing the pitch clock at the major league level for the 2018 season.&lt;ref name=opinions&gt;{{cite web|last=Castrovince |first=Anthony |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/opinions-differ-on-mlb-pitch-clock/c-265068962 |title=Opinions differ on MLB pitch clock |publisher=MLB.com |date=January 20, 2016 |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB opted against imposing it unilaterally, over the opposition of the MLBPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USA TODAY Sports |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/02/19/mlb-no-pitch-clock-2018-but-mound-visits-warm-up-times-limited/351422002/ |title=MLB pace of play: No pitch clock in 2018, but mound visits limited |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=February 19, 2018 |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PONTIFEX''' (Planning Of Non-specific Transportation by an Intelligent Fleet EXpert) was a mid-1980s project that introduced a novel approach to complex aircraft fleet scheduling,&lt;ref&gt;P. Mertens, V. Borkowski, W. Geis, ''Betriebliche Expertensystem-Anwendungen'', Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1993, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; partially funded by the [[European Commission]]'s Strategic Programme for R&amp;D in Information Technology.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Magrassi]], "Results and progress of project 2111 Pontifex", European Strategic Programme for R&amp;D in Information Technology, Office and business systems, European Commission DGXIII, Brussels, Belgium, November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mathematical problems stemming from nontrivial fleet scheduling easily become computationally unsolvable, the PONTIFEX idea consisted in a seamless merge of [[algorithms]] and [[heuristic]] knowledge embedded in rules.&lt;ref&gt;M.Cini, P. Magrassi, "Pontifex: A Knowledge-Based DSS For Routing And Scheduling Problems", Quaderni dell'Istituto per l'Analisi dei Sistemi e l'lnformatica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Roma, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.Cini, P.

It is still in use today (2008).

'''Reciprocal determinism''' is the theory set forth by [[psychologist]] [[Albert Bandura]] which states that a person's behavior both influences and is influenced by [[personality psychology|personal factors]] and the [[social environment]]. Bandura accepts the possibility that an individual's behavior may be [[operant conditioning|conditioned]] through the use of consequences. At the same time he asserts that a person's behavior (and personal factors, such as cognitive skills or attitudes) can impact the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; These skill sets result in an under- or overcompensated ego that, for all creative purposes, is too strong or too weak to focus on pure outcome. This is important because Bandura was able to prove the strong correlation between this with experiments.

Bandura was able to show this when he created the Bandura's Box experiment.  As an example, Bandura's reciprocal determinism could occur when a child is acting out in school. The child doesn't like going to school; therefore, he/she acts out in class. This results in teachers and administrators of the school disliking having the child around. When confronted by the situation, the child admits he/she hates school and other peers don't like him/her. This results in the child acting inappropriately, forcing the administrators who dislike having him/her around to create a more restrictive environment for children of this stature. Each behavioral and environmental factor coincides with the child and so forth resulting in a continuous battle on all three levels.

Reciprocal determinism is the idea that behavior is controlled or determined by the individual, through cognitive processes, and by the environment, through external social stimulus events.  The basis of reciprocal determinism should transform individual behavior by allowing subjective thought processes transparency when contrasted with cognitive, environmental, and external social stimulus events.

Actions do not go one way or the other, as it is affected by repercussions, meaning one's behavior is complicated and can't be thought of as individual and environmental means.

Research conducted in this field include the study of doctor-patient relationships where one group of patients are termed 'physician-reliant' and the other group 'self-reliant'. The physician-reliant patients tend to be more passive in their decision making and rely on their physicians to make their choices for them. Self-reliant patients take a more active role in deciding which health options would better suit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akoul|first=Gregory M.|title=Perpetuating Passivity: Reliance and Reciprocal Determinism in Physician-Patient Interaction|journal=Journal of Health Communication: Internal Perspectives|volume=3|series=3|pages=233–259|doi=10.1080/108107398127355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===

Another relevant research is regarding the reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and mathematical performance. It shows that reciprocal determinism may not be the appropriate model in all cultures but does take place in most. Self-efficacy is a conceptualized assessment of the person's competence to perform a specific task. Self-efficacy results from success or failures that arise in attempts to learn a task. Self-efficacy, measure by a personal confidence level before each question, and the mathematical scores were obtained in 41 countries for the study by Kitty and Trevor Williams. The reciprocal determinism of mathematics self-efficacy and achievement was found in 26 of the 30 nations. They suggest that this might be a fundamental psychological process that takes place across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Williams et al.|title=Self-Efficacy and Performance in Mathematics: Reciprocal Determinism in 33 Nations|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|pages=453–466|doi=10.1037/a0017271|volume=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Albert Bandura, [[self-efficacy]] is defined as a person's belief in their capability to accomplish a certain task. Another study looked at the relationship of self-efficacy and job culture with job satisfaction among athletic trainers. The study used Bandura's triadic reciprocal causation model as a template to label job satisfaction as the behavioural factor, self-efficacy as the personal factor, and job culture as the environmental factor.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/305027215&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--Please clarify what is meant by "reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and performance" and in what way this may not be the appropriate model in all cultures.--&gt;

==Triadic reciprocal causation==
'''Triadic reciprocal causation''' is a term introduced by [[Albert Bandura]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9MRvYIh5YC&amp;pg=PA473&amp;lpg=PA473&amp;dq=triadic+reciprocal+causation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=W1H85MGefi&amp;sig=DbAABuTNweBRbLSL6jQ15Pk7bAA ''Psychology: An International Perspective'' by Michael W. Eysenck, p. 473].&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the mutual influence between three sets of factors:
* personal factors (e.g., [[cognitive]], [[affective]] and [[biological]] events),
* the environment,
* [[behavior]]

==Interaction of genes and environment==
[[Behavioral genetics]] is a relatively new field of study attempting to make sense of both [[Heredity|genetic]] and environmental contributions to individual variations in human behavior. Genes can be turned on and off. Multiple genes are factors in forming behavior traits.

===Aggression in abused boys===
Researchers believe there is a genetic link to impulsive aggression through the impact of a gene on the production of an [[enzyme]] called [[Monoamine oxidase A]] (MAOA).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas, et al. December 30, 2005. [http://intramural.nimh.nih.gov/research/pubs/lindenberg01.pdf Neural mechanisms of genetic risk for impulsivity and violence in humans.] NIMH. Accessed August 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The MAOA gene reduces the production of MAOA, leading to increased incidents of impulsive aggression. A 26-year study in [[New Zealand]] found strong correlation between experience of [[childhood abuse]] and criminal or violent behavior in males with the MAOA gene.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/01/health/main517241.shtml Study: Abuse And Genetics = Aggression] August 1, 2002. Accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In that study, impulsive aggression was found to be nine times more likely to manifest in males with the gene who were [[abused]] than in abused males without the gene or males with the gene who had not been abused.

The English phrase '''''rule of thumb''''' refers to a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. It refers to an easily learned and easily applied procedure or standard, based on practical experience rather than theory. This usage of the phrase can be traced back to the seventeenth century.

A modern [[folk etymology]] holds that the phrase derives from the maximum width of a stick allowed for [[wife-beating]] under [[English law]]; this belief may have originated in a rumored statement by the eighteenth-century judge [[Sir Francis Buller]] that a man may beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb. The rumor produced numerous jokes and satirical cartoons at Buller's expense; however, there is no record that he made such a statement.

The English jurist [[William Blackstone]] wrote in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' of an "old law" that once allowed "moderate" beatings by husbands, but did not mention thumbs or any specific implements. While wife beating has been officially outlawed for centuries in England and the United States, it continued in practice; several nineteenth-century American court rulings referred to an "ancient doctrine" that the judges believed had allowed husbands to physically punish their wives using implements no thicker than their thumbs.

The exact phrase ''rule of thumb'' first became associated with domestic abuse in the 1970s, after which the spurious legal definition was cited as factual in a number of law journals, and the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] published a report on domestic abuse titled "Under the Rule of Thumb" in 1982.

== Origin and usage ==

In English, ''rule of thumb'' refers to an approximate method for doing something, based on practical experience rather than theory.{{refn|name=OED}}{{refn|name=Wordsworth}}{{refn|name=Clapp}} The exact origin of the phrase is uncertain.{{refn|name=Martin}} Its earliest (1685) appearance in print comes from a posthumously published collection of sermons by Scottish preacher James Durham: "Many profest Christians are like to foolish builders, who build by guess, and by rule of thumb (as we use to speak), and not by Square and Rule".{{refn|name=OED}}{{refn|name=O'Conner}}

The phrase is also found in Sir William Hope's ''The Compleat Fencing Master'', 1692: "What he doth, he doth by rule of Thumb, and not by Art".{{refn|name=Safire}} James Kelly's ''The Complete Collection of Scottish Proverbs'', 1721, includes: "No Rule so good as Rule of Thumb, if it hit",{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=James Kelly}} meaning a practical approximation.{{refn|name=Safire}}

Historically, the width of the thumb, or "thumb's breadth", was used as the equivalent of an [[inch]] in the cloth trade; similar expressions existed in Latin and French as well.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Kelly}} The thumb has also been used in [[brewing]] beer, to gauge the heat of the brewing vat.{{refn|name=Wordsworth}} [[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]] writes that ''rule of thumb'' means a "rough measurement". He says that "Ladies often measure [[yard]] lengths by their thumb. Indeed, the expression 'sixteen nails make a yard' seems to point to the thumb-nail as a standard" and that "Countrymen always measure by their thumb".{{refn|name=Brewer}} According to ''Phrasefinder'', "The phrase joins [[the whole nine yards]] as one that probably derives from some form of measurement but which is unlikely ever to be definitively pinned down".{{refn|name=Martin}}

== Folk etymology ==

[[File:Judge Thumb, or - patent sticks for family correction- warranted lawful! LCCN95508959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of Sir Francis Buller in judges' robes and powdered wig, carrying bundles of rods whose ends resemble thumbs; in the background, a man with a rod raised over his head is about to strike a woman who is running away from him|Cartoon by [[James Gillray]] satirizing [[Sir Francis Buller]], 1782: "Judge Thumb; or, Patent Sticks for Family Correction: Warranted Lawful!"]]

A modern [[folk etymology]]{{refn|name=Safire}}{{refn|name=Brunvand}} relates the phrase to [[domestic violence]] via an alleged rule under [[English law]] that allowed for wife beating provided the implement used was a rod or stick no thicker than a man's thumb. While [[wife beating]] has been officially outlawed in England (and later, the United States) for centuries, enforcement of the law was inconsistent, and wife beating did continue. However, such a ''rule of thumb'' was never codified in law.{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Wilton}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}}

The English jurist [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the late 1700s in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' that by an "old law", a husband was justified in using "moderate correction" against his wife, but was barred from inflicting serious violence. According to Blackstone, by the late 1600s this custom was in doubt, and a woman was by then allowed "security of the peace" against an abusive husband{{efn|one of Blackstone's sources, the jurist [[Sir Matthew Hale]], ruled in 1674 that a husband may admonish his wife and confine her to the house, but not beat her.{{refn|name=Clapp}}}} (Blackstone did not mention either thumbs or sticks).{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}} Citing Blackstone, the twentieth-century legal scholar [[William L. Prosser]] wrote that there was "probably no truth to the legend" that a husband was allowed to beat his wife "with a stick no thicker than his thumb".{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}}

The association between the thumb and implements of domestic violence can be traced to the year 1782, when the English judge [[Sir Francis Buller]] was ridiculed for purportedly stating that a husband could beat his wife, provided he used a stick no wider than his thumb.{{efn|Whether Buller was supposed to have meant his own thumb or the husband's is unknown. One history states, "A witty countess is said to have sent the next day to require the measurements of his thumb, that she might know the extent of her husband's right".{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}}}} There is no record of Buller making such a statement; however, the rumor generated much satirical press, with Buller being mocked as "Judge Thumb" in published jokes and cartoons.{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=Foyster}}

In the following century, several court rulings in the United States referred to a supposed common-law doctrine that the judges believed had once allowed wife beating with an implement smaller than a thumb.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wilton}} None of these courts referred to such a doctrine as a ''rule of thumb'' or endorsed such a rule. However, all allowed for some degree of wife beating so long as it did not result in serious injury.{{refn|name=Clapp}}

An 1824 court ruling in [[Mississippi]] stated that a man was entitled to enforce "domestic discipline" by striking his wife with a whip or stick no wider than the judge's thumb. In a later case in [[North Carolina]] (''State v. Rhodes'', 1868), the defendant was found to have struck his wife "with a switch about the size of this fingers"; the judge found the man not guilty due to the switch being smaller than a thumb.{{refn|name=Wilton}} The judgement was upheld by the state supreme court, although the later judge stated:

{{quote|Nor is it true that a husband has a right to whip his wife. And if he had, it is not easily seen how {{em|the thumb}} is the standard of size for the instrument which he may use, as some of the old authorities have said [...] The standard is the {{em|effect produced}}, and not the manner of producing it, or the instrument used.{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=Wilton}}}}

In 1873, also in North Carolina, the judge in ''State v. Oliver'' ruled, "We assume that the old doctrine that a husband had the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not the law in North Carolina".{{refn|name=Wilton}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}} These latter two cases were cited by the legal scholar [[Beirne Stedman]] when he wrote in a 1917 law review article that an "old common law rule" had permitted a husband to use "moderate personal chastisement on his wife" so long as he used "a switch no larger than his thumb".{{refn|name=Kelly}}{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}}

By the late 19th century, most American states had outlawed wife beating; some had severe penalties such as [[forty lashes]] or imprisonment for offenders. There was a common belief in parts of the United States that a man was permitted to beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb; however, this belief was not connected with the phrase ''rule of thumb'' until the 1970s.{{refn|name=Wilton}}

In the 20th century, public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first, and then re-emerged in the 1970s along with the resurgent [[feminist movement]].{{refn|name=Clapp}} The first recorded link between wife beating and the phrase ''rule of thumb'' appeared in 1976, in a report on domestic violence by women's-rights advocate [[Del Martin]]: {{quote|For instance, the common-law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband 'the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb'{{emdash}}a rule of thumb, so to speak.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wilton}}}}

While Martin appears to have meant the phrase ''rule of thumb'' only as a figure of speech, some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law.{{refn|name=O'Conner}}{{refn|name=Wilton}} The following year, a book on battered women stated: {{quote|One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the 'rule of thumb'. Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating [...] The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only 'a rod not thicker than his thumb.' In other words, wifebeating was legal.{{refn|name=Davidson}}}}

Despite this erroneous reading of the common law (which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections) the spurious legal doctrine of the "rule of thumb" was soon mentioned in a number of law journals.{{refn|name=Clapp}}{{refn|name=Kelly}} The myth was repeated in a 1982 report by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] on domestic abuse titled "Under the Rule of Thumb", as well as a later United States Senate report on the [[Violence Against Women Act]].{{refn|name=Clapp}}

In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase ''rule of thumb'',{{refn|name=Kelly}} which was seen as [[taboo]] owing to this false origin.{{refn|name=Clapp}} [[Patricia T. O'Conner]], former editor of the ''New York Times Book Review'', described it as "one of the most persistent myths of political correctness".{{refn|name=O'Conner}} During the 1990s, several authors, including the conservative social critic [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], wrote about the false etymology of ''rule of thumb''.{{refn|name=Clapp}} Sommers analyzed the history of the phrase and its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson}} Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.{{refn|name=Clapp}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">'''Saint-Venant's principle''', named after [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant]], a [[French people|French]] [[elasticity (mathematics)|elasticity theorist]],  may be expressed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus Edward Hough Love|A. E. H. Love]], "A treatise on the mathematical theory of elasticity," Cambridge University Press, 1927. (Dover reprint {{ISBN|0-486-60174-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... the difference between the effects of two different but statically equivalent loads becomes very small at sufficiently large distances from load.}}

The original statement was published in French by Saint-Venant in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. C. B. Saint-Venant,  1855, Memoire sur la Torsion des Prismes, Mem. Divers Savants, 14, pp. 233–560.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this informal statement of the principle is well known among structural and mechanical engineers, more recent mathematical literature gives a rigorous interpretation in the context of partial differential equations. An early such interpretation was made by [[Richard von Mises|von Mises]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Mises, On Saint-Venant's Principle. Bull. AMS, 51, 555–562, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saint-Venant's principle allows elasticians to replace complicated stress distributions or weak boundary conditions with ones that are easier to solve, as long as that boundary is geometrically short. Quite analogous to the [[electrostatics]], where the [[electric field]] due to the ''i''-th moment of the load (with 0th being the net charge, 1st the [[dipole]], 2nd the [[quadrupole]]) decays as &lt;math&gt;1/r^{i+2} &lt;/math&gt;  over space, Saint-Venant's principle states that high order momentum of mechanical load (moment with order higher than [[torque]]) decays so fast that they never need to be considered for regions far from the short boundary. Therefore, the Saint-Venant's principle can be regarded as a statement on the [[asymptotic]] behavior of the [[Green's function]] by a point-load.

'''Mary Salynn (Selyn) McCollum''' was the only white female [[Freedom Rider]] during the leg from [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on May 17, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arsenault|first1=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justics|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University|isbn=9780195136746|pages=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZAA-hS178UC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=salynn+mccollum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F5KAKlHkJQ&amp;sig=V5DtCpgF1rkvLQRikWKpgF6ZrsU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHXWVI2LI8mzggSwoYGgBg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=salynn%20mccollum&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born to Hilda and Walter McCollum in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] on April 6, 1940, her family moved around during her childhood. She eventually ended up in Amherst, New York where she attended junior high and high school. She has one sister named Rhonda.  Though admitted to [[Syracuse University]], McCollum's family wanted her to return to the South as both her parents were born and raised in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College and SNCC==

After graduation, she matriculated in 1958 at [[Peabody College|George Peabody College for Teachers]]{{efn|Now known as Peabody College of Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt University}} in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  Her course of study focused on instruction for intellectually and developmentally disabled students. Although she was an undergraduate, she took some graduate level courses. During one such course, she met a [[Fisk University]] professor, Lester Carr,  who shared her interest in developmentally challenged children. Professor Carr invited McCollum to visit [[Fisk University]] to see a classroom of autistic children. He also invited her to come hear [[Kelly Miller Smith]] speak at First Baptist, Capitol Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Participation in Civil Rights Movement'''

McCollum attended training sessions led by Reverend [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]] on non-violent protesting and also nightly meetings about desegregating downtown Nashville. The workshops were not tactical but instead focused on how to handle hostile citizens who opposed the student demonstrations. After the workshops and meetings, the college students would socialize and eat dinner at a restaurant on Jefferson Street.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1961, she attended a [[Nashville Student Movement]] meeting as a guest of Central Committee Member, Prof. Carr.

As a result of her participation in the [[Freedom Rides]], and the strife it caused within the college administration her professor, Leonard J. Lucito,  arranged for her to attend [[Southern Illinois University]], where she was able to complete her studies.  While at SIU, she helped organize lunch counter demonstrations with a few local students and even led a non-violent workshop using what she had learned from Lawson and her Nashville sit in experience. At one of these sit-ins with ten other protesters, she was assaulted with a knife and received a four-five inch cut on the back of her thigh. She was refused hospital care and ended up being driven to East St. Louis to receive care. This event garnered much attention in local and national newspapers. Soon John Lewis joined her in [[Cairo, Illinois]].  Upon completion of her course work she returned to Nashville and used scholarship money she received from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr to continue participating in the Movement while student teaching kindergarten on the Peabody's campus.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCollum visited Highlander Folk School during her time in [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]]. In the beginning of 1962, McCollum began working full-time for [[SNCC]] in Atlanta. Her duties included handling voter registration in Georgia, fundraising, and public speaking at churches throughout the South. She did not attend the [[March on Washington]] because by that time she had developed a dislike of being in large unorganized crowds probably due to her experiences in [[Cairo, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom Rides==

There were ten [[Freedom Riders]]—two whites ([[Jim Zwerg]] and Salynn McCollum) and eight African Americans ([[John Robert Lewis|John Lewis]], William Barbee, Paul Brooks, Charles Butler, Allen Carson, Bill Harbour, Catherine Burks, and Lucretia Collins). McCollum was sent as an observer to report back to [[Diane Nash]] and was under orders not to be arrested with the other Riders. Leo Lillard drove her to [[Pulaski, Tennessee]] where she joined the other [[Freedom Riders]]. While some sources say McCollum missed the Nashville bus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arsenault|first1=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justics|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University|isbn=9780195136746|pages=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZAA-hS178UC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=salynn+mccollum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F5KAKlHkJQ&amp;sig=V5DtCpgF1rkvLQRikWKpgF6ZrsU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHXWVI2LI8mzggSwoYGgBg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=salynn%20mccollum&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; she remembers this as an intentional decision to board someplace else to keep herself separate from the group and to try to provide a little protection.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Freedom Riders]] did not converse during the rides as to maintain as much anonymity as possible. It was evident though they had been discovered by the time they reached the Alabama state line as armed gunmen were posted along the highway to Birmingham. Upon arrival at the Birmingham bus depot, she attempted to disembark to report back to Nash what was happening but was prevented from leaving the bus. All the passengers were detained for a period of time. Then the regular passengers were let off the bus, but not the [[Freedom Riders]]. When the Freedom Riders were finally let off the bus, McCollum joined Catherine Burks and Lucretia Collins thereby identifying herself as a Freedom Rider. By then, she had made the phone call to [[Diane Nash]] to inform her of what was happening in Birmingham. Eventually, they arrested all ten of them and took them to jail.

McCollum was separated from the other female Freedom Riders due to her race and held with the white women prisoners. When the white prisoners discovered she was a Freedom Rider, they beat her up and stole her candy and cigarettes. She stayed in jail about three or four days and was eventually released to her father's custody. Her parents were very disappointed and disapproved of her participation in the movement. Then, she was driven to Memphis in a police car by a patrolman and Birmingham Chief of Police [[Bull Conner]]. Once in Memphis, McCollum and her father flew back to Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Freedom Rides==

After her tenure with [[SNCC]], McCollum took a job as a Day Care Center Director in Harlem for about twenty years. Then, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where she trained dogs, rode horses, and traveled. In 2000, she moved back to Tennessee where she lived with her sister, Rhonda McCollum and family, in [[Nunnelly, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights Oral History Project, Salynn McCollum, Special Collections Division, Nashville Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt; She died on May 1, 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12368">The [[Serbian language]] is one of the officially recognized minority languages in [[Croatia]]. It is primarily used by the [[Serbs of Croatia]]. The [[Croatian Constitution]], [[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]], [[Law on Education in language and script of national minorities]] and [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] define the public co-official usage of Serbian in Croatia. Serbian and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] are two [[standard language|standardized]] [[Variety (linguistics)#Standard varieties|varieties]] of the [[Pluricentric language|pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language]]. Majority of Serbs of Croatia use [[Ijekavian]] pronunciation of [[Proto-Slavic]] vowel [[Yat|jat]] except in the [[Podunavlje]] region in [[Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja]] Counties where local Serb population use [[Ekavian]] pronunciation. Post-[[World War II]] and [[Croatian War of Independence]] settlers in Podunavlje which have come from [[Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]] or Western Slavonia either use their original Ijekavian pronunciation, adopted Ekavian pronunciation or both of them depending on context. In 2011 Census majority of Serbs of Croatia declared Croatian standardized variety as their first language with Ijekavian pronunciation always being required standard form in Croatian. While Serbian variety recognizes both pronunciations as standard Ekavian is the more common one as it is the dominant one in [[Serbia]], with Ijekavian being mostly limited to [[Republika Srpska]] in Bosnia, [[Montenegro]] and Croatia.

==History==
The Orthodox [[liturgical book]] [[Varaždin Apostol]] from 1454 represents the oldest preserved text in [[Cyrillic]] from the territory of today's Croatia.&lt;ref name="biskupija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biskupija-varazdinska.hr/OLD/Aktualno/Aktualnosti_2005/Aktualno823.htm |title=A823 |publisher=Biskupija-varazdinska.hr |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights, one of only two constitutional laws in country, entered into force on 23 December 2002.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] urged the Croatian government to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=93697 |title=UN calls on Croatia to ensure use of Serbian Cyrillic |format= |author = [[B92]] |date=3 April 2015  |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted the [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia|use of Serbian Cyrillic in Vukovar]] and municipalities concerned.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian Foreign Minister [[Ivica Dačić]] said that his country welcomes the UN Human Rights Committee's report.&lt;ref name="Tanjug-UN Serbia reaction"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tanjug.rs/news/172551/serbia-welcomes-un-stance-on-use-of-cyrillic-in-croatia.htm |title = Serbia welcomes UN stance on use of Cyrillic in Croatia |format =  |author = [[Tanjug]] |date = 3 April 2015 |accessdate = 2015-04-11 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150411211332/http://www.tanjug.rs/news/172551/serbia-welcomes-un-stance-on-use-of-cyrillic-in-croatia.htm |archivedate = 11 April 2015 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serbian language education==
[[File:Škola u Trpinji.jpg|thumbnail|right|bi-lingual plate in front of the school in [[Trpinja]]]]
[[File:Dalj_Street_sign.JPG|thumbnail|right|Bilingual street sign in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] in [[Dalj]], eastern [[Croatia]]]]
Most schools with instruction in Serbian are located in [[Vukovar-Srijem County|Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja County]] in the area of former [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–98)|Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] where rights on education in minority languages were provided during the [[United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]] based on the  [[Erdut Agreement]]. Today with those schools there is also [[Kantakuzina Katarina Branković Serbian Orthodox Secondary School]] in [[Zagreb]].

In the school year 2010-2011, 3.742 students attended kindergartens, primary and secondary schools in Serbian.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/PeriodicalReports/CroatiaPR5_hr.pdf | title=Peto izvješće Republike Hrvatske o primjeni Europske povelje o regionalnim ili manjinskim jezicima | date=October 2013 | author=Government of Croatia | publisher=[[Council of Europe]] | page=36 | language=hr | format=PDF | accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59 educational institutions offered Serbian language education that year and 561 educators and teachers worked in them.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt; In school year 2011-2012 the total number of students was 4.059 in 63 educational institutions and 563 educators and teachers worked in them.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt; Number of classes or groups in this period increased from 322 to 353.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt;

As a chair at the Department of [[South Slavic languages]], [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] has a The Chair of [[Serbian literature|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrin literature]].&lt;ref name="Filozofski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/slaven/juzslav/en/about-the-department/the-chair-of-serbian-and-montenegrin-literature/ | title=The Chair of Serbian and Montenegrin Literature | date= | author=[[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] | publisher=[[University of Zagreb]] | page= | language=en | format= | accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the others, lecturers of Serbian literature at the university over the time included [[Antun Barac]], [[Đuro Šurmin]] and [[Armin Pavić]].&lt;ref name="Filozofski"/&gt;

==Other forms of cultural autonomy==
Various minority organizations use Serbian in their work. One of them, [[Association for Serbian language and literature in Croatia]] from [[Vukovar]] is a nonprofit professional organization that brings together scientists and technical workers in the Republic of Croatia engaged in studying and teaching of Serbian language and literature.

==The co-official use at local government level==
The [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] provides for a mandatory co-official use of minority languages in [[municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy. Municipalities [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]], [[Gvozd]], [[Jagodnjak]], [[Šodolovci]], [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo]], [[Trpinja]], [[Markušica]], [[Negoslavci]], [[Biskupija]], [[Ervenik]], [[Kistanje]], [[Gračac]], [[Udbina]], [[Vrbovsko]], [[Donji Kukuruzari]], [[Erdut]] and [[Vukovar]], according to the provisions of law, are obliged to grant equal co-official use of Serbian language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Law enforcement is facing great resistance in the part of the majority population, most notably in the case of Vukovar where it led to [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia]].

'''Social alienation''' is "a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of [[social interaction|integration]] or [[Value (ethics)|common values]] and a high degree of distance or [[social isolation|isolation]] between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment".&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement", ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management'', vol. 22, no. 2 (1999): 120–32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[sociology|sociological]] concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Esp., [[Emile Durkheim]], 1951, 1984; [[Erich Fromm]], 1941, 1955; [[Karl Marx]], 1846, 1867; [[Georg Simmel]], 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin-Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).

==History==
The term ''alienation'' has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense of achieving a higher state of [[contemplation]], [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to [[neoplatonic]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] (in the Greek ''alloiosis''). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The [[New Testament]] mentions the term ''apallotrioomai'' in Greek—"being alienated from". Ideas of estrangement from a [[Golden Age]], or due to a [[fall of man]], or approximate equivalents in differing [[cultures]] or [[religions]], have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as [[Gnosticism]].

Alienation has also had a particular [[legal]]-[[political]] meaning since at least [[Ancient Roman]] times, where to [[Alienation (property law)|alienate]] property (''alienato'') is to transfer [[ownership]] of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'' which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from ''alius'', meaning "other" or "another". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by [[physicians]] referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced [[physiology]]. In Latin ''alienatio mentis'' (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;E Regis (1895) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14035276M/A_practical_manual_of_mental_medicine A practical manual of mental medicine] 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E. Régis; with a preface by [[Benjamin Ball (physician)|M. Benjamin Ball]]; authorized translation by H.M. Bannister; with introduction by the author. Published 1895 by Blakiston in Philadelphia. Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica asylum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to [[Felix Platter]].

In [[medieval]] times, a relationship between alienation and [[social order]] has been described, mediated in part by [[mysticism]] and [[monasticism]]. The [[Crusades]] and [[witch-hunts]] have been described as forms of mass alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), "Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order," Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233–259 (stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/pss/2854675)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century &lt;!--Linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
In the 17th century, [[Hugo Grotius]] put forward the concept that everyone has '[[Sovereignty|sovereign]] authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early [[social contract]] theory. In the 18th century, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] introduced a distinction between [[Natural and legal rights|alienable and unalienable rights]] in the legal sense of the term. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a [[state of nature]] due to the expansion of [[civil society]] or the [[nation state]].

In the same century a law of [[alienation of affection]] was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.

In the history of literature, the [[German Romantics]] appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.&lt;ref&gt;Rado Pribic (2008) [http://dspace.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/660 Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism], Lafayette College, Easton, PA&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 19th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] popularized a Christian ([[Lutheran]]) and [[Idealist]] philosophy of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/alienation/v-1 "Alienation".]&lt;/ref&gt; He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the [[self]] was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.

Around the same time, [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his '[[moral treatment]]' approach, and developed related theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dora B. Weiner [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft638nb3db&amp;chunk.id=d0e13621&amp;toc.id=d0e13621&amp;brand=ucpress Nine: Mind and Body in the Clinic] in Rousseau, G.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs5PRR9-8BcC Madness and Civilization], 1964/2001, p. 209. Also known (unabridged) as [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5Pyfip2P1gC History of Madness] 1961/2006, p. 372. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two camps formed following Hegel, the [[Young Hegelians|'young' or 'left' Hegelians]] who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the [[Right Hegelians|'old' or 'right' Hegelians]] who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.

===Marx===
{{Main|Marx's theory of alienation}}
Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's [[dialectic]] model to a theory of [[historical materialism|(historical) materialism]]. [[Marx's theory of alienation]] is articulated most clearly in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846). The [[Young Marx|'young' Marx]] wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-[[anthropological]] ([[Marxist humanism]]) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a [[structural]]-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Vandenberghe [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEpXcGXP274C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Philosophical History of German Sociology] Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by [[Kostas Axelos]]: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the ''economic and social alienation'' aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of [[capitalism]]. Essentially, there is an "exploitation of men by men" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging [[industry|industrial]] production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the [[human being]]. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would take the analysis further in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in ''The German Ideology'' (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in [[labour (economics)|work]] each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism "work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products." "The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdue, William D., ''Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology'', Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell Ollman (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society] Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Political Alienation'' refers to the idea that "politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy" in a way that is alienating because it "distorts the logic of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Human Alienation'', individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where "they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls "historical conditions." The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more "needs" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 113)&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to ''ideological alienation'', Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from "their true happiness" and instead turn them towards "illusory happiness".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 161-162)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word ''alienation'', and similar words such as ''estrangement'', are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, ''[[:de:Entfremdung|Entfremdung]]'' and ''[[:de:Entäußerung|Entäußerung]]''. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote "''Entfremdung''...constitutes the real interest of this ''Entäußerung''."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arthur (1986), ''The Dialectics of Labor'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1800s to 1900s===
Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] wrote critical works on [[individualism|individualization]] and [[urbanization]]. Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'' (''Community and Society'') is about the loss of primary relationships such as [[family|familial]] bonds in favour of [[Objective (goal)|goal]]-oriented, secondary [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.

The American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]'' in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, "On the Meaning of Alienation", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8).  Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement," ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.

In a broader [[philosophy|philosophical]] context, especially in [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], alienation describes the inadequacy of the human [[being]] (or the [[mind]]) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by [[Kierkegaard]]'s notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described the "thing-in-itself" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is "reflective consciousness". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the [[human condition]]). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the "Other"  (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their [[self-consciousness]] has a "masochistic desire" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play ''[[No Exit]]'', "Hell is other people".

In the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] developed around the start of the 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and [[unconscious mind]], between different parts of a hypothetical [[psychic apparatus]], and between the self and [[civilization]]. It postulates [[defense mechanisms]], including [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of [[false consciousness]] associated with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] (2001) [http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/felix/pfge15.pdf Alienation, Sociology of] in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of [[Western Marxism]] developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by [[György Lukács]]. Critics of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Protestant Ethic]] also drew on the works of [[Max Weber]].

Figures associated with [[critical theory]], in particular with the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also developed theories of alienation, drawing on [[neo-Marxist]] ideas as well as other influences including [[neo-Freudian]] and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of [[commodification]] to the cultural, educational and [[Political party|party-political]] spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) [http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_6/pangilinan_december2009.pdf Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm] Kritike, Vol3, No2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the revolutionary group [[Situationist International]] came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to [[advanced capitalism]], the latter conceptualized as a diffuse '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. [[The Theory of Communicative Action]] associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]] emphasizes the essential role of [[language]] in [[public sphere|public life]], suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of [[Market (economics)|market]] forces and [[State (polity)|state]] power.

This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Dahms, H. "Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory." In [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIZctokjRlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation]. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA).  In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[globalization]], the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and [[post-modernism]] (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.

==Powerlessness==
Alienation in the sense of a lack of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] has been technically defined by Seeman as "the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks." Seeman argues that this is "the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the [[prerogative]] and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 784)&lt;/ref&gt;  More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, "A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing".

In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist [[Julian Rotter]]. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external [[locus of control]], which means "differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1966: 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.

More recently, Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Geyer (1996: xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that "a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an [[overchoice]] of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom". Geyer adapts [[cybernetics]] to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed [[feedback]]: "The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions.  Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with [[apathy]] and alienation as a result".

==Meaninglessness==
A sense of [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] has been defined by Seeman as "the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 786)&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes.  In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to [[powerlessness]]; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".

Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: "With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis."  "[[Information overload]]" or the so-called "data tsunami" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.

==Normlessness==
Normlessness (or what [[Durkheim]] referred to as [[anomie]]) "denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 787)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, "The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals".  This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.

Neal &amp; Collas (2000: 122) write, "Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms.  Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct".  This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: "The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well.  The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily "negative": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.

==Relationships==
One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of [[parental alienation]], where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have [[divorced]] or [[legal separation|separated]]).  The term is not applied where there is [[child abuse]]. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the [[social dynamics]] of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of [[attachment theory|attachment]], the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. [[Adoptees]] can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjlifton.com/journey.htm Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial estrangement between parents and adult children "is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns." The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013).

==Social isolation==
Social isolation refers to "The feeling of being segregated from one's community".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"&gt;(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: "While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world.  With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships."

Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], migrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. [[Diaspora]] literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as [[Hafid Bouazza]] in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, "Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005.  The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits".

==Among returning war veterans==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}
Because of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, William M., "Trauma of Iraq war haunting thousands returning home," ''USA Today'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, "We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society."&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 26"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 27"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, "They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview", ''Military History'', Weider History Group, Inc. Leesburg, VA, November 2012. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that "even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Mokenhaupt, Brian, [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26372/esq0307essay/ "I Miss Iraq. I Miss My Gun. I Miss My War,"] ''Esquire,'' June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, Psychologist, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C, "Perspectives," ''Vietnam'' magazine, August 2002: 58–61. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief'', October 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political alienation==
One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the [[political system]]. Such [[political alienation]] could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in [[revolution]], [[reform]]ing behavior, or [[abstention]] from the political process, possibly due to [[voter apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Schwartz [https://books.google.com/books?id=7wOVheiteOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Political Alienation and Political Behavior] Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is [[policy alienation]], where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a [[policy]] programme being implemented.

==Self-estrangement==
Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider [[self-estrangement]] to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as "the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying]], activities...".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"/&gt; It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely "self" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness.  On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional [[discourse]]s themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of "self-estrangement" rather than "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of [[essentialism]] and [[economic determinism]] well", the concept still has value if a [[Lacanian]] reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the [[concept of self]] between [[humanism]] and [[antihumanism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]], or [[nature]] and [[nurture]].

==Mental disturbance==
Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from [[psychoanalytic]] theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as [[schizoid personality]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. [[R. D. Laing]] was particularly influential in arguing that [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]] and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and [[ontological security|ontological insecurity]] in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank (1975) [http://www.positivedisintegration.com/Johnson1975.pdf Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement] Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaker|first=P.

In a related vein, for [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]], psychology ''normalizes'' conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as [[critical psychology]] or [[liberation psychology]], which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DnX73bkC0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting] Introduction; Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Zizek]] (drawing on [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to "enjoy!" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).

[[Frantz Fanon]], an early writer on [[postcolonialism]], studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to [[mental disorders]] among the [[colonized]] in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).

A process of '[[malignant]] alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the [[suicide]] of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation.

==Disability==
Differences between persons with [[disability|disabilities]] and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, "Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. (1989), [http://sfaa.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,10;journal,90,279;linkingpublicationresults,1:113218,1 Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness], ''Human Organization'', Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226–235&lt;/ref&gt; found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: [[social rejection]] by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in [[marginalization]] of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.

Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.&lt;ref&gt;Janice L. Willms [http://www.annals.org/content/126/11/923.extract Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion] Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younger|first=JB|title=The alienation of the sufferer.|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=June 1995|volume=17|issue=4|pages=53–72|pmid=7625781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Alienation is most often represented in [[literature]] as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''. In addition, ''[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]'' is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', ''[[Black Boy]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'', ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQLTOk18LwMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation] Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include ''[[The Child in Time]]'', ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', and ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (Senekal, 2008 &amp; 2010b: 102–123).

Sociologist [[Harry Dahms]] has analysed [[The Matrix Trilogy]] of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of ''[[The Matrix]]'' is the "all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [http://web.utk.edu/~hdahms/Emergence.pdf THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation.] Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]'s concept album ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and British [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17042">'''Space charge''' is a concept in which excess [[electric charge]] is treated as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when [[charge carriers]] have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region. Space charge usually only occurs in [[dielectric]] media (including [[vacuum]]) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or [[Electric field screening|screened]]. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a [[metal]] object when it is heated to [[incandescence]] in a [[vacuum]]. This effect was first observed by [[Thomas Edison]] in light bulb [[Electrical filament|filament]]s, where it is sometimes called the [[Edison effect]], but space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and [[solid-state electronic]] devices.

==Cause==

===Physical explanation===
When a metal object is placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is sufficient to cause [[electron]]s to "boil" away from the surface [[atom]]s and surround the metal object in a cloud of free electrons. This is called [[thermionic emission]]. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby positively charged object, thus producing an electric current which passes through the vacuum.

Space charge can result from a range of phenomena, but the most important are:

# Combination of the current density and spatially [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|inhomogeneous]] resistance
# [[Ionization]] of species within the dielectric to form heterocharge
# Charge injection from electrodes and from a stress enhancement
# [[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]] in structures such as [[Electrical treeing|water tree]]s.  "Water tree" is a name given to a tree-like figure appearing in a water-impregnated polymer insulating cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that in [[alternating current]] (AC) most carriers injected at [[Electrode|electrodes]] during a half of cycle are ejected during the next half cycle, so the net balance of charge on a cycle is practically zero. However, a small fraction of the carriers can be trapped at levels deep enough to retain them when the field is inverted. The amount of charge in AC should increase slower than in [[direct current]] (DC) and become observable after longer periods of time.

==== Hetero and homo charge ====
Hetero charge means that the polarity of the space charge is opposite to that of neighboring electrode, and homo charge is the reverse situation. Under high voltage application, a hetero charge near the electrode is expected to reduce the breakdown voltage, whereas a homo charge will increase it. After polarity reversal under ac conditions, the homo charge is converted to hetero space charge.

===Mathematical explanation===
If the "[[vacuum]]" has a [[pressure]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; mmHg or less, the main [[vehicle]] of conduction is [[electron]]s. The emission current density ''(J'') from the [[cathode]], as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of its thermodynamic [[temperature]] ''T'', in the absence of space-charge, is given by [[Richardson's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;J = (1-\tilde{r})A_0T^2\exp\left(\frac{-\phi}{kT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = \frac{4\pi e m_e k^2}{h^3} \approx 1.2 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;  A m&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
:''e'' = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge),
:''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = electron mass,
:''k'' = [[Boltzmann's constant]] = 1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt;J/K,
:''h'' = [[Planck's constant]] = 6.62 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J s,
:''&amp;phi;'' = [[work function]] of the cathode,
:''ř'' = mean electron reflection coefficient.

The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For [[Tungsten]], (1 - ř)A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6 to 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A m&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''&amp;phi;'' = 4.52 eV. At 2500&amp;nbsp;°C, the emission is 28207 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some [[pulse]]d [[valves]] such as the [[cavity magnetron]]. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the [[Coulomb's law|repulsion]] of the [[cloud]] of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the ''space charge effect''. In the limit of large current densities, ''J'' is given by the Child-Langmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above.

==Occurrence==
Space charge is an inherent property of all [[vacuum tube]]s. This has at times made life harder or easier for [[electrical engineer]]s who used tubes in their designs. For example, space charge significantly limited the practical application of [[triode]] [[amplifier]]s which led to further innovations such as the vacuum tube [[tetrode]].

On the other hand, space charge was useful in some tube applications because it generates a negative [[Electromotive force|EMF]] within the tube's envelope, which could be used to create a negative bias on the tube's grid. Grid bias could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage. This could improve the engineer's control and fidelity of amplification. It allowed to construct ''space charge tubes'' for [[Vehicle audio|car radios]] that required only 6 or 12 volts anode voltage (typical examples were the 6DR8/EBF83, 6GM8/ECC86, 6DS8/ECH83, 6ES6/EF97 and 6ET6/EF98).

Space charges can also occur within [[dielectric]]s. For example, when gas near a high voltage electrode begins to undergo [[dielectric breakdown]], electrical charges are injected into the region near the electrode, forming space charge regions in the surrounding gas. Space charges can also occur within solid or liquid dielectrics that are stressed by high [[electric fields]]. Trapped space charges within solid dielectrics are often a contributing factor leading to dielectric failure within high voltage power cables and capacitors.

=== In vacuum (Child's law) ===&lt;!--'Child's law' redirects here--&gt;
[[Image:ChildLangmuirLawGraph1.png|Graph showing Child-Langmuir Law. S and d are constant and equal to 1.|thumb]]

First proposed by [[Clement D. Child]] in 1911, Child's law states that the space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a plane-parallel vacuum diode varies directly as the three-halves power of the anode voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and inversely as the square of the distance ''d'' separating the cathode and the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Child |first=C. D. |authorlink=Clement D. Child |title=Discharge From Hot CaO |journal=Physical Review | series = Series I |date=1 May 1911 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=492–511 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevSeriesI.32.492 |bibcode = 1911PhRvI..32..492C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For electrons, the current density ''J'' (amperes per meter squared) is written:
:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{ I_a }{ S } =\frac{4 \epsilon_0}{9}\sqrt{2 e / m_e} \frac{V_a^{3/2}}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the anode current and ''S'' the anode surface inner area; &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is its mass. The equation is also known as the "three-halves power" law and as the Child–Langmuir law. Child originally derived this equation for the case of atomic ions, which have much smaller ratios of their charge to their mass. [[Irving Langmuir]] published the application to electron currents in 1913, and extended it to the case of cylindrical cathodes and anodes.

The equation's validity is subject to the following assumptions:
# Electrons travel ballistically between electrodes (i.e., no scattering).
# In the interelectrode region, the space charge of any ions is negligible.
# The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface.

The assumption of no scattering (ballistic transport) is what makes the predictions of Child–Langmuir Law different from those of Mott–Gurney Law. The latter assumes steady-state drift transport and therefore strong scattering.

=== In semiconductors ===

In semiconductors and insulating materials, an electric field causes charged particles, electrons, to reach a specific drift velocity that is parallel to the direction of the field. This is different from the behavior of the free charged particles in a vacuum, in which a field accelerates the particle. The proportionality factor between the magnitudes of the drift velocity, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[electron mobility|mobility]], &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \mu \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Drift regime (The Mott Gurney law) ====&lt;!--'Mott–Gurney law' redirects here--&gt;

The Child's Law behavior of a space charge limited current that applies in a vacuum diode doesn't generally apply to a semiconductor/insulator in a single-carrier device, and is replaced by the Mott-Gurney law. For a thin slab of material of thickness &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, sandwiched between two selective Ohmic contacts, the electric current density, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, flowing through the slab is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mott |first1=Nevill F. |last2=Gurney |first2=R. W. |title=Electronic Processes in Ionic Crystals, 1st ed. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murgatroyd |first=P. N. J. |journal=J. Phys. D |title=Theory of space-charge-limited current enhanced by Frenkel effect |year=1970 |volume=3 |page=151 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/3/2/308|bibcode = 1970JPhD....3..151M }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{9}{8} {\epsilon}{\mu} \frac{{V_a}^{2}}{{L}^3}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage that has been applied across the slab and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permitivity]] of the solid. The Mott-Gurney law offers some crucial insight into charge-transport across an intrinsic semiconductor,
namely that one should not expect the drift current to increase linearly with the applied voltage, i.e., from [[Ohm's law]], as one would expect
from charge-transport across a metal or highly doped semiconductor. Since the only unknown quantity in the Mott-Gurney law is the charge-carrier mobility, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is commonly used to characterize charge transport in intrinsic semiconductors. Using the Mott-Gurney law for characterizing amorphous semiconductors, along with semiconductors containing defects and/or non-Ohmic contacts, should however be approached with caution as significant deviations both in the magnitude of the current and the power law dependence with respect to the voltage will be observed. In those cases the Mott-Gurney law can not be readily used for characterization, and other equations which can account for defects and/or non-ideal injection should be used instead. 

During the derivation of the Mott-Gurney law, one has to make the following assumptions:
# There is only one type of charge carrier present, i.e., only electrons or holes.
# The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other.
# The carrier mobility, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and the permittivity, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, are constant throughout the sample.
# The current flow is not limited by traps or energetic disorder.
# The current is not predominantly due to doping.
# The electric field at the charge-injecting electrode is zero, meaning that the current is governed by drift only.

As an application example, the steady-state space-charge-limited current across a piece of intrinsic silicon with a charge-carrier mobility of 1500 &amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V-s, a dielectric constant of 11.9, an area of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a thickness of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; cm can be calculated by an [http://www.popproperty.net/PopularTools/Semiconductor/SpaceChargeLimited.aspx on line calculator] to be 126.4 μA at 3 V. Note that in order for this calculation to be accurate, one must assume all the points listed above.

==== Low voltage regime ====

In the case where a very small applied bias is applied across the single-carrier device, the current is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Levie|first=R. |last2=Seidah|first2=N. G. |last3=Moreira|first3=H.  |journal=J. Membrane Biol. |title=Transport of Ions of One Kind through Thin Membranes |year=1972 |volume=10 |page=171 |doi=10.1007/BF01867852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Mensfoort |first=S. |last2=Coehoorn|first2=R  |journal=Physical Review B |title=Effect of Gaussian Disorder on the Voltage Dependence of the Current Density in Sandwich-Type Devices based on Organic Semiconductors |year=2008 |volume=78 |page=085207(16)|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.78.085207|bibcode=2008PhRvB..78h5207V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Röhr |first=J. A. |last2=Kirchartz|first2=T. |last3=Nelson|first3=J.  |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |title=On the Correct Interpretation of the Low Voltage Regime in Intrinsic Single-Carrier Devices |year=2017 |volume=29 |page=205901|doi=10.1088/1361-648X/aa66cc|bibcode=2017JPCM...29t5901R}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J=4{\pi}^2 \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{q} {\mu}{\epsilon} \frac{{V_a}}{{L}^3}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}T&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal energy. Note that the equation describing the current in the low voltage regime follows the same thickness scaling as the Mott-Gurney law, &lt;math&gt;L^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;, but increases linearly with the applied voltage.

====Saturation regimes====

When a very large voltage is applied across the semiconductor, the current can transition into a saturation regime. 

In the velocity-saturation regime, this equation takes the following form
:&lt;math&gt;J=2{\epsilon}{v}\frac{{V_a}}{{L}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Note the different dependence of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; between the Mott-Gurney law and the equation describing the current in the velocity-saturation regime.  In the ballistic case (assuming no collisions), the Mott-Gurney equation takes the form of the more familiar Child-Langmuir law.

In the charge-carrier saturation regime, the current through the sample is given by,
:&lt;math&gt;J={q}{\mu}{N_\mathrm{eff}}\frac{{V_a}}{{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective [[density of states]] of the charge carrier type in the semiconductor.

== Shot noise ==
Space charge tends to reduce [[shot noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terman |first=Frederick Emmons |authorlink=Frederick Terman |title=Radio Engineers' Handbook |edition=first |year=1943 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=286&amp;ndash;294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot noise results from the random arrivals of discrete charge; the statistical variation in the arrivals produces shot noise.&lt;ref name="Terman292-3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Terman|1943|pp=292&amp;ndash;293}}&lt;/ref&gt; A space charge develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the space charge density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the space charge can reduce the number of carriers emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Terman|1943|pp=286&amp;ndash;287}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the space charge limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.&lt;ref name="Terman292-3"/&gt;

[[File:Bohumil_Kubišta_-_St_Sebastian.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''''St Sebastian''''' is a 20th-century painting by the Bohemian artist [[Bohumil Kubišta]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063619/CZR_280_006.html|title=St Sebastian, 1912|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Sebastian]] was a Christian matryr. It is held in the [[National Gallery in Prague]].

The picture is painted on in oils on canvas and has dimensions of 98 x 74,5&amp;nbsp;cm. It is one of the most important works of Bohumil Kubishta, member of the pre-First World War Czech avant-garde. Unlike traditional Christian interpretations of the theme of suffering of the Christian martyr, Bohumil Kubishta combines cubist forms and expressiveness, but integrates spiritual strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Hieronymus Bosch 075.jpg|thumb|A detail from [[The Haywain Triptych]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
A '''stabbing''' is [[penetrating trauma|penetration]] with a sharp or pointed object at close range. ''Stab'' connotes purposeful action, as by an [[Assassination|assassin]] or [[murder]]er, but it is also possible to accidentally stab oneself or others. Stabbing differs from [[Slashing (crime)|slashing]] or [[cutting]] in that the motion of the object used in a stabbing generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim's body, rather than being drawn across it.

Stabbings today are common among [[gangs]] and in [[prisons]] because knives are cheap, easy to acquire (or manufacture), easily concealable and relatively effective. In 2013 about 8 million stabbings occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Assassinato luigi.jpg|thumb|After being attacked and stabbed, empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] boarded a ship, unaware of the severity of her condition as consequence of an [[acute stress reaction]]. Bleeding to death from a puncture wound to the heart, Elisabeth's last words were, "What happened to me?"]]
Stabbings have been common throughout human history and were the means used to [[assassinate]] a number of distinguished historical figures, such as Second [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] and [[Roman emperor]]s [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Caligula]].

In Japan, the historical practice of stabbing oneself deliberately in [[ritual suicide]] is known as ''[[seppuku]]'' (more colloquially ''hara-kiri'', literally "belly-cutting" since it involves cutting open the abdomen). The ritual is highly codified, and the person committing suicide is assisted by a "second" who is entrusted to decapitate him cleanly (and thus expedite death and prevent an undignified spectacle) once he has made the abdominal wound.

==Mechanism==
The human [[skin]] has a somewhat elastic property as a self-defense; when the human body is stabbed by a thin object such as a small kitchen knife, the skin often closes tightly around the object and closes again if the object is removed, which can trap some blood within the body. It has thus been speculated that the [[fuller (weapon)|fuller]], an elongated concave depression in a metal blade, functions to let blood out of the body in order to cause more damage. This misconception has led to fullers becoming widely known as "blood grooves". The fuller is actually a structural reinforcement of the blade similar in design to a metal I-beam used in construction. However, [[internal bleeding]] is just as dangerous as external bleeding; if enough blood vessels are severed to cause serious injury, the skin's elasticity will do nothing to prevent blood from exiting the circulatory system and accumulating uselessly in other parts of the body.

Death from stabbing is caused by [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], severe [[blood loss]], infection, or loss of function of an essential organ such as the [[heart]] and/or [[lung]]s.

==Medical treatment==
{{further|Stab wound}}
Although previously a victim of abdominal stabbing would be subject to exploratory surgery [[laparotomy]], it is now considered safe not to operate if the patient is stable.  In that case, they should be observed for signs of decompensation indicating a serious injury.  In the event that the patient initially presents stabbing injuries and is unstable, laparotomy should be initiated to discover and rectify any internal injury.

==Autopsy examination==
When someone who has sustained a stab wound dies, the body is autopsied and the wound is inspected by a [[forensic pathologist]]. Such examination can yield valuable information about the weapon used to produce the injury. From the external appearance and internal findings, the pathologist will usually be able to offer opinion about the dimensions of the weapon including the width and minimum possible length of the blade. It is possible to determine whether the weapon was single edged or double edged.&lt;ref name=Biju&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=Biju|author2=Ajay Balachandran |author3=Anu Sasidharan |author4=Ramakrishanan U K |author5=Prem T N |author6=Thomas Jerry |title=Unusual Incised Stab Wound Produced by a Single Edged Weapon: A Case Report|journal=Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology|date=22 July 2013|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1–3|doi=10.5958/j.0973-9130|url=http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ijfmt&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=2&amp;article=001|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes factors like the taper of the blade and movement of knife in the wound can also be determined. [[Bruise]]s or [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] may give information about the [[Knife#Parts|guard]].&lt;ref name=Biju/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">A '''statite''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''static'' and ''satellite'') is a hypothetical type of artificial [[satellite]] that employs a [[solar sail]] to continuously modify its [[orbit]] in ways that [[gravity]] alone would not allow. Typically, a statite would use the solar sail to "hover" in a location that would not otherwise be available as a stable [[geosynchronous orbit]]. Statites have been proposed that would remain in fixed locations high over [[Earth]]'s poles, using reflected [[sunlight]] to counteract the gravity pulling them down. Statites might also employ their sails to change the shape or velocity of more conventional orbits, depending upon the purpose of the particular statite.

The concept of the statite was invented independently (and approximately simultaneously) by [[Robert L. Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward Patent"&gt;{{Ref patent | country = US | number = 5183225 | status = patent | title = Statite: Spacecraft That Utilizes Light Pressure and Method of Use |  gdate = 1993-02-02 | pridate =  | inventor = Robert L.

L.: "Halo Orbits for Solar Sails --- Dynamics and Applications," ESA Journal, Vol. 13, 1989, pp.229-234&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with the type of [[halo orbit]] invented by Robert Farquhar). Subsequently, the terms "non-[[Keplerian orbit]]" and "artificial [[Lagrange point]]" have been used as a generalization of the above terms.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

No statites have been deployed to date, as solar sail technology is still in its infancy. NASA's cancelled [[Sunjammer (spacecraft)|Sunjammer]] solar sail mission had the stated objective of flying to an artificial Lagrange point near the Earth/Sun L1 point, to demonstrate the feasibility of the [http://wiki.solarsails.info/index.php?title=Geostorm Geostorm] [[geomagnetic storm]] warning mission concept proposed by NOAA's [[Patricia Mulligan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulligan|first1=Patricia|title=Solar Sails for the Operational Space Community|journal=Spaceviews|date=August 1998|volume=8|issue=3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotype threat has been argued to show a reduction in the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M | last2 = Spencer | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Aronson | first3 = Joshua  | author-link1 = Claude Steele | contribution = Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat | editor-last = Zanna | editor-first = Mark P. | title = Advances in experimental social psychology, volume 34 | pages = 379–440 | publisher = Academic Press | location = Amsterdam | isbn = 9780120152346 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M. | author-link = Claude Steele |title=A threat in the air: How stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance|journal=American Psychologist|volume=52|issue=6|year=1997|pages=613–629|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.6.613|pmid=9174398|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.9608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the theory, if negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, group members are likely to become [[Anxiety|anxious]] about their performance, which may hinder their ability to perform to their full potential. Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. It is hypothesized that the mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting [[working memory]] (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).&lt;ref name="BeilockEtAl2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beilock|first1=Sian L.|last2=Rydell|first2=Robert J.|last3=McConnell|first3=Allen R.|title=Stereotype threat and working memory: Mechanisms, alleviation, and spillover|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=136|issue=2|year=2007|pages=256–276|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.136.2.256|pmid=17500650|citeseerx=10.1.1.669.9881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, studies have cautioned that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-world performance gaps.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"/&gt; One review has voiced concerns that the effect has been over-estimated for schoolgirls and that the field likely suffers from [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Flore2014" /&gt;

Stereotype threat is purportedly a contributing factor to long-standing [[Race and intelligence|racial]] and [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gaps]] in academic performance. It may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative stereotype because stereotype threat is thought to arise from a particular situation, rather than from an individual's [[personality trait]]s or characteristics. Since most people have at least one [[social identity]] which is negatively stereotyped, most people are vulnerable to stereotype threat if they encounter a situation in which the stereotype is relevant. Situational factors that increase stereotype threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the stereotype to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of stereotype threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the stereotyped group. These effects are also increased when they expect [[discrimination]] due to their identification with a negatively stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Spencer | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Aronson | first3 = Joshua | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2601(02)80009-0 | title = Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat | series = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 34 | pages = 379–440 | date = 2002 | isbn = 9780120152346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lead to a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.&lt;ref name="GilovichKeltner2006"&gt;{{citation|author-last1=Gilovich|author-first1=Thomas|author-last2=Keltner|author-first2=Dacher |author-last3=Nisbett|author-first3= Richard E. | contribution = Being a member of a stigmatized group: stereotype threat |editor-last1=Gilovich|editor-first1=Thomas|editor-last2=Keltner|editor-first2=Dacher |editor-last3=Nisbett|editor-first3= Richard E. | title = Social psychology | pages = 467–468 | publisher = W.W.

The opposite of stereotype threat is '''stereotype boost''', which is when people perform better than they otherwise would have, because of exposure to [[positive stereotype]]s about their social group. A variant of stereotype boost is '''stereotype lift''', which is people achieving better performance because of exposure to negative stereotypes about other social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Original study==
[[File:Stereotype threat bw.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"The Effects of Stereotype Threat on the Standardized Test Performance of College Students (adjusted for group differences on SAT)". From J. Aronson, C.M. Steele, M.F. Salinas, M.J. Lustina, ''Readings About the Social Animal'', 8th edition, ed. E. Aronson]]
In 1995, [[Claude Steele]] and Joshua Aronson performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance.&lt;ref name=SteeleAronson /&gt; They had African-American and [[European American|European-American]] college students take a difficult verbal portion of the [[Graduate Record Examination]] test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students did not perform as well on the test. Steele and Aronson split students into three groups: stereotype-threat (in which the test was described as being "diagnostic of intellectual ability"), non-stereotype threat (in which the test was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability"), and a third condition (in which the test was again described as nondiagnostic of ability, but participants were asked to view the difficult test as a challenge). All three groups received the same test.

Adjusted for previous SAT scores, subjects in the non-diagnostic-challenge condition performed significantly better than those in the non-diagnostic-only condition and those in the diagnostic condition. In the first experiment, the race-by-condition interaction was marginally significant. However, the second study reported in the same paper found a significant interaction effect of race and condition. This suggested that placement in the diagnostic condition significantly impacted African Americans compared with European Americans.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

Steele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test could reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task. They found that African Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words associated with relevant negative stereotypes (e.g., completing "__mb" as "dumb" rather than as "numb").&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

==Further empirical studies==
More than 300 published papers show the effects of stereotype threat on performance in a variety of domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diversity.arizona.edu/sites/diversity/files/stereotype_threat_overview.pdf |title=Stereotype Threat: An Overview |last1=Stroessner |first1=Steve |last2=Good |first2=Catherine |website=diversity.arizona.edu |publisher=Reducing Stereotype Threat.org |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the stereotype threat that occurs depends on how the task is framed. If a task is framed to be neutral, stereotype threat is not likely to occur; however, if tasks are framed in terms of active stereotypes, participants are likely to perform worse on the task. For example, a study on chess players revealed that female players performed more poorly than expected when they were told they would be playing against a male opponent. In contrast, women who were told that their opponent was female performed as would be predicted by past ratings of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Anne|last2=D'Ettole|first2=Claudio|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|title=Checkmate?

Researchers Vishal Gupta, Daniel Turban, and Nachiket Bhawe extended stereotype threat research to [[entrepreneurship]], a traditionally male-stereotyped profession. Their study revealed that stereotype threat can depress women's entrepreneurial intentions while boosting men's intentions. However, when entrepreneurship is presented as a gender-neutral profession, men and women express a similar level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name = "Stereotype Threat and Entrepreneurial Intentions"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=V.

When it was described as a test of athletic ability, European-American students performed worse, but when the description mentioned intelligence, African-American students performed worse.&lt;ref name="StoneLynch1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Lynch|first2=Christian I.|last3=Sjomeling|first3=Mike|last4=Darley|first4=John M.|title=Stereotype threat effects on Black and White athletic performance|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=77|issue=6|year=1999|pages=1213–1227|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1213|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.5039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have demonstrated how stereotype threat can negatively affect the performance of European Americans in athletic situations&lt;ref name="White Men Can't Jump"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Perry|first2=W.|last3=Darley|first3=John|title="White Men Can't Jump": Evidence for the Perceptual Confirmation of Racial Stereotypes Following a Basketball Game|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|year=1997|pages=291–306|issn=0197-3533|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1903_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the performance of men who are being tested on their social sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat in Men"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Anne M.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.|title=Stereotype Threat in Men on a Test of Social Sensitivity|journal=Sex Roles|volume=52|issue=7–8|year=2005|pages=489–496|issn=0360-0025|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-3714-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the framing of a task can produce stereotype threat in most individuals, certain individuals appear to be more likely to experience stereotype threat than others. Individuals who highly identify with a particular group appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing stereotype threat than individuals who do not identify strongly with the stereotyped group.

The mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat. In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right, whereas women who took the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.&lt;ref name="InzlichtBen-Zeev2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inzlicht|first1=M.|last2=Ben-Zeev|first2=T.|title=A Threatening Intellectual Environment: Why Females Are Susceptible to Experiencing Problem-Solving Deficits in the Presence of Males|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=5|year=2000|pages=365–371|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00272|pmid=11228906|citeseerx=10.1.1.24.1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a study conducted by Desert, Preaux, and Jund in 2009 was to see if children from lower [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic groups]] are affected by stereotype threat. The study compared children that were 6–7 years old with children that were 8–9 years old from multiple elementary schools. These children were presented with the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's Matrices]] test, which is an intellectual ability test. Separate groups of children were given directions in an evaluative way and other groups were given directions in a non-evaluative way. The "evaluative" group received instructions that are usually given with the Raven Matrices test, while the "non-evaluative" group was given directions which made it seem as if the children were simply playing a game. The results showed that third graders performed better on the test than the first graders did, which was expected. However, the lower socioeconomic status children did worse on the test when they received directions in an evaluative way than the higher socioeconomic status children did when they received directions in an evaluative way. These results suggested that the framing of the directions given to the children may have a greater effect on performance than socioeconomic status. This was shown by the differences in performance based on which type of instructions they received. This information can be useful in classroom settings to help improve the performance of students of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desert|first=Michael|author2=Marie Preaux |author3=Robin Jund |title=So young and already victims of stereotype threat: Socio-economic status and performance of 6 to 9 years old children on Raven's progressive matrices|journal=European Journal of Psychology of Education|year=2009|volume=24|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1007/BF03173012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been studies on the effects of stereotype threat based on age. A study was done on 99 senior citizens ranging in age from 60–75 years. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories such as memory and physical abilities, and were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. Additionally, they were asked to read articles that contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors, and they watched someone reading the same articles. The goal of this study was to see if priming the participants before the tests would affect performance. The results showed that the control group performed better than those that were primed with either negative or positive words prior to the tests. The control group seemed to feel more confident in their abilities than the other two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Sean|author2=Joseph Baker |author3=William Pearce |author4=Janice Deakin |title=Immunity to Popular Stereotypes of Aging?

Many psychological experiments carried out on Stereotype Threat focus on the physiological effects of negative stereotype threat on performance, looking at both high and low status groups. Scheepers and Ellemers tested the following hypothesis: when assessing a performance situation on the basis of current beliefs the low status group members would show a physiological threat response, and high-status members would also show a physiological threat response when examining a possible alteration of the status quo(Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=Ellemers|first2=Naomi|date=March 2005|title=When the pressure is up: The assessment of social identity threat in low and high status groups|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=41 |issue=2|pages=192–200|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.06.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment were in line with expectations. As predicted, participants in the low status condition showed higher blood pressure immediately after the status feedback, while participants in the high-status condition showed a spike in blood pressure while anticipating the second round of the task.

In 2012, Scheepers et al. hypothesized that when high social power is stimulated 'an efficient cardiovascular pattern (challenge)' is produced, whereas, 'an inefficient cardiovascular pattern' or threat is caused by the activation of low social power (Scheepers, de Wit, Ellemers &amp; Sassenberg, 2012). Two experiments were carried out in order to test this hypothesis. The first experiment looked at power priming and the second experiment related to role play. Both results from these two experiments provided evidence in support for the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=de Wit|first2=Frank|last3=Ellemers|first3=Naomi|last4=Sassenberg|first4=Kai|date=January 2012|title=Social power makes the heart work more efficiently: Evidence from cardiovascular markers of challenge and threat|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48 |issue=1|pages=371–374|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.06.014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype lift and stereotype boost==
Stereotype threat concerns how stereotype cues can harm performance. However, in certain situations, stereotype activation can also lead to performance enhancement through stereotype lift or stereotype boost. Stereotype lift increases performance when people are exposed to negative stereotypes about another group.&lt;ref name="Walton 2003 456–467"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=G. M.|author2=Cohen, G.

C. |editor=Inzlicht, M. |editor2=Schmader, T.|chapter=Stereotype boost: Positive outcomes from the activation of positive stereotypes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype boost occurs when a positive aspect of an individual's social identity is made salient in an identity-relevant domain. Although stereotype boost is similar to stereotype lift in enhancing performance, stereotype lift is the result of a negative outgroup stereotype, whereas stereotype boost occurs due to activation of a positive [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] stereotype.&lt;ref name="Shih, M. J. 2012 141–156"/&gt;

Consistent with the positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, [[Asian American]] women performed better on a math test when their Asian identity was [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] compared to a [[Treatment and control groups|control condition]] where no social identity was primed.

==Mechanisms==
Although numerous studies demonstrate the effects of stereotype threat on performance, questions remain as to the specific cognitive factors that underlie these effects. Steele and Aronson originally speculated that attempts to suppress stereotype-related thoughts lead to anxiety and the narrowing of [[attention]]. This could contribute to the observed deficits in performance. In 2008, [[Toni Schmader]], Michael Johns, and Chad Forbes published an integrated model of stereotype threat that focused on three interrelated factors:
# [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] arousal; 
# performance monitoring, which narrows attention; and, 
# efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name="Schmader2008"/&gt;

A number of studies looking at physiological and neurological responses support Schmader and colleagues' integrated model of the processes that produce stereotype threat.

With regard to performance monitoring and vigilance, studies of brain activity have supported the idea that stereotype threat increases both of these processes.

[[File:Gray727 anterior cingulate cortex.png|thumb|right|300px|Researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC).]]

Another study used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to investigate brain activity associated with stereotype threat. The researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC), a neural region thought to be associated with social and emotional processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The negative consequences of threat: A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying women's underperformance in math | year = 1995 | journal = Psychological Science | pages = 168–175 | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | last1 = Krendle | first1 = Anne C. | last2 = Richeson | first2 = Jennifer A. | last3 = Kelley | first3 = William M. | last4 = Heatherton | first4 = Todd F. |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02063.x | pmid=18271865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wraga and colleagues found that women under stereotype threat showed increased activation in the ventral ACC and that the amount of this activation predicted performance decrements on the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wraga|first1=M.|last2=Helt|first2=M.|last3=Jacobs|first3=E.|last4=Sullivan|first4=K.|title=Neural basis of stereotype-induced shifts in women's mental rotation performance|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=1|year=2006|pages=12–19|issn=1749-5016|doi=10.1093/scan/nsl041|pmid=18985116|pmc=2555429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals were made aware of performance-related stimuli, they were more likely to experience stereotype threat.

A study conducted by Boucher, Rydell, Loo, and Rydell has shown that stereotype threat not only affects performance, but can also affect the ability to learn new information. In the study, undergraduate men and women had a session of learning followed by an assessment of what they learned. Some participants were given information intended to induce stereotype threat, and some of these participants were later given "gender fair" information, which it was predicted would reduce or remove stereotype threat. As a result, participants were split into four separate conditions: control group, stereotype threat only, stereotype threat removed before learning, and stereotype threat removed after learning. The results of the study showed that the women who were presented with the "gender fair" information performed better on the math related test than the women who were not presented with this information. This study also showed that it was more beneficial to women for the "gender fair" information to be presented prior to learning rather than after learning. These results suggest that eliminating stereotype threat prior to taking mathematical tests can help women perform better, and that eliminating stereotype threat prior to mathematical learning can help women learn better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boucher|first=Kathryn L.|author2=Robert Rydell |author3=Katie Van Loo |author4=Michael Rydell |title=Reducing Stereotype threat in order to facilitate learning|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2012|volume=42|issue=2|pages=174–179|doi=10.1002/ejsp.871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decreased performance is the most recognized consequence of stereotype threat.

In the long run, the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to disidentify with the stereotyped group. For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as "a math person" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. This disidentification is thought to be a psychological coping strategy to maintain [[self-esteem]] in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Learning in a Man's World"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Jennifer|last2=James|first2=Jacquelyn B.|last3=Barnett|first3=Rosalind Chait|title=Learning in a Man's World: Examining the Perceptions of Undergraduate Women in Male-Dominated Academic Areas|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1|year=2002|pages=46–50|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated exposure to anxiety and nervousness can lead individuals to choose to distance themselves from the stereotyped group.

Although much of the research on stereotype threat has examined the effects of coping with negative stereotype on academic performance, recently there has been an emphasis on how coping with stereotype threat could "spillover" to dampen self-control and thereby affect a much broader category of behaviors, even in non-stereotyped domains.&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=Kang, Sonia|title=Stereotype threat spillover: How coping with threats to social identity affects, aggression, eating, decision-making, and attention|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=99|issue=3|pages=467–481|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20&amp;%20Kang,%202010.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0018951|pmid=20649368|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003450/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20%26%20Kang%2C%202010.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.600.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Michael Inzlicht]] and colleagues suggest that, when women cope with negative stereotypes about their math ability, they perform worse on math tests, and that, after completing the math test, women may continue to show deficits even in unrelated domains. For example, women might overeat, be more aggressive, make more risky decisions,&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover" /&gt; and show less endurance during physical exercise.&lt;ref name="ego depletion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=McKay, Linda|author3=Aronson, Joshua|title=Stigma as ego-depletion: How being the target of prejudice affects self-control|journal=Psychological Science|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=262–269|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Inzlicht,%20McKay,%20&amp;%20Aronson.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01695.x|pmid=16507068|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003531/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Inzlicht%2C%20McKay%2C%20%26%20Aronson.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived discrimination associated with stereotype threat can also have negative long-term consequences on individuals' [[mental health]].

==Mitigation==
Additional research seeks ways to boost the test scores and academic achievement of students in negatively stereotyped groups. There are many ways to combat the effects of stereotype threat.

# Have participants engage in [[self-affirmation]], which is a process in which participants write about a value that is important to them. In 2006, researchers Geoffrey L. Cohen, Julio Garcia, Nancy Apfel, and Allison Master found that a self-affirmation exercise (in the form of a brief in-class writing assignment) significantly improved the grades of African-American middle-school students, and reduced the racial achievement gap by 40%.

==Criticism==
The stereotype threat explanation of [[achievement gap]]s has attracted criticism. According to Paul R. Sackett, Chaitra M. Hardison, and Michael J. Cullen, both the media and scholarly literature have wrongly concluded that eliminating stereotype threat could completely eliminate differences in test performance between European Americans and African Americans.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On interpreting stereotype threat as accounting for African American-White differences on cognitive tests|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=7–13|date=January 2004|pmid=14736315|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.7|url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1935-990X|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404150510/http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sackett et al. have pointed out that, in Steele and Aronson's (1995) experiments where stereotype threat was removed, an achievement gap of approximately one [[standard deviation]] remained between the groups, which is very close in size to that routinely reported between African American and European Americans' average scores on large-scale standardized tests such as the SAT. In subsequent correspondence between Sackett et al. and Steele and Aronson, Sackett et al. wrote that "They [Steele and Aronson] agree that it is a misinterpretation of the Steele and Aronson (1995) results to conclude that eliminating stereotype threat eliminates the African American-White test-score gap."&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On the Value of Correcting Mischaracterizations of Stereotype Threat Research|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|year=2004|pages=48–49|issn=1935-990X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.48|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050208/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur R. Jensen]] criticised stereotype threat theory on the basis that it invokes an additional mechanism to explain effects which could be, according to him, explained by other, well-known, and well-established theories, such as test anxiety and especially the [[Yerkes–Dodson law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yerkes | first1 = Robert M. | author-link1 = Robert M. Yerkes | last2 = Dodson | first2 = John D. | author-link2 = John Dillingham Dodson | title = The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation | journal = [[The Journal of Comparative Neurology|Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–482 | doi = 10.1002/cne.920180503 | date = November 1908 | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Yerkes/Law/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jensen's view, the effects which are attributed to stereotype threat may simply reflect "the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a function of test complexity".&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;{{citation | last = Jensen | first = Arthur Robert | author-link = Arthur Robert Jensen | contribution = Population differences in ''g'': causal hypotheses | editor-last = Jensen | editor-first = Arthur Robert | editor-link = Arthur Robert Jensen | title = The g factor: the science of mental ability | pages = 513–515 | publisher = Praeger | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780275961039| quote = ''the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject.

They further articulate that, "Yerkes and Dodson may have the dubious distinction to be the most highly cited, but largely unread, paper in the history of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = David M. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = Adam M. | last3 = Park | first3 = Collin R. | last4 = Halonen | first4 = Joshua | last5 = Zoladz | first5 = Phillip R. | title = The temporal dynamics model of emotional memory processing: a synthesis on the neurobiological basis of stress-induced amnesia, flashbulb and traumatic memories, and the Yerkes-Dodson Law | journal = [[Neural Plasticity (journal)|Neural Plasticity]] | volume = 2007 | id = 60803 | page = 60803 | doi = 10.1155/2007/60803 | pmid = 17641736 | pmc = 1906714  | date = 2007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wei | first = Thomas E. | title = Stereotype threat, gender, and math performance: evidence from the national assessment of educational progress | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228776168 | format = web | publisher = [[Harvard University]] | date = October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wei examined [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|real-world testing]] over a broad population (rather than lab assessments with questionable [[external validity]]), and found a reverse stereotype threat: a randomly assigned question actually raised female students' scores by 0.05 standard deviations.

Gijsbert Stoet and [[David C. Geary]] reviewed the evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of the achievement gap in mathematics between men and women. They concluded that the relevant stereotype threat research has many methodological problems, such as not having a control group, and that the stereotype threat literature on this topic misrepresents itself as "well established". They concluded that the evidence is in fact very weak.&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

=== Publication bias ===

[[File:FloreAndWicherts2015 meta analysis sex stereotype threat.png|thumb|Meta-analysis of stereotype threat on girls showing asymmetry typical of publication bias. From Flore, P. C., &amp; Wicherts, J. M. (2014)&lt;ref name="Flore2014"/&gt;]]

The strength and type of the effect has also been questioned. Flore and Wicherts concluded the reported effect is small, but also that the field is inflated by [[publication bias]]. They argue that, correcting for this, the most likely true effect size is near zero (see meta-analytic plot, highlighting both the restriction of large effect to [[Statistical power|low-powered]] studies, and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active).&lt;ref name="Flore2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flore|first1=Paulette C.|last2=Wicherts|first2=Jelte M.|title=Does stereotype threat influence performance of girls in stereotyped domains? A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of School Psychology|volume=53|issue=1|year=2014|pages=25–44|issn=0022-4405|doi=10.1016/j.jsp.2014.10.002|pmid=25636259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. For instance, Ganley et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganley|first=Colleen M.|author2=Mingle, Leigh A.|author3=Ryan, Allison M.|author4=Ryan, Katherine|author5=Vasilyeva, Marina|author6=Perry, Michelle|title=An Examination of Stereotype Threat Effects on Girls' Mathematics Performance|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1 January 2013|doi=10.1037/a0031412|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1886–1897|pmid=23356523|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719005546/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2014|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.353.4436}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined math stereotype threat in a well-powered (total N ~ 1000) multi-experiment study. This allowed examination of potential moderators such as age and implicit vs explicit methods. Significant gender differences in math were found, but "no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat" was found. Further, they found that evidence for stereotype threat in children reflects [[publication bias]]: large, well-controlled studies find smaller or non-significant effects, while among the many [[Statistical power|underpowered]] studies run, researchers selectively published those in which [[false-positive]] effects reached significance:&lt;ref name=Ganley2013/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;nonsignificant findings were almost always reported in an article along with some significant stereotype threat effects found either at another age (Ambady et al., 2001; Muzzatti &amp; Agnoli, 2007), only with certain students (Keller, 2007), on certain items (Keller, 2007; Neuville &amp; Croizet, 2007), or in certain contexts (Huguet &amp; Regner, 2007, Study 2; Picho &amp; Stephens, 2012; Tomasetto et al., 2011). Importantly, none of the three unpublished dissertations showed a stereotype threat effect. This observation suggests the possibility that publication bias is occurring. Publication bias refers to the fact that studies with null results are often not written up for publication or accepted for publication (Begg, 1994). This bias is a serious concern, especially if these results are being used to make recommendations for interventions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''t''-closeness''' is a further refinement of [[l-diversity|''l''-diversity]] group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation. This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The ''t''-closeness model extends the ''l''-diversity model by treating the values of an attribute distinctly by taking into account the distribution of data values for that attribute.

==Attacks on ''l''-diversity==
This is useful because in real data sets attribute values may be skewed or semantically similar. However, accounting for value distributions may cause difficulty in creating feasible ''l''-diverse representations. The ''l''-diversity technique is useful in that it may hinder an attacker leveraging the global distribution of an attribute's data values in order to infer information about sensitive data values. Not every value may exhibit equal sensitivity, for example, a rare positive indicator for a disease may provide more information than a common negative indicator. Because of examples like this, ''l''-diversity may be difficult and unnecessary to achieve when protecting against attribute disclosure.  Alternatively, sensitive information leaks may occur because while ''l''-diversity requirement ensures “diversity” of sensitive values in each group, it does not recognize that values may be semantically close, for example, an attacker could deduce a stomach disease applies to an individual if a sample containing the individual only listed three different stomach diseases.

==Formal definition==
Given the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred based upon the distribution of values for ''l''-diverse data, the ''t''-closeness method was created to further ''l''-diversity by additionally maintaining the distribution of sensitive fields. The original paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| url = https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui/papers/t_closeness_icde07.pdf
| title = ''t''-Closeness: Privacy beyond ''k''-anonymity and ''l''-diversity
| authors = Ninghui Li, Tiancheng Li, and Suresh Venkatasubramanian
| journal = ICDE

| date = 
| publisher = Purdue University
| doi = 10.1109/ICDE.2007.367856
| quote = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ninghui Li, Tiancheng Li, and [[Suresh Venkatasubramanian]] defines ''t''-closeness as:

{{quote|'''The ''t''-closeness Principle:''' An equivalence class is said to have ''t''-closeness if the distance between the distribution of a sensitive attribute in this class and the distribution of the attribute in the whole table is no more than a threshold ''t''. A table is said to have ''t''-closeness if all equivalence classes have ''t''-closeness.}}

Charu Aggarwal and [[Philip S. Yu]] further state in their book on [[differential privacy|privacy-preserving]] [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Privacy-Preserving Data Mining – Models and Algorithms
| url = http://charuaggarwal.net/generalsurvey.pdf
| chapter = A General Survey of Privacy
| editor1 = Charu C. Aggarwal
| editor2 = Philip S. Yu
| publisher = Springer
| isbn = 978-0-387-70991-8
| year = 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;that with this definition, threshold ''t'' gives an upper bound on the difference between the distribution of the sensitive attribute values within an anonymized group as compared to the global distribution of values. They also state that for numeric attributes, using ''t''-closeness anonymization is more effective than many other privacy-preserving data mining methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2128">'''Trigger list''' in its most general meaning refers to a list whose items are used to initiate ("trigger") certain actions.

== United States: Private financial information==

In the [[United States]], when a person applies for a [[mortgage loan]], the [[lender]] makes a credit inquiry about the potential borrower from the national credit bureaus, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]] and [[TransUnion]]. Unless the borrower is opted out, the credit bureaus put the applicants  onto a "trigger list" of "leads" about persons who are interested in new loans. These lists are sold to numerous lenders all over the United States, and soon after the application the applicant starts receiving offers from all parts of the country. The trigger lists contain a significant amount of personal financial information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://realtytimes.com/rtcpages/20060911_mortgageapps.htm Home Mortgage Applications "Trigger" Sales of Private Financial Information]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the buyers of trigger lists are "lead generators" which resell filtered information to borrowers, e.g., of people who live in a certain area and have a certain [[credit score]].

While the [[Federal Trade Commission]] considers the market of "trigger lists" to be a legal business, many people and organizations (such as the [[National Association of Mortgage Brokers]]) consider this a serious breach of privacy and lobby for putting this practice under regulatory controls.

As of now, American consumers may [[opt-out]] from "trigger lists" by calling  1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/protect.shtm FTC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear non-proliferation==
The [[Zangger Committee]] and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] maintain lists of items that may contribute to nuclear proliferation; The [[nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] forbids its members to export such items to non-treaty members. these items are said to trigger the countries' responsibilities under the NPT, hence the name.

A '''USB dead drop''' is a [[USB]] mass storage device installed in a [[public space]]. For example, a [[USB flash drive]] might be mounted in an outdoor brick wall and fixed in place with fast concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public are implicitly invited to find files, or leave files, on a dead drop by directly plugging their [[laptop]] into the wall-mounted [[USB stick]] in order to transfer data.  (It is also possible to use [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablet]]s for this purpose, by utilizing a [[USB On-The-Go|USB on-the-go]] cable.)  The dead drops can therefore be regarded as an anonymous, offline, [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] network.  However, in practice USB dead drops are [[USB dead drop#Comparison to other types of data transfer|often used for social or artistic reasons]], rather than for practical ones.

==Background and history== 
The Dead Drops project was conceived by [[Berlin]]-based conceptual artist [[Aram Bartholl]], a member of New York's [[Fat lab]] art and technology collective. The first USB dead drop network of five devices was started by Bartholl in October 2010 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/mar/08/dead-drops-what-to-do-if-you-see-a-usb-stick-sticking-out-of-a-wall|title=Dead Drops: what to do if you see a USB stick sticking out of a wall|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=8 March 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1326177/Dead-Drops-Bizarre-new-artwork-embeds-USB-sticks-buildings.html|title=Dead Drops: Bizarre new artwork embeds USB sticks in buildings|date=3 November 2010|work=[[Mail Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://gizmodo.com/5677377/theres-a-usb-stick-in-my-brick-wall&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the [[dead drop]] method of [[espionage]] communication. An unrelated system called "deadSwap," in which participants use an SMS gateway to coordinate passing USB memory sticks on to one another, was begun in [[Germany]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://deadswap.net/files/deadswap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Each dead drop is typically installed without any data on the drive, except two files:&lt;ref name="instructables.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Create-a-USB-Dead-Drop-in-Nature/?ALLSTEPS|title=Create a USB Dead Drop in Nature - All|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; deaddrops-manifesto.txt,&lt;ref&gt;http://deaddrops.com/download/deaddrops-manifesto.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[readme.txt]] file explaining the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://deaddrops.com/download/readme.txt&lt;/ref&gt;  Although typically found in urban areas embedded in concrete or brick since 2010, installation of USB dead drop into trees&lt;ref name=computerworld_2013/&gt; and other types of bodies in natural settings has also been mentioned since at least 2013.&lt;ref name="instructables.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2015/02/there_was_a_secret_usb_drive_h.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wireless]] dead drops such as the 2011 [[PirateBox]], where the user connects to a [[wifi hotspot]] with [[network attached storage|local storage]] rather than physically connects to a USB device, have also been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= PirateBox | url= http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110129205033/http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2011-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= WIDROP | url= http://widrop.bzhack.org/ | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001303/http://widrop.bzhack.org/ | archivedate= 2011-05-14 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Wireless drop |url= https://deaddrops.com/db/?page=view&amp;id=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other types of data transfer==
Some of the advantages of utilizing USB dead drops are practical in nature:  they permit [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file sharing without needing any internet or cellular connection, sharing files with another person secretly/anonymously, and they record no [[IP address]] or similar [[personally identifying information]].  Other benefits are more social or artistic in nature:  USB dead drops are an opportunity to practice "[[Telecomix#Datalove|datalove]]" and can be seen as a way to promote [[off-grid]] data networks.  The motive to utilize USB dead drops has been compared to what drives people involved in [[geocaching]], which has been around for much longer and is somewhat similar in that often a set of GPS coordinates is used to locate a particular USB dead drop,&lt;ref name=arstechnica_2016/&gt; in particularly that USB dead drops give the user "the thrill of discovery"&lt;ref name=vocative_2015/&gt; both in seeking out the location of the dead drop, and then also in addition when examining the data it contains.

===Potential drawbacks to users===
Dead drops are USB-based devices, which must be connected to an upstream computer system (laptop or smartphone or similar).  The act of making such a connection, to a device which is not necessarily trusted, inherently poses certain threats:  
* [[Malware]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2010/11/02/usb-ports-on-new-york-citys-streets-plug-in-if-you-dare/&lt;/ref&gt; anyone can intentionally or unintentionally store malware on it that can infect an attached computer with malware such as a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]], [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] or [[Firmware#Security risks|proprietary firmware]].  This risk can be mitigated by using [[antivirus software]], or by using a [[burner phone|throwaway device]] for the act of data-transfer. 
* [[Booby trap]]:  a fake dead drop or [[USB Killer]] might be rigged up to electrically damage any equipment connected to it, and/or constitute a health and safety hazard for potential users. This risk can be mitigated by using a USB [[galvanic isolation]] adapter, which allows data exchange while physically decoupling the two circuits.  Wifi-based dead drops do not suffer from this threat. 
* [[Mugging (robbery)|Mugging]]:  because a USB dead drop is normally in a public or quasi-public location, it is possible for the location itself to be watched, and users of the dead drop attacked when they attempt to use the system. (Compare with the risk of being mugged at night near an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] outside a bank which is higher than the risk of being mugged during the day at the teller window inside the bank.  Thieves target ATM users because they know most people are withdrawing money, which can then be stolen; thieves can also target USB dead drops, because they know that using one requires a laptop or similar [[consumer electronics]] device.)

===Drawbacks to the system infrastructure===
Publicly and privately available USB dead drops give anyone (with physical access) the ability to save and transfer data anonymously and free of charge.  These features are advantages over [[the internet]] and the [[cellular network]], which are at best quasi-anonymous and low-cost (there is always some fee associated although in certain scenarios such as government-subsidized or employer-subsidized or public-library-subsidized network access the enduser may experience [[indirect costs|no direct costs]]).  However, offline networks are vulnerable to various types of threats and disadvantages, relative to online ones:
* One device at a time: Users cannot plug in to a USB dead drop if someone else is already plugged in
* Removal of stored data: anyone with physical access can erase all of the data held within the USB dead drop (via [[file deletion]] or [[disk formatting]]), or make it unusable by encrypting the data or the whole drive and hiding the key (see also the related topic of [[ransomware]]).
* Removal of the entire device:  thieves can steal the USB drive itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miamis-dead-drop-art-project-failing-because-thieves-keep-stealing-public-usb-drives-6537986&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disclosure: anyone can disclose the location of a (formerly) private dead drop, by shadowing people that use it, and publishing coordinates in a public fashion.  This impacts the anonymous nature of USB dead drops, since known drops can be [[CCTV camera|filmed]] or otherwise observed. 
* [[Vandalism]] of the dead drop by physical destruction: anyone with physical access can destroy the dead drop by using for instance [[pliers]] or a [[hammer]], by high voltage from a static field, with high temperature from a blowtorch, or other methods of physical force. It is possible to make the USB key more difficult to vandalize or to extract, by sealing it in a hole deeper than the length of the USB key (at least 2&amp;nbsp;cm more), but this requires legitimate users to connect with a USB [[Extension cable|extender cable]].  For clarity, sometimes the installation of the dead-drop can itself be vandalism of the building; when a building owner destroys a dead drop placed without permission, they are not vandalizing the dead drop, but removing a device placed without their leave.  Even when a device is placed legally, the device itself is vulnerable to third-party vandalism. 
* [[Hazards of outdoor recreation#Inclement weather|Exposure to the elements]]:  dead drops tend to be exposed to [[precipitation|rain and snow]], which will presumably reduce their [[MTBF|service lifetime]].&lt;ref name=arstechnica_2016&gt;https://arstechnica.com/business/2016/04/on-the-hunt-for-dead-drops-the-offline-anonymous-information-network/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Demolition]] or damage during maintenance: certain dead drop locations are limited to the lifespan of public structures.  When a dead drop is embedded in a brick wall, the drop can be destroyed when the wall is destroyed.  When a drop is embedded in a concrete sidewalk, the drop can be destroyed by sidewalk-related construction and maintenance.  Sometimes dead drops are damaged when walls are repainted.&lt;ref name=vocative_2015/&gt;

==Prevalence==
As of 2013, there were more than one thousand known USB dead drops (plus six known wifi-based dead drops).&lt;ref name=computerworld_2013&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/article/2597815/data-center/dead-drops-offline-p2p-file-sharing-network-goes-global.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries which have large numbers of USB dead drops include the [[United States]] and several in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=computerworld_2013/&gt;  As of 2016, it was estimated that the overall dead drop infrastructure contained more than ten [[terabyte]]s of storage capacity, with the majority still in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], but also with significant numbers of devices reportedly installed in the [[Asia]]/[[Australia|Pacific]] region, [[South America]], and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/04/160331_tecnologia_proyecto_dead_drops_usb_muros_red_offline_aram_bartholl_lb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vocative_2015&gt;http://www.vocativ.com/tech/internet/odd-world-usb-dead-drops/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vedanta''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|ə}}; [[Sanskrit]]: वेदान्त, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Vedānta}}'') or '''Uttara Mīmāṃsā''' is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. ''Vedanta'' literally means "end of the [[Vedas]]", reflecting ideas that emerged from the speculations and philosophies contained in the [[Upanishad]]s. It does not stand for one comprehensive or unifying doctrine. Rather it is an umbrella term for many sub-traditions, ranging from [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] to [[Advaita|non-dualism]], all of which developed on the basis of a common textual connection called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]''. The ''Prasthanatrayi'' is a collective term for the ''[[Principal Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]].''

All Vedanta schools, in their deliberations, concern themselves with the following three categories but differ in their views regarding the concept and the relations between them: ''[[Brahman]]'' – the ultimate metaphysical reality,  ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'' – the individual soul or self, and  ''[[Prakriti]]'' – the empirical world, [[impermanence|ever-changing]] physical universe, body and matter.

Some of the better known sub-traditions of Vedanta include [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] (non-dualism), [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism), and [[Dvaita]] (dualism). Most other Vedantic sub-traditions are subsumed under the term [[Bhedabheda]] (difference and non-difference). Over time, Vedanta adopted ideas from other [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools like ''[[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]]'' and ''[[Nyaya]]'', and, through this [[syncretism]], became the most prominent school of [[Hinduism]]. Many extant forms of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] have been significantly shaped and influenced by the doctrines of different schools of Vedanta. The Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word ''Vedanta'' literally means the ''end of the [[Vedas]]'' and originally referred to the ''[[Upanishads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedanta was concerned with the {{IAST|''jñānakāṇḍa''}} or Vedic knowledge part called the ''Upanishads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koller|2013|pp=100–106}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denotation of Vedanta subsequently widened to include the various philosophical traditions based on to the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Raju|1972|pp=176–177}}; {{harvnb|Isaeva|1992|p=35 with footnote 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Upanishads]]'' may be regarded as the end of ''Vedas'' in different senses:{{sfn|Raju|1972|pp=176–177}}
# These were the last literary products of the Vedic period.
# These mark the culmination of Vedic thought.
# These were taught and debated last, in the ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' (student) stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Scharfe|2002|pp=58–59,115–120,282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vedanta''' is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools of [[Indian philosophy]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}} It is also called ''Uttara Mīmāṃsā'', the 'latter enquiry' or 'higher enquiry'; and is often contrasted with ''[[Mimamsa|Pūrva Mīmāṃsā]]'', the 'former enquiry' or 'primary enquiry'. ''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā'' deals with the ''karmakāṇḍa'' or rituals part (the ''[[Samhita]]'' and ''[[Brahmana]]s'') in the ''Vedas''.{{Sfn|Clooney|2000|pp=147–158}}{{Sfn|Mohan Lal Sandal|1925|p=16, Sutra 30}}{{refn|group=note|Historically, Vedanta has been called by various names. The early names were the Upanishadic ones (''Aupanisada''), the doctrine of the end of the ''Vedas'' (''Vedanta-vada''), the doctrine of ''[[Brahman]]'' (''Brahma-vada''), and the doctrine that ''Brahman'' is the cause (''Brahma-karana-vada'').{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}}}}

==''Prasthanatrayi'', the Three Sources==
The ''[[Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavadgita]]'' and the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' constitute the basis of Vedanta. All schools of Vedanta propound their philosophy by interpreting these texts, collectively called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]'', literally, ''three sources''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ranganathan}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ''[[Upanishads]]'',{{refn|group=note|The ''Upanishads'' were many in number and developed in the different schools at different times and places, some in the Vedic period and others in the medieval or modern era (the names of up to 112 ''Upanishads'' have been recorded).{{sfn|Dasgupta|1922|pp=28}} All major commentators have considered twelve to thirteen oldest of these texts as the Principal ''Upanishads'' and as the foundation of Vedanta.}} or ''Śruti prasthāna''; considered the ''[[Sruti]]'', the “heard” (and repeated) foundation of Vedanta.
# The ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', or ''Nyaya prasthana'' / ''Yukti prasthana''; considered the reason-based foundation of Vedanta.
# The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', or ''Smriti prasthāna''; considered the ''[[Smriti]]'' (remembered tradition) foundation of Vedanta.

The ''Brahma Sutras'' attempted to synthesize the teachings of the ''Upanishads''.  The diversity in the teaching of the ''Upanishads'' necessitated the systematization of these teachings. This was likely done in many ways in ancient India, but the only surviving version of this synthesis is the ''Brahma Sutras'' of ''[[Badarayana]]''.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}

All major Vedantic teachers, including [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]], [[Rāmānuja|Ramanuja]], [[Nimbarka]], [[Vallabha Acharya|Vallabha]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], have composed commentaries not only on the ''Upanishads'' and ''Brahma Sutras'', but also on the ''Bhagavad Gita''. The ''Bhagavad Gita'', due to its syncretism of [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and [[Upanishad]]ic thought, has played a major role in Vedantic thought.{{sfn|Pasricha|2008|p=95}}

==History==

The ''Upanishads'' present a rigorous philosophical inquiry in the form of identifying various doctrines and then presenting arguments for or against them. They form the basic texts and Vedanta interprets them through rigorous philosophical [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx–xxxiiii}};  {{harvnb|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying interpretations of the ''Upanishads'' and their synthesis, the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', led to the development of different schools of Vedanta over time of which three,{{sfn|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}} four,{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}} five&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/Colloquium03–DiffVedantas.pdf Prem Pahlajrai, Asian Languages and Literature, University of Washington, ''Vedanta: A Comparative Analysis of Diverse Schools'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or six{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=216}}{{refn|group=note|Sivananda also mentions Meykandar and the ''[[Shaiva Siddhanta]]'' philosophy.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}}}} are prominent.{{refn|group=note|Proponents of other Vedantic schools continue to write and develop their ideas as well, although their works are not widely known outside of smaller circles of followers in [[India]].}}

The history of Vedanta is divided into two periods: one prior to the composition of the ''Brahma Sutras'' and the other encompassing the schools that developed after the ''Brahma Sutras'' were written.

===Before the ''Brahma Sutras''===
Little is known{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} of schools of Vedanta existing before the composition of the ''Brahma Sutras'' (400–450 BCE).{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} considers the ''Brahma Sutras'' as a group of sutras composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years. The precise date is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=746}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1949|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} estimates that the book was composed in its current form between 400 and 450 BCE.}} It is clear that Badarayana, the writer of ''Brahma Sutras'', was not the first person to systematize the teachings of the ''Upanishads'', as he quotes six Vedantic teachers before him – Ashmarathya, Badari, Audulomi, Kashakrtsna, Karsnajini and Atreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to other early Vedanta teachers – Brahmadatta, Sundara, Pandaya, Tanka and Dravidacharya – are found in secondary literature of later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of these ancient teachers have not survived, but based on the quotes attributed to them in later literature, Sharma postulates that Ashmarathya and Audulomi were [[Bhedabheda]] scholars, Kashakrtsna and Brahmadatta were [[Advaita]] scholars, while Tanka and Dravidacharya were either Advaita or Vishistadvaita scholars.{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}

===''Brahma Sutras''===
{{Main article|Brahma Sutras}}
[[Badarayana]] summarized and interpreted teachings of the ''Upanishads'' in the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', also called the ''Vedanta Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,151–152}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241}}; {{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Vedanta–sūtra are known by a variety of names, including (1) Brahma–sūtra, (2) Śārīraka–sutra, (3) Bādarāyaṇa–sūtra and (4) Uttara–mīmāṁsā.}} Badarayana summarized the teachings of the classical Upanishads&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN PHILOSOPHY|last=Satischandra Chatterjee|first=Dhirendramohan Dutta|publisher=Rupa Publications India Pvt.

Though attributed to Badarayana, the Brahma Sutras were likely composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} The estimates on when the Brahma Sutras were complete vary,&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 746&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1949|p=436}} with Nicholson in his 2013 review stating, that they were most likely compiled in the present form around 400–450 BCE.{{sfn|Nicholson|2013|p=26, Quote: "From a historical perspective, the Brahmasutras are best understood as a group of sutras composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years, most likely composed in its current form between 400 and 450 BCE."}} Isaeva suggests they were complete and in current form by 200 CE,&lt;ref&gt;NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1281-7}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; while Nakamura states that "the great part of the ''Sutra'' must have been in existence much earlier than that."{{sfn|Nakamura|1949|p=436}}

The book is composed of four chapters, each divided into four quarters or sections.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}} These sutras attempt to synthesize the diverse teachings of the Upanishads. However, the cryptic nature of aphorisms of the ''Brahma Sutras'' have required exegetical commentaries.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=151–152}} These commentaries have resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|pp=26–27}}; {{harvnb|Mohanty|Wharton|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the ''Brahma Sutras'' and Adi Shankara===
{{See also|Vedas|Upanishads|Darsanas}}

Little with specificity is known of the period between the ''Brahma Sutras'' (5th century BCE) and Adi Shankara (8th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}} Only two writings of this period have survived: the ''Vākyapadīya'', written by [[Bhartṛhari]] (second half 5th century{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=426}}), and the ''Kārikā'' written by Gaudapada (early 6th{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}} or 7th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his school in his commentaries.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} A number of important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the ''Siddhitraya'' by Yamunācārya (c. 1050), the ''Vedārthasamgraha'' by Rāmānuja (c. 1050–1157), and the ''Yatīndramatadīpikā'' by Śrīnivāsa Dāsa.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} At least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahma Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|Bhartŗhari (c. 450–500), Upavarsa (c. 450–500), Bodhāyana (c. 500), Tanka (Brahmānandin) (c. 500–550), Dravida (c. 550), Bhartŗprapañca (c. 550), Śabarasvāmin (c. 550), Bhartŗmitra (c. 550–600), Śrivatsānka (c. 600), Sundarapāndya (c. 600), Brahmadatta (c. 600–700), Gaudapada (c. 640–690), Govinda (c. 670–720), Mandanamiśra (c. 670–750).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

A noted scholar of this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha maintained that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach the tenet of [[Bhedabheda]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essentials of Indian Philosophy|last=Hiriyanna|first=M.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (2008 Reprint)|year=1948|isbn=978-81-208-1330-4|location=Delhi|pages=19, 21–25, 150–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaudapada, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Gaudapada}}

Gaudapada (c. 6th century CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Jagannathan|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the teacher or a more distant predecessor of [[Govinda Bhagavatpada|Govindapada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Michael Comans|2000|pp=2,163}}&lt;/ref&gt; the teacher of Adi Shankara. Shankara is widely considered as the founder of [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}} Gaudapada's treatise, the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}''—also known as the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' or the ''{{IAST|Āgama Śāstra}}''{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=239}}—is the earliest surviving complete text on Advaita Vedanta.{{refn|group=note|There is ample evidence, however, to suggest that Advaita was a thriving tradition by the start of the common era or even before that. Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} Scholarship since 1950 suggests that almost all [[Sannyasa#Sannyasa Upanishads|Sannyasa Upanishads]] have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=17–18}}; {{harvnb|Rigopoulos|1998|pp=62–63}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|1995|p=332 with note 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd Century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=x–xi,8–18}}; {{harvnb|Sprockhoff|1976|pp=277–294,319–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient Sannyasa Upanishads may be, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], because major Hindu monasteries of this period belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17–18}}}}

Gaudapada's ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' relied on the [[Mandukya Upanishad|Mandukya]], [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhandogya]] ''Upanishads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=239}}; {{harvnb|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=308}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'', Advaita (non-dualism) is established on rational grounds (''upapatti'') independent of scriptural revelation; its arguments are devoid of all religious, mystical or scholastic elements. Scholars are divided on a possible influence of [[Buddhism]] on Gaudapada's philosophy.{{Refn|group=note|Scholars like {{harvtxt|Raju|1972|p=177}}, following the lead of earlier scholars like Sengupta,{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} believe that Gaudapada co-opted the Buddhist doctrine that ultimate reality is pure consciousness [[Yogacara#Representation–only|(''vijñapti-mātra'')]]. {{harvtxt|Raju|1972|pp=177–178}} states, "Gaudapada wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the Mandukaya Upanisad, which was further developed by Shankara." {{harvtxt|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} states that the whole purpose of Gaudapada was to present and demonstrate the ultimate reality of Atman, an idea denied by [[Buddhism]]. According to {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}, Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century, state both Murti and Richard King, never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.{{sfn|Jagannathan|2011}} While there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different, states {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}}} The fact that Shankara, in addition to the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', the principal ''Upanishads'' and the ''[[Bhagvad Gita]]'', wrote an independent commentary on the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' proves its importance in {{IAST|Vedāntic}} literature.{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}}

Adi Shankara (788–820), elaborated on Gaudapada's work and more ancient scholarship to write detailed commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi and the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}''. The Mandukya Upanishad and the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' have been described by Shankara as containing "the epitome of the substance of the import of Vedanta".{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} It was Shankara who integrated Gaudapada work with the ancient ''Brahma Sutras'', "and give it a ''locus classicus''" alongside the realistic strain of the ''Brahma Sutras''.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} writes: "The ''Brahmasutras'' themselves espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins."}} His interpretation, including works ascribed to him, has become the normative interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakamura|1950}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Shankara synthesized the ''Advaita–vāda'' which had previously existed before him,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} and, in this synthesis, became the restorer &amp; defender of an ancient learning.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} He was an unequaled commentator,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} due to whose efforts and contributions,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}}}}

A noted contemporary of Shankara was  [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], who regarded [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] and Vedanta as forming a single system and advocated their combination known as ''Karma-jnana-samuchchaya-vada''.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241,372–375}}{{refn|group=note|According to Mishra, the [[sutra]]s, beginning with the first sutra of Jaimini and ending with the last sutra of Badarayana, form one compact [[shastra]].{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241,372–375}}}} The treatise on the differences between the Vedanta school and the Mimamsa school was a contribution of Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta rejects rituals in favor of [[sannyasa|renunciation]], for example.{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=175-176}}

===Ramanuja and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta===
Rāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was the most influential philosopher in the [[Vishishtadvaita]] tradition. As the philosophical architect of Vishishtadvaita, he taught qualified [[Nondualism|non-dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|2001|page=239}}; {{harvnb|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}}; {{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Carman|1974|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja's teacher, Yadava Prakasha, followed the Advaita monastic tradition. Tradition has it that Ramanuja disagreed with Yadava and Advaita Vedanta, and instead followed [[Nathamuni]] and [[Yamunacharya|Yāmuna]]. Ramanuja reconciled the ''Prasthanatrayi'' with the theism and philosophy of the Vaishnava [[Alvars]] poet-saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=10–11,17–18}}; {{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–4,52–53,79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja wrote a number of influential texts, such as a [[bhasya]] on the ''Brahma Sutras'' and the ''Bhagavad Gita'', all in Sanskrit.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|pp=82–87 with footnotes}}

Ramanuja presented the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Hindu soteriology|soteriological]] importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja's case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Atman (souls) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman.&lt;ref name="Bartley 2013 1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98"&gt;{{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98}}; {{harvnb|Sullivan|2001|page=239}}; {{harvnb|Doyle|2006|pp=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishishtadvaiata provides the philosophical basis of [[Sri Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernard|1947|pages=9–12}}; {{harvnb|Sydnor|2012|pp=0–11,20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanuja was influential in integrating ''[[Bhakti]]'', the devotional worship, into Vedanta premises.{{Sfn|Fowler|2002|p=288}}

=== Madhva and Dvaita ===
Dvaita was propounded by Madhvacharya (1238–1317 CE).{{refn|group=note|Many sources date him to 1238–1317 period,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=12–13,359–361}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some place him over 1199–1278 CE.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}}} He presented the opposite interpretation of Shankara in his Dvaita, or dualistic system.{{sfn|Bernard|1947|pp=9–12}} In contrast to Shankara's non-dualism and Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism, he championed unqualified dualism. Madhva wrote commentaries on the chief ''Upanishads'', the ''Bhagavad Gita'' and the ''Brahma Sutra''.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|p=187}}

Madhva started his Vedic studies at age seven, joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat),{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 117}} studied under [[guru]] Achyutrapreksha,{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} frequently disagreed with him, left the Advaita monastery, and founded Dvaita.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} Madhva and his followers Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha, were critical of all competing Hindu philosophies, Jainism and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1962|pp=128–129,180–181}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=150–151,372,433–434}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; but particularly intense in their criticism of Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=372–375}}

Dvaita Vedanta is theistic and it identifies Brahman with Narayana, or more specifically Vishnu, in a manner similar to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. But it is more explicitly pluralistic.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=188–189}} Madhva's emphasis for difference between soul and Brahman was so pronounced that he taught there were differences (1) between material things; (2) between material things and souls; (3) between material things and God; (4) between souls; and (5) between souls and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=396}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated for a difference in degrees in the possession of knowledge. He also advocated for differences in the enjoyment of bliss even in the case of liberated souls, a doctrine found in no other system of Indian philosophy. {{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=188–189}}

==Overview of the schools of Vedanta==

===Schools propounding Non-dualism===

====Advaita school====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x216px|Shankaracharya]]
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Advaita Vedanta ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: अद्वैत वेदान्त) espouses non-dualism and monism. ''Brahman'' is held to be the sole unchanging metaphysical reality and identical to ''Atman''.{{sfn|Stoker|2011}} The physical world, on the other hand, is always-changing empirical [[Maya (illusion)|''Maya'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=160–161}}; {{harvnb|Doniger|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Doniger|1986|p=119}} says "that to say that the universe is an illusion (''{{IAST|māyā}}'') is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. ''Maya'' not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge."}} The absolute and infinite ''Atman''-''Brahman'' is realized by a process of negating everything relative, finite, empirical and changing.{{sfn|Das|1952}} The school accepts no duality, no limited individual souls (''Atman'' / ''Jivatman''), and no separate unlimited cosmic soul. All souls and existence across space and time is considered as the same oneness (i.e. monism).{{sfn|Sharma|2007|pp=19–40,53–58,79–86}} Spiritual liberation in ''Advaita'' is the full comprehension and realization of oneness, that one's unchanging ''Atman'' (soul) is the same as the ''Atman'' in everyone else, as well as being identical to the ''nirguna'' ''Brahman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|1995|pp=1–2, 97–102}}; {{harvnb|Etter|2006|pp=57–60, 63–65}}; {{harvnb|Perrett|2013|pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vishishtadvaita====
{{main article|Vishishtadvaita}}
[[File:Ramanuja embracing Lord Varadaraj.jpg|thumb|right|x160px|Ramanujacharya depicted with Vaishnava [[Tilaka]] and Vishnu statue.]]

''Vishishtadvaita'' asserts that ''Jivatman'' (human souls) and ''Brahman'' (as ''Vishnu'') are different, a difference that is never transcended.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betty|2010|pp= 215–224}}; {{harvnb|Craig|2000|pp=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this qualification, Ramanuja also affirmed monism by saying that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the ''Brahman''.&lt;ref name="Bartley 2013 1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98"/&gt; ''Vishishtadvaita'', like ''Advaita'', is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta in a qualified way, and both begin by assuming that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Etter|2006|pp=57–60,63–65}}; {{harvnb|Buitenin|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the relation between the ''Brahman'' and the world of matter (''Prakriti''), ''Vishishtadvaita'' states both are two different absolutes, both metaphysically true and real, neither is false or illusive, and that ''saguna'' ''Brahman'' with attributes is also real.{{sfn|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}} Ramanuja states that God, like man, has both soul and body, and the world of matter is the glory of God's body.{{sfn|Buitenin|2010}} The path to ''Brahman'' (''Vishnu''), according to Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of the personal god (''[[bhakti]]'' of ''saguna'' ''Brahman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}}; {{harvnb|Buitenin|2010}}; {{harvnb|Sydnor|2012|pp=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shuddhādvaita====
{{main article|Shuddhadvaita}}[[File:Shri mahaprabhuji.jpg|thumb|right|text|x224px|Vallabhacharya]]
''[[Shuddhadvaita]]'' (pure non-dualism) states that the entire universe is real and is subtly ''[[Brahman]]'' only in the form of ''[[Krishna]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}} Vallabhacharya, the propounder of this philosophy, agreed with Advaita Vedanta's [[ontology]], but emphasized that ''prakriti'' (empirical world, body) is not separate from the ''Brahman'', but just another manifestation of the latter.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}} Everything, everyone, everywhere—soul and body, living and non-living, ''jiva'' and matter—is the eternal ''[[Krishna]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479-481}} The way to ''Krishna'', in this school, is ''[[bhakti]]''.  Vallabha opposed renunciation of monistic ''sannyasa'' as ineffective and advocates the path of devotion (''bhakti'') rather than knowledge (''jnana''). The goal of ''bhakti'' is to turn away from ego, self-centered-ness and deception, and to turn towards the eternal ''Krishna'' in everything continually offering freedom from ''[[samsara]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}}

===School propounding Dualism - Dvaita===
{{main article|Dvaita}}
[[File:Shri Madhvacharya.jpg|thumb|x184px|Madhvacharya]]

This school is based on the premise of dualism. ''Atman'' (soul) and ''Brahman'' (as ''Vishnu'') are understood as two completely different entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Dehsen|1999|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brahman'' is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=353–354}} {{refn|group=note|The concept of ''Brahman'' in ''Dvaita'' Vedanta is so similar to the monotheistic eternal God, that  some early colonial–era ''[[Indologist]]s'' such as [[George Abraham Grierson]] suggested Madhva was influenced by early [[Christian]]s who migrated to India, {{sfn|Kulandran|Hendrik|2004|pp=177–179}} but later scholarship has rejected this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Sarma|2000|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In ''Dvaita'' Vedanta, an individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and complete devotional surrender to ''Vishnu'' for salvation, and it is only His grace that leads to redemption and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1962|pp=417–424}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhva believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned, a view not found in ''Advaita'' and ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=374–375}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta asserted "qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls", Madhva asserted both "qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls".{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=374}}

===Schools propounding Bhedabheda===
{{main article|Bhedabheda}}''[[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]]'' means "difference and non–difference" and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (''Jīvatman'') is both different and not different from ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Nicholson}} Notable figures in this school are Bhartriprapancha, [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]] (8th–9th century), Ramanuja's teacher Yādavaprakāśa, [[Nimbārka]] (13th century) who founded the [[Dvaitadvaita]] school, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]] (1486–1534) who founded the [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] school and [[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijñānabhikṣu]] (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson}}; {{harvnb|Sivananda|1993|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=note|According to Nakamura and Dasgupta, the ''Brahmasutras'' reflect a ''[[Bhedabheda]]'' point of view,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} the most influential tradition of Vedanta before Shankara. Numerous Indologists, including Surendranath Dasgupta, Paul hacker, Hajime Nakamura, and Mysore Hiriyanna, have described ''Bhedabheda'' as the most influential school of Vedanta before Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}}}

====Upadhika====
Bhaskara, in postulating ''Upadhika'', considers both identity and difference to be equally real. As the causal principle, ''Brahman'' is considered non-dual and formless pure being and intelligence.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=340}} The same ''Brahman'', manifest as events, becomes the world of plurality. ''{{IAST|Jīva}}'' is ''Brahman'' limited by the mind. Matter and its limitations are considered real, not a manifestation of ignorance. Bhaskara advocated ''bhakti'' as ''dhyana'' (meditation) directed toward the transcendental ''Brahman''. He refuted the idea of ''Maya'' and denied the possibility of liberation in bodily existence.{{sfn|Mohanty|Wharton|2011}}

====Dvaitādvaita====
[[File:Nimbarkacharya's holy icon at the Ukhra Nimbarka Peeth Mahanta Asthal(West Bengal).JPG|thumb|right|x115px|Nimbarkacharya's icon at Ukhra, West Bengal]]
{{main article|Dvaitadvaita}}[[Nimbarka|Nimbārka]] propounded ''[[Dvaitādvaita]]'', based upon [[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]] as was taught by [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]]. ''Brahman'' (God), souls ''(chit)'' and matter or the universe ''(achit)'' are considered as three equally real and co-eternal realities. ''Brahman'' is the controller ''(niyantr)'', the soul is the enjoyer ''(bhoktr)'', and the material universe is the object enjoyed ''(bhogya)''. The Brahman is ''[[Krishna]]'', the ultimate cause who is omniscient, omnipotent, all-pervading Being. He is the [[efficient cause]] of the universe because, as Lord of ''Karma'' and internal ruler of souls, He brings about creation so that the souls can reap the consequences of their ''karma''. God is considered to be the [[material cause]] of the universe because creation was a manifestation of His powers of soul ''(chit)'' and matter ''(achit)''; creation is a transformation ''(parinama)'' of God's powers. He can be realized only through a constant effort to merge oneself with His nature through meditation and devotion. {{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=376}}

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
[[File:Chaitanya-Mahabrabhu-at-Jagannath.jpg|thumb|right|x195px|Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]
{{main article|Achintya Bhedabheda}}
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was the prime exponent of ''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda''.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=247}} In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=407}}; {{harvnb|Gupta|2007|pp=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda'' represents the philosophy of "inconceivable difference in non-difference",{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=378–380}} in relation to the non-dual reality of ''Brahman''-''Atman'' which it calls (''[[Krishna]]''), ''svayam bhagavan''.{{sfn|Gupta|2016|pp=44–45}} The notion of "inconceivability" (''acintyatva'') is used to reconcile apparently contradictory notions in Upanishadic teachings. This school asserts that ''Krishna'' is ''[[Bhagavan]]'' of the ''bhakti yogins'', the ''Brahman'' of the ''jnana yogins'', and has a divine potency that is inconceivable. He is all-pervading and thus in all parts of the universe (non-difference), yet he is inconceivably more (difference). This school is at the foundation of the ''[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]]'' religious tradition.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=378–380}}

== Vedanta philosophy ==

The important approaches followed by the most noted proponents of different schools of Vedanta are summarized below:
# To theorize that the soul (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'') and the physical universe (''[[Prakriti]]'') are both identical with and different from ''[[Brahman]]''. This view is held by Bhartriprapancha.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}
# To place non-dualistic ideas in the most important place, relegating dualistic ideas to an interim position. This approach is followed by Shankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael Comans|1996|pp=49–71}}; {{harvnb|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–53}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2000| pp=224–228 with notes 8, 13 and 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To theorize that non-dualism is qualified by difference. This is Ramanuja's approach.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=346}}
# To emphasize dualism, discrediting and offering an alternative explanation of non-dualistic ideas. This is from Madhva.{{sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=368–374}}

Sivananda gives the following explanation:
{{quote|Madhva said, "Man is the servant of God," and established his Dvaita philosophy. Ramanuja said, "Man is a ray or spark of God," and established his Visishtadvaita philosophy. Sankara said, "Man is identical with Brahman or the Eternal Soul," and established his Kevala Advaita philosophy.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}}}}

===Common features===
Despite their differences, all schools of Vedanta share some common features:
# ''Brahman'' exists as the unchanging material cause and instrumental cause of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}};  {{harvnb|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}; {{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Sheridan|1991|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Upanishads'' are a reliable source of knowledge (''Sruti Śabda'' in [[Pramana]]);{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=34,66}} Vedanta is the pursuit of knowledge into the ''Brahman'' and the ''Ātman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|pp=34,66}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Belief in rebirth and the desirability of release from the cycle of rebirths, ''(mokşa)''.{{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}
# The self  (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'') is the agent of its own acts ([[karma]]) and the recipient of the consequences of these actions.{{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}
# Rejection of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] and conclusions of the other Vedic schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and, to some extent, the [[Purva Mimamsa]].){{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}

===Metaphysics===
Vedanta philosophies discuss three fundamental metaphysical categories and the relations between the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raju|1972|pp=176–177, 505–506}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Fowler|2002|pp=49–59, 254, 269, 294–295, 345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Ishvara]]'': the ultimate reality&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' or ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'': the individual soul, self&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009|p='see entry for Atman(self)'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Prakṛti|Prakriti]]''/''Jagat'':&lt;ref name="Washington"/&gt; the empirical world, ever–changing physical universe, body and matter&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipner|1986|pp=40–41,51–56,144}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=23,78,158–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brahman / Ishvara - Conceptions of the Supreme Reality ====
Shankara, in formulating Advaita, talks of two conceptions of ''Brahman'': the higher ''Brahman'' as undifferentiated Being, and a lower ''Brahman'' endowed with qualities as the creator of the universe.{{sfn|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}
# ''Parā'' or Higher ''Brahman'':  the undifferentiated, absolute, infinite, transcendental, supra-relational Brahman beyond all thought and speech is defined as ''parā'' ''Brahman'', ''nirviśeṣa'' Brahman or ''nirguṇa'' Brahman and is the Absolute of metaphysics.
# ''Aparā'' or Lower ''Brahman'': the ''[[Brahman]]'' with qualities defined as ''aparā'' ''Brahman'' or ''saguṇa'' ''Brahman''. The ''saguṇa'' ''Brahman'' is endowed with attributes and represents the personal God of religion.

Ramanuja, in formulating Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, rejects ''nirguṇa''—that the undifferentiated Absolute is inconceivable—and adopts a theistic interpretation of the ''Upanishads'', accepts ''Brahman'' as ''Ishvara'', the personal God who is the seat of all auspicious attributes, as the One reality. The God of Vishishtadvaita is accessible to the devotee, yet remains the Absolute, with differentiated attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|p=317}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhva, in expounding Dvaita philosophy, maintains that ''[[Vishnu]]'' is the supreme God, thus identifying the ''Brahman'', or absolute reality, of the ''Upanishads'' with a personal god, as Ramanuja had done before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britannica|2016}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimbarka, in his dvaitadvata philosophy, accepted the ''Brahman'' both as ''nirguṇa'' and as ''saguṇa''. Vallabha, in his shuddhadvaita philosophy, not only accepts the triple ontological essence of the ''Brahman'', but also His manifestation as personal God (''Ishvara''), as matter and as individual souls.{{sfn|Vitsaxis|2009|pp=100–101}}

==== Relation between Brahman and Jiva / Atman ====
The schools of Vedanta differ in their conception of the relation they see between ''Ātman'' / ''Jivātman'' and ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara'':{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}}
* According to Advaita Vedanta, ''Ātman'' is identical with ''Brahman'' and there is no difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raju|1972|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Vishishtadvaita, ''Jīvātman'' is different from ''Ishvara'', though eternally connected with Him as His mode.{{sfn|Ādidevānanda|2014|pp=9-10}} The oneness of the Supreme Reality is understood in the sense of an organic unity (''vishistaikya''). ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara'' alone, as organically related to all ''Jīvātman'' and the material universe is the one Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betty|2010|pp=215–224}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Dvaita, the ''Jīvātman'' is totally and always different from ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craig|2000|pp=517–18}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=361–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Shuddhadvaita (pure monism), the ''Jīvātman'' and ''Brahman'' are identical; both, along with the changing empirically-observed universe being [[Krishna]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}}

===Epistemology===
{{main article|Pramana}}
[[File:3 Pramana Epistemology Dualistic Dvaita Vishishtadvaita Hindu schools.svg|thumb|180px|Epistemology in Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. Advaita and some other Vedanta schools recognize six epistemic means.]]

==== Pramana ====
''Pramāṇa'' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रमाण) literally means "proof", "that which is the means of valid knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|pp=520–521}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to [[epistemology]] in Indian philosophies, and encompasses the study of reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2000|pp=520–521}} The focus of [[Pramana]] is the manner in which correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows or does not know, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2002|pp=25–26}}; {{harvnb|Bhawuk|2011|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six{{Refn|group=note|A few Indian scholars such as Vedvyasa discuss ten, Krtakoti discusses eight, but six is most widely accepted; see {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|pp=149–150}}}} ''pramanas'' as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2011|p=172}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=73–76}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception)
# ''Anumāṇa'' (inference)
# ''[[Upamāṇa]]'' (comparison and analogy)
# ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances)
# ''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)
# ''[[Śabda]]'' (scriptural testimony/ verbal testimony of past or present reliable experts).
The different schools of Vedanta have historically disagreed as to which of the six are epistemologically valid. For example, while Advaita Vedanta accepts all six ''pramanas'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimes|2006|p=238}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|p=228}}; {{harvnb|Clayton|2006|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita accept only three ''pramanas'' (perception, inference and testimony).{{sfn|Grimes|2006|p=238}}

Advaita considers ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception) as the most reliable source of knowledge, and ''[[Śabda]]'', the scriptural evidence, is considered secondary except for matters related to Brahman, where it is the only evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|1995|pp=65}}; {{harvnb|Gupta|1995|pp=137–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Anantanand {{harvtxt|Rambachan|1991|pp=xii–xiii}} states, "According to these [widely represented contemporary] studies, Shankara only accorded a provisional validity to the knowledge gained by inquiry into the words of the [[Śruti]] (Vedas) and did not see the latter as the unique source (''pramana'') of ''Brahmajnana''. The affirmations of the Śruti, it is argued, need to be verified and confirmed by the knowledge gained through direct experience (''anubhava'') and the authority of the Śruti, therefore, is only secondary." Sengaku {{harvtxt|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}} concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (''vastutantra''), and considered subjective opinions (''purushatantra'') and injunctions in Śruti (''codanatantra'') as secondary. Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (''pramana–janya'') in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra–bhasya.}} In Vishistadvaita and Dvaita, ''[[Śabda]]'', the scriptural testimony, is considered the most authentic means of knowledge instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|p=304}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|pp=208–211, 237–239}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=147–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Theories of cause and effect ====
All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''Satkāryavāda'',{{sfn|Nicholson}} which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are two different views on the status of the "effect", that is, the world. Most schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya, support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} According to {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}, "the ''Brahma Sutras'' espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins". In contrast to Badarayana, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedantists hold a different view, ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says that the effect, the world, is merely an unreal (''vivarta'') transformation of its cause, Brahman.{{Refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} writes of Advaita Vedantin position of cause and effect - Although Brahman seems to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are essentially unreal, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts.}}

==Influence==

=== Hindu traditions ===
Vedanta, adopting ideas from other [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools, became the most prominent school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Clooney|2000|pp=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vedanta traditions led to the development of many traditions in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks|1990|pp=20–22,77–79}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Vaishnavism]] of south and southeastern India is based on Ramanuja's ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta.{{Sfn|Carman|Narayanan|1989|pp=3–4}} Ramananda led to the ''Vaishnav Bhakti'' Movement in north, east, central and west India. This movement draws its philosophical and theistic basis from ''Vishishtadvaita''. A large number of devotional ''Vaishnavism'' traditions of east India, north India (particularly the Braj region), west and central India are based on various sub-schools of ''Bhedabheda'' Vedanta.{{sfn|Nicholson}} ''Advaita'' Vedanta influenced ''Krishna Vaishnavism'' in the northeastern state of [[Assam]].{{sfn|Neog|1980|pp=243–244}} The Madhva school of Vaishnavism found in coastal [[Karnataka]] is based on ''Dvaita'' Vedanta.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=372–375}}

''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamas]]'', the classical literature of ''[[Shaivism]]'', though independent in origin, show Vedanta association and premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|pp=126–128}}; {{harvnb|Klostermaier|1984|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 92 ''Āgamas'', ten are (''[[dvaita]]'') texts, eighteen (''[[bhedabheda]]''), and sixty-four (''[[advaita]]'') texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2014|p=167 note 21}}; {{harvnb|Dyczkowski|1989|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Bhairava Shastras'' are monistic, ''Shiva Shastras'' are dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasugupta|2012|pp=252, 259}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=162–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Isaeva|1995|pp=134–135}} finds the link between Gaudapada's ''Advaita'' Vedanta and ''[[Kashmir Shaivism]]'' evident and natural. [[Tirumular]], the Tamil ''Shaiva Siddhanta'' scholar, credited with creating "Vedanta–Siddhanta" (Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva Siddhanta synthesis), stated, "becoming ''Shiva'' is the goal of Vedanta and ''Siddhanta''; all other goals are secondary to it and are vain."{{sfn|Manninezhath|1993|pp=xv, 31}}

''[[Shaktism]]'', or traditions where a goddess is considered identical to ''[[Brahman]]'', has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of ''Advaita'' Vedanta and dualism premises of ''Samkhya–Yoga'' school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as ''Shaktadavaitavada'' (literally, the path of nondualistic ''Shakti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDaniel|2004|pp=89–91}}; {{harvnb|Brooks|1990|pp=35–39}}; {{harvnb|Mahony|1997|p=274 with note 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===
{{Main article|Neo-Vedanta|Hindu nationalism|Hindu reform movements}}

Neo-Vedanta, variously called as "Hindu modernism", "neo-Hinduism", and "neo-Advaita", is a term that denotes some novel interpretations of [[Hinduism]] that developed in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1999|p=135}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=258}}; {{harvnb|King|2002|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably as a reaction to the colonial British rule.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=187,135—142}} {{harvtxt|King|2002|pp=129–135}} writes that these notions accorded the Hindu nationalists an opportunity to attempt the construction of a nationalist ideology to help unite the Hindus to fight colonial oppression. Western [[Orientalism|orientalists]], in their search for its "essence", attempted to formulate a notion of "Hinduism" based on a single interpretation of Vedanta as a unified body of religious praxis.{{sfn|King|2002|p=118}} This was contra-factual as, historically, Hinduism and Vedanta had always accepted a diversity of traditions. {{harvtxt|King|1999|pp=133–136}} asserts that the neo-Vedantic theory of "overarching tolerance and acceptance" was used by the Hindu reformers, together with the ideas of [[Universalism in religion|Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], to challenge the polemic dogmatism of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic missionaries against the Hindus.

The neo-Vedantins argued that the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy were perspectives on a single truth, all valid and complementary to each other.{{Sfn|King|1999|p=137}}  {{harvtxt|Halbfass|2007|p=307}} sees these interpretations as incorporating western ideas{{sfn|Halbfass|2007|p=307}} into traditional systems, especially [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} It is the modern form of Advaita Vedanta, states {{harvtxt|King|1999|p=135}}, the neo-Vedantists subsumed the Buddhist philosophies as part of the Vedanta tradition{{refn|group=note|Vivekananda, clarifies Richard King, stated, "I am not a Buddhist, as you have heard, and yet I am"; but thereafter Vivekananda explained that "he cannot accept the Buddhist rejection of a self, but nevertheless honors the Buddha's compassion and attitude towards others".{{sfn|King|1999|p=138}}}} and then argued that all the world religions are same "non-dualistic position as the philosophia perennis", ignoring the differences within and outside of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=133–136}} According to {{harvtxt|Gier|2000|p=140}}, neo-Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta which accepts universal realism:{{quote|Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Aurobindo have been labeled neo-Vedantists (the latter called it realistic Advaita), a view of Vedanta that rejects the Advaitins' idea that the world is illusory. As Aurobindo phrased it, philosophers need to move from 'universal illusionism' to 'universal realism', in the strict philosophical sense of assuming the world to be fully real.}}

A major proponent in the popularization of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|King|2002|pp=135–142}} who played a major role in the [[Hindu nationalism|revival of Hinduism]].{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} He was also instrumental in the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the [[Vedanta Society]], the international arm of the [[Ramakrishna Order]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Criticism of Neo-Vedanta label ====
{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=2}} writes that the attempts at integration which came to be known as neo-Vedanta were evident as early as between the 12th and the 16th century−  {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{refn|group=note|The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions" has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24–33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26–27}}}}}}[[Bimal Krishna Matilal|Matilal]] criticizes Neo-Hinduism as an oddity developed by West-inspired Western Indologists and attributes it to the flawed Western perception of Hinduism in modern India. In his scathing criticism of this school of reasoning, {{harvtxt|Matilal|2002|pp=403–404}} says:{{quote|The so-called 'traditional' outlook is in fact a construction. Indian history shows that the tradition itself was self-conscious and critical of itself, sometimes overtly and sometimes covertly. It was never free from internal tensions due to the inequalities that persisted in a hierarchical society, nor was it without confrontation and challenge throughout its history. Hence Gandhi, Vivekananda and Tagore were not simply 'transplants from Western culture, products arising solely from confrontation with the west.

...It is rather odd that, although the early Indologists' romantic dream of discovering a pure (and probably primitive, according to some) form of Hinduism (or Buddhism as the case may be) now stands discredited in many quarters; concepts like neo-Hinduism are still bandied about as substantial ideas or faultless explanation tools by the Western 'analytic' historians as well as the West-inspired historians of India.}}

=== Influence on Western thinkers ===
An exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia since the late 18th century as a result of colonization of parts of Asia by Western powers. This also influenced western religiosity. The first translation of ''Upanishads'', published in two parts in 1801 and 1802, significantly influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them the consolation of his life.{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177—178}} He drew explicit parallels between his philosophy, as set out in ''The World as Will and Representation'',&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. ''The World as Will and Representation''. Translated from the German by EFJ Payne. Dover Publications, vol. 1, chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the Vedanta philosophy as described in the work of Sir William Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Sir William. ''On the Philosophy of the Asiatics''. Sir William Jones. Asiatic Researches, vol. 4, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}} Influenced by Śaṅkara's concepts of ''Brahman'' (God) and ''māyā'' (illusion), [[Lucian Blaga]] often used the concepts ''marele anonim'' (the Great Anonymous) and ''cenzura transcendentă'' (the transcendental censorship) in his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2007), ''Marele Anonim şi cenzura transcendentă la Blaga. Brahman şi māyā la Śaṅkara'', in ''Caiete critice'' 6–7 (236–237), Bucharest, ISSN|1220-6350, pp. 75–83.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
According to {{harvtxt|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}, the Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism:
{{Quote|The prevalence of Vedanta thought is found not only in philosophical writings but also in various forms of ([[Hindu]]) literature, such as the epics, lyric poetry, drama and so forth. ...the Hindu religious sects, the common faith of the Indian populace, looked to Vedanta philosophy for the theoretical foundations for their theology. The influence of Vedanta is prominent in the sacred literatures of Hinduism, such as the various Puranas, Samhitas, Agamas and Tantras...{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

[[Frithjof Schuon]] summarizes the influence of Vedanta on Hinduism as follows:
{{Quote|The Vedanta contained in the Upanishads, then formulated in the ''Brahma Sutra'', and finally commented and explained by Shankara, is an invaluable key for discovering the deepest meaning of all the religious doctrines and for realizing that the ''[[Sanatana Dharma]]'' secretly penetrates all the forms of traditional spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Witz|1998|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Schuon|1975|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{harvtxt|Flood|1996|pp=231–232, 238}} states,
{{Quote|..the most influential school of theology in India has been Vedanta, exerting enormous influence on all religious traditions and becoming the central ideology of the Hindu renaissance in the nineteenth century. It has become the philosophical paradigm of Hinduism "par excellence".}}

==Similarities with Spinoza's philosophy==
German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was among the early scholars to notice similarities between the religious conceptions of the Vedanta and those of the Dutch Jewish philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], writing that Spinoza's thought was
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines [...] comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Goldstucker, ''Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker'', W. H. Allen, 1879. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Max Müller]] noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying,
{{quote|The Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay,
{{quote|sign=|source=|As to Spinoza's Deity—''natura naturans''—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as ''natura naturata'' or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.&lt;ref&gt;H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308-310. Quest Books&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28683">'''Vision Forum''' is an organisation that carries out research in contemporary art and organises events that transgresses the boundaries between [[performance art|performance]], exhibition, [[workshop]]s and [[education]]. It grew from a series of events organised by [[Curatorial Mutiny]] in collaboration with KSM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isak.liu.se/ksm KSM website (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt; at Campus [[Norrköping]], [[Linköpings Universitet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liu.se/?l=en University website]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sweden]] 2005-2007. Vision Forum took its present form in 2008. It does not have a physical location or a program, but responds to the needs of the group of artists, curators and researchers that are part of the network at any given moment. Its members are mostly based in [[Europe]] and have carried out projects all over the continent, in North America, Australia and Asia. In 2009, neuroscientist [https://stephenwhitmarsh.com Stephen Whitmarsh] joined the group, showing that the organisation can host members outside of the artistic community. A strategy that has been developed further in  subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Now 2012"&gt;Time Capsules and Conditions of Now, Edited by Fatos Ustek, David Roberts Art Foundation, London, UK and Vision Forum 2012, {{ISBN|978-91-978934-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workshops and Public Presentations==
[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|right|Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

In 2008-09, Vision Forum organised two major projects. (Anti)Realism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/2008antirealism.html Documentation of workshop and exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; brought together young contemporary visual artists based in Sweden, China, Great Britain, the Netherlands and France.&lt;ref name="Youth, Youth p. 120-121"&gt;Youth, Youth, Youth, p. 120-121, Catalogue Produced by Huang Xiaopeng, Guangzhou At Academy, Guangzhou, China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the project was a practical workshop that took place in [[Guangzhou]], China, in September 2008. The European participants developed collaborative projects with their Chinese peers that focused on [[time-based art]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;”The title and the [[conceptual framework]] of the workshop (Anti)Realism was created to look into the differences and similarities of how we look at [[reality]] (both as individuals and as members of different cultures) and how that can be used to further our understanding and appreciation of life. The project allowed the participants to both understand differences between European cultures, as well as how these differ from Chinese contemporary art and life.”&lt;ref&gt;(Anti)Realism, Numéro 1, D'Ailleurs, Cold Mountain, France {{ISBN|978-2-9518588-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The results of the workshop were presented to the public at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Art and a second were later developed into an exhibition which was shown at Verkstad in Sweden, Ècole Régional de Beaux Arts de Besaçon in France and at Adele C in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Youth, Youth, Youth, p. 87, Catalogue Produced by Huang Xiaopeng, Guangzhou At Academy, Guangzhou, China, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to (Anti)Realism Vision Forum created four workshops in [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/rome.html Documentation of workshop organised by Formazero]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zürich]],&lt;ref&gt;Curatorial workshop in Zürich organised by White Space and other local players.[http://www.visionforum.eu/zurich.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/amsterdam.html Utopia workshop in Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/stockholm.html The Stockholm syndrom organised by Good TV at Konsthögskolan Stockholm]&lt;/ref&gt; These involved a completely different group of artists and curators from (Anti)Realism and focused on [[architecture]], artistic production, [[curator|curation]] and [[presentation]] respectively.

==The Development of Nodes==
[[File:Dinu.li.low.jpg|thumb|right| Video stills of Dinu Li's performance on the Shenzhen Metro that was part of The Invisible Generation, November 2009.]]

In 2009-10, Vision Forum focused on four major projects or “[[wikt:node|node]]s”. They were each made up of a number of artists and curators who, like the Vision Forum workshops in 2008-09 met regularly. The nodes were held together by all doing research on [[time]] and [[temporality]] in different ways. “If you don’t want God, you’d better have a multiverse” was curated and developed by [[1:1 Projects]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/rome.html Blog devoted to the project]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was focused on workshops in Rome, [[Skopje]] and [[Paris]]. At the last meeting, the participants reformulated themselves into “OuUnPo” (Workshop for Alternative Universes), inspired by French literary group [[Oulipo]]. The participants organised a public event at [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome|MACRO]] in Rome and at [[Tate Britain]] in [[London]] &lt;ref&gt;Yane Calovski, Obj'ct, Ed. Basak Senova, Ponder Pause Process (a situation), p. 90-97, Zorlu Center Art Collection, Istanbul, Turkey {{ISBN|978-605-63320-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spring 2010 under the new name. Ouunpo has since then carried out events in [[Porto]], [[Athens]], [[Belgrade]], [[Amsterdam]]-[[Nijmegen]], [[Stockholm]]-[[Norrköping]]&lt;ref&gt;Music for Works, Takahashi and Miliani, Jacopo Miliani - Do you Believe in Mirages, a+mbookstore edizioni, Milano, 2012. {{ISBN|9788887071429}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with art and science institutions like [[Deste Foundation]] and [[Max Planck Institute]]. Australian artist duo [[A Constructed World]] started “Speech and What Archive?” which continued its activities in 2010-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speecharchive.blogspot.com/ The project’s official blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The node focused on alternative forms of communication and organised events in Paris, [[Nice]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Melbourne]] working with art institutions like [[Villa Arson]] and [[California College of the Arts|CCA]]. Curator Claire Louise Staunton carried out research which later lead to the creation of the temporary gallery “Inheritance Shenzhen”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artforum.com/archive/id=24421 Article in Artforum picks by Robin Peckham]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Chinese region of [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inheritanceprojects.org/inh-sz/ Documentation of the Gallery’s activities December 2009 – April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This project was developed in Milton Keynes in 2011 with a large exhibition, seminar and publication.&lt;ref name="mkgallery.org"&gt;http://www.mkgallery.org/education/projectspace/community_without_propinquity/&lt;/ref&gt; They then travelled to [[Chandigar]] and as an outcome of this research the node presented an exhibition about British architect [[Jane Drew]] and the artistic work that flourished around her at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|Institute of Contemporary Art]] in London in 2014.

==The Invisible Generation==
{{Main|The Invisible Generation|l1= The Invisible Generation}}

[[File:Huttner.hitler.melbourne.jpg|thumb|left| Installation view of poster project “Young Dictators” (Hitler as child), by Per Hüttner at public location in Melbourne, September 2009.]]

The fourth major project realized in 2009-10 was [[The Invisible Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Invisible Generation, published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2010. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No, project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take. In the introduction to the project in the catalogue Gerrie van Noord writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; “The Invisible Generation is a collection of artistic interventions that spread virally across the continents of our globe. It used the artistic and curatorial network of Vision Forum as a platform to multiply and make its way into the perception of people in unexpected spaces of selected cities around the world. The project takes its starting point in performative traditions, but focuses on practices and events that cross over into other time-based activities such as sound, film, video, literature, theatre and workshops and draws inspiration from other related fields such as journalism, fashion and design, but also from those further removed like mathematics and physics”&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie van Noord, p.8 The Invisible Generation catalogue, published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2010. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Redefining Communication==
Since September 2011 Vision Forum organizes two international workshops a year in [[Östergötland]] in Sweden. These bring together members of the different international nodes (in 2012 Vision Forum ran 10 nodes) and interact with local institutions and art organizations. This means that the research carried out in the individual nodes have started cross referencing and exchanging methodology between each other. Vision Forum, through its structure, develops modes of [[communication]] and knowledge production that make use of current technology. The nodes of the network also allow a deeper dialogue with their audiences that, in their turn, are inscribed into in numerous interconnected networks.&lt;ref name="OuUnPo 2013"&gt;OuUnPo[RTO], edited by Claudia Squitieri and Samon Takahashi, texts by OuUnPo, designed by Åbäke published by Dent-de-Leone and Vision Forum, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It has become increasingly clear that the network focuses on research about how art uses, retains, distributes and develops knowledge along with how this can be fed back into the everyday lives of art's audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Invisible Generation]], Gerrie van Noord, 2011, published by Curatorial Mutiny and Vision Forum, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties in with Vision Forum's founder Per Hüttner's work that can be exemplified by projects like [[I am a Curator]]”,&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

This idea of exchange is based on co-producing knowledge with the collaborating institutions and audiences, rather than a top down knowledge distribution. The strategy that they call "collapsing the global with the local" is currently being developed by the network in collaboration with [[Global Art and the Museum]] at [[ZKM]] in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalartmuseum.de/site/guest_author/323 OuUnPo and Globalisation on Global Art and the Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residency and Interdisciplinary Activities==
In 2011 Vision Forum started publishing books and catalogues regularly to document its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vfpublications.blogspot.de/ The Organisations website for publications]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also started to produce experimental films in a separate node called Vision Forum Film. Two films were in Production in 2012: "Effektivia" directed by [[Jesper Frilund]] and [[Marcus Fernstad]] and "The River" by Sino-Swedish director Ting Ting Yang (杨婷婷).&lt;ref&gt;Vision Forum Film, edited by Rudi Heinrichsen, translated by Yan Rong and designed by Erik Månsson. Texts by Rudi Heinrichsen, Per Hüttner, Yang Tingting, Jesper Frilund and Rebbecca Catching. published by Vision Forum, 2013. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-8-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 Vision Forum opened an international residency program called "Norrköping Air.&lt;ref&gt;David Isaksson, Norrköpings Tidningar, p. B2-3, 20 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;" The program was initiated in collaboration with KSM at [[Linköpings universitet]], [[IASPIS]] and offers three artists the opportunity to work in parallel [[Sweden]] for 3 months during the Swedish summer months. The project focuses on experimental art in public spaces, drawing inspiration from the [[Invisible Generation]] and similar projects and was developed in close dialogue with the centenary of Norrköping Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://norrkopingair.blogspot.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wh war room.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;!--Wally Hedrick, ''War Room'', c. 1967, exterior view.--&gt; Installing Hedrick's ''War Room'' at [[Sonoma State University]] in 2002.]]
The '''''War Room''''' (1967/68–2002), by [[Wally Hedrick]] (1928–2003), consists of eight canvases approximately 5 feet wide and 11 feet tall, all painted a deep black. Hedrick referred to these canvases as "wounded veterans". These canvases are bolted together to create a freestanding cubic room that could be entered via a small door in one of the canvases, thus creating an architectural painting. The black painted surfaces of the canvases face inward and the backs of the canvases face outward. 

The ''War Room'' is an “environmental” painting; the viewer enters a small enclosure of painted blackness. The viewer is left to consider the encompassing darkness and contemplate the vacuity that this space creates. Hedrick refused to ignore the war and instead created a work of cultural and political significance. After the Vietnam War ended he repainted these canvases black in protest of the Gulf War in 1992 and the Iraqi war in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

During this time, Hedrick was accused of stealing paintings, including a canvas by [[Clyfford Still]], from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], where he was teaching, then either painting them black or painting his own iconoclastic pictures over them.&lt;ref name=Selz89&gt;Peter Selz and Susan Landauer, Art of Engagement: Visual Politics in California and Beyond, UC Press, 2006, pg.89. &lt;/ref&gt;

The ''War Room'' is a significant item of Bay Area art history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Mass-appeal-Art-comes-at-visitors-from-all-2678761.php |last=Baker |first=Kenneth | title=Mass appeal / Art comes at visitors from all directions at the S.F.

[[File:Washtub-bass-Kianti-Ecolove.png|180px|thumb|A small washtub bass being played]]
The '''washtub bass''', or '''gutbucket''', is a stringed instrument used in [[American folk music]] that uses a metal washtub as a resonator.  Although it is possible for a washtub bass to have four or more strings and [[tuning peg]]s, traditional washtub basses have a single string whose pitch is adjusted by pushing or pulling on a staff or stick to change the tension.

The washtub bass was used in [[jug band]]s that were popular in some [[African American]] communities in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, [[UK|British]] [[Skiffle music|skiffle]] bands used a variant called a [[tea chest bass]], and during the 1960s, US folk musicians used the washtub bass in jug band-influenced music.

Variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator.  As a result, there are many different names for the instrument including the "gas-tank bass", "barrel bass", "box bass" (Trinidad), "bush bass" (Australia), "babatoni" ([[South Africa]]), "[[tingotalango]]" (Cuba), "[[:it:bidofono|tulòn]]" (Italy), "laundrophone" and others.

The hallmarks of the traditional design are simplicity, very low cost and do-it-yourself construction, leading to its historical association with lower economic classes. These factors also make it quite common for modern-day builders to promote modifications to the basic design, such as adding a [[finger board]], pedal, [[electronic pickup]], [[drumhead]], or making the staff immovable.

==History==
[[Image:ElectricInbindiBass.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Electric "inbindi" bass which is amplified by a public address system]]
[[Ethnomusicologist]]s trace the origins of the instrument to the [[Ground bow|'ground bow' or 'ground harp']] - a version that uses a piece of bark or an animal skin stretched over a pit as a resonator.  The ''ang-bindi'' made by the [[Baka people (Congo and Sudan)|Baka people]] of the Congo is but one example of this instrument found among tribal societies in Africa and Southeast Asia, and it lends its name to the generic term ''inbindi'' for all related instruments.  Evolution of design, including the use of more portable resonators, has led to many variations, such as the ''[[dan bau]]'' (Vietnam) and ''[[Ektara|gopichand]]'' (India), and more recently, the "electric one-string", which amplifies the sound using a pickup.

The washtub bass is sometimes used in a [[jug band]], often accompanied by a [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] as a [[percussion instrument]].  Jug bands, first known as "spasm bands", were popular especially among African-Americans around 1900 in New Orleans and reached a height of popularity between 1925 and 1935 in Memphis and Louisville.

At about the same time, European-Americans of Appalachia were using the instrument in "old-timey" folk music. A musical style known as "gut-bucket blues" came out of the jug band scene, and was cited by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] as the type of music he was seeking when he first recorded [[Elvis Presley]].

According to [[Willie "The Lion" Smith]]'s autobiography, the term "gutbucket" comes from "Negro families" who all owned their own pail, or bucket, and would get it filled with the makings for [[chitterlings]]. The term "gutbucket" came from playing a lowdown style of music.&lt;ref name="Music on My Mind"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Willie the Lion|title=Music on My Mind: The Memoirs of an American Pianist, Foreword by Duke Ellington|year=1964|page=11|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company Inc. |location=New York City|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English [[Skiffle music|skiffle]] bands, [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] [[bush band]]s and [[South Africa]]n [[kwela]] bands, the same sort of bass has a [[tea-chest bass|tea chest]] as a resonator.  [[The Quarrymen]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]'s band before [[the Beatles]], featured a tea-chest bass, as did many young bands around 1956.

A folk music revival in the U.S. in the early 1960s re-ignited interest in the washtub bass and jug band music.  Bands included [[Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (album)|Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions]], which later became The [[Grateful Dead]], and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, which featured [[Fritz Richmond]] on bass.

==Tea chest bass==
[[Image:Rhoener Saeuwaentzt Guenther.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Tea chest bass]]
A '''tea chest bass''' is a variation of the washtub bass that uses a [[tea chest]] as the resonator for an upright stringed [[bass (instrument)|bass]].  The instrument is made from a pole, traditionally a broomstick, placed into or alongside the chest. One or more strings are stretched along the pole and plucked.

In Europe, particularly England and Germany, the instrument is associated with [[skiffle]] bands. In Australia it was traditionally used to provide deep sounds for "[[bush band]]s", though most such groups today use [[electric bass]] or [[double bass]]. It was commonly called a "bush bass".

==Other variations==
Other variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator, for example:
* "gas-tank bass"
* "barrel bass"
* "box bass" ([[Trinidad]])
* "bush bass" ([[Australia]])
* "babatoni" ([[South Africa]])
* "dumdum" ([[Zimbabwe]])
* "dan bau" ([[Vietnam]])
* "sanduku" ([[Zanzibar]])
* "tingotalango" ([[Cuba]])
* "[[:it:bidofono|tulòn]]" ([[Italy]])
