      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9468">'''Adaptive mutation''' is a controversial evolutionary theory.  It posits that mutations, or genetic changes, are much less random and more purposeful than traditional evolution. There have been a wide variety of experiments trying to prove (or disprove) the idea of adaptive mutation, at least in microorganisms.

==Definition==
The most widely accepted theory of evolution states that organisms will diversify based on natural selection where changes caused by mutations improve the organism's chance of survival. Adaptive mutation states that rather than mutations and evolution being random, they are in response to specific stresses. In other words, the mutations that occur are more beneficial and specific to the given stress, instead of random and not a response to anything in particular. It should be noted that the term stress refers to any change in the environment, such as temperature, nutrients, population size, etc. Tests with microorganisms have found that for adaptive mutation, more of the mutations observed after a given stress were more effective at dealing with the stress than chance alone would suggest is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = P.L. | year = 1993 | title = Adaptive mutation: The uses of adversity | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 467–504 | pmc=2989722 | pmid=8257106 | doi=10.1146/annurev.mi.47.100193.002343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sniegowski |first1=P.D. |last2=Lenski |first2=R.E. |year=1995 |title=Mutation and adaptation: The directed mutation controversy in evolutionary perspective |url=http://0-www.jstor.org/stable/2097219. |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=26 |issue= |pages=553–578 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.26.110195.003005 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of adaptive mutation was first brought to academic attention in the 1980s by John Cairns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cairns | first1 = J | last2 = Overbaugh | first2 = J | last3 = Miller | first3 = S | year = 1988 | title = The origin of mutants | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 335 | issue = | pages = 142–45 | doi=10.1038/335142a0 | pmid=3045565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major experiments==
Adaptive mutation is a very controversial topic so there have been many experiments to prove or discredit the theory. Three major experiments are the SOS response&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKenzie | first1 = G.J. | last2 = Harris | first2 = R.S. | last3 = Lee | first3 = P.L. | last4 = Rosenberg | first4 = S.M. | year = 2000 | title = The SOS response regulates adaptive mutation | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6646.full | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 12| pages = 6646–6651 | doi=10.1073/pnas.120161797 | pmid=10829077 | pmc=18688}}&lt;/ref&gt; and responses to starvation in ''Escherichia coli'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = P.L. | year = 2000 | title = Adaptive mutation: implications for evolution | journal = BioEssays | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1067–1074 | pmc=2929355 | pmid=11084622 | doi=10.1002/1521-1878(200012)22:12&lt;1067::AID-BIES4&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; and testing for revertants of a tryptophan auxotroph of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', or yeast.&lt;ref&gt;Reference 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===SOS response===
This experiment is different from the others in one small way: this experiment is concerned with the pathways leading to an adaptive mutation while the others tested the changing environment microorganisms were exposed to.

Simply put, the [[SOS response]] in ''E. coli'' is a response to DNA damage that must be repaired. The normal cell cycle is put on hold and [[mutagenesis]] may begin.  This means that mutations will occur to try to fix the damage. This [[hypermutation]], or increased rate of change, response has to have some regulatory process, and some key molecules in this process are [[RecA]], and [[LexA]]. These are proteins and act as stoplights for this and other processes. They also appear to be the main contributors to adaptive mutation in ''E. coli''. Changes in presence of one or the other was shown to affect the SOS response, which in turn affected how the cells were able to process lactose, which should not be confused with the lactose starvation experiment. The key point to understand here is that LexA and RecA both were required for adaptive mutation to occur, and without the SOS response adaptive mutation would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Reference 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lactose starvation===
The ''E. coli'' strain FC40 has a high rate of mutation, and so is useful for studies, such as for adaptive mutation. Due to a [[frameshift mutation]], a change in the sequence that causes the DNA to code for something different, FC40 is unable to process lactose. When placed in a lactose-rich medium, it has been found that 20% of the cells mutated from Lac- (could not process lactose) to Lac+, meaning they could now utilize the lactose in their environment. The responses to stress are not in current DNA, but the change is made during DNA replication through recombination and the replication process itself, meaning that the adaptive mutation occurs in the current bacteria and will be inherited by the next generations because the mutation becomes part of the genetic code in the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Reference 5&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly obvious in a study by Cairns, which demonstrated that even after moving ''E. coli'' back to a medium with minimal levels of lactose, Lac+ mutants continued to be produced as a response to the previous environment.&lt;ref&gt;Reference 1&lt;/ref&gt; This would not be possible if adaptive mutation was not at work because natural selection would not favor this mutation in the new environment.

Although there are many genes involved in adaptive mutation, RecG, a protein, was found to have an effect on adaptive mutation. By itself, RecG was found to not necessarily lead to a mutational phenotype. However, it was found to inhibit the appearance of revertants (cells that appeared normally, as opposed to those with the mutations being studied) in wild-type cells. On the other hand, RecG mutants were key to the expression of RecA-dependent mutations, which were a major portion of study in the SOS response experiments, such as the ability to utilize lactose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Trimarchi | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Maurer | first3 = R.A. | year = 1996 | title = Two enzymes, both of which process recombination intermediates, have opposite effects on adaptive mutation in Escherichia coli | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/142/1/25.full.pdf+html | journal = Genetics | volume = 142 | issue = 1| pages = 25–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeast===
Dr. von Borstel, in the 1970s, conducted experiments similar to the Lactose Starvation experiment with yeast, specifically ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''. He tested for tryptophan [[auxotroph]] revertants. A tryptophan auxotroph cannot make tryptophan for itself, but wild-type cells can and so a revertant will revert to the normal state of being able to produce tryptophan. He found that when yeast colonies were moved from a tryptophan-rich medium to a minimal one, revertants continued to appear for several days. The degree to which revertants were observed in yeast was not as high as with bacteria. Other scientists have conducted similar experiments, such as Hall who tested histidine revertants, or Steele &amp; Jinks-Robertson who tested lysine.  These experiments demonstrate how recombination and DNA replication are necessary for adaptive mutation. However, in lysine-tested cells, recombination continued to occur even without selection for it. Steele and Jinks-Robertson concluded that recombination occurred in all circumstances, adaptive or otherwise, while mutations were present only when they were beneficial and adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;Reference 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the production of mutations during selection was not as vigorous as observed with bacteria, these studies are convincing. As mentioned above, a subsequent study adds even more weight to the results with ''lys2''. Steele &amp; Jinks-Robertson [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989722/#R123] found that LYS prototrophs due to interchromosomal recombination events also continue to arise in nondividing cells, but in this case, the production of recombinants continued whether there was selection for them or not. Thus, mutation occurred in stationary phase only when it was adaptive, but recombination occurred whether it was adaptive or not.

Delayed appearance of mutants has also been reported for ''Candida albicans.''&lt;ref&gt;Malavasic MJ, Cihlar RL. Growth response of several ''Candida albicans'' strains to inhibitory concentrations of heavy metals. J Med Vet Mycol. 1992;30:421–32.&lt;/ref&gt; With long exposure to sublethal concentrations of heavy metals, colonies of resistant cells began to appear after 5–10 days and continued to appear for 1–2 weeks thereafter. These resistances could have resulted from gene amplification, although the phenotypes were stable during a short period of nonselective growth. However, revertants of two auxotrophies also appeared with similar kinetics. None of these events in ''Candida albicans'' have, as yet, been shown to be specific to the selection imposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1486">'''Analog observation''' is, in contrast to [[naturalistic observation]], a research tool by which a subject is observed in an artificial setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Comer|first=Ronald J.|title=Fundamentals of Abnormal Psychology|year=1996|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Co.|location=New York|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, types of settings in which analog observation is utilized include clinical offices or research laboratories, but, by definition, analog observations can be made in any artificial environment, even if the environment is one which the subject is likely to encounter naturally.

== Applications ==

'''Analog observation''' is typically divided into two iteration of application: The first iteration primarily studies the effect of manipulation of variables in the subject's environment, including setting and events, on the subject's behavior. The second iteration primarily seeks to observe the subject's behavior in [[quasi-experiment]]al social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=Encyclopedia of psychology|year=1984|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bielefeld School''' is a group of German historians based originally at [[Bielefeld University]] who promote [[social history]] and [[political history]] using quantification and the methods of [[political science]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1289&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders include [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Jürgen Kocka]] and [[Reinhart Koselleck]]. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as "historical social science" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal ''{{ill|Geschichte und Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift fur Historische Sozialwissenschaft|de|Geschichte und Gesellschaft}}'' since 1975.

Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s–60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society"—''Gesellschaftsgeschichte''—has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the [[modernization theory]] of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''German Studies Review'' 1984 7(3): 451-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte==
''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' (1987–) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality.  His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized.   More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of "total history."

Volumes 1–2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 ''Von der "Deutschen Doppelrevolution" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914'' (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German [[Sonderweg]] or "special path" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  Wehler's ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914–1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society.  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.  The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871–1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]] disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a "[[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|failed bourgeois revolution]]" in 1848. Influenced by the [[New Left]], Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period "from below."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow, "Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88#1 pages 53–72 quote on page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'', he launched a critique of the "top-down" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting "the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, "Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians" in Evans, ed. ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'' (1978) pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Along with historians [[Geoff Eley]] and [[David Blackbourn]], Evans emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;See Evans, ''In Defence of History,'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural turn===
From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'?

Kocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, "But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents."  He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Magnússon, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calculus of voting''' refers to any [[mathematical model]] which predicts voting behaviour by an electorate, including such features as participation rate.  A calculus of voting represents an hypothesized decision-making process.

These models are used in [[political science]] in an attempt to capture the relative importance of various factors influencing an elector to vote (or not vote) in a particular way.

==Example==

One such model was proposed by [[Anthony Downs]] (1957) and is adapted by [[William H. Riker]] and [[Peter Ordeshook]], in “A Theory of the Calculus of Voting” (Riker and Ordeshook 1968)

:''V'' = ''pB'' &amp;minus; ''C'' + ''D''

where
:''V'' = the proxy for the probability that the voter will turn out 
:''p'' = probability of vote “mattering”
:''B'' = “utility” benefit of voting--differential benefit of one candidate winning over the other 
:''C'' = costs of voting (time/effort spent)
:''D'' = citizen duty, goodwill feeling, psychological and civic benefit of voting (this term is not included in Downs's original model)

A [[political science]] model based on [[rational choice]] used to explain why citizens do or do not vote.


The alternative equation is

:''V'' = ''pB'' +  ''D'' &gt; ''C''

Where for voting to occur the (P)robability the vote will matter "times" the (B)enefit of one candidate winning over another combined with the feeling of civic (D)uty, must be greater than the (C)ost of voting

In [[statistics]], '''count data''' is a [[statistical data type]], a type of [[data]] in which the observations can take only the non-negative [[integer]] values {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, and where these integers arise from [[counting]] rather than [[ranking]].  The statistical treatment of count data is distinct from that of [[binary data]], in which the observations can take only two values, usually represented by 0 and 1, and from [[ordinal data]], which may also consist of integers but where the individual values fall on an arbitrary scale and only the relative ranking is important.

Statistical analyses involving count data includes simple counts, such as the number of occurrences of thunderstorms in a calendar year, and [[categorical data]] in which the counts represent the numbers of items falling into each of several categories.

==Count variables==
An individual piece of count data is often termed a '''count variable'''.  When such a variable is treated as a [[random variable]], the [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]], [[binomial distribution|binomial]] and [[negative binomial distribution|negative binomial]] distributions are commonly used to represent its distribution.

==Graphical examination==
Graphical examination of count data may be aided by the use of [[data transformation (statistics)|data transformation]]s chosen to have the property of stabilising the sample variance. In particular, the [[square root]] transformation might be used when data can be approximated by a [[Poisson distribution]] (although other transformation have modestly improved properties), while an inverse sine transformation is available when a [[binomial distribution]] is preferred.

==Relating count data to other variables==
Here the count variable would be treated as a [[dependent variable]]. Statistical methods such as [[least squares]] and [[analysis of variance]] are designed to deal with continuous dependent variables. These can be adapted to deal with count data by using [[data transformation (statistics)|data transformation]]s such as the [[square root]] transformation, but such methods have several drawbacks; they are approximate at best and estimate [[parameter]]s that are often hard to interpret.

The [[Poisson distribution]] can form the basis for some analyses of count data and in this case [[Poisson regression]] may be used. This is a special case of the class of [[generalized linear model]]s which also contains specific forms of model capable of using the [[binomial distribution]] ([[binomial regression]], [[logistic regression]]) or the [[negative binomial distribution]] where the assumptions of the Poisson model are violated, in particular when the range of count values is limited or when [[overdispersion]] is present.

[[File:Vishnu Avatars.jpg|thumb|300px|19th century painting of avatars of Vishnu by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]
{{Vaishnavism}}
'''Dashavatara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|æ|ʃ|ə|ˈ|v|æ|t|ə|r|ə}}; {{lang-sa|दशावतार}}, {{IAST|daśāvatāra}}) refers to the ten primary [[avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]], the Hindu god of preservation. Vishnu is said to descend in form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word ''Dashavatara'' derives from {{IAST|daśa}}, meaning 'ten', and avatar ({{IAST|avatāra}}), roughly equivalent to 'incarnation'.

The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, and no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard. However, most draw from the following set of figures, omitting at least one of those listed in parentheses: [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Vamana]], [[Parashurama]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Balarama]] or &lt;!-- WARNING: deletion of "Buddha" will be reverted right away --&gt;[[Gautama_Buddha_in_Hinduism|Buddha]], and [[Kalki]]. In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces Vishnu as the source of all avatars. Some traditions include a regional deity such as [[Vithoba]] or [[Jagannath]] in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha. All avatars have appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the [[Kali Yuga]].

==Description==
The list of avatars in the Dashavatara varies by region. The following table summarizes the position of avatars within the Dashavatara in many but not all traditions. A number in the table indicates the position of the corresponding avatar within the Dashavatara. Two or more numbers separated by commas indicate that the position of the corresponding avatar within the Dashavatara varies between traditions. Bracketed numbers indicate that the corresponding avatar is omitted in some traditions.

==Etymology==
The word ''Dashavatara'' derives from {{IAST|daśa}}, meaning 'ten' and avatar ({{IAST|avatāra}}), meaning 'incarnation'.

Number of occurrences of these avatars of lord Vishnu are one less than the total number of avatars in previous yuga.

[[Satya Yuga]] - Had 4 ([[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]])

[[Treta Yuga]] - Had 3 ([[Vamana]], [[Parshurama]], [[Rama]]) 

[[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara Yug]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;a- Had 2 ([[Krishna]], [[Balarama]])

[[Kali Yuga|Kali Yug]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;a- Had 1, Yet to have 1 ([[Lord Buddha]], [[Kalki]])

==List==

* '''[[Matsya]]''', the fish. Vishnu takes the form of a fish to save [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] from the [[Flood myth|deluge]] ([[Pralaya]]), after which he takes his boat to the new world along with one of every species of plant and animal, gathered in a massive cyclone.
* '''[[Kurma]]''', the giant tortoise. When the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[Asura|asuras]] were churning the [[Ocean of milk]] in order to get [[Amrita]], the nectar of immortality, the mount Mandara they were using as the churning staff started to sink and Vishnu took the form of a tortoise to bear the weight of the mountain.
* '''[[Varaha]]''', the boar. He appeared to defeat [[Hiranyaksha]], a demon who had taken the Earth, or [[Prithvi]], and carried it to the bottom of what is described as the cosmic ocean(much like in ether theory) in the story. The battle between Varaha and Hiranyaksha is believed to have lasted for a thousand years, which the former finally won. Varaha carried the Earth out of the ocean between his tusks and restored it to its place in the universe.
* '''[[Narasimha]]''', the half-man/half-lion. The ''[[rakshasa]] (Demon)'' [[Hiranyakashipu]], the elder brother of Hiranyaksha, was granted a powerful boon from [[Brahma]] that he could not be killed by man or animal, inside or outside a room, during day or night, neither on ground nor in air, with a weapon that is either living or inanimate. Hiranyakashipu persecuted everyone for their religious beliefs including his son who was a Vishnu follower.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p73"/&gt; Vishnu descended as an anthropomorphic incarnation, with the body of a man and head and claws of a lion. He disemboweled Hiranyakashipu at the courtyard threshold of his house, at dusk, with his claws, while he lay on his thighs. Narasimha thus destroyed the evil demon and brought an end to the persecution of human beings including his devotee Prahlada, according to the Hindu mythology.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah A. Soifer|title=The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YoydqgcseYC|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0800-1|pages=73–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vamana]]''', the dwarf. The fourth descendant of Hiranyakashyap, [[Bali (demon)|Bali]], with devotion and penance was able to defeat [[Indra]], the god of firmament. This humbled the other deities and extended his authority over the three worlds. The gods appealed to Vishnu for protection and he descended as a boy Vamana.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah A. Soifer|title=The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YoydqgcseYC&amp;pg=PA33| year=1991| publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0800-1|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[yajna]] (यज्ञ) of the king, Vamana approached him and Bali promised him for whatever he asked. Vamana asked for three paces of land. Bali agreed, and the dwarf then changed his size to that of a giant ''Trivikrama'' form.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p33"/&gt; With his first stride he covered the earthly realm, with the second he covered the heavenly realm thereby symbolically covering the abode of all living beings.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p33"/&gt; He then took the third stride for the netherworld. Bali realized that Vamana was [[Vishnu]] incarnate. In deference, the king offered his head as the third place for Vamana to place his foot. The avatar did so and thus granted Bali immortality and making him ruler of Pathala, the netherworld. This legend appears in hymn 1.154 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and other Vedic as well as Puranic texts.&lt;ref name="Doniger1988p28"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger| title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hwNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |year=1988 |publisher =Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-1866-4|page =28}}, [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_1/Hymn_154 Wikisource of Griffith's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Strides of Vishnu: Hindu Culture in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtLScrjrWiAC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971825-2|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Parashurama]]''', the warrior with the axe. He is son of [[Jamadagni]] and [[Renuka]] and received an axe after a penance to [[Shiva]]. He is the first Brahmin-Kshatriya in Hinduism, or warrior-saint, with duties between a [[Brahmin]] and a [[Kshatriya]]. King [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] and his army visited the father of Parashurama at his ashram, and the saint was able to feed them with the divine cow [[Kamadhenu]]. The king demanded the cow, but Jamadagni refused. Enraged, the king took it by force and destroyed the ashram. Parashurama then killed the king at his palace and destroyed his army. In revenge, the sons of Kartavirya killed Jamadagni. Parashurama took a vow to kill every Kshatriya on earth twenty-one times over, and filled five lakes with their blood. Ultimately, his grandfather, [[rishi]] Rucheeka, appeared before him and made him halt. He is a [[Chiranjivi]] (immortal), and believed to be alive today in penance at [[Mahendra Mountains|Mahendragiri]].

* '''[[Rama]]''', the prince and king of [[Ayodhya]]. He is a commonly worshipped avatar in [[Hinduism]], and is thought of as the ideal heroic man. His story is recounted in one of the most widely read scriptures of Hinduism, the ''[[Ramayana]]''. While in exile from his own kingdom with his brother [[Lakshman]] and the God [[Hanuman]], his wife [[Sita]] was abducted by the demon king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]]. He travelled to Lanka, killed the demon king and saved Sita.
* '''[[Balarama]]''', the elder brother of Krishna, is regarded generally as an avatar of [[Shesha]]. Balarama is included as the eighth avatar of Vishnu in the [[Sri Vaishnava]] lists, where Buddha is omitted and Krishna appears as the ninth avatar in this list.{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} He is particularly included in the lists where Krishna is removed and becomes the source of all.
*  '''[[Krishna]]'''{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} was the eighth son of [[Devaki]] and [[Vasudeva]]. A frequently worshipped deity in Hinduism, he is the hero of various legends and embodies qualities such as love and playfulness.
*'''[[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]]''': [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism, is commonly included as an avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism. Buddha is sometimes depicted in Hindu scriptures as a preacher who deludes and leads demons and heretics away from the path of the [[Vedas|Vedic scriptures]], but another view praises him a compassionate teacher who preached the path of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence).{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}}{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}}&lt;ref&gt;Literature review of secondary references of Buddha as Dashavatara which regard Buddha to be part of standard list:

Various versions of the list of Vishnu's avatars exist.{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar,{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} while others – such as the ''Yatindramatadipika'', a 17th-century summary of [[Sri Vaishnavism|Srivaisnava]] doctrine{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} – give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth.{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who don't accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu.{{sfn|Krishna|2009}}

===Buddha===
{{main|Buddha in Hinduism}}
The [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] was included as one of the avatars of Vishnu under [[Bhagavatism]] by the [[Gupta period]] between 330 and 550 CE. The mythologies of the Buddha in the [[Theravada]] tradition and of Vishnu in Hinduism share a number of structural and substantial similarities.{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-15}} For example, states Indologist John Holt, the Theravada cosmogony and cosmology states the Buddha covered 6,800,000 yojanas in three strides, including earth to heaven and then placed his right foot over Yugandhara – a legend that parallels that of the Vamana avatar in Hinduism. Similarly, the Buddha is claimed in the Theravada mythology to have been born when the ''dhamma'' is in decline, so as to preserve and uphold the ''dhamma''. These similarities may have contributed to the assimilation of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-15}}

The adoption of [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] as an avatar in [[Bhagavatism]] was a catalyzing factor in Buddhism's assimilation into Vaishnavism's mythic hierarchy. By the 8th century CE, the Buddha was included as an avatar of Vishnu in several [[Puranas]].{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-18}} This assimilation is indicative of the Hindu ambivalence toward the Buddha and Buddhism.{{sfn|Holt|2013|p=18}} Conversely, Vishnu has also been assimilated into Sinhalese Buddhist culture,{{sfn|Holt|2013|p=3}} and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] is sometimes called ''Buddha-Bhagavatism''.&lt;ref name="Budd"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hāṇḍā, Omacanda |title=Buddhist Art &amp; Antiquities of Himachal Pradesh: Up to 8th Century A.D. |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1994 |pages=40 |isbn=81-85182-99-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this period, the concept of Dashavatara was fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chandraiashistory.com/INDIAN%20HISTORY%202003.htm|title=(Prabha IAS-IPS Coaching Centre - Indian History 2003 exam - "The crystallization Of the Avatara Concept and the worship of the incarnations of Vishnu were features of Bhagavatism during the Gupta period"|publisher=Arumbakkam, Chennai|accessdate=1 January 2008|last=Indian|first=History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915213751/http://www.chandraiashistory.com/INDIAN%20HISTORY%202003.htm|archivedate=15 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary interpretation==
Some modern interpreters sequence Vishnu's ten main avatars in a definitive order, from simple life-forms to more complex, and see the Dashavataras as a reflection, or a foreshadowing, of the modern [[theory of evolution]]. Such an interpretation was first propounded by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]] in her 1877 opus ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', in which she proposed the following ordering of the Dashavataras:&lt;ref name="Nanda"&gt;{{cite book|first=Meera|last=Nanda| authorlink=Meera Nanda|chapter= Madame Blavatsky's children: Modern Hinduism's encounters with Darwinism|editor1=James R.

Blavatsky believed that the avatara-related Hindu texts were an allegorical presentation of Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref name="Brown2012p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Mackenzie Brown|title=Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDfgCgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-48467-4|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Orientalism#Orientalism and religion|Orientalist]]s and reformist Hindus in India picked up this idea to rationalize Hinduism as being consistent with modern science. [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]{{refn|Sen was a leader of the colonial era monotheistic [[Brahmo Samaj]] reform movement of Hinduism that adopted ideas from Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brahmo-Samaj Brahmo Samaj], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated in 1882,&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt;

{{quote|The Puranas speak of the different manifestations or incarnations of the Deity in different epochs of the world history. Lo! The Hindu Avatar rises from the lowest scale of life through the fish, the tortoise, and the hog up to the perfection of humanity. Indian Avatarism is, indeed, a crude representation of the ascending scale of Divine creation. Such precisely is the modern theory of evolution.}}

Similarly Aurobindo regarded "Avataric Evolutionism" as a "parable of evolution", one which does not endorse evolutionism, but hints at "transformative phases of spiritual progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Mackenzie Brown|title=Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDfgCgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-48467-4|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nanda, the Dashavatara concept has led to some Hindus asserting that their religion is more open to scientific theories, and has not opposed or persecuted scientists midst them like the way Christianity and Islam has.&lt;ref name="Nandafull"&gt;{{cite book|first=Meera|last=Nanda| authorlink=Meera Nanda|chapter= Madame Blavatsky's children: Modern Hinduism's encounters with Darwinism|editor1=James R. Lewis|editor2=Olav Hammer|title=Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|date=19 November 2010|publisher=BRILL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQOJJiyOyH8C&amp;pg=279&amp;|isbn=90-04-18791-X|pages=279–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, adds Nanda, Hinduism has many cosmological theories and even the Vaishnava one with Dashavatara concept does not explicitly teach evolution of species, rather it states an endless cycles of creationism.&lt;ref name="Nandafull"/&gt;

The Dashavatara concept appealed to other scholars. [[Monier Monier-Williams]] wrote "Indeed, the Hindus were ... Darwinians centuries before the birth of Darwin, and evolutionists centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by the Huxleys of our time, and before any word like evolution existed in any language of the world."&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|first=C Mackenzie|last=Brown| chapter= Vivekananda and the scientific legitimation of Advaita Vedanta|editor1=James R.

B. S. Haldane]] suggested that Dashavatara gave a "rough idea" of vertebrate evolution: a fish, a tortoise, a boar, a man-lion, a dwarf and then four men (Kalki is not yet born).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cover Story: Haldane: Life Of A Prodigious Mind | journal=[[Science Reporter]] | year=1992 | volume=29 | pages=46 | publisher=Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nabinchandra Sen]] explains the Dashavatara with Darwin's evolution in his ''Raivatak''.&lt;ref name="Sen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amiya P.

Deshmukh]] also remarked on the "striking" similarity between Darwin's theory and the Dashavatara.&lt;ref name="Deshmukh1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chintaman Dwarkanath Deshmukh|title=Aspects of Development|page = 33|year=1972|publisher=Young Asia Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Vaishnava Hindus reject this "Avataric Evolutionism" concept. For example, ISKCON's Prakashanand states that this apologeticism degrades the divine status of Rama and Krishna, unduly sequences Rama as inferior to Krishna, both to the Buddha. Rama and Krishna are supremely divine, each right and perfect for the circumstances they appeared in, states Prakashanand.&lt;ref name="Brown2012p182"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2067">'''Double mass analysis''' &lt;ref&gt;Searcy, J.K. and C.H. Hardison (1960). Double-mass curves. U.S. Geological Survey ''Water-Supply Paper ''1541-B''''&lt;/ref&gt; is a commonly used [[data analysis]] approach for investigating the behaviour of records made of [[hydrology|hydrological]] or [[meteorology|meteorological]] data at a number of locations. It is used to determine whether there is a need for corrections to the data - to account for changes in data collection procedures or other local conditions. Such changes may result from a variety of things including changes in [[instrumentation]], changes in observation procedures, or changes in gauge location or surrounding conditions. Double mass analysis for checking consistency of a [[hydrological]] or [[meteorological]] record is considered to be an essential tool before taking it for analysis purpose. This method is based on the hypothesis that each item of the recorded data of a population is consistent.

An example of a double mass analysis is a "double mass plot", or "double mass curve".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.M. (1983) Engineering Hydrology, 3rd edition. Macmillan Press, London. p.27&lt;/ref&gt; For this, points and/or a joining line are plotted where the x- and y- coordinates are determined by the running totals of the values observed at two stations. If both stations are affected to the same extent by the same trends then a double mass curve should follow a straight line. A break in the slope of the curve would indicate that conditions have changed at one location but not at another.
This [[Scientific technique|technique]] is based on the principle that when each recorded data comes from the same [[parent population]], they are consistent.

      <comment>As far as I know, no reliable sources use the term "dysphoria" in the context of body dysmorphic disorder. The term is used in "Body integrity dysphoria", the ICD-11's term for body integrity identity disorder, but this does not seem relevant enough to be put in the lead section.</comment>

{{distinguish|Diaphoresis|Dysmorphia}}
'''Dysphoria''' (from {{lang-el|δύσφορος}} (dysphoros), δυσ-, difficult, and φέρειν, to bear) is a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction. In a psychiatric context, dysphoria may accompany [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or agitation. The term is often used to refer to [[gender dysphoria]], experienced by people whose [[gender identity]] does not align with their [[Sex assignment|sex assigned at birth]], and who may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Common reactions to dysphoria include emotional distress; in some cases, even physical distress. The opposite state of mind is known as [[euphoria]].

==In psychiatry==
Intense states of distress and unease increase the risk of [[suicide]], as well as being unpleasant in themselves. Relieving dysphoria is therefore a priority of psychiatric treatment. One may treat underlying causes such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[bipolar disorder]] as well as the dysphoric symptoms themselves.

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) categorizes specific dysphoria in the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].

[[Body integrity identity disorder]] is referred to as "Body integrity dysphoria" in the ICD-11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/256572629|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria===
{{Main article|Gender dysphoria}}
Gender dysphoria is discomfort, unhappiness, or distress due to one's [[gender]] or physical sex. The current edition ([[DSM-5]]) of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' uses the term "gender dysphoria" where it previously referred to "gender identity disorder", making it clear that they no longer consider the gender identity to be disordered, but rather the emotional state of distress which results from the gender identity.&lt;ref name="recommendations"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=L| last2=Karasic |first2=D |last3=Meyer |first3=W |last4=Wylie |first4=K |title=Recommendations for Revision of the DSM Diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder in Adults|journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|year=2010|volume=12|pages=80–85|doi=10.1080/15532739.2010.509202|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erin J. Sharma''' ([[née]] Donald, born April 24, 1976) is a former [[correction officer]] for the United States [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. She was sentenced to life in federal prison in 2009 for causing the beating death of an inmate at the [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] unit of the [[Coleman Federal Correctional Complex]] near [[Coleman, Florida]].  Prosecutors said that after inmate Richard Delano grabbed her arm through a food slot and bruised it, she and another guard (later revealed to be her supervisor) arranged for him to be assigned to share a cell with a notoriously violent inmate, knowing Delano would be harmed.&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"&gt;{{ cite news

==Early life==
Sharma was the daughter of a [[United States Army|Army]] soldier, and moved around frequently during her childhood.  She graduated high school a year early, and began working as a corrections officer in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1997.  She married Rajesh "Roger" Sharma, a fellow corrections officer, in 1999.  They moved together to [[Edgefield, South Carolina]]; where Erin got a job as a corrections officer at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Edgefield|FCI Edgefield]].  When they gave birth to a daughter, they decided to move to Florida to be closer to Erin's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocala.com/article/20090810/ARTICLES/908101006/1001/NEWS01|title=Ex-guard awaits sentencing for inmate death|last=Lee|first=Suevon|publisher=''[[Star-Banner]]''|date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmate death==
On February 3, 2005, Richard Allen Delano, a convicted [[methamphetamine]] dealer, grabbed Sharma's arm through a food slot, bruising it.  She then said to him, "You're a dead man".&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"/&gt; She received minor first aid treatment and was sent home for the rest of the day.&lt;ref name= "OcalaGuardTestifies"/&gt;
On March 1, Delano, who had a reputation as a [[Informant|snitch]],&lt;ref name= "OcalaLife"&gt;{{ cite news

was transferred into a cell with John Javilo "Animal" McCullah, a convicted murderer who had assaulted all of his previous cellmates. Prior to the transfer, witnesses overheard Sharma encouraging McCullah to attack Delano, but to do so on a day when she was not at work.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;{{ cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, while Sharma was on a three-day vacation, Delano was beaten into a coma. He died 13 days later.
Sharma was charged with two [[felony]] counts of violating Delano's [[civil rights]] under [[color (law)|color of law]] for conspiring to have him killed and with violating his Constitutional right not to be subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"/&gt;

==Trial==
At the federal trial in [[Orlando]], the prosecution showed that Sharma and an alleged corrections officer co-conspirator knew that McCullah, who had been placed on special single-cell hold status, was likely to assault Delano.&lt;ref name= "Sentinel"/&gt;
In his opening statement, federal prosecutor Douglas Kern told the jury that putting Delano into a cell with McCullah "was like putting a sheep in a cage with a wolf". Kern described McCullah as a "hugely violent, racist gang member inmate" who was a member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] [[prison gang]]. He described Sharma as the "puppet master," and McCullah as her puppet.&lt;ref name= "OcalaTrial"/&gt;

FBI Agent James Raby testified about three unrecorded interviews conducted with Sharma following the assault.  Raby said Sharma had acknowledged knowing Delano's reputation as a snitch, knowing that McCullah was notoriously violent, and knowing that the shared cell arrangement would "invariably"&lt;!--word the newspaper uses--&gt; lead to an assault.  He said Sharma had expressed regret about the assault.  Various witnesses described Sharma as a vengeful officer who played favorites and hated snitches.&lt;ref name= "OcalaGuardTestifies"/&gt;

When her own turn to testify came, Sharma denied having made the statements that Raby testified to, and denied telling him that she felt "haunted" by the assault.  She said her threats were clearly jokes, and that she "treated those inmates almost like they were my kids."&lt;ref name= "OcalaGuardTestifies"&gt;{{ cite news

==Sentence==
On October 26, 2009, Senior U.S. District Judge [[Patricia C. Fawsett]] sentenced the 33-year-old Sharma to life in federal prison.  Fawsett said Delano's death was "an expectable result" of the transfer, and that she "took advantage of her superior position" to gain revenge on Delano. Therefore, Delano's death amounted to [[second-degree murder]].  Fawsett also found that Sharma had [[perjury|perjured]] herself on the witness stand when she disputed Raby's testimony, saying that it ran counter to "the overwhelming evidence" of Sharma's involvement in the crime. The perjury finding qualified Sharma for a two-level [[obstruction of justice]] upward departure from the federal [[sentencing guidelines]].&lt;ref name= "OcalaLife"/&gt;  Sharma's attorney said he would file an appeal.&lt;ref name= "Sentinel"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ocala"&gt;{{ cite news

The location where Sharma is serving her sentence is something of a mystery.  According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, Sharma is assigned to the Residential Reentry Management Field Office in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; she was previously assigned to the RRM field office in [[Sacramento, California]].  However, RRMs are not prison facilities, but are merely an administrative designation for inmates assigned to home-confinement, "halfway-houses", or state and county correctional facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/locations/ccm/csc/&lt;/ref&gt;  Since she is serving a life sentence, this designation almost certainly means that she was originally held in a California state prison before being transferred to a Missouri state prison.  However, a search of the Missouri Department of Corrections inmate database does not reveal anyone being held under her name, and an earlier search of the California Department of Corrections database did not turn up anyone under her name either.  This suggests that she is being held under an alias, which would not be unusual for a former correctional officer.

Following the fatal assault, McCullah was temporarily transferred to the [[United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX]], the federal [[supermax]] prison in Colorado. After this he was transferred to the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Victorville|Federal Correctional Institution, Victorville]], a medium security facility in California.  Currently he is serving his sentence in the Special Management Unit at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg]] Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocala.com/article/20091027/ARTICLES/910271010/1001/NEWS01?Title=Guard-sentenced-to-life-in-prison&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;IDType=IRN&amp;IDNumber=03040-063&amp;x=99&amp;y=14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second officer==
During Sharma's trial, Raby testified that Sharma's supervisor, Michael Kennedy, proposed that Delano be transferred into a cell with McCullah, believing that McCullah would give Delano "a good [butt] kicking and head-knocking".
On November 2, 2009, the U.S. Justice Department announced that a grand jury had indicted Kennedy on one count of conspiring to violate Delano's federal civil rights and one count of violating his civil rights by arranging for another inmate to assault him.&lt;ref name= "OcalaKennedy "&gt;{{ cite news

'''Ethnic violence'''  refers to [[violence]] expressly motivated by [[ethnic hatred]] and [[ethnic conflict]].  It is commonly related to [[political violence]], and often the terms are interchangeable, or one is used as a pretext for the other when politically expedient.
Forms of ethnic violence which can be argued to have the character of [[terrorism]] may be known as '''ethnic terrorism''' or '''ethnically-motivated terrorism'''.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} 
"Racist terrorism" is a form of ethnic violence dominated by overt [[racism]] and [[xenophobic]] reactionism.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Ethnic violence in an organized, sustained form is known as [[ethnic conflict]] or warfare ([[race war]]), in contrast to [[class conflict]], where the dividing line is social class rather than ethnic background.

Care must be taken to distinguish ethnic violence, which is violence ''motivated'' by an ethnic division, from violence that just happens to break out between groups of different ethnicity motivated by other factors (political or ideological).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent ethnic rivalry is the subject matter of Jewish sociologist [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]'s ''Der Rassenkampf'' ("Struggle of the Races", 1909); and more recently of [[Amy Chua]]'s notable study, ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World On Fire]]: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability''.
Some academics would place all "nationalist-based violence" under ethnic violence, which would include the World Wars and all major conflicts between industrialised nations during the 19th century.{{dubious|date=August 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Jerry Z. "Us and Them." Foreign Affairs. Council on Foreign Relations, Mar.-Apr. 2008. Web. &lt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63217/jerry-z-muller/us-and-them&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causality and characteristics==
{{essay-like|date=August 2013}}
There are a variety of potential causes for ethnic violence. Research by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NESCI) has shown that violence results when ethnic groups are partially mixed: neither clearly separated enough to reduce contact nor thoroughly mixed enough to build common bonds.  According to Dr. May Lim, a researcher affiliated with NECSI, "Violence normally occurs when a group is large enough to impose cultural norms on public spaces, but not large enough to prevent those norms from being broken. Usually this occurs in places where boundaries between ethnic or cultural groups are unclear." &lt;ref&gt;M. Lim, R. Metzler, Y. Bar-Yam, Global Pattern Formation and Ethnic/Cultural Violence, Science 317, 5844 (2007).http://www.necsi.edu/research/ethnicviolence/sci317/&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory also states that the minimum requirement for ethnic tensions to result in ethnic violence on a systemic level is a heterogeneous society and the lack of a power to prevent them from fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ethnic conflicts that erupted after the end of the Cold War, this lack of outer controls is seen as the cause; Since there was no longer a strong centralized power (in the form of the USSR) to control the various ethnic groups, they then had to provide defense for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that once ethnicity is established, there needs to be strong distinctions, otherwise violence is inevitable.

Another theory supports that a general feeling of lack of security can cause ethnic violence, when paired with proximity to other ethnic groups. This can eventually lead to distrust of the other ethnic groups, which leads to an unwillingness to peacefully coexist with the other ethnic groups.

The emotions that tend to cause ethnic tensions, which can lead to ethnic violence, are fear, hate, resentment, and rage. Individual identities might change throughout the years, but strong emotional issues can lead to a desire to fulfill those needs above all other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Roger Dale. Understanding Ethnic Violence: Fear, Hatred, and Resentment in Twentieth-century Eastern Europe. Cambridge [England: Cambridge UP, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This strong desire to satisfy individual needs, without harming your own group, can have violent results.

Assuming that ethnic groups can be defined as a group of people who band together to protect material goods, while satisfying the need to feel a part of a group, violence resulting from ethnicity can be a result of a violation of either of these. However, this also requires that there was no peaceful solution.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Explaining Interethnic Cooperation." The American Political Science Review 90.4 (1996): 715-35. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory states that ethnic violence is the result of past tensions. Referring to the other ethnic group based solely on their previous offences tends to increase the probability of future violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Explaining Interethnic Cooperation." The American Political Science Review 90.4 (1996): 715-35. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is referenced in the literature on ethnic violence that tends to focus on areas that have already had a history of ethnic violence, instead of comparing them with areas that have had peaceful ethnic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Habyrimana, James, Macartan Humphreys, Daniel Posner, Jeremy Weinstein, Richard Rosecrance, Arthur Stein, and Jerry Z. Muller. "Is Ethnic Conflict Inevitable?" Council on Foreign Relations (July 2008). Web. &lt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64457/james-habyarimana-macartan-humphreys-daniel-posner-jeremy-weinst/is-ethnic-conflict-inevitable#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic violence obviously does not exist in exactly the same conditions in every example. Where one case of ethnic violence might result in a drawn out genocide, another might result in a race riot. Different issues lead to different levels of intensity of violence. The problem mainly comes down to issues of group security. In situations where offensive and defensive actions are indistinguishable to outsiders, and the offensive actions are more effective in insuring group survival, then violence is sure to be present and harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Posen, Barry R. "The Security Problem and Ethnic Conflict." (1993). Johns Hopkins University. Web. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227042314/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This view of ethnic violence placed risk in areas where members of ethnic groups feel insecure about their future, not as a result of emotional tensions.

Ethnic violence often occurs as a result of individual domestic disputes spiralling out of control to large-scale conflicts. When individual disputes occur between two members of different ethnic groups, they can either result in peace or result in further violence. Peace is more likely when the offended person feels their offender will be punished sufficiently in their own ethnic group. Or peace is achieved simply through the fear of greater ethnic violence. If either the belief of retribution or the fear of violence is not present, then ethnic violence may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Explaining Interethnic Cooperation." The American Political Science Review 90.4 (1996): 715-35. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic violence being particularly violent, there are numerous theories for preventing it, or once it starts, for ending it. Yaneer Bar-Yam of the New England Complex Systems Institute suggests that either "clear boundaries" or "thorough mixing" can reduce violence, citing Switzerland as an example.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Unfortunately, poorly planned separations do not lead to peace among ethnic groups.  Religious separation between India and Pakistan left large heterogenous areas in India where violence has since occurred.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientists Who Model Ethnic Violence Find That in Switzerland, Separation Is Key to Peace." Discover Blogs. Discover Magazine, 12 Oct. 2011. Web. &lt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2011/10/12/scientists-who-model-ethnic-violence-find-that-in-switzerland-separation-is-key-to-peace/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] is often presented as the classic "melting pot" of ethnicities. "Ethnic" tensions in the United States are more typically viewed in terms of [[race in the United States|race]].

Using the media to change perceptions of ethnicity might lead to a change in probability of ethnic violence. The use of media that results in ethnic violence is usually a cyclical relationship; one group increases messages of group cohesion in response to a perceived threat, and a neighboring group responds with messages of their own group cohesion. Of course, this only happens when outside groups are already perceived as being potential threats.&lt;ref&gt;Posen, Barry R. "The Security Problem and Ethnic Conflict." (1993). Johns Hopkins University. Web. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227042314/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/cmtoolkit/pdfs/posen-1993.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this logic, ethnic violence might be prevented by decreasing messages of group cohesion, while increasing messages of safety and solidarity with members of other ethnic groups.

Outside forces may also be effective in decreasing the likelihood of ethnic violence. However, not all interferences from outside forces may be helpful. If not handled delicately, the possibility might increase. Outside groups can help stabilize danger zones by imposing gentle economic sanctions, develop more representative political institutions that would allow for minority voices to be heard, and encourage the respect of ethnically diverse communities and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael E., and John Rex. The Ethnicity Reader: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Migration. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 1997. 80-100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if done incorrectly, outside interference can cause a nationalistic lash-back.

*Heat absorption and transfer quality for a [[solar cooker]]

[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark]]s are synthetic figures of merit that summarize the speed of computers in performing various typical tasks.

== Modulation systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In modulation systems for communication, figure of merit of a device means the noise figure&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Amplitude modulation ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Figure of merit for [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{(SNR)_{O,AM}}{(SNR)_{C,AM}}}=\frac{k_a^2P}{1+k_a^2P}
&lt;/math&gt;

Figure of merit for [[Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|double-sideband suppressed-carrier]] (DSB-SC) receiver or that of a [[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] (SSB) modulation is always unity. Therefore, noise performance of AM receiver is inferior to that of a DSB-SC receiver or an SSB receiver.

=== Frequency modulation ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Figure of merit for [[frequency modulation]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{(SNR)_{O,FM}}{(SNR)_{C,FM}}}=\frac{3k_f^2P}{W^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Deception==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
The precision and verifiability of numbers sometimes make them a more effective sales tool than vague and non-numeric descriptions such as "state of the art" or "leaves the others in the dust".  When used in [[deceptive advertising]], the deception lies more in the question of relevance rather than truth since the number quoted, as a figure of merit may not be enough to determine performance when comparing products. For example, when purchasing a laptop a consumer could choose on the basis of the capacity of its hard drive. The [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], [[Disk buffer|buffer]], and [[seek time]]s may not be noted, but may significantly affect performance.

Some figures such as [[Audio power#PMPO|peak music power]] are used in selling consumer merchandise and have the principal merit of yielding high numbers that can impress people who don't know what the numbers mean.  Other figures such as [[Specific fuel consumption (thrust)|specific fuel consumption]] are addressed to engineers and other studious buyers whom the sellers dare not mislead.

Another example is the [[megapixel]] count of a [[digital camera]]. A consumer unaware that the number of pixels on a sensor is only one factor in the quality of the image that is captured may, for example, buy a camera with more pixels squeezed onto a smaller [[image sensor]], thus losing quality to the small pixel size.&lt;ref&gt;Monkman, Jerry: Outdoor Digital Photography; 2011, Appalachian Mountain Club&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Makers of cheap, consumer-market [[optical telescope|telescopes]] often tout the magnification power of their products, sidestepping the fact that [[aperture]], optical quality, and the type and quality of the telescope's mount are more important for obtaining a quality image.

'''Formalism''' is a school of [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply "brackets" (''i.e.'', ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.

==In literary theory==
In [[literary theory]], formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] but also literary devices such as meter and [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.

Formalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against [[Romanticist]] theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, [[Russian formalism]], and soon after Anglo-American [[New Criticism]]. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in [[René Wellek]] and [[Austin Warren]]'s ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1948, 1955, 1962).

Beginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;“Formalism and its Malcontents: Benjamin and de Man on the Function of Allegory”, Jim Hansen, New Literary History, 2004, Vol. 35, No. 4, 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
William H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.&lt;ref&gt;Thelin, WIlliam H. "Advocating Language: An Ethical Approach to Politics in the Classroom". ''The Ethics of Writing Instruction''. Michael Pemberton, ed. Stamford: Ablex Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"&gt;Cain, Mary Ann. "Problematizing Formalism: A Double-Cross of Genre Boundaries." ''College Composition and Communication''. 51:1 Sept 1999. 89-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a "natural" act, one not subject to instruction.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;
In regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;

==Research==
Formalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.

===Russian formalism===
{{Main|Russian formalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Russian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by [[Boris Eichenbaum]], [[Viktor Shklovsky]] and [[Yury Tynyanov]], and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by [[Roman Jakobson]]. (The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:
*The aim is to produce "a science of literature that would be both independent and factual," which is sometimes designated by the term ''[[poetics]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*Since literature is made of language, linguistics will be a foundational element of the science of literature.
*Literature is autonomous from external conditions in the sense that literary language is distinct from ordinary uses of language, not least because it is not (entirely) communicative.
*Literature has its own history, a history of innovation in formal structures, and is not determined (as some crude versions of Marxism have it) by external, material history.
*What a work of literature says cannot be separated from ''how'' the literary work says it, and therefore the form and  of a work, far from being merely the decorative wrapping of an isolable content, is in fact part of the content of the work.

According to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (''ostraneniye,'' more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (''[[syuzhet]]/fabula''). "Defamiliarization" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its "literariness." For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.

This emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was [[Leon Trotsky]]'s ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' (1924).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that "the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: "The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that "Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.

==The Prague Circle and structuralism==
{{Main|Prague linguistic circle}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18934">'''Geochemical modeling''' is the practice of using [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], or both, to analyze the [[chemical reactions]] that affect [[Geology|geologic systems]], commonly with the aid of a computer. It is used in high-temperature [[geochemistry]] to simulate reactions occurring deep in the Earth's interior, in [[magma]], for instance, or to model low-temperature reactions in [[aqueous solutions]] near the Earth's surface, the subject of this article.

== Applications to aqueous systems ==
Geochemical modeling is used in a variety of fields, including environmental [[Environmental protection|protection]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]],&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, ''Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[petroleum industry]], and [[economic geology]].&lt;ref name = "GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Models can be constructed, for example, to understand the composition of natural waters; the mobility and breakdown of [[Pollution|contaminants]] in flowing [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]]; the formation and dissolution of rocks and [[minerals]] in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or [[Carbon sequestration|carbon dioxide]]; and the generation of [[Acid mine drainage|acidic waters]] and leaching of metals from mine wastes.

== Development of geochemical modeling ==
[[Robert Garrels|Garrels]] and Thompson (1962) first applied chemical modeling to geochemistry in 25&amp;nbsp;°C and one atmosphere total pressure.  Their calculation, computed by hand, is now known as an ''equilibrium model'', which predicts species distributions, mineral saturation states, and gas fugacities from measurements of bulk solution composition. By removing small aliquots of [[solvent]] water from an equilibrated spring water and repeatedly recalculating the species distribution, Garrels and Mackenzie (1967) simulated the reactions that occur as spring water evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;Garrels, R.M. and F.T. Mackenzie, 1967, Origin of the chemical compositions of some springs and lakes. ''Equilibrium Concepts in Natural Waters, Advances in Chemistry Series'' '''67''', American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, pp. 222-242&lt;/ref&gt; This coupling of mass transfer with an equilibrium model, known as a ''reaction path model'', enabled geochemists to simulate reaction processes.

[[Harold C. Helgeson|Helgeson]] (1968) introduced the first computer program to solve equilibrium and reaction path models,&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, H.C., 1968, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, I. Thermodynamic relations. ''Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta'' '''32''', 853-877&lt;/ref&gt; which he and coworkers used to model geological processes like [[weathering]], sediment [[diagenesis]], [[evaporation]], [[hydrothermal alteration]], and [[Ore genesis|ore deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, H.C., R.M. Garrels and F.T. Mackenzie, 1969, Evaluation of irreversible reactions in geochemical processes involving minerals and aqueous solutions, II. Applications. ''Geochemica et Cosmochimica Acta'' '''33''', 455-481&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments in geochemical modeling included reformulating the governing equations, first as [[ordinary differential equations]], then later as [[algebraic equations]]. Additionally, [[Component (thermodynamics)|chemical components]] came to be represented in models by aqueous species, minerals, and gases, rather than by the elements and electrons which make up the species, simplifying the governing equations and their numerical solution.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt;

Recent improvements in the power of personal computers and [[#Software programs in common use|modeling software]] have made geochemical models more accessible and more flexible in their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C., 2009, Geochemical Modeling of Reaction Paths and Geochemical Reaction Networks. In E.H. Oelkers and J. Schott(eds.), 2009, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Water-Rock Interaction. ''Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry'' '''70''', 533-569&lt;/ref&gt; Geochemists are now able to construct on their laptops complex reaction path or [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]] which previously would have required a supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. ''Ground Water'' '''38''', 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting up a geochemical model ==
An aqueous system is uniquely defined by its chemical composition, [[temperature]], and [[pressure]].&lt;ref name = "Anderson"&gt;Anderson, G.M. 2009, ''Thermodynamics of Natural Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 664 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Creating geochemical models of such systems begins by choosing the basis, the set of [[Chemical species|aqueous species]], [[minerals]], and [[gases]] which are used to write chemical reactions and express composition. The number of basis entries required equals the number of [[Component (thermodynamics)|components]] in the system, which is fixed by the [[Gibbs' phase rule|phase rule]] of thermodynamics. Typically, the basis is composed of water, each mineral in equilibrium with the system, each gas at known [[fugacity]], and important aqueous species. Once the basis is defined, a modeler can solve for the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium state]], which is described by [[Law of mass action|mass action]] and mass balance equations for each component.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt;

In finding the equilibrium state, a geochemical modeler solves for the distribution of mass of all species, minerals, and gases which can be formed from the basis. This includes the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]], [[activity coefficient]], and [[concentration]] of aqueous species, the [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] state of minerals, and the fugacity of gases. Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero are said to be in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed [[supersaturation|supersaturated]], indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve.&lt;ref name = "Anderson" /&gt;

Geochemical modelers commonly create reaction path models to understand how systems respond to changes in composition, temperature, or pressure. By configuring the manner in which mass and heat transfer are specified (i.e., open or closed systems), models can be used to represent a variety of geochemical processes. Reaction paths can assume chemical equilibrium, or they can incorporate kinetic rate laws to calculate the timing of reactions. In order to predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath, geochemical models are increasingly being coupled with [[Groundwater model|hydrologic models]] of mass and heat transport to form [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]].&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt; Specialized geochemical modeling programs that are designed as cross-linkable re-entrant software objects enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChemPlugin.ORG|url=http://chemplugin.org/|publisher=Aqueous Solutions LLC|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of reactions ==
Geochemical models are capable of simulating many different types of [[Chemical reaction|reactions]]. Included among them are: 
*[[Acid-base reactions]]
*[[Coordination complex|Aqueous complexation]]
*Mineral [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]]
*Reduction and oxidation ([[redox]]) reactions, including those catalyzed by [[enzyme]]s, [[Reactions on surfaces|surfaces]], and [[microorganism]]s
*[[Adsorption|Sorption]], [[ion exchange]], and surface complexation
*Gas dissolution and [[Degasification|exsolution]]
*[[Stable isotope|Stable isotope fractionation]]
*[[Radioactive decay]]

Simple [[phase diagrams]] or plots are commonly used to illustrate such geochemical reactions. Eh-pH [[Pourbaix diagram|(Pourbaix)]] diagrams, for example, are a special type of activity diagram which represent acid-base and redox chemistry graphically.

== Uncertainties in geochemical modelling ==
Various sources can contribute to a range of simulation results. The range of the simulation results is defined as model uncertainty. One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the conceptual model, which is developed and defined by the modeller. Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dethlefsen|first=Frank|last2=Haase|first2=Christoph|last3=Ebert|first3=Markus|last4=Dahmke|first4=Andreas|date=2011-01-01|title=Effects of the variances of input parameters on water-mineral interactions during CO2 sequestration modeling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187661021100590X|journal=Energy Procedia|series=10th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies|volume=4|pages=3770–3777|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.02.311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty. These are the applied thermodynamic database and the parameters for the kinetic minerals dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=Christoph|last2=Dethlefsen|first2=Frank|last3=Ebert|first3=Markus|last4=Dahmke|first4=Andreas|date=2013-06-01|title=Uncertainty in geochemical modelling of CO2 and calcite dissolution in NaCl solutions due to different modelling codes and thermodynamic databases|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292713000656|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=33|pages=306–317|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the thermodynamic data (i.e. equilibrium constants, parameters for temperature correction, activity equations and coefficients) can result in large uncertainties. Furthermore, the large spans of experimentally derived rate constants for minerals dissolution rate laws can cause large variations in simulation results. Despite this is well-known, uncertainties are not frequently considered when conducting geochemical modelling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=Christoph|last2=Ebert|first2=Markus|last3=Dethlefsen|first3=Frank|date=2016-04-01|title=Uncertainties of geochemical codes and thermodynamic databases for predicting the impact of carbon dioxide on geologic formations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292716300087|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=67|pages=81–92|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing uncertainties can be achieved by comparison of simulation results with experimental data, although experimental data does not exist at every temperature-pressure condition and for every chemical system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although such a comparison or calibration can not be conducted consequently the geochemical codes and thermodynamic databases are state-of-the-art and the most useful tools for predicting geochemical processes.

The grandfather paradox was alluded to in written stories as early as 1929, and in 1931 it was described as "the age-old argument of preventing your birth by killing your grandparents" in a letter to American science fiction magazine [[Amazing Stories]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39KQY1FnSfkC|title=Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|date=1999|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=0387985719|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=255, 286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[science fiction]] stories dealing with the paradox are the short story ''Ancestral Voices'' by [[Nathaniel Schachner]], published in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginn|first1=Sherry|last2=Leach|first2=Gillian I.|title=Time-Travel Television: The Past from the Present, the Future from the Past|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=London|isbn=1442255773|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1944 book ''[[Future Times Three]]'' by [[René Barjavel]], although a number of other works from the 1930s and 1940s touched upon the topic in various degrees of detail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Variants==
The grandfather paradox encompasses any change to the past,&lt;ref name="NicholasSmith"/&gt; and it's presented in many variations. Physicist John Garrison et al. give a variation of the paradox of an electronic circuit which sends a signal through a time machine to shut itself off, and receives the signal before it sends it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrison|first1=J.C.|last2=Mitchell|first2=M.W.|last3=Chiao|first3=R.Y.|last4=Bolda|first4=E.L.|title=Superluminal Signals: Causal Loop Paradoxes Revisited|journal=Physics Letters A|date=August 1998|volume=245|issue=1-2|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(98)00381-8|arxiv=quant-ph/9810031|bibcode=1998PhLA..245...19G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|title=Time Machine Tales|date=2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319488622|pages=335-336}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent paradox is known in [[philosophy]] as ''autoinfanticide'', going back in time and killing oneself as a baby.&lt;ref name="horwich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horwich|first1=Paul|title=Asymmetries in Time: Problems in the Philosophy of Science|date=1987|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262580888|page=116|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Hitler's murder paradox}}Another variant of the grandfather paradox is the "Hitler paradox" or "Hitler's murder paradox",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/04/06/book-review-life-after-life-kate-atkinson/OL6nDqGHPFgxaUBrJgXEHL/story.html|title=Book review: Life after Life’ by Kate Atkinson|author=Eugenia Williamson|date=6 April 2013|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=9 August 2013|quote=Google the phrase “go back in time and,” and the search engine will suggest completing the phrase with a simple directive: “kill Hitler.” The appeal of murdering the Nazi dictator is so great that it has its own subgenre within speculative fiction, a trope known as “Hitler’s murder paradox” in which a time traveller journeys back far enough to nip the leader — and World War II — in the bud, typically with unexpected consequences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fairly frequent trope in science fiction, in which the protagonist travels back in time to murder [[Adolf Hitler]] before he can instigate [[World War II]] and [[The Holocaust]]. Rather than necessarily physically preventing time travel, the action removes any ''reason'' for the travel, along with any knowledge that the reason ever existed, thus removing any point in travelling in time in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=J.H.|title=Time Travel: A New Perspective|date=1997|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=Minnesota|isbn=9781567180855|page=23|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBf_HjZHUxkC|quote=A variation on the grandfather paradox . . . is the Hitler paradox. In this one you travel back in time to murder Hitler before he starts the Second World War, thus saving millions of lives. But if you murder Hitler in, say, 1938, then the Second World War will never come about and you will have no reason to travel back in time to murder Hitler!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the consequences of Hitler's existence are so monumental and all-encompassing that for anyone born after the war, it is likely that their birth was influenced in some way by its effects, and thus the lineage aspect of the paradox would directly apply in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inglis-Arkell|first1=Esther|title=Are we running out of time to kill Hitler via time travel?|url=http://io9.com/5932026/are-we-running-out-of-time-to-kill-hitler-via-time-travel|website=io9|accessdate=2013-08-12|date=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advocate a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] approach to the grandfather paradox. When the time traveller kills their grandfather, they are actually killing a parallel universe version of their grandfather, and the time traveller's original universe is unaltered; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not "genuine" time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Time Travel and Modern Physics|date=December 23, 2009|author1=Frank Arntzenius|author2=Tim Maudlin|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other variants, the actions of the time traveller have no effect outside of their own personal experience, as depicted in [[Alfred Bester]]'s short story ''[[The Men Who Murdered Mohammed]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Philosophical analysis==
Even without knowing whether time travel to the past is physically possible, it is possible to show using [[modal logic]] that changing the past results in a logical contradiction. If it is necessarily true that the past happened in a certain way, then it is false and impossible for the past to have occurred in any other way. A time traveller would not be able to change the past from the way it ''is'', they would only act in a way that is already consistent with what ''necessarily'' happened.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198236212|pages=368–369|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration of the grandfather paradox has led some to the idea that time travel is by its very nature paradoxical and therefore logically impossible. For example, the philosopher [[Bradley Dowden]] made this sort of argument in the textbook ''Logical Reasoning'', arguing that the possibility of creating a contradiction rules out time travel to the past entirely. However, some philosophers and scientists believe that time travel into the past need not be logically impossible provided that there is no possibility of changing the past,&lt;ref name="NicholasSmith"/&gt; as suggested, for example, by the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]]. Bradley Dowden himself revised the view above after being convinced of this in an exchange with the philosopher Norman Swartz.&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/time_travel1.htm |title=Time Travel - Visiting the Past|author=Norman Swartz|year=1993|publisher=SFU.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical physics===
Consideration of the possibility of backwards time travel in a hypothetical universe described by a [[Gödel metric]] led famed logician [[Kurt Gödel]] to assert that time might itself be a sort of illusion.&lt;ref name="Yourgrau"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yourgrau|first1=Palle|title=A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Godel and Einstein|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780786737000|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtY907BlhxYC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22time+itself+-+hence+speed+and+motion+-+is+but+an+illusion%22&amp;dq=2005+A+World+Without+Time:+The+Forgotten+Legacy+of+G%C3%B6del+and+Einstein#v=onepage|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holt|first=Jim|title=Time Bandits|date=2005-02-21|publisher=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/28/time-bandits-2|accessdate=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests something along the lines of the [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|block time]] view in which time is just another dimension like space, with all events at all times being fixed within this 4-dimensional "block".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A variation of [[Hugh Everett|Everett's]] [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not "genuine" time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Time Travel and Modern Physics|date=December 23, 2009|author1=Frank Arntzenius|author2=Tim Maudlin|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self-consistent history, so that time travelers remain within their own world rather than traveling to a different one.&lt;ref name="Hawking warp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html|title=Space and Time Warps|year=1999|accessdate=February 25, 2012|last1=Hawking|first1=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causal loops==
{{main|Causal loop}}
Backwards time travel that does not create a grandfather paradox creates a causal loop. The [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] expresses one view on how backwards [[time travel]] would be possible without the generation of paradoxes. According to this hypothesis, physics in or near [[closed timelike curves]] (time machines) can only be consistent with the universal laws of physics, and thus only self-consistent events can occur. Anything a time traveller does in the past must have been part of history all along, and the time traveller can never do anything to prevent the trip back in time from happening, since this would represent an inconsistency. Novikov et al. used the example given by physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] for the grandfather paradox, of a billiard ball heading towards a time machine: the ball's older self emerges from the time machine and strikes its younger self so its younger self never enters the time machine. Novikov et al. showed how this system can be solved in a self-consistent way which avoids the grandfather paradox, though it creates a causal loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

Norton|location=New York|isbn=0393312763}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|510–511}} Some physicists suggest that causal loops only exist in the quantum scale, in a fashion similar to the [[chronology protection conjecture]] proposed by [[Stephen Hawking]], so histories over larger scales are not looped.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;{{rp|517}} Another conjecture, the [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]], suggests that every closed timelike curve passes through an [[event horizon]], which prevents such causal loops from being observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|title=Traversable wormholes: The Roman ring|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 April 1997|volume=55|issue=8|pages=5212–5214|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212|arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5212V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth Lloyd and other researchers at MIT have proposed an expanded version of the Novikov principle, according to which probability bends to prevent paradoxes from occurring. Outcomes would become stranger as one approaches a forbidden act, as the universe must favor improbable events to prevent impossible ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Laura|title=Physicists Tame Time Travel by Forbidding You to Kill Your Grandfather|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/07/time-travel-2/|website=WIRED|accessdate=2017-01-02|date=2010-07-20|quote=But this dictum against paradoxical events causes possible unlikely events to happen more frequently. 'If you make a slight change in the initial conditions, the paradoxical situation won’t happen. That looks like a good thing, but what it means is that if you’re very near the paradoxical condition, then slight differences will be extremely amplified,' says Charles Bennett of IBM’s Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum physics===
Physicist [[David Deutsch]] has argued that quantum computation with a negative delay&amp;mdash;backwards time travel&amp;mdash;produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=David|authorlink=David Deutsch|title=Quantum mechanics near closed timelike lines|journal=Physical Review D|date=15 November 1991|volume=44|issue=10|pages=3197–3217|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, researchers published a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons.&lt;ref name="Ringbauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringbauer|first1=Martin|last2=Broome|first2=Matthew A.|last3=Myers|first3=Casey R.|last4=White|first4=Andrew G.|last5=Ralph|first5=Timothy C.|title=Experimental simulation of closed timelike curves|journal=Nature Communications|date=19 June 2014|volume=5|page=4145|doi=10.1038/ncomms5145|pmid=24942489|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4145R|arxiv=1501.05014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch uses the terminology of "multiple universes" in his paper in an effort to express the quantum phenomena, but notes that this terminology is unsatisfactory. Others have taken this to mean that "Deutschian time travel" involves multiple universes in order to resolve the grandfather paradox.&lt;ref name="Billings"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lee Billings|title=Time Travel Simulation Resolves 'Grandfather Paradox'|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/|accessdate=24 September 2014|agency=Scientific American|date=2 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC (closed timelike curve) fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic [[quantum field theory]] on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|Water balance]]
'''Groundwater recharge''' or '''deep drainage''' or '''deep percolation''' is a [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] process where [[water]] moves downward from [[surface water]] to [[groundwater]]. Recharge is the primary method through which water enters an [[aquifer]].  This process usually occurs in the [[vadose zone]] below plant [[root]]s and is often expressed as a [[flux]] to the [[water table]] surface. Recharge occurs both naturally (through the [[water cycle]]) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., "artificial groundwater recharge"), where rainwater and or [[reclaimed water]] is routed to the subsurface.

==Processes==
Groundwater is recharged naturally by [[rain]] and [[snow]] melt and to a smaller extent by surface water (rivers and lakes). Recharge  may be impeded somewhat by human activities including paving, development, or [[logging]].  These activities can result in loss of topsoil resulting in reduced water infiltration, enhanced [[surface runoff]] and reduction in recharge. Use of groundwaters, especially for [[irrigation]], may also lower the water tables. Groundwater recharge is an important process for [[sustainable]] groundwater management, since the volume-rate [[water abstraction|abstracted]] from an [[aquifer]] in the long term should be less than or equal to the volume-rate that is recharged.

Recharge can help move excess salts that accumulate in the root zone to deeper soil layers, or into the groundwater system. Tree roots increase water [[Soil#Soil water|saturation]] into [[groundwater]] reducing water [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="trees water infiltration"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | title=Urban Trees Enhance Water Infiltration | publisher=The American Society of Agronomy | work=Fisher, Madeline | date=November 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 31, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602034025/https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2008/1117/221/ | archivedate=June 2, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Flooding]] temporarily increases [[stream bed|river bed]] [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] by moving clay soils downstream, and this increases aquifer recharge.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/major-floods-recharge-aquifers/ | title=Major floods recharge aquifers | publisher=University of New South Wales Science | date=January 24, 2011 | accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial groundwater recharge is becoming increasingly important in India, where [[Overdrafting|over-pumping]] of groundwater by farmers has led to underground resources becoming depleted. In 2007, on the recommendations of the [[International Water Management Institute]], the Indian government allocated {{INRConvert|1800|c|year=2007}} to fund dug-well [[Aquifer storage and recovery|recharge projects]] (a dug-well is a wide, shallow well, often lined with concrete) in 100 districts within seven states where water stored in hard-rock aquifers had been over-exploited. Another environmental issue is the disposal of waste through the water flux such as dairy farms, industrial, and urban [[Surface runoff|runoff]].

===Wetlands===
[[Wetlands]] help maintain the level of the water table and exert control on the hydraulic head (O'Brien 1988; Winter 1988). This provides force for groundwater recharge and discharge to other waters as well. The extent of groundwater recharge by a wetland is dependent upon [[soil type|soil]], [[vegetation]], site, perimeter to volume ratio, and water table gradient (Carter and Novitzki 1988; Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge occurs through [[soil type|mineral soils]] found primarily around the edges of wetlands (Verry and Timmons 1982) The soil under most wetlands is relatively impermeable. A high perimeter to volume ratio, such as in small wetlands, means that the surface area through which water can infiltrate into the groundwater is high (Weller 1981). Groundwater recharge is typical in small wetlands such as [[Prairie Pothole Region|prairie potholes]], which can contribute significantly to recharge of regional groundwater resources (Weller 1981). Researchers have discovered groundwater recharge of up to 20% of wetland volume per season (Weller 1981).

===Depression-focused recharge===
If water falls uniformly over a field such that [[field capacity]] of the soil is not exceeded, then negligible water percolates to [[groundwater]].  If instead water puddles in low-lying areas, the same water volume concentrated over a smaller area may exceed field capacity resulting in water that percolates down to recharge groundwater.  The larger the relative contributing runoff area is, the more focused infiltration is.  The recurring process of water that falls relatively uniformly over an area, flowing to groundwater selectively under surface depressions is depression focused recharge.  Water tables rise under such depressions.

====Depression pressure====
Depression focused groundwater recharge can be very important in [[arid region]]s.  More rain events are capable of contributing to groundwater supply.

Depression focused groundwater recharge also profoundly effects [[contaminant]] transport into groundwater.  This is of great concern in regions with [[karst]] geological formations because water can eventually dissolve tunnels all the way to [[aquifer]]s, or otherwise disconnected streams.  This extreme form of preferential flow, accelerates the transport of contaminants and the [[erosion]] of such [[tunnel]]s.  In this way depressions intended to trap [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water—before it flows to vulnerable water resources—can connect underground over time.  [[Cavitation]] of surfaces above into the tunnels, results in [[pothole]]s or caves.

Deeper ponding exerts [[pressure]] that forces water into the ground faster.  Faster flow dislodges contaminants otherwise adsorbed on soil and carries them along. This can carry [[pollution]] directly to the raised [[water table]] below and into the [[groundwater supply]].  Thus the quality of water collecting in [[infiltration basin]]s is of special concern.

====Pollution====
Pollution in stormwater [[Surface runoff|runoff]] collects in retention basins.  Concentrating degradable contaminants can accelerate [[biodegradation]].  However, where and when water tables are high this affects appropriate design of [[detention pond]]s, [[retention pond]]s and [[rain garden]]s.

==Estimation methods==

Rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to quantify since other related processes, such as [[evaporation]], [[transpiration]] (or [[evapotranspiration]]) and [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] processes must first be measured or estimated to determine the balance.

===Physical===

Physical methods use the principles of [[soil physics]] to estimate recharge. The ''direct'' physical methods are those that attempt to actually measure the volume of water passing below the root zone. ''Indirect'' physical methods rely on the measurement or estimation of soil physical parameters, which along with soil physical principles, can be used to estimate the potential or actual recharge. After months without rain the level of the rivers under humid climate is low and represents solely drained groundwater. Thus, the recharge can be calculated from this base flow if the catchment area is already known.

===Chemical===

Chemical methods use the presence of relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] water-soluble substances, such as an [[isotopic tracer]] or [[chloride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=G.B. |author2=Hughes, M.W. |year=1978 |title=The use of environmental chloride and tritium to estimate total recharge to an unconfined aquifer |journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research |volume=16 |pages=181–195 |doi=10.1071/SR9780181 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving through the soil, as deep drainage occurs.

===Numerical models===

Recharge can be estimated using [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]], using such [[Source code|codes]] as [[Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance]], [[UNSAT-H]], [[SHAW]], [[Weap|WEAP]], and [[MIKE SHE]]. The 1D-program [[Hydrus (software)|HYDRUS1D]] is available online. The codes generally use [[climate]] and [[soil]] data to arrive at a recharge estimate and use the [[Richards equation]] in some form to model groundwater flow in the [[vadose zone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8000">The '''Kern County child abuse cases''' started the [[day care sexual abuse hysteria]] of the 1980s in [[Kern County, California]].&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news |first= Maggie|last= Jones|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Who Was Abused? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/magazine/19KIDSL.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position= |quote=There are several ways to view the small white house on Center Street in [[Bakersfield, California]].

At least 36 people were convicted and most of them spent years imprisoned. Thirty-four convictions were overturned on appeal.  The district attorney responsible for the convictions was [[Ed Jagels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truthinjustice.org/ed-jagels.htm |title=Mean Justice - Dirty Secrets |website=Truthinjustice.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was sued by at least one of those whose conviction was overturned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aele.org/law/2003LRAUG/mvc.html|title=Modahl v.

==History==
In 1982, Alvin and Debbie McCuan's two daughters, coached by their step-grandmother Mary Ann Barbour, who had custody of them, alleged they had been abused by their parents, and accused them of being part of a sex ring that included Scott and Brenda Kniffen. The Kniffens' two sons also claimed to have been abused. No physical evidence was ever found. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted in 1984 and given a combined sentence of over 1000 years in prison.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_baker.htm |title=Kern County ritual abuse cases |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=The triggering incident occurred in 1980 when Becky McCuan disclosed that her grandfather, Rod Phelps, had touched her inappropriately. The family doctor confirmed the abuse.  |publisher=Religious Tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convictions were overturned in 1996 and the two couples were released. In 2001, a TV movie about the Kniffens titled ''Just Ask My Children'' was aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280474/|title=Just Ask My Children|date=10 September 2001|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six similar cases occurred throughout Kern County. For instance, the testimony of five young boys was the prosecution's key evidence in a trial in which four defendants were convicted. John Stoll, a 41-year-old carpenter, received the longest sentence of the group: 40 years for 17 counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. "It never happened," Ed Sampley, one of the accusers, told a ''New York Times'' reporter in 2004. He claimed he had lied about Stoll. Stoll was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/01/local/me-stoll1 Conviction reversed after 19 years], [[Los Angeles Times]], John Johnson, May 1, 2004. Retrieved 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090930214951/http://www.wrongfulconvictionlawsuitdefense.com/2009/09/articles/news/john-stoll-to-receive-5m-settlement-in-20-year-wrongful-conviction-case-featured-in-the-documentary-witch-hunt/ Web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The county paid out nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims.&lt;ref name=edj&gt;{{cite news|title=Crusading Calif.

MSNBC also made a documentary on John Stoll and the Kern County cases.

Sampley and three other former accusers returned in 2004 to the courthouse where they had testified against Stoll, this time to say that Stoll never molested them. In their late 20s, each of them said he always knew the truth—that Stoll had never touched them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/magazine/19KIDSL.html|title=Who Was Abused?|date=19 September 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stoll's son has "continued to say that he had been molested."&lt;ref name=Logan&gt;{{cite news|last=Logan |first=Jessica |title=Prosecutor's fire makes her either loved or loathed |publisher=The Bakersfield Californian |date=2005-05-31 |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/862/story/100201.html |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235257/http://bakersfield.com/862/story/100201.html |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, the only defendant with a previous conviction of molestation was Grant Self, who rented Stoll's pool house briefly.&lt;ref name=Branco&gt;{{cite news|last=Branco|first=Shellie|title=Ruling puts man back in hospital|publisher=The Bakersfield Californian|date=2007-04-18|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/619/story/122888.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113056/http://www.bakersfield.com/619/story/122888.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Stoll had to wait until 2004 for the reversal of his convictions, but was released on the new testimony.

Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that foregrounded satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' as training material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110522150523/http://members.shaw.ca/imaginarycrimes/michelleremembers.htm Archive.is]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is a loosely defined concept that addresses the human [[awareness]] of both internal and external stimuli. This can refer to spiritual recognition, psychological understanding, medically altered states, or more modern-day concepts of life purpose, satisfaction, and [[self-actualization]].

Most proposals map consciousness in a series of levels, some stages of which are more continuous or complex than others. Movement between stages is often bidirectional depending on internal and external conditions, with each mental ascension precipitating a change in reactivity. In the most basic sense, this alteration might lead to a reduced responsiveness as seen in [[anesthesiology]]; more abstract facets of tiered consciousness describe characteristics of profoundness, [[insight]], [[perception]], or [[understanding]].

First appearing in the historical records of the ancient [[Maya civilization#Writing and literacy|Mayan]] and [[Incan#Communication and medicine|Incan]] civilizations, proposals of multiple levels of consciousness have pervaded spiritual, psychological, medical, and moral speculations in both [[Eastern culture#Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures. Because of occasional and sometimes substantial overlap between [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], there have recently been attempts to combine perspectives to form new models that integrate components of separate viewpoints.

Which if any of these proposals, models or viewpoints can be verified or falsified is open to question.

==History==

[[File:The Pyramid of Kulkucan (3182000923).jpg|thumb|alt=Pyramid of Kulkucan|Pyramid of Kulkucan (found at the center of the Chichen Itza)]]Although many cultures have incorporated theories of the layered consciousness into their belief structure, particularly for spiritual means before the [[Separation of church and state#Ancient history|separation of church and state]] within any given civilization, the Ancient Mayans were among the first to propose an organized sense of each level, its purpose, and its temporal connection to humankind.

==Mayans==

The pyramid of consciousness has defined [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] thought since the dawn of its civilization around 2000 BCE. Shamans and priests defined consciousness as an awareness of being aware, commonly referred to as a branch of [[metacognition]]. Because consciousness incorporates stimuli from the environment as well as internally, the Mayans believed it to be the most basic form of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calleman|first=Carl Johan|title=Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time: the Mayan Calendar|year=2000|publisher=Garev Publishing International|isbn=978-0970755803|pages=1–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This existence, which they referred to as a loose translation of ''[[Cosmos]]'', was made up of nine underworlds, depicted concretely through the nine-storied [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent]] in [[Chichen Itza]], [[Tikal Temple I|the Temple of the Jaguar]] in [[Tikal]], and the [[Temple of the Inscriptions]] in [[Palenque]]. Within these nine underworlds are a specified "day" and "night", symbolizing periods of enlightenment, increased consciousness, and a heightened ability to interact with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calleman|first=Carl Johan|title=Mayan|authorlink=Carl Johan Calleman|work=Calendar: The Pyramid of Consciousness|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Mayan_Calendar/id/1722|publisher=The Global Oneness Commitment|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710212121/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Mayan_Calendar/id/1722|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common cause for debate is the exponentially accelerating dates separating each level of consciousness, where each stage occurs roughly 20 times faster than the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lungold|first=Ian Xel|title=Mayan Calendar Time Scale for Man's Evolution on Earth|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/962704/Mayan-Time-Scale-for-Mans-Evolution-on-Earth|work=The Mayan Calendar Comes North|publisher=Mayan Majix Learning Lab|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Theories==

[[File:PeterSavichHeartChakra.jpg|thumb|alt=The Seven Chakras|The Seven [[Chakras]] ]]Although historical views of the separation of consciousness into various layers do not exactly mirror modern-day perspectives, many parallels can be gathered from the overarching themes found in [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures.

===Eastern perspectives===

Many specific similarities have been drawn between Ancient Incan and historical Eastern views of tiered consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillabel|first=Dirk|title=Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness|year=2001|publisher=House of the Sun|location=Seattle, WA|pages=1–53|url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/sevenlevels.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within most Eastern belief structures is the principle of the Cosmos as a joint entity with human awareness. Many branches stress the importance of AUM, also written [[Om]], as the first sound produced after the world was created. Within [[Christianity]] this concept can be likened to the first words of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] regarding the holiness of the Word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Azariah|first=Jayapaul|title=The Symbol OM (Aum)|url=http://xuxoweb.galeon.com/Aum.html|accessdate=3 March 2011|newspaper=Eubios Ethics Institute Newsletter 4|date=July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical beliefs====

The majority of Eastern perspectives assert that while consciousness originates from the sound of AUM, it has incorporated itself into flesh, which therefore gives humankind the goal of attaining oneness with the universe once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=James H.|title=Zen-brain reflections : reviewing recent developments in meditation and states of consciousness|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262012232|pages=1–586|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ4fyfH_t9EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Incan tradition, this oneness eliminates the separation of external and internal changes into one general indication of movement from stage to stage, commonly known as the Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Consciousness !! Description !! Notes
|-
| Personal || Knowledge of the self and of personality ||
|-

|-
| Light || Attained only by near-death experiences; "tunnel effect" || First level above the human world
|-
| Sound || Only heard when the mind attunes itself to the world || From the primeval vibration AUM
|}

====Modern-day beliefs====

Like the Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness, [[yoga]] meditation practices as well as the teachings of [[Vedanta]] and [[Tantra]] emphasize the importance of [[self-realization]], a concept that has become increasingly popular in Western philosophy after [[Abraham Maslow|Abraham Maslow's]] and [[Carl Rogers|Carl Rogers's]] research in [[Humanistic Psychology]].

=====Advaita Vedanta=====

[[File:Aum by a Korean artist.jpg|thumb|alt=Aum (Om) Mantra|Aum (Om) Mantra]]In particular, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] has been a topic of extensive study in both Eastern and Western cultures for its tiered depiction of the steps toward attaining self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|title=The Self in Advaita Vedanta|journal=International Philosophical Quarterly|year=1966|volume=6|pages=5–21|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=ipq_1966_0006_0001_0003_0004&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;q=the%20self%20in%20advaita%20vedanta|accessdate=3 March 2011|doi=10.5840/ipq19666118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the unidirectional nature of Mayan, Inca, and ancient shamanic perspectives, however, this particular belief structure arranges the attainment of oneness with OM through rows and domains, each of which constitutes a fragment of this vibratory sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Victor|first=P. George|author2=V.V.S. Saibaba |title=Studies in Vedanta: Essays in Honour of Professor S.S. Rama Rao Pappu|journal=Teaching Philosophy|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|pages=332–335|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=teachphil_2007_0030_0003_0332_0335&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;q=the%20self%20in%20advaita%20vedanta|accessdate=3 March 2011|doi=10.5840/teachphil200730319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Row !! Level !! Realm !! Description
|-
| 1: "A" || Waking || Conscious || External, active conscious
|-
| 2: "U" || Dreaming || Unconscious || Subtle images and impressions
|-
| 3: "M" || Deep Sleep || Subconscious || Focus on latent or inactive thought patterns
|-
| 4: "AUM" || Absolute || Consciousness || Transcending of all three levels
|}

=====OM Mantra=====

Similarly, the seven levels of consciousness defined by modern-day OM mantras strive to reach Absolute Reality through the same four realms described in the Advaita Vedanta, with three transitional tiers in between each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bharati|first=Swami Jnaneshvara|title=Om Mantra and the Seven Levels of Consciousness|year=2007|publisher=Lulu Enterprises, Inc.|location=Raleigh, NC|pages=1–32|asin=B004JH6982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Between the first ("A") and second ("U") levels is the ''Unmani'', similar to the Western concept of [[hypnagogia]], or the movement from full alertness into [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep#Stages of NREM sleep|stage 1 sleep]]
* Between the second ("U") and third ("M") levels is the ''Aladani'', mirroring ideas of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]
* Between the third ("M") and fourth ("AUM") levels is the ''Samadhi'', or the attainment of deep absorption

=====The Veda=====

The ancient Indian [[Vedas]] texts have lent a comparable view of unified consciousness, with a key difference in the purpose of human ascension from stage to stage. Instead of oneness with the universe, the Vedic vision of consciousness emphasizes the importance of attaining knowledge and pure intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Satya P.|title=Vedic vision of consciousness and reality|year=2005|publisher=Centre for Studies in Civilizations|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788187586180|pages=1–522|url=http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/satya+singh/vedic+vision+of+consciousness+and+reality/6005949/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ananda Sangha=====

[[File:Sivakempfort.jpg|thumb|alt=Statue of Shiva|Statue of Shiva]]The Ananda Sangha movement has evolved following the teachings of the late yogi and guru [[Paramhansa Yogananda]]. Compared to the multi-dimensional theories of consciousness in shamanic and OM mantra perspectives, this particular ideological faction stresses simplicity rather than detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kriyananda|first=Swami|title=Intuition for Starters: How to Know and Trust Your Inner Guidance|year=2002|publisher=Crystal Clarity Publishers|location=Nevada City, CA|isbn=1-56589-155-4|pages=1–127|url=http://www.crystalclarity.com/product.php?code=BIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Subconscious: relatively dim awareness; repository of remembered experiences and consequent mental impressions
* Conscious: rational awareness; guides daily decisions and can be influenced by others; input from the bodily senses
* Superconscious Awareness: intuition and heightened mental clarity; problem and solution are seen as one entity

===Western perspectives===

Fluctuations in consciousness theories are not particular to Eastern cultures. A surprising degree of overlap can be found within the field of health and social sciences with regard to dulled, standard, and heightened intensities of awareness, both naturally and as a result of injury or disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Izard|first=C.|title=Levels of emotion and levels of consciousness|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=96–98|doi=10.1017/S0140525X07001045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological views====

Like many [[psychology|psychological]] theories within the particular field of [[psychoanalysis]], one of the most popular theories of consciousness was proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who described three facets of the [[psychic apparatus]]: the unconscious ([[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]) or instinctual facet, the preconscious ([[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]) or rational facet, and the conscious ([[Super-ego|superego]]) or moral facet.

Although not unlike the Vedic vision of consciousness as a form of [[intelligence]], [[Jean Piaget|Jean Piaget's]] [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] is not commonly considered a form of knowledge awareness but instead as the evolution of the brain's capacity for thought throughout the human lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pons|first=F.|author2=P. Harris |title=Piaget's conception of the development of consciousness: An Examination of two hypotheses|journal=Human Development|year=2001|volume=44|issue=4|pages=220–227|doi=10.1159/000057061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical and pathological views====

Similar to previously mentioned psychological views, medical and pathological perspectives often hypothesize tiered consciousness as a result of disease or disorders. [[Altered level of consciousness|The Altered Levels of Consciousness]] (ALC) theory is one such measure, in which a person's arousability and responsiveness to environmental stimuli are classified by their behavioral response.

=====Glasgow Coma Scale=====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:JoseGoulaoHospital.jpg|thumb|alt=Comatose Patient|Comatose Patient (most extreme level on the Glasgow Coma Scale)]] --&gt;Although many such ALC tests take place in hospital settings, the primary evaluation of patient alertness is the Glasgow Coma Scale, which separates levels of consciousness from standard conscious awareness to a [[coma]]tose state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=L.|title=Assessment of Levels of Consciousness: The Glasgow Coma Scale|journal=University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Nursing|year=1987|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=120&amp;sid=ef978c44-327b-458d-ab15-a965836e8543%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=c8h&amp;AN=1993157161|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Conscious''': normal, attentive; oriented to self, place, and mind
* '''Confused''': impaired or slowed thinking; disoriented
* '''Delirious''': disoriented, restless, clear deficit in attention; possible incidence of hallucinations and delusions
* '''Somnolent''': excessive drowsiness; little response to external stimuli
* '''Obtunded''': decreased alertness, slowed motor responses; sleepiness
* '''Stuporous''': conscious but sleep-like state associated with little or no activity; only responsiveness is in reaction to pain
* '''Comatose''': no response to stimuli, cannot be aroused; no gag reflex or pupil response to light

=====Relationship to schizophrenia=====

Recent hypotheses have incorporated these ALC theories into the psychopathological study of [[schizophrenia]], suggesting that each altered level of awareness is connected to a degree of suffering or shock experienced by the patient, arguably traversing the Qliphoth in the process. As the situation increases in seriousness, patients will descend to lower levels of consciousness and consequentially lose the capacity to cry, to smile, or to exhibit a wide range of emotions when reacting to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mates|first=Maureen|title=Altered Levels of Consciousness in Schizophrenia|journal=Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine|year=1992|volume=7|issue=4|pages=216–220|doi= |url=http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1992/pdf/1992-v07n04-p216.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more physiologically based studies, scientists have found that while the [[reticular formation]] controls alertness, wakefulness, and arousal in the brain, many mental responses to internal and external stimuli are dictated through signals relayed to and from the thalamus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tindall|first=Suzie C.|title="Level of Conscioussness."

===Modern-day perspectives===

Although many of the previously mentioned theories are still widely held today in various groups, beliefs, and areas of study, a majority of commonly accepted perspectives stem from just the past decade. These hypothesized structures of awareness draw from many historical and early eighteenth- or nineteenth-century theories to form an integrated and overarching generalization of consciousness as a means of determining inner and outer recognition of stimuli.

====Holder's three levels of consciousness====

Derived loosely from his philosophy of the [[Kung fu#Meditation|Kung Fu]] system, Philip Holder offers three levels of consciousness that feature distinct differences in the way in which they are reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holder|first=Philip|title=The Three Levels of Consciousness and Humanity|url=http://www.wingchunonline.com/levels-of-consciousness/|work=Wing Chun Online|publisher=Wing Chun|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barrett's seven levels of personal consciousness====

[[File:MasonParanoidPolaroid.jpg|thumb|alt=Self-Concept|[[Self-concept]]]]Similarly, Richard Barrett proposes seven stages of consciousness that progress in a logical order. The progression focuses on “[[existential]]” needs directly connected to and dependent on the human condition, all of which are motivating factors for daily interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Richard|title=The Seven Levels of Personal Consciousness|journal=Business &amp; Economics|year=2006|pages=248–252|url=http://www.valuescentre.com/uploads/2010-07-06/The%207%20Levels%20of%20Personal%20Consciousness-1.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gibson's four states of consciousness====

Dr. Bob Günius Gibson, left-handed author of ''Notes on Personal Integration and Health'' and often recognized as a [[psychic|psychic healer]], hypothesized the existence of four tiers of extrasensory awareness. Beyond being more applicable to internal states rather than reactions to the external environment, these stages contrast markedly with the previously mentioned modern theories through their emphasis on humankind's immediate interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Marsha|title=Levels of Consciousness|url=http://www.marshasummers.com/innerman/tape7.htm|work=Studies of the Inner Being|publisher=Daytona Music|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson does not focus on life progression or individual power to move between levels, but rather on momentary instances of personal experience.

==Attempts to combine theories==

===Leary's 8-Circuit Model of Consciousness===

[[File:Deep Thought (3914353258).jpg|thumb|alt=Deep in Thought|Deep in Thought]]Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson proposed [[8-Circuit Model of Consciousness|the Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness]], a psychologically based theory that unifies various interpretations of main altered states of awareness into a single mega-theory, or a hypothesis' about an already existing hypothesis. In this case, Leary and Wilson state that [[Altered level of consciousness|the altered levels of consciousness]] defined in medical fields are products of eight differing brain structures within the human nervous system.

This concept not only connects psychology and the more medically focused studies of [[neurology]] and biology, but also incorporates elements of sociology, anthropology, physics, chemistry, and advanced mathematical formulas. Furthermore, critics argue that the inspiration for his theory stems at least indirectly from the Hindu [[chakra]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert Anton|title=Cosmic Trigger: Final Secret of the Illuminati|year=2008|publisher=New Falcon Publications|location=Las Vegas, NV|isbn=978-1561840038|pages=1–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Morin's integration===

Similar to Dr. Rondell Gibson's view of a simplified hierarchy of conscious states, Alain Morin describes a four-tiered integration of nine past awareness models, focusing explicitly on the two common aspects underlying each belief structure: the perception of the self in time and the complexity of those self-representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=Alain|title=Levels of Consciousness and Self-Awareness: A Comparison and Integration of Various Views.|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=2|pages=358–371|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.09.006|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:jzJyTUjZytEJ:www.societyofrobots.com/robottheory/self-awareness_review.pdf+%22levels+of+consciousness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiGSelg-Sv4Tg4jTX0WDTM4JnyzZi4pLoDiriu3uFf6rMRXjvleJ8yXu0YIO_K8enn2Jur6Xg76W0wvDGq3OrmiLKfbjywM-uo0rhIPVZR68ztIGvBbEdAAqOiDJv0_RmbtHRQ3&amp;sig=AHIEtbQunMEYJUoOVZWytul9fD7o73h4lA|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In summary, Morin concludes that from the many concepts discussed above it is near impossible to settle for only one theory without accepting at least a fraction of another. Although each hypothesis has been debated either in scientific or more spiritually focused literature, he states that consciousness is related most directly to the subjective perception of self-recognition and language, both of which are determined by culture and our external environment as a whole.

=== Bob Monroe ===

[[Robert Monroe|Robert Allan Monroe]] became known for his research into [[Altered state of consciousness|altered consciousness]] and "[[out-of-body experience]]". His book 1985 ''"Far Journeys"''  showed numerous levels of consciousness and infinite expansion of consciousness.

''“The plants exist on levels of consciousness from one through seven. They are on a vibrational rate on the levels one through seven. It is the same pattern.''

''Animals exist on the levels of consciousness from eight through fourteen, and when a person attains, when a consciousness attains level fourteen, it can no longer go any higher unless it is willing to change its form of consciousness.''

''Levels of consciousness from fifteen through twenty-one are what you call human life on this earth.''

''When a person progresses to level of consciousness twenty one, he then has the choice of going higher or staying within the realm of human form, but he cannot go higher unless he is willing to give up human form.”'' &lt;ref&gt;''Far Journeys'' (1985)  {{ISBN|0-385-23182-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.be8.com/group/courseofawakening/forum/topics/the-levels-of-consciousness The Infinite expansion of consciousness &amp; its levels.[[Robert Monroe]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905052149/http://www.be8.com/group/courseofawakening/forum/topics/the-levels-of-consciousness |date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore and Gillette===

Some analytical psychological methods have presented methodology to engage in deeper levels of inner expansive transcendence, depth that may lead to a reconciliation process. Propositions such as "active imagination," engaging in a conversation with the "Ego" and "Shadow" for instance. "Invocation," calling upon an archetypal imago to dialogue with, perhaps an image of saint or God, "Admiring Mature Paragon Examples," having conversations with wise old men and women; those who have accessed wisdom, for example, and "Acting 'As If,'" getting into character, acting like the character archetype one wishes to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Douglas|last2=Gillette|first2=Robert|title=King Warrior Magician Lover, Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine|year=1990|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780062506061|url=https://www.amazon.com/King-Warrior-Magician-Lover-Rediscovering/dp/0062506064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is '''locally regular''' if intuitively it looks locally like a [[regular space]]. More precisely, a locally regular space satisfies the property that each point of the space belongs to an open subset of the space that is regular under the [[subspace topology]]. 

==Formal definition==

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''locally regular''' [[if and only if]] each point, ''x'', of ''X'' has a [[neighbourhood]] that is [[regular space|regular]] under the [[subspace topology]]. Equivalently, a space ''X'' is locally regular if and only if the collection of all open sets that are regular under the subspace topology forms a base for the topology on ''X''.

==Examples and properties==

* Every locally regular [[T0 space]] is [[Locally Hausdorff space|locally Hausdorff]].
* A regular space is always locally regular.
* A [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is regular, hence locally regular.
* A [[T1 space]] need not be locally regular as the set of all real numbers endowed with the [[cofinite topology]] shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17565">The '''Matilda effect''' is a bias against acknowledging the achievements of those [[women in science|women scientists]] whose work is attributed to their male colleagues.  This effect was first described by suffragist and abolitionist [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] (1826–98) in her essay, "Woman as Inventor".  The term "Matilda effect" was coined in 1993 by science historian [[Margaret W. Rossiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Rossiter Margaret W.| title = The Matthew/Matilda Effect in Science| journal = Social Studies of Science| volume=23 | issue = 2| place = London| year = 1993| pages = 325–341| issn = 0306-3127| url=| doi=10.1177/030631293023002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matilda Effect.png|thumb|Matilda effect]]

Rossiter provides several examples of this effect.  Trotula ([[Trota of Salerno]]), a 12th-century Italian woman physician, wrote books which, after her death, were attributed to male authors.  Nineteenth- and twentieth-century cases illustrating the Matilda effect include those of [[Nettie Stevens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12105830/nettie-stevens-genetics-gender-sex-chromosomes|title=Nettie Stevens discovered XY sex chromosomes.

The Matilda effect is sometimes compared to the [[Matthew effect]], whereby an eminent scientist often gets more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is shared or similar.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Professor [[Ben Barres]] (born 1955), a neurobiologist at [[Stanford University Medical School]] who transitioned from female to male, has spoken of his scientific achievements having been perceived differently, depending on his sex at the time.&lt;ref name="vedantam"&gt;Shankar Vedantam, (13 July 2006).

On the other hand, several studies found no difference between citations and impact of publications of male authors and those of female authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Peter Hegarty|author2 = Zoe Walton| author-link = | title = The Consequences of Predicting Scientific Impact in Psychology Using Journal Impact Factors| journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume = 7 |issue = 1| pages = 72–78|  doi = 10.1177/1745691611429356|pmid = 26168426| url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/1/72.abstract|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Stephane Baldi| author-link = | title = Normative versus Social Constructivist Processes in the Allocation of Citations: A Network-Analytic Model| journal = American Sociological Review|volume = 63 |issue = 6| pages = 829–846|  doi = 10.2307/2657504| jstor=2657504| year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Nick Haslam|author2 = Lauren Ban|author3 = Leah Kaufmann|author4 = Stephen Loughnan|author5 = Kim Peters|author6 = Jennifer Whelan|author7 = Sam Wilson| author-link = | title = What makes an article influential?

Swiss researcher have indicated that mass media ask male scientists more often to contribute on shows than they do their female fellow scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Fabienne Crettaz von Roten| author-link = | title = Gender Differences in Scientists' Public Outreach and Engagement Activities| journal= Science Communication| volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 52–75| year = 2011|doi = 10.1177/1075547010378658| url=http://scx.sagepub.com/content/33/1/52.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one U.S. study, "although overt gender discrimination generally continues to decline in American society," "women continue to be disadvantaged with respect to the receipt of scientific awards and prizes, particularly for research."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| author = Anne E.

== Examples ==
Examples of women subjected to the Matilda effect:
* [[Trotula]] ([[Trota of Salerno]], 12th century) -  Italian physician, author of works which, after her death, were attributed to men authors.  Hostility toward women as teachers and healers led to denial of her very existence. At first her work was credited to her husband and son but as information got passed on, monks confused her name for that of a man. She is not mentioned in the "Dictionary of Scientific Biography"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=Margaret W.|date=1993|title=The Matthew Matilda Effect in Science|jstor=285482|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume= 23| issue =  2|pages=325–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nettie Stevens]] (1861–1912), discoverer of the [[XY sex-determination system]].   Her crucial studies of mealworms revealed for the first time that an organism’s sex is determined by its chromosomes rather than by environmental or other factors. Stevens greatly influenced the scientific community’s transition to this new line of inquiry:  chromosomal sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Doing Biology|last = Hagen|first = Joel|publisher = Harper Collins|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Glenview, IL|pages = 37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], a distinguished geneticist at the time, is generally credited with this discovery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 6 Women Scientists Who Were Snubbed Due to Sexism|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130519-women-scientists-overlooked-dna-history-science/|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her extensive work in the field of genetics, Stevens’ contributions to Morgan’s work are often disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nettie Maria Stevens (1861-1912) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|url = https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/nettie-maria-stevens-1861-1912|website = embryo.asu.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930)- [[Harvard University]] discovered that stimuli that were paired with other vivid stimuli would be recalled more easily. She also discovered that duration of exposure led to better recall. These findings, along with her paired-associations method, would later be used by [[Georg Elias Müller]] and [[Edward B. Titchener]], without any credit being given to Calkins.
* [[Gerty Cori]] (1896–1957), Nobel-laureate biochemist, worked for years as her husband's assistant, despite having equal qualification as him for a professorial position.
* [[Rosalind Franklin]] (1920–58) - now recognized as a important contributor to the 1953 discovery of [[DNA]] structure. At the time of the  discovery by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Dewey Watson|James Watson]], for which the two men received a 1962 Nobel Prize, her work was not properly credited (though Watson described the crucial importance of her contribution, in his 1968 book ''[[The Double Helix]]'').
* [[Marthe Gautier]] (born 1925) - now recognized for her important role in the discovery of the chromosomal abnormality that causes [[Down syndrome]], a discovery previously attributed exclusively to [[Jérôme Lejeune]].
* [[Marian Diamond]] (born 1926), working at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], experimentally discovered the phenomenon of [[brain plasticity]], which ran contrary to previous neurological dogma.  When her seminal 1964 paper&lt;ref&gt;Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR,[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.901230110/full "The Effects of an Enriched Environment on the Histology of the Rat Cerebral Cortex"],"J Comp Neurol 1964;123:111-120", retrieved 9 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; was about to be  published, she discovered that the names of her two secondary co-authors, [[David Krech]] and [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Mark Rosenzweig]], had been placed before her name (which, additionally, had been placed in parentheses).  She protested that she had done the essential work described in the paper, and her name was then put in first place (without parentheses).  The incident is described in a 2016 documentary film, ''My Love Affair with the Brain: The Life and Science of Dr. Marian Diamond''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunaproductions.com/ My Love Affair with the Brain: The Life and Science of Dr. Marian Diamond]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Harriet Zuckerman]] (born 1937) - as a result of the Matilda effect, Zuckerman was also credited by husband [[Robert K. Merton]] as co-author of the concept of the [[Matthew effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Non sequitur|date=March 2017}}
* Programmers of [[ENIAC]] (dedicated 1946) - several women made substantial contributions to the project, including [[Adele Goldstine]], [[Kathleen Antonelli|Kay McNulty]], [[Jean Bartik|Betty Jennings]], [[Betty Holberton|Betty Snyder]], [[Marlyn Meltzer|Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Frances Spence|Fran Bilas]] and [[Ruth Teitelbaum|Ruth Lichterman]], but histories of [[ENIAC]] have typically not addressed these contributions, and have at times focused on hardware accomplishments rather than software accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Light|first = Jennifer S.|title = When Computers Were Women|journal = Technology and Culture|volume = 40|issue = 3|year = 1999|pages = 455–483|url = http://pcfly.info/doc/Computers/18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Examples''' of men scientists favored over women scientists for '''[[Nobel Prize]]s'''
* In 1903, [[Maria Skłodowska Curie]] (1867–1934) was included in the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] only on the insistence of a Nobel Prize Committee member who was an advocate of women scientists—Swedish mathematician [[Magnus Goesta Mittag-Leffler]]—and of her fellow-laureate, husband [[Pierre Curie]].  Marie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.  She was never admitted to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]; a student of hers, [[Marguerite Perey]], would be the first woman so honored, in 1962.
* In 1934, the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to [[George Whipple]], [[George Richards Minot]], and [[William P. Murphy]]. They felt their female co-worker, [[Frieda Robscheit-Robbins]], was excluded on grounds of her sex. Whipple however shared  the prize money with her as he felt she deserved the Nobel as well, since she was co-author of almost all of Whipple's publications.
* In 1944 the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was given to [[Otto Hahn]] as the sole recipient. [[Lise Meitner]] had worked with Hahn and had laid the theoretical foundations for [[nuclear fission]] (she coined the term "nuclear fission"). Meitner was not recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee, partly due to her gender and partly due to her persecuted Jewish identity in Nazi Germany. She was affected by the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], which prohibited Jews from holding government-related positions, including in research. Initially, her Austrian citizenship shielded her from persecution, but she fled Germany after [[Anschluss|Hitler's annexation of Austria in 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ScienceWeek |url=http://scienceweek.com/2004/rmps-32.htm |date=2013-04-14 |accessdate=2015-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414151521/http://scienceweek.com/2004/rmps-32.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1950, [[Cecil Frank Powell|Cecil Powell]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and for the resulting discovery of the [[pion]] (pi-meson). [[Marietta Blau]] did pioneering work in this field. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] had nominated her for the prize along with [[Hertha Wambacher]], but both were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1063/PT.3.1728|title = Marietta Blau in the history of cosmic rays|journal = Physics Today|volume = 65|issue = 10|pages = 8|year = 2012|last1 = Sime|first1 = Ruth Lewin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, two American physicists [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]], predicted the violation of the parity law in weak interactions and suggested a possible experiment to verify it. In 1957, [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] performed the necessary experiment in collaboration with [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] and showed the parity violation in the case of [[beta decay]].  The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 was awarded to the male physicists and Wu was omitted. She received the [[Wolf Prize]] in 1987 in recognition for her work.&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2004/jan/20/wolf-prize-goes-to-particle-theorists&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1958, [[Joshua Lederberg]] shared a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[George Wells Beadle|George Beadle]] and [[Edward Lawrie Tatum|Edward Tatum]]. Microbiologists Joshua Lederberg and his wife [[Esther Lederberg]], along with Beadle and Tatum, developed [[replica plating]], a method of transferring bacterial colonies from one petri dish to another, which is vital to current understanding of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Esther Lederberg was not recognized for her vital work on this research project; her contribution was paramount to the successful implementation of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CensorshipIndex|url = http://www.esthermlederberg.com/Censorship/CensorshipIndex.html|website = www.esthermlederberg.com|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she did not receive recognition for her discovery of the [[lambda phage]] or for her studies on the F [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|fertility factor]] that created a foundation for future genetic and bacterial research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Esther Lederberg, pioneer in genetics, dies at 83|url = http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/november29/med-esther-112906.html|website = Stanford University|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the late 1960s, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] (born 1943) discovered the first radio [[pulsar]].  For this discovery, in 1974 a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to her supervisor [[Antony Hewish]] and to [[Martin Ryle]], citing Hewish and Ryle for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics.  Jocelyn Burnell was left out.  A Ph.D. student at the time of her discovery, she felt the intellectual effort had been mostly her supervisor's; but her omission from the Nobel Prize was criticized by several prominent astronomers, including [[Sir Fred Hoyle|Fred Hoyle]].  [[Iosif Shklovsky]], recipient of the 1972 [[Bruce Medal]], at the 1970 [[International Astronomical Union]]'s General Assembly.

==In the arts==
* ''[[:pl:Za ścianą|Za ścianą]]'' (Next Door): a 1971 Polish TV film directed by [[Krzysztof Zanussi]], starring [[Maja Komorowska]] as "Anna" and [[Zbigniew Zapasiewicz]] as "Jan".  The two apartment-building next-door neighbors both work in academia.  Jan is an assistant professor.  Anna, who would like to develop a closer acquaintance with him, might have achieved comparable academic rank and thus an easier entree to his affections, had a male colleague not appropriated the credit for her research.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

In [[western astrology|astrology]], a '''negative''', '''ceptive''', '''dispassive''', '''yin''', '''nocturnal''' or '''feminine''' sign refers to any of the six even-numbered signs of the [[zodiac]]: [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] or [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]].

These 11 signs constitute the [[earth sign|earth]] and [[water sign|water]] [[triplicity|triplicities]].

==Introduction to signs==
In astrology there are two groups: positive and negative. These two groups also
include six individual signs that are called zodiac signs. The negative signs associated
with the zodiac are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. The positive
signs associated with the zodiac are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and
Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twelve signs are divided into two
groups based upon one's exact time and place of birth. The negative and positive signs
alternate, starting with Aries as positive and Taurus as negative and continuing this pattern through the list of zodiac signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emerson|first=Michael|title=History of Astrology-Origins and Beginnings|url=http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|publisher=Astrology insight|accessdate=December 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075959/http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|archivedate=December 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different types of sign terminology==
The signs negative and positive are referred to as a negative-sunsign or a
positive-sunsign. There are many terms used in astrology to differentiate the
two groups. In Chinese astrology, the two groups are categorized as yin and yang, corresponding respectively to negative and positive.  Standen explains that different astrologers may refer to signs by different names. For example, an astrologer may refer to positive signs as masculine and negative signs as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raaj Sudhanshu|first=Rajendra|title=Positive &amp; Negative Sign|url=http://www.subhanshu.com/astrology/positive-negative-sign.htm|publisher=Subhanshu.com|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each sign is divided into two main
types: active and passive. As a general rule, the active type will be called masculine and the passive type will be called feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Standen|first=Anthony|title=Is There An Astrological Effect On Personality|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=1975|volume=89|issue=2|pages=259–260|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/vjrl20|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative Zodiacs==
Zodiac signs associated with the negative are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. Note that there is no value judgment attached to the terms negative or positive. They may be likened to polarities in a magnet: one side is positive and one side is negative. Neither side is "good" nor "bad"—they are merely different.

==The “Sunsign Effect”==
The sunsign effect is a pattern of alternating high and low extraversion-scores for
the 12 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introvert is a person who gains energy when alone and spends it when with other people. Extravert is a person who gains energy from socialization, expending it when alone. Jan J.F. van Rooij did an experiment on Introversion-Extraversion: astrology
versus psychology, to see if those in the negative sunsign were introverted and those in
the positive sunsign were negative. Van Rooijs did this experiment on those with
astrological knowledge and on those with no astrological knowledge. His results showed
that negative sunsign people are not that responsive to the outer world and are
accordingly not influenced that easily by astrological information. They rely more on
their own ideas and feelings, thus proving his point that people who are born with the
negative sunsign are introverted, and those born with the positive sunsign are
extroverted.

==Element Associated with negative signs==
Earth and Water are the elements attached to those who are in the negative sign.
Earth is the element of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Water is the element of Cancer,
Scorpio, and Pisces. Elements are the basic traits of the signs. They reveal the
fundamental aspects of the personality.
“Water signs are attuned to waves of emotion, and often seem to have a built-in
sonar for reading a mood. This gives them a special sensitivity in relationships, knowing
when to show warmth and when to hold back. At their best, they are a healing force that
bring people together -- at their worst, they are psychic vampires, able to manipulate
and drain the life force of the closest to them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall explains that water signs are
more in tune with their emotions and are comfortable showing them. Water signs bring a
certain presence to a situation; they seek out the problem and fix it.
“Earth signs are sensual, meaning they engage with life through the five senses.
It takes time to sense the dense physical world, and earth signs can operate at a slower,
more thorough pace than the other elements. Theyʼre oriented toward whatʼs real, and
often this makes them very productive, able to create tangible results.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earth signs are described by Hall as earthy people. These signs focus on the things
that connect us to the earth: things which bring peace, as opposed to focusing on the material world.

{{Behavioural influences}}
'''Obedience''', in human behavior, is a form of "[[social influence]] in which a person yields to explicit instructions or orders from an authority figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Colman | first = Andrew | title = A Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 0199534063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obedience is generally distinguished from [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]], which is behavior influenced by peers, and from [[conformity]], which is behavior intended to match that of the majority.  Depending on context, obedience can be seen as [[morality|moral]], [[immorality|immoral]], or [[amorality|amoral]].

Humans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate [[authority]] figures, as shown by the [[Milgram experiment]] in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the [[Nazis]] managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the [[Holocaust]]. The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that "Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others."&lt;ref name=Milgram2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram|first=S.|title=Behavioral study of obedience|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1963|volume=67|pages=371–378|doi=10.1037/h0040525|pmid=14049516}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion was reached in the [[Stanford prison experiment]].

==Experimental studies==

=== Classical methods and results ===
Although other fields have studied obedience, social psychology has been primarily responsible for the advancement of research on obedience. It has been studied experimentally in several different ways.

====Milgram's experiment====
In one classical study, Stanley Milgram (as part of the [[Milgram experiment]]) created a highly controversial yet often replicated study. Like many other experiments in psychology, Milgram's setup involved [[deception]] of the participants. In the experiment, subjects were told they were going to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning.  In reality, the experiment focuses on people's willingness to obey malevolent authority. Each subject served as a teacher of associations between arbitrary pairs of words.  After meeting the "teacher" at the beginning of the experiment, the "learner" (an accomplice of the experimenter) sat in another room and could be heard, but not seen.  Teachers were told to give the "learner" electric shocks of increasing severity for each wrong answer. If subjects questioned the procedure, the "researcher" (again, an accomplice of Milgram) would encourage them to continue.  Subjects were told to ignore the agonized screams of the learner, his desire to be untied and stop the experiment, and his pleas that his life was at risk and that he suffered from a heart condition.  The experiment, the "researcher" insisted, had to go on. The [[dependent variable]] in this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;

====Zimbardo's experiment====
The other classical study on obedience was conducted at [[Stanford University]] during the 1970s. [[Phillip Zimbardo]] was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]], college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of "social forces" on participants behavior.&lt;ref name=Zimbardo1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haney|first=C|author2=Banks, C. |author3=Zimbardo, P. |title=Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|year=1973|volume=1|pages=69–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using [[random assignment]] half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing "a psychological state of imprisonment".&lt;ref name=Zimbardo1/&gt;

====Results====
The Milgram study found that most participants would obey orders even when obedience posed severe harm to others.  With encouragement from a perceived authority figure, about two-thirds of the participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock to the learner. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that "subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will".&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt; Milgram attempted to explain how ordinary people were capable of performing potentially lethal acts against other human beings by suggesting that participants may have entered into an agentic state, where they allowed the authority figure to take responsibility for their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html|title=Milgram Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbardo obtained similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders and turned aggressive. Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards. The cruelty of the "guards" and the consequent stress of the "prisoners," forced Zimbardo to terminate the experiment prematurely, after 6 days.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo1" /&gt;

=== Modern methods and results ===
The previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience. Milgram's study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community. In a modern study, Jerry Burger replicated Milgram's method with a few alterations. Burger's method was identical to Milgram's except when the shocks reached 150 volts, participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended (base condition). To ensure the safety of the participants, Burger added a two-step screening process; this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment. In the modeled refusal condition, two confederates were used, where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher. The teacher stopped after going up to 90 volts, and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off.  This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies' participants occurred after moving past 150 volts. Additionally, since Milgram's study only used men, Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions.&lt;ref name=Burger1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry|title=Replicating Milgram: Would people still obey today?|journal=American Psychologist|year=2009|volume=64|pages=1–11|doi=10.1037/a0010932|pmid=19209958|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data from his previous study, Burger probed participant's thoughts about obedience. Participants' comments from the previous study were coded for the number of times they mentioned "personal responsibility and the learner's well being".&lt;ref name=Burger2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry |author2=Girgis, Z. |author3=Manning, C.|title=In their own words: Explaining obedience to authority through an examination of participants' comments|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|year=2011|volume=2|pages=460–466|doi=10.1177/1948550610397632|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prods the participants used in the first experiment were also measured.

Another study that used a partial replication of Milgram's work changed the experimental setting. In one of the Utrecht University studies on obedience, participants were instructed to make a confederate who was taking an employment test feel uncomfortable. Participants were told to make all of the instructed stress remarks to the confederate that ultimately made him fail in the experimental condition, but in the control condition they were not told to make stressful remarks. The dependent measurements were whether or not the participant made all of the stress remarks (measuring absolute obedience) and the number of stress remarks (relative obedience).&lt;ref name=Utrecht&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeus|first=Wim|author2=Quinten Raaijmakers |title=Administrative obedience: Carrying out orders to use psychological-administrative violence|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1986|volume=16|pages=311–324|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420160402|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Utrecht studies, another study used the stress remarks method to see how long participants would obey authority. The dependent measures for this experiment were the number of stress remarks made and a separate measure of personality designed to measure individual differences.&lt;ref name=Bocchiaro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bocchiaro|first=Piero|author2=Zimbardo, P. |title=Defying unjust authority: An exploratory study|journal=Current Psychology|year=2010|volume=29|pages=155–170|doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9080-z|pmid=20461226|issue=2|pmc=2866362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Results====
Burger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.
In Burger's follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.
The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results. They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.&lt;ref name=Utrecht /&gt;
The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called "the foot in the door scenario").&lt;ref name=Bocchiaro /&gt;
In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain,&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=F.|author2=Caballero, B., Gomez, &amp; Zamorano M.|title=Obediencia a la autoridad [Obedience to Authority]|journal=Psiquis|year=1981|volume=2|pages=212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref name=Kilham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kilham|first=W.|author2=Mann, L. |title=The level of destructive obedience as a function of transmitter and executant roles in the Milgram obedience paradigm|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|volume=29|pages=696–702|doi=10.1037/h0036636|pmid=4833430|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan)&lt;ref name=Shanab&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shanab|first=M.|author2=Yahka, K. |title=A cross-cultural study of obedience|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|year=1978|volume=11|pages=530–536}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found participants to be obedient.

===Implications===
One of the major assumptions of obedience research is that the effect is caused only by the experimental conditions, and [[Thomas Blass]]' research contests this point, as in some cases participant factors involving personality could potentially influence the results.&lt;ref name=Blass1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blass|first=T|title=Understanding behavior in the Milgram obedience experiment: The role of personality, situations and their interactions|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=60|pages=398–413|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.3.398|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one of Blass' reviews on obedience, he found that participant's personalities can impact how they respond to authority,&lt;ref name="Blass1"/&gt; as people that were high in authoritarian submission were more likely to obey.&lt;ref name=Elms&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elms|first=A.|author2=Milgram, S. |title=Personality characteristics associated with obedience and defiance to authoritative command|journal=Journal of Experimental Research in Personality|year=1966|volume=1966|pages=282–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replicated this finding in his own research, as in one of his experiments, he found that when watching portions of the original Milgram studies on film, participants placed less responsibility on those punishing the learner when they scored high on measures of authoritarianism.&lt;ref name=Blass2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blass|first=T.|title=Right-wing authoritarianism and role as predictors of attributions about obedience to authority|journal=Journal of Personality and Individual Differences|year=1995|volume=1|pages=99–100|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(95)00004-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to personality factors, participants who are resistant to obeying authority had high levels of [[social intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Burley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burley|first=P|author2=McGuinnes, J. |title=Effects of social intelligence on the Milgram paradigm|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1977|volume=40|pages=767–770|doi=10.2466/pr0.1977.40.3.767|pmid=866515|issue=3 Pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other research==
Obedience can also be studied outside of the Milgram paradigm in fields such as economics or political science. One economics study that compared obedience to a tax authority in the lab versus at home found that participants were much more likely to pay participation tax when confronted in the lab.&lt;ref name=Cadsby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cadsby|first=B.|author2=Maynes, E. |author3=Trivedi, V. |title=Tax compliance and obedience to authority at home and in the lab: A new experimental approach|journal=Experimental Economics|year=2006|volume=9|pages=343–359|doi=10.1007/s10683-006-7053-8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding implies that even outside of experimental settings, people will forgo potential financial gain to obey authority.

Another study involving political science measured public opinion before and after a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case debating whether or not states can legalize physician assisted suicide. They found that participants' tendency to obey authorities was not as important to public opinion polling numbers as religious and moral beliefs.&lt;ref name=Skitka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.|author2=Bauman, C. |author3=Lytle, B. |title=Limits of legitimacy: Moral and religious convictions as constraints on deference to authority|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|pages=567–578|doi=10.1037/a0015998|pmid=19785478|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although prior research has demonstrated that the tendency to obey persists across settings, this finding suggests that at personal factors like religion and morality can limit how much people obey authority.

==Other experiments==

===The Hofling hospital experiment===
{{main|Hofling hospital experiment}}
Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in research settings. In 1966, psychiatrist Charles K. Hofling published the results of a [[field experiment]] on obedience in the nurse–physician relationship in its natural hospital setting. Nurses, unaware they were taking part in an experiment, were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a (fictional) drug to their patients. Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances, 21 out of the 22 nurses would have given the patient an overdose.&lt;ref name="hofling_hospital"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofling | first1 = C.K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1966 | title = An Experimental Study of Nurse-Physician Relationships | doi = 10.1097/00005053-196608000-00008 | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 141 | issue = | pages = 171–80 | pmid = 5957275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural attitudes==
[[File:4242 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 28 - Obediencia Dno exireo - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 30-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|[[Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]]: capital featuring '''Virtues and vices''' - ''Obediencia D&lt;omi&gt;no exireo'' (Obedience to God).]]

Many traditional cultures regard obedience as a [[virtue]]; historically, societies have expected children to obey their elders (compare [[patriarchy]], slaves their owners, serfs their lords in [[feudal society]], lords their king, and everyone God. Even long after [[slavery]] ended in the United States, the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black codes]] required black people to obey and submit to whites, on pain of [[lynching]]. Compare the religious ideal of [[Surrender (religion)|surrender]] and its importance in Islam (the word ''Islam'' can literally mean "surrender").&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Christian [[wedding]]s, obedience was formally included along with [[honor]] and [[love]] as part of a conventional bride's (but not the bridegroom's) [[wedding vow]]. This came under attack with [[women's suffrage]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the [[feminist]] movement. {{As of | 2014}} the inclusion of a promise to obey in [[marriage vows]] has become optional in some [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s.

==Obedience training of human beings==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
{{main|Socialization|Military training}}
Some animals can easily be trained to be obedient by employing [[operant conditioning]], for example [[obedience school]]s exist to condition [[dog]]s to obey the orders of human owners.

Learning to obey adult rules is a major part of the [[socialization]] process in childhood, and many techniques are used by adults to modify the behavior of children. Additionally, extensive training is given in armies to make soldiers capable of obeying orders in situations where an untrained person would not be willing to follow orders. Soldiers are initially ordered to do seemingly trivial things, such as picking up the sergeant's hat off the floor, marching in just the right position, or marching and standing in formation. The orders gradually become more demanding, until an order to the soldiers to place themselves into the midst of gunfire gets an instinctively obedient response.

==Factors affecting obedience==

===Embodiment of prestige or power===
[[Image:Russian paratroopers in Kazakhstan.jpg|thumb|right|Obedience occurs in several situations; most often referred to is the obedience of soldiers to a superior officer.]]
When the Milgram experimenters were interviewing potential volunteers, the participant selection process itself revealed several factors that affected obedience, outside of the actual experiment.

Interviews for eligibility were conducted in an abandoned complex in [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berstein 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berstein|first=D.A.|title=Psychology|year=1988|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the dilapidated state of the building, the researchers found that the presence of a Yale professor as stipulated in the advertisement affected the number of people who obeyed. This was not further researched to test obedience without a Yale professor because Milgram had not intentionally staged the interviews to discover factors that affected obedience.&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;  A similar conclusion was reached in the [[Stanford prison experiment]].&lt;ref name="Berstein 1"/&gt;

In the actual experiment, [[Reputation|prestige]] or the appearance of power was a direct factor in obedience—particularly the presence of men dressed in gray [[white coat|laboratory coats]], which gave the impression of scholarship and achievement and was thought to be the main reason why people complied with administering what they thought was a painful or dangerous shock.&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;  A similar conclusion was reached in the [[Stanford prison experiment]].

Raj Persaud, in an article in the BMJ,&lt;ref name="persaud"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Persaud | first1 = Raj | year = 2005 | title = The Man Who Shocked the World: The Life and Legacy of Stanley Milgraml | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = | page = 356 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7512.356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; comments on Milgram's attention to detail in his experiment:
{{quote|The research was also conducted with amazing verve and subtlety—for example, Milgram ensured that the "experimenter" wear a grey lab coat rather than a white one, precisely because he did not want subjects to think that the "experimenter" was a medical doctor and thereby limit the implications of his findings to the power of physician authority.}}

Despite the fact that prestige is often thought of as a separate factor, it is, in fact, merely a subset of power as a factor. Thus, the prestige conveyed by a Yale professor in a laboratory coat is only a manifestation of the experience and status associated with it and/or the social status afforded by such an image.

=== Agentic state and other factors ===
According to Milgram, "the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow." Thus, "the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obedience to Authority|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York|pages=xii, xiii.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this hypothetical agentic state, Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject's obedience: politeness, awkwardness of withdrawal, absorption in the technical aspects of the task, the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human, a belief that the experiment served a desirable end, the sequential nature of the action, and anxiety.

=== Belief perseverance ===
Another explanation of Milgram's results invokes [[belief perseverance]] as the underlying cause. What "people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity ... as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures."'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990|title=A cognitive reinterpretation of Stanley Milgram's observations on obedience to authority|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232510613_A_Cognitive_Reinterpretation_of_Stanley_Milgram's_Observations_on_Obedience_to_Authority|journal=American Psychologist|volume=45|pages=1384–1385|via=|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.45.12.1384 | last1 = Nissani | first1 = Moti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|right|Gemini Orbit Attitude and Maneuvring System location]]

The '''Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System''' ('''OAMS''') was a [[reaction control system]] used in [[low Earth orbit|Earth orbit]] by the [[Project Gemini]] [[spacecraft]]. It provided both automatic and manual [[rotation]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] by means of 16 [[vernier thruster]]s using [[hypergolic]] propellants.

==Operations==
The OAMS had 16 small, fixed-position, fixed-thrust [[rocket engine]]s which burned [[hypergolic]] propellants ([[monomethylhydrazine]] fuel using [[nitrogen tetroxide]] as [[oxidizer]]) fed under pressure from a pair of tanks located in the aft Equipment Module. 
Besides providing [[attitude control]], the OAMS provided for linear up, down, sideways, forward or aft [[translation (physics)|translation]] of the spacecraft. This gave the spacecraft the capability to change its orbit, required for [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] with another spacecraft, the [[Agena Target Vehicle]].
The system was also used to push the spacecraft away from the spent second stage of the [[Titan II GLV|Titan II launch vehicle]] on first reaching orbit.

*The eight rotational control engines were mounted off the spacecraft's [[center of mass]] around the aft section of the Equipment Module, pointed at 90 degree positions up, down, left and right. These were rated at {{convert|25|lbf|N}} thrust and fired in pairs, causing it to pitch, roll, or yaw to control attitude.
*Six of the translational control engines were mounted on the side of the Retrorocket Module, near the spacecraft's center of mass. Four of these were rated at {{convert|100|lbf|N}} thrust, one each pointed up, down, left or right. The other two were pointed forward, at the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions, to provide aft thrust. These were rated at {{convert|85|lbf|N}} (reduced from the original spec of {{convert|100|lbf|N}} in July 1962).
*The two {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrust forward translation control engines were mounted on the inside of the aft end of the equipment adapter, at the twelve o'clock and six o'clock positions.

[[Walter Schirra]] said that because there is no turbulence in space, on [[Gemini 6]] "I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of [[Gemini 7]], literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence".&lt;ref name="agle199809"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.

==Events==
During [[Gemini 8]], on March 16, 1966, OAMS engine number 8 became stuck on, resulting in uncontrollable spinning of the spacecraft. The entire OAMS had to be shut down and the mission was terminated prematurely. This resulted in modifications to OAMS to permit engine isolation.

'''Perfection''' is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. 

The [[terminology|term]] is used to designate a range of diverse, if often kindred, [[concept]]s. These have historically been addressed in a number of discrete [[academic discipline|discipline]]s, notably [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[ontology]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''O doskonałości'' (On Perfection), 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term and concept==
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Aristotle]].]]
The form of the word long fluctuated in various languages. The [[English language]] had the alternates, "perfection" and the [[Bible|Biblical]] "perfectness."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection: the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "perfection" derives from the [[Latin]] "''[[w:la:perfectio|perfectio]]''", and "perfect" — from "''[[w:la:perfectus|perfectus]]''". These expressions in turn come from "''[[w:la:perficio|perficio]]''" — "to finish", "to bring to an end." "''Perfectio''(n)" thus literally means "a finishing", and "perfect''(us)''" — "finished", much as in [[grammar|grammatical]] parlance ("[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]").&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

Many modern languages have adopted their terms for the concept of "perfection" from the Latin: the [[French language|French]] "''[[w:fr:parfait|parfait]]''" and "''perfection''"; the [[Italian language|Italian]] "''[[w:it:perfetto|perfetto]]''" and "''[[w:it:perfezione|perfezione]]''"; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "''[[w:es:perfecto|perfecto]]''" and "''[[w:es:perfección|perfección]]''"; the [[English language|English]] "perfect" and "perfection"; the [[Russian language|Russian]] "''[[w:ru:совершенный|совершенный]]''" (sovyershenniy) and "''совершенcтво''" (sovyershenstvo); the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] "''savršen''" and "''savršenstvo''"; the [[Czech language|Czech]] "''dokonalost''"; the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] "''dokonaly''" and "''dokonalost''"; the [[Polish language|Polish]] "''doskonały''" and "''doskonałość''."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

The genealogy of the concept of "perfection" reaches back beyond Latin, to [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Greek equivalent of the Latin "''perfectus''" was "''teleos''." The latter Greek expression generally had concrete referents, such as a perfect physician or flutist, a perfect comedy or a perfect social system. Hence the Greek "''teleiotes''" was not yet so fraught with abstract and superlative associations as would be the Latin "''perfectio''" or the modern "perfection." To avoid the latter associations, the Greek term has generally been translated as "[[wikt:complete|complete]]ness" rather than "perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest definition of "perfection", fairly precise and distinguishing the shades of the concept, goes back to [[Aristotle]]. In Book ''Delta'' of the ''Metaphysics'', he distinguishes three meanings of the term, or rather three shades of one meaning, but in any case three different concepts. That is perfect:
:1. which is complete — which contains all the requisite parts;
:2. which is so good that nothing of the kind could be better;
:3. which has attained its purpose.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these concepts is fairly well subsumed within the second. Between those two and the third, however, there arises a duality in concept. This duality was expressed by [[Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', when he distinguished a twofold perfection: when a thing is perfect in itself — as he put it, in its ''substance''; and when it perfectly serves its ''purpose''.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7 /&gt;

The variants on the concept of perfection would have been quite of a piece for two thousand years, had they not been confused with other, kindred concepts. The chief of these was the concept of that which is the best:  in Latin, "''excellentia''" ("excellence"). In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], "''excellentia''" and "''perfectio''" made a pair; thus, for example, dignitaries were called "''perfectissime''", just as they are now called "excellency."  Nevertheless, these two expression of high regard differ fundamentally: "''excellentia''" is a distinction among many, and implies comparison; while "''perfectio''" involves no comparison, and if something is deemed perfect, then it is deemed so in itself, without comparison to other things.  [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who thought much about perfection and held the world to be the [[Optimism#Philosophy|best of possible worlds]], did not claim that it was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes==
[[File:6655 - Roma - Ettore Ferrari, Giulio Cesare Vanini (1889) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]]]]
The parallel existence of two concepts of perfection, one strict ("perfection," as such) and the other loose ("excellence"), has given rise, perhaps since [[ancient history|antiquity]] but certainly since the [[Renaissance]], to a singular [[paradox]]: that the greatest perfection is imperfection. This was formulated by [[Lucilio Vanini]] (1585–1619), who had a precursor in the 16th-century writer [[Joseph Juste Scaliger]], and they in turn referred to the ancient philosopher [[Empedocles]]. Their argument, as given by the first two, was that if the world were perfect, it could not improve and so would lack "true perfection," which depends on progress. To [[Aristotle]], "perfect" meant "complete" ("nothing to add or subtract"). To Empedocles, according to Vanini, perfection depends on incompleteness ("''perfectio propter imperfectionem''"), since the latter possesses a potential for development and for complementing with new characteristics ("''perfectio complementii''"). This view relates to the [[baroque]] [[esthetic]] of Vanini and [[Marin Mersenne]]:  the perfection of an art work consists in its forcing the recipient to be active—to complement the art work by an effort of mind and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradox]] of perfection—that imperfection is perfect—applies not only to human affairs, but to [[technology]].  Thus, irregularity in [[semiconductor]] [[crystal]]s (an imperfection, in the form of [[contaminant]]s) is requisite for the production of semiconductors. The solution to the apparent paradox lies in a distinction between two concepts of "perfection": that of regularity, and that of [[utility]]. Imperfection is perfect in technology, in the sense that irregularity is useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect numbers==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Perfect number]] --&gt;
[[Perfect number]]s have been distinguished ever since the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called them "''teleioi''." There was, however, no consensus among the Greeks as to which numbers were "perfect" or why. A view that was shared by [[Plato]] held that 10 was a perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mathematics|Mathematicians]], including the mathematician-philosopher [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], proposed as a perfect number, the number 6.&lt;ref name="TatarkiewiczSp1980p137"/&gt;

The number 10 was thought perfect because there are 10 fingers to the two hands. The number 6 was believed perfect for being divisible in a special way:  a sixth part of that number constitutes unity; a third is two; a half — three; two-thirds ({{lang-el|dimoiron}}) is four; five-sixths (''pentamoiron'') is five; six is the perfect whole.  The ancients also considered 6 a perfect number because the human foot constituted one-sixth the height of a man, hence the number 6 determined the height of the human body.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Euclid]]]]
Thus both numbers, 6 and 10, were credited with perfection, both on purely mathematical grounds and on grounds of their relevance in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt; Belief in the "perfection" of certain numbers survived [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], but this quality came to be ascribed to other numbers as well. The perfection of the number 3 actually became [[proverb]]ial: "''omne trinum perfectum''" ({{lang-la|all threes are perfect}}).  Another number, 7, found a devotee in the 6th-century [[Pope]] [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great), who favored it on grounds similar to those of the Greek mathematicians who had seen 6 as a perfect number, and in addition for some reason he associated the number 7 with the concept of "[[eternity]]."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]], however, championed the perfection of 6: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Alcuin]] wrote that [[God]] had created the world in 6 days because that was the perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The Greek mathematicians had regarded as perfect that number which equals the [[summation|sum]] of its [[divisor]]s that are smaller than itself. Such a number is neither 3 nor 7 nor 10, but 6, for 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

But there are more numbers that show this property, such as 28, which = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. It became customary to call such numbers "perfect." [[Euclid]] gave a formula for (even) "perfect" numbers:
:N&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)
where ''p'' and 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[Euclid]] had listed the first four perfect numbers: 6; 28; 496; and 8128. A manuscript of 1456 gave the fifth perfect number: 33,550,336. Gradually mathematicians found further perfect numbers (which are very rare). In 1652 the [[Poland|Polish]] [[polymath]] [[Jan Brożek]] noted that there was no perfect number between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite over 2,000 years of study, it still is not known whether there exist infinitely many perfect numbers; or whether there are any odd ones.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Today the term "perfect number" is merely historic in nature, used for the sake of tradition. These peculiar numbers had received the name on account of their analogy to the construction of man, who was held to be [[nature]]'s most perfect creation, and above all on account of their own peculiar regularity. Thus, they had been so named on the same grounds as perfect objects in nature, and perfectly proportioned edifices and statues created by man; the numbers had come to be called "perfect" in order to emphasize their special regularity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The [[Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]]s had named these numbers "perfect" in the same sense in which [[philosopher]]s and [[artist]]s used the word. Jamblich (''In Nicomachi arithmeticam'', Leipzig, 1894) states that the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] had called the number 6 "marriage," "health," and "beauty," on account of the [[harmony]] and accord of that number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The perfect numbers early on came to be treated as the measure of other numbers: those in which the sum of the divisors is greater than the number itself, as in 12, have — since as early as [[Theon of Smyrna]], ca. 130 A.D. — been called "redundant" ({{lang-la|redundantio}}), "more than perfect" (''plus quam perfecti''), or "[[abundant number]]s", and those the sum of whose divisors is smaller, as in 8, have been called "[[deficient number]]s" (''deficientes'').&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Currently 47 perfect numbers have been identified.

==Physics and chemistry==
[[File:Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]]]
A variety of [[physics|physical]] and [[chemistry|chemical]] [[concept]]s include, in their names, the word "perfect."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The physicist designates as a ''[[rigid body|perfectly rigid]]'' body, one that "is not deformed by forces applied to it."  He uses the concept in the full awareness that this is a fictitious body, that no such body exists in [[nature]]. The concept is an ''[[thought experiment|ideal]] [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]''.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[plasticity (physics)|perfectly plastic]]'' body is one that is deformed infinitely at a constant load corresponding to the body's limit of plasticity: this is a physical ''[[Physical model|model]]'', not a body observed in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[black body|perfectly black]]'' body would be one that absorbed completely, radiation falling upon it — that is, a body with a coefficient of absorption equal to unity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A [[crystal]] is perfect when its physically equivalent walls are equally developed; it has a perfect [[structure]] when it answers the requirements of spatial [[symmetry]] and is free of structural defects, dislocation, lacunae and other flaws.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect fluid]]'' is one that is incompressible and non-viscous — this, again, is an [[ideal fluid]] that does not exist in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect gas]]'' is one whose molecules do not interact with each other and which have no volume of their own.  Such a gas is ''fictitious'', just as are perfectly solid, perfectly rigid, perfectly plastic and perfectly black bodies. They are termed "perfect" in the ''strict'' (non-metaphorical) sense of the word. These are all concepts that are necessary in physics, insofar as they are limiting, ideal, fictitious — insofar as they set the extreme which nature may at the most approach.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

In a ''looser'' sense, real things are called "perfect" if they approximate perfection more or less closely, though they be not, strictly speaking, perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The relation of these ''perfect'' bodies to ''real'' bodies may be illustrated by the relation of a perfect gas to a real one. The equation of state of a perfect gas is a first approximation to a quantum equation of state that results from statistical physics. Thus, the equation of state of a real gas within classical limits assumes the form of the equation of  state of a perfect gas. That is, the equation of state of a perfect gas describes an ideal gas (comprising points, that is, dimensionless molecules that do not act upon one another).&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The [[ideal gas law|perfect gas equation]] arose from the work of [[Robert Boyle]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], who, in studying the properties of [[real gas]]es, found [[formula]]s applicable not to these but to an ideal, [[perfect gas]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Plato]]]]
The ''[[ethics|ethical]]'' question of perfection concerns not whether man ''is'' perfect, but whether he ''should'' be. And if he ''should'' be, then how is this to be attained?&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] seldom actually used the term, "perfection"; but the concept of "[[Good and evil|good]]", central to his philosophy, was tantamount to "perfection." He believed that approximation to the idea of perfection makes people perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Soon after, the [[Stoics]] introduced the concept of perfection into ethics expressly, describing it as [[harmony]] — with [[nature]], [[reason]], man himself. They held that such harmony—such perfection—was attainable for anyone.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Plato and the Stoics had made perfection a [[philosophy|philosophical]] watchword. Soon it would be transformed, in [[Christianity]], into a [[religion|religious]] one.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

The Christian doctrine of perfection is in the [[Gospels]] as well as elsewhere in the [[Bible]]. [[The Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48 enjoins: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." &lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian writings, especially [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s, are replete with calls to perfection. Many of these are collected in a discourse by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], ''De perfectione iustitiae hominis''. They begin already with the [[Old Testament]]: "Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God." (''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:13.)  Elsewhere synonyms for "perfection" are "undefiled", "without rebuke", "without blemish", "blameless", "holy", "righteous", "unblamable", "unreprovable."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]]]
Augustine explains that not only that man is properly termed perfect and without blemish who is already perfect, but also he who ''strives'' unreservedly after perfection. This is a broader concept, of ''approximate'' perfection, resembling that used in the [[exact sciences]]. The first ancient and Christian perfection was not very remote from modern ''self-perfection''. [[St. Ambrose]] in fact wrote about ''degrees'' of perfection ("''gradus piae perfectionis''").&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118 /&gt;

Along with the idea of perfection, [[Holy Scripture]] conveyed doubt as to whether perfection was ''attainable'' for man. According to [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 1:8, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Similarly Jesus said in Matthew 19:17: "And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God..."; while Jesus does not deny that he himself is good, he does call into question the idea that anyone but God can even be good, let alone perfect. And [[St. Jerome]] wrote:  "''Perfectio vera in coelestibus''" — true perfection is to be found only in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 5th century CE, two distinct views on perfection had arisen within the Church: that it was attainable by man on earth by his own powers; and, that it may come to pass only by special [[divine grace]]. The first view, which was championed by [[Pelagius]], was condemned in 417 CE; the second view, which was championed by St. Augustine, prevailed at the very beginning of the 5th century and became authoritative.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the Church did not condemn the writings of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Areopagite]], purportedly the first [[bishop]] of [[Athens]], voicing a ''natural'' possibility for man to rise to perfection, to the contemplation of God. And so, for centuries, two views contended within the Church.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

Even as, for the ancient philosophers, the essence of perfection had been [[harmony]], so for the [[Gospel]] and the Christian theologians it was [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], or love. [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] wrote (''[[Epistle to the Colossians]]'', 3:14): "And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

[[St. Gregory]] wrote that perfection will be realized only after the fulfillment of history — only "then will the world be beautiful and perfect." Still, everyone should make his own approach to perfection — to [[Sacred|holiness]].  Discourses in moral theology and [[asceticism]] were generous with advice on how this was to be done.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

The [[medieval]] concept of perfection and self-perfection, especially in its mature form, can be natural for modern man. As formulated by [[Peter Lombard]], this concept implies that perfection is a result of ''[[Personal development|development]]''. And as described by [[Giles of Rome]], perfection has not only personal sources ("''personalia''") but ''social'' ones ("''secundum statum''"). Since the individual is formed within a [[society]], the second perfection subsumes the first, in accordance with the "order of the universe" ("''ordo universi''"). The social perfection is ''binding'' on man, whereas personal perfection is only ''becoming'' to him.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Theses on perfection persist within the Church to the present day. The first condition for perfection is the desire of it. Also necessary is [[Divine grace|grace]] — but God gives grace to those who desire perfection and strive for it.  Another condition for perfection is constancy of striving and effort. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] says: "He who stops, regresses." And effort is necessary in things not only great but also in the smallest; the [[Gospel]] according to [[St. Luke]] says: "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:  and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much." An aid in approaching perfection is an awareness of [[God]]'s perfection and of one's own imperfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120/&gt;

[[File:John Calvin Titian B.jpg|thumb|100px|[[John Calvin|Calvin]]]]
The 14th century saw, with the [[Scotism|Scotists]], a shift in interest from [[moral]] to [[ontology|ontological]] perfection; the 15th century, particularly during the [[Italian Renaissance]], a shift to [[art]]istic perfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the 16th century saw [[John Calvin]]'s complete conditioning of man's perfection on the [[divine grace|grace of God]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The second half of the 16th century brought the [[Counter-reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]], and a return of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] concept; and also, heroic attempts to attain perfection through [[contemplation]] and [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]]. This was the age of [[Ignatius Loyola]] and the founding of the [[Jesuit Order]]; of [[Teresa of Ávila|St. Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–82) and [[St. John of the Cross]] (1542–91), and the 1593 founding of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Barefoot Carmelites]]. This was the culminating point in the history of the [[Christianity|Christian]] idea of perfection; at the same time, it was the terminal point as there soon began attempts at reforming the idea.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121/&gt;

The first half of the 17th century saw attempts at a Catholic reform of the idea of perfection. This was the time of [[Cornelis Jansen]] (1585–1638) and of [[Jansenism]] — of a growing belief in [[predestination]] and in the impossibility of perfection without [[Divine grace|grace]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

With the second half of the 17th century came a further development in the doctrine of [[predestination]] — the doctrine of "[[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]." Perfection could be reached through a passive awaiting of grace rather than by an active striving. This theory, formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Miguel de Molinos]] (ca. 1628 - 1697), spread in [[France]], where it was espoused by [[Madame Guyon]] (1648–1717) and for a time attracted [[François Fénelon]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The 18th century brought a sea change to the idea of moral perfection. Faith in it remained, but it changed character from [[religion|religious]] to [[secular]]. This secular, 18th-century perfection was a fundamental article of faith for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Its central tenet was that ''[[nature]] was perfect''; and perfect, too, was the man who lived in harmony with nature's law.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive man was held to be the most perfect, for he was closest to nature. Perfection lay behind present-day man rather than before him, for [[civilization]] distanced man from perfection instead of bringing him closer to it.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

A second interpretation, however, took the contrary view: [[civilization]] perfected man by bringing him closer to [[reason]], and thereby to [[nature]]; for reason would direct life with due consideration for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

The former, retrospective view of perfection had antecedents in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]: [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] had described a "[[golden age]]" that had existed at the beginning of time, and which had been succeeded by silver, copper and Iron Ages, each inferior to the previous. The renewal of this view now, after two millennia, was stimulated by European contact with the "primitive" peoples of the [[Americas]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was but one of many who wrote in a similar vein.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

These two mid-18th-century schools of thought — one seeing perfection in [[nature]] and in the past, and the other in [[civilization]] and in the future — represented a reaction not against the idea of perfection, but against its [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] interpretation: as, earlier, the measure of perfection had been the idea of [[God]], so now it was the idea of [[nature]] or of [[civilization]]. It was the latter idea that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122/&gt;

The idea of perfection as transcendental, fell away; only worldly perfection counted. The idea that perfection was a matter of grace, also fell by the wayside; man himself must strive for it, and if a single man could not accomplish it, then perhaps mankind could. As [[God]] had been the measure of perfection during the [[Middle Ages]], so now man was: the measure had become smaller, more accessible. To the thinking of the 19th century, such worldly, human perfection might ultimately be attainable by everyone. And if not perfection, then ''improvement''.  This would be the great concept of the [[modern age]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

At the very midpoint of the 18th century, there occurred an exceptional momentary retreat from the idea of perfection.  It was in the [[France|French]] ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The entry, "Perfection" (vol. XII, 1765), discussed only technical perfection, in the sense of the matching of human products to the tasks set for them; no mention was made of [[ontology|ontological]], [[morality|moral]] or [[esthetics|esthetic]] perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, the 18th century saw great declarations championing the future perfection of man, as in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte'' (1784) and [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]]'s ''Ideen'' (1784/91).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

Perfection was expected to come about by a variety of means. Partly it would be by way of ''natural'' development and progress (the view espoused by [[David Hume]]) but more so by way of ''[[education]]'' (precursors of this view included [[John Locke]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and the leaders of the [[Polish Enlightenment]]) and by way of overt ''state'' action ([[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], later [[Jeremy Bentham]]); reliance was placed in [[cooperation]] among people ([[Charles Fourier]], 1808), later in [[eugenics]] ([[Francis Galton]], 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with the [[idealism|idealists]] and [[romanticism|romantics]] — with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[Polish messianism|Polish Messianists]] — as well as with the 19th-century [[Positivism|Positivists]] and [[evolutionism|evolutionists]]; [[Herbert Spencer]] penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

The idea of human perfectibility had, however, become more comprehensive. Man would attain greater perfection, in the sense that he would live more rationally, healthily, happily, comfortably. But there was no adequate term for this new conception, as the term "perfection" had a moral coloring, while the new goal was more intellectual, physical and social.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

In 1852, [[John Henry Newman]], the future [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], wrote that it would be well if the [[English language]], like the [[Greek language|Greek]], had a term to express [[intellect]]ual perfection, analogously to the term "[[health]]", which addresses man's physical state, and to "[[virtue]]", which speaks to his moral nature. During the 19th century, the [[Germany|Germans]] would come to call perfection, thus construed, "culture" (''Kultur''), and the [[France|French]] would call it "civilization" (''civilisation'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

One of the elements of perfection, in its new construction, is ''[[health]]'', understood by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a state of complete physical and mental well-being."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the burgeoning achievements of contemporary [[biology]] have not dislodged the age-old interest in moral perfection — with the important distinction, that the goal now is not so much perfection as ''improvement''. A classic early-19th century exponent of this view was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the advances of [[science]] and [[technology]] appear to have been paralleled to some extent by increasingly pluralistic attitudes. The [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980) has written: "To demand of someone that he strive after perfection seems equally inappropriate as to blame him for not striving after it." Such striving, he adds, "is often egocentric and yields poorer moral and social results than an outward-directed behavior based not on self-perfection but on good will and kindliness toward others."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] viewed perfection as a requisite for [[beauty]] and high [[art]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] held that perfection was to be found in the right [[Body proportions|proportions]] and in a [[harmony|harmonious]] arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by [[Plato]], who believed that art ought to be "apt, suitable, without deviations" — in short, "perfect".&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a conviction that perfection was a single quality, the Pythagoreans, Plato and their adherents held that beauty also was a single quality; hence, for every kind of art, there was but one perfect and proper [[Substantial form|form]]. [[Plutarch]] stated (''De Musica'') that, during the early Greek age, musical [[harmony|harmonies]] that were recognized as perfect were ''legally binding'' at public performances.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145" /&gt;

Similarly, in [[temple]] [[architecture]] from the 5th century BCE, there were established [[classical order|orders]].  There were established [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s for [[Doric order|Doric]] temples, and for [[Ionia|Ionic]] temples. Likewise in [[sculpture]], for centuries, it was a matter of dogma that certain proportions of the human body were perfect and obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a prevalent belief that certain [[shape]]s and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] were in themselves perfect. Plato felt that the perfect proportion was the [[ratio]] of the [[Edge (geometry)|side]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]]. His authority was so great that architects and other artists continued using this proportion, even when ignorant of its source, as late as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Another early idea — one that was to be espoused by many illustrious writers and artists of various periods — found perfection in the [[circle]] and the [[sphere]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''Physica'' that the circle was "the perfect, first, most beautiful form." [[Cicero]] wrote in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods): "Two [[shape|forms]] are the most distinctive:  of [[solid]]s, the [[sphere]]... and of [[plane figure]]s, the [[circle]]...  There is nothing more [[symmetry|commensurate]] than these forms."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

In a commentary to Aristotle's ''De coelo et mundo'' (''[[On the Heavens|On the Heavens and Earth]]''), the [[medieval]] [[Poles|Pole]], [[Jan of Słupcza]], wrote: "The most perfect body ought to have the most perfect form, and such [a body] is [[heaven]], while the most perfect form is the round form, for nothing can be added to it." In the famous illustrated ''Les très riches heures du duc de Berry'', [[paradise]] is depicted as contained within an ideal [[sphere]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] [[architect]] [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) stated: "the round form is the most perfect of all."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The most excellent of 16th-century architects, [[Andrea Palladio]], held that "the most perfect and most excellent" form was "the round form, since of all forms it is the simplest, the most uniform, the strongest, the most capacious" and "is the most suitable for rendering the unity, infinity, uniformity and righteousness of God." This was the same thought as in Jan of Słupcza and in Serlio, and it was one of uncommon durability.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]] — [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[High Medieval|Gothic]] alike — had been quite taken with the idea of perfection. But a true explosion of the imperative for perfection came with the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

Renaissance aesthetics placed less emphasis than had [[classicism|classical]] aesthetics on the unity of things perfect. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], in his ''[[Il Cortegiano|Courtier]]'', wrote, of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giorgione]], that "each of them is unlike the others, but each is the most perfect [''perfectissimus''] in his style." &lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[File:Daniele Barbaro by Titian.jpg|thumb|[[Daniele Barbaro|Barbaro]]]]
The great [[architect]] and [[polymath]] [[Leone Battista Alberti]] wrote (''De architectura'') that "the art of building... in [[Italy]] [had] achieved perfect maturity", that the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] had "created such a perfect art of building that there was in it nothing mysterious, hidden or unclear." This was yet another formulation of the concept of perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[Daniele Barbaro]], in his 1567 translation of [[Vitruvius]], classically defined perfection as "that which lacks nothing and to which nothing can be added."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

The Renaissance showed a marked concern with ''preeminence'' in perfection. Leonardo concluded that the most perfect of the [[arts]] was [[painting]]. In 1546 [[Benedetto Varchi]] compared great masters in the arts. Others compared [[art]] and [[science]], [[art]] and [[nature]], and perfection in the arts of the ancients with that in the modern masters. The 16th century saw comparisons of their music, the 17th — of their [[visual arts]] and especially of their [[poetry]]. These comparisons construed perfection fairly loosely; the concept was treated more strictly by [[architecture|architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] distinguished a variety of properties to perfection. It was variously held to be:
* an ''objective'' property ([[Petrarch]], who opposed perfection to other esthetic qualities such as grace);
* specific to ''[[art]]'' rather than to nature ([[Vasari]]);
* a ''rare'' property ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] felt that not even Greek architecture had attained perfection);
* a property of the ''whole'' work rather than of its parts ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]);
* a conjunction of ''many'' values ([[Lodovico Dolce]] thought [[Raphael]] perfect because Raphael had manifold talent, as opposed to the one-sided [[Michelangelo]]);
* something that required not merely talent but art, that is, ''[[skill]]'' ([[Vasari]]);
* not the ''sole'' value in a work of [[art]] ([[Vasari]] differentiated perfection from grace; Renaissance [[Platonism|Platonists]] such as [[Ficino]] viewed perfection as a divine attribute).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[eclecticism|eclectic]] view of the late Renaissance, perfection in a work would require uniting the talents of ''many'' artists. [[Paolo Pino]] held that only that painter would be perfect who combined the talents of [[Titian]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection was harder to apply to Renaissance [[literature]] but became so common — often, linked to "''eccelente''" — as to become banal. Its frequent application brought about its [[relativization]] and even [[subjectivity|subjectivization]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Beginning with [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Palladio]], perfection in art had become less important, less definite, less objective. The striving for perfection no longer had the importance for [[man of letters|men of letters]] that it did for the great [[architect]]s. But the 17th century still revered perfection, as shown by the appearance of that word in book titles: ''De perfecta poesi'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[poet]] [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640); ''Le peintre parfait'' (1767 by [[André Félibien]]; and ''Idée de la perfection de la peinture'' (1662) by [[Fréart de Chambray]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Sarbiewski offered several theses: poetry not only imitates things ''perfectissime'' ("most perfectly"), but imitates them as they ought ''perfectissime'' to be in nature; perfect art is recognized by its agreement with nature, as well as its universality; art is the more perfect, the nobler (''nobilior'') its manner of representing things; it is the more perfect, the more truths it contains; perfection has various degrees — it is higher in [[poetry]] than in [[prose]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

In [[classicism]], especially in [[France|French]] 17th-century classicism, from an ''ideal'' attainable by few, perfection became an ''obligation'' for every author. And inasmuch as the criterion of perfection had been lowered, "perfection" now meant only ''correctness.'' In the ensuing devaluation, it was not enough that art be ''perfecta'', it should be ''perfectissima''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection, formerly the ''supreme'' characterization for a work of art, now became but one of ''many'' positive characterizations. [[Cesare Ripa]], in his ''Iconologia'' (published 1593, but typical for the 17th century), presented ''perfezione'' as a concept of equal status with grace (''grazia''), prettiness (''venustà'') and [[beauty]] (''bellezza'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s pupil, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in his ''Psychology'', wrote that beauty consists in perfection, and that this was why beauty was a source of pleasure.  No such general esthetic theory, explicitly naming perfection, had ever been formulated by any of its devotees from [[Plato]] to [[Palladio]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Edmund Burke|Burke]]]]
Wolff's theory of beauty-as-perfection was developed by the school's chief aesthetician, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]]. This tradition remained active in Germany as late as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], who considered both [[beauty]] and [[sublimity]] to be ideas of perfection; when unity prevailed, beauty emerged; when plurality — sublimity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

In the latter part of the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote much in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' about perfection — inner and outer, objective and subjective, qualitative and quantitative, perceived clearly and obscurely, the perfection of nature and that of art. Nevertheless, in aesthetics Kant found that "The judgment of taste [i.e., aesthetic judgment] is entirely independent of the concept of perfection" — that is, beauty was something different from perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

Earlier in the 18th century, [[France]]'s leading aesthetician, [[Denis Diderot]], had questioned whether perfection was a more comprehensible idea than beauty. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had treated perfection as an unreal concept, and wrote [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], "Let us not seek the [[wiktionary:chimera|chimera]] of perfection, but that which is the best possible."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], in 1757, the important aesthetician [[Edmund Burke]] denied that perfection was the cause of beauty.  Quite the contrary, he argued that beauty nearly always involved an element of ''imperfection''; for example, women, in order to heighten their attractiveness, emphasized their weakness and frailty, which is to say, their imperfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The 18th century was the last for which perfection was a principal concept in aesthetics. In the 19th century, perfection survived only vestigially as a general expression of approval. [[Alfred de Musset]] held that "Perfection is no more attainable for us than is infinity. One ought not to seek it anywhere: not in love, nor beauty, nor happiness, nor virtue; but one should love it, in order to be virtuous, beautiful and happy, insofar as that is possible for man."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Paul Valéry]] wrote: "To strive for perfection, to devote endless time to a work, to set oneself—like [[Goethe]]—an unattainable goal, are all intents that are precluded by the pattern of modern life."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The dismissal of the question concerning whether artists ''can'' achieve perfection, still left the question: Do artists ''want'' to achieve it? Is that their actual goal? Some artists, schools and epochs ''have'' aimed for perfection. Others have nurtured ''other'' goals: pluralism, novelty, powerful sensations, faithfulness to truth, self-expression and expression of the world, [[creativity]] and [[originality]] — all of which may roughly be summarized as "expression."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been ages of perfection, and ages of expression. The arts of [[ancient Greece]], the [[Renaissance]] and [[neoclassicism]] were arts of perfection. In the [[mannerism|mannerist]], [[baroque]] and [[romanticism|romantic]] periods, expression has prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology and theology==
The Greek philosopher [[Anaximander]] described the world as "endless" (''apeiron''), [[Xenophanes]] — as "the greatest" (''megistos'').  But while they ascribed great qualities to the world, they did not regard it as perfect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Parmenides]]]]
Only [[Parmenides]] seems to have considered [[existence]] to be "''tetelesmenon''" ("finished"); and [[Melissus of Samos|Melissos]], his successor in the [[Eleatics|Eleatic school]], said that existence "was entirely" ("''pan esti''"). Thus both saw perfection in existence; true existence was one, constant, immutable.  Moreover, Parmenides thought the world to be [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], limited in all directions, and like a [[sphere]] — which was a mark of its perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187" /&gt;

Parmenides' view was embraced to some extent by [[Plato]]. He thought that the world was the work of a good [[Demiurge]], and that this was why order and harmony prevailed in the world.  The world was the best, the most beautiful, perfect. It had a perfect shape (spherical) and a perfect motion (circular).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"/&gt;

But Plato said nothing about the Demiurge architect-of-the-world himself being perfect. And understandably so, for perfection implied finitude, limits; whereas it was the world, not its creator, that had limits. A similar view was held by [[Aristotle]]: the world could be perfect, but God could not.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[pantheism|pantheist]] [[Stoics]] held the divinity to be perfect — precisely because they identified it with the world. [[Cicero]] wrote in ''De natura deorum'' (On the Nature of the Gods) that the world "encompasses... within itself all beings... And what could be more nonsensical than denying perfection to an all-embracing being...  Besides the world, there is no thing that does not lack something and that is harmonious, perfect and finished in every respect..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain moment, Greek philosophy became bound up with the religion of the [[Christianity|Christians]]: the abstract concept of [[first cause]] became linked with the religious concept of [[God]]; the ''[[primum movens]]'' became identified with the [[Creator deity|Creator]], the absolute with the divine Person. Features of an absolute existence were discovered in the Person of the Creator: He was immutable, timeless. And absolute existence took on the attributes of a person: it was good, omnipotent, omnipresent. Christian [[theology]] united the features of the [[first cause]] in Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics]]'' with those of the Creator in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''. But the attributes of God did not include perfection, for a perfect being must be ''finite''; only of such a being might one say that it lacked nothing.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

There was another reason for the denial, to God, of perfection — in a branch of Christian theology that was under the influence of [[Plotinus]]. In this view, the absolute from which the world derived could not be grasped in terms of human [[concept]]s, even the most general and transcendent. Not only was that absolute not [[matter]], it was not [[spirit]] either, nor [[idea]]; it was superior to these. It exceeded any description or praise; it was incomprehensible and ineffable; it was beyond all that we may imagine — including perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

[[Medieval]] Christian philosophy held that the concept of perfection might describe Creation, but was not appropriate to describe God. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], indicating that he was following [[Aristotle]], defined a perfect thing as one that "possesses that of which, by its nature, it is capable." Also (''[[Summa Theologica]]''): "That is perfect, which lacks nothing of the perfection proper to it." Thus there were, in the world, things perfect and imperfect, more perfect and less perfect. God permitted imperfections in Creation when they were necessary for the good of the whole.  And for man it was natural to go by degrees from imperfection to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Duns Scotus]] understood perfection still more simply and mundanely: "Perfection is that which it is better to have than not to have." It was not an attribute of God but a property of creation: all things partook of it to a greater or lesser degree. A thing's perfection depended on what sort of perfection it was eligible for. In general, that was perfect which had attained the fullness of the qualities possible for it.  Hence "whole" and "perfect" meant more or less the same ("''totum et perfectum sunt quasi idem''").&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|[[Benedict Spinoza|Spinoza]]]]
This was a [[teleology|teleological]] concept, for it implied an [[telos (philosophy)|end]] (goal or purpose). God created things that served certain purposes, created even those purposes, but He himself did not serve any purpose.  Since God was not finite, He could not be called perfect: for the concept of perfection served to describe ''finite'' things. Perfection was not a [[theology|theological]] concept, but an [[ontology|ontological]] one, because it was a feature, in some degree, of every [[being]]. The 9th-century thinker [[Paschasius Radbertus]] wrote: "Everything is the more perfect, the more it resembles God." Still, this did not imply that God himself was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection, as an attribute of God, entered [[theology]] only in modern times, through [[René Descartes]] — and in the ''[[plural]]'', as the "perfections" of God.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 190–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Descartes, the concept of perfection as a principal concept in philosophy was upheld by other great 17th-century thinkers. In [[Benedict Spinoza]]'s philosophy, however, there was no personal God, and perfection became a property of — even a synonym for — the existence of reality (that is, for the essence of things).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] wrote: "As M. Descartes states, ''existence'' itself is perfection." Leibniz added: "Perfection, I call any simple quality, if it is positive and absolute, such that, if it expresses something, it does so without limits."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

At the same time, Leibniz also construed perfection, in his ''[[Monadology]]'', in an utterly different way: "Only that is perfect which possesses no limits, that is, only God."  This concept would last out the entire 17th century.  Subsequently, [[Immanuel Kant]] would describe perfection as "''omnitudo realitatis''" ("the omnitude of reality").  Thus perfection, which during the [[Middle Ages]] could be a property of any individual being, in 17th-century philosophy became as well, and indeed preeminently, a property of God.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

Leibniz's pupil and successor, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], took up this concept of perfection — but with a difference. Wolff ascribed perfection not to being as a whole, but once again to its individual constituents. He gave, as examples, an eye that sees faultlessly, and a watch that runs faultlessly. He also distinguished variants — ''perfectio simplex'' and ''composita'', ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'' — and differentiated the magnitude of perfection (''magnitudo perfectionis'').&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff's pupil, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], derived perfection from rules, but anticipated their collisions (''regularum collisio'') leading to exceptions (''exceptio'') and limiting the perfection of things. Baumgarten distinguished perfection ''simplex'' and ''composita'', ''interna'' and ''externa'', ''transcendentalis'' and ''accidentalis''; and, positing so broad a construction, he arrived at the conclusion that "everything is perfect."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Wolff and his pupils had returned to the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection that the [[Scholastics]] had used. The ''[[theology|theological]]'' concept of perfection had lived only from Descartes to Leibniz, in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

Thanks to Wolff's school, the concept of perfection lasted in [[Germany]] through the 18th century. In other western countries, however, especially [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], in that century the concept of perfection was already in decline. It was ignored by the French ''[[Grande Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

The history of the concept of perfection had undergone great evolutions — from "''Nothing'' in the world is perfect", to "''Everything'' is perfect"; and from "Perfection is ''not'' an attribute of God", to "Perfection ''is'' an attribute of God."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

With [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s school, every thing had become perfect. This was a singular moment in the history of the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection; and soon thereafter, that history came to an end.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

==Many concepts==
The foregoing discussion shows that the ''term'' "perfection" has been used to designate a variety of ''[[concept]]s'':
* The word "perfection" has a special meaning in [[mathematics]], where it gives a ''[[proper name]]'' to certain [[number]]s that demonstrate uncommon properties.
* In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], "perfection" designates a ''[[scientific model|model]]'' — a conceptual construct for bodies that in reality do not precisely correspond to the model.
* Elsewhere the term "perfection" is used consistently with the word's [[etymology]] ("perfect" = "finished"). That is perfect which ''lacks nothing''. This is how the term has been used in [[ontology]] (a perfect being), [[ethics]] (a perfect life) and [[medicine]] (perfect health). In these fields, the concept is understood variously as ''ideal [[model (abstract)|model]]'' or as ''actual [[approximation]]'' to the model.
* Also called "perfect" is that which completely ''achieves its purpose''. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] gave examples from [[biology]] (perfect vision) and [[technology]] (a clock that runs neither slow nor fast).  Here "perfection" is less fictitious [[model (abstract)|model]] than actual ''[[approximation]]'' to the model.
* That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. In ''social'' discourse, one speaks of a perfect artist, engineer or carpenter. The term is used similarly in [[art]] criticism, when speaking of perfect technique or of the perfect likeness of a portrait. Here again, "perfection" is either ideal model or approximate realization of the model.
* In [[aesthetics]] and [[art theory]], perfection is ascribed to what is fully [[harmony|harmonious]] — to what is constructed in accordance with a single principle (e.g., the [[Parthenon]], the ''[[Odyssey]]'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for the first, mathematical sense, all these concepts of "perfection" show a kinship and oscillate between [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] and [[approximation]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11" /&gt;

However, the expression "perfect" is also used [[colloquial]]ly as a [[superlative]] ("perfect idiot," "perfect scoundrel," "perfect storm"). Here ''perfectum'' is confused with ''excellens'' of an approving, admiring or condemnatory kind.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection has also been construed as that which is ''the best''. In [[theology]], when [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] termed [[God]] "perfect," they had in mind something other than ''[[model (abstract)|model]]''; than that which ''lacks nothing''; than that ''achieves its purpose''; than that fulfills its functions; or than that ''is [[harmony|harmonious]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C Hello World Program.png|thumb|right|402px|The [[source code]] for a simple computer program written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. When [[compiled]] and run, it would give the output "[["Hello, World!" program|Hello, world!]]".]]
A '''programming language''' is a [[formal language]], which comprises a [[Instruction set|set of instructions]] used to produce various kinds of [[Input/output|output]]. Programming languages are used in [[computer programming]] to create [[program (machine)|programs]] that implement specific [[algorithm]]s.

Most programming languages consist of [[Machine instruction|instructions]] for [[computer]]s, although there are programmable machines that use a limited set of [[domain-specific language|specific instructions]], rather than the [[General-purpose language|general programming languages]] of modern computers. Early ones preceded the [[History of computing hardware|invention of the digital computer]], the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the [[Banū Mūsā|brothers Musa]] in [[Baghdad]], during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Koetsier | first = Teun | title = On the prehistory of programmable machines; musical automata, looms, calculators | publisher = PERGAMON, Mechanism and Machine Theory 36 | year = 2001 | pages = 589–603}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1800s, programs were used to direct the behavior of machines such as [[Jacquard loom]]s, [[music box]]es and [[player piano]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, James (2004) ''Jacquard's Web'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, their programs (such as a player piano's scrolls) could not produce different behavior in response to some input or condition.

Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year. Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an [[imperative programming|imperative]] form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use other forms of program specification such as the [[declarative programming|declarative]] form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] (form) and [[semantics]] (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language is specified by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard) while other languages (such as [[Perl]]) have a dominant [[Programming language implementation|implementation]] that is treated as a [[reference implementation|reference]]. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

==Definitions==
A programming language is a notation for writing [[computer program|programs]], which are specifications of a computation or [[algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Aaby 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaby|first=Anthony|title=Introduction to Programming Languages|year=2004|url=http://www.emu.edu.tr/aelci/Courses/D-318/D-318-Files/plbook/intro.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108043216/http://www.emu.edu.tr/aelci/Courses/D-318/D-318-Files/plbook/intro.htm|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=dmy-all|access-date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but not all, authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express ''all'' possible algorithms.&lt;ref name="Aaby 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In mathematical terms, this means the programming language is [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] {{cite book|last=MacLennan|first=Bruce J.|title=Principles of Programming Languages|page=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-511306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:

; Function and target
: A ''computer programming language'' is a [[formal language|language]] used to write [[computer program]]s, which involves a [[computer]] performing some kind of computation&lt;ref name=sigplan&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] SIGPLAN|title=Bylaws of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages of the Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/sigplan_bylaws.htm|accessdate=19 June 2006|year=2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622110145/http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/sigplan_bylaws.htm|archivedate=22 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}, ''The scope of SIGPLAN is the theory, design, implementation, description, and application of computer programming languages - languages that permit the specification of a variety of different computations, thereby providing the user with significant control (immediate or delayed) over the computer's operation.''&lt;/ref&gt; or [[algorithm]] and possibly control external devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[disk drive]]s, [[robot]]s,&lt;ref name="robots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/tld/courses/cs148/02/programming.html |title=Programming Robots |accessdate=23 September 2006 |last=Dean |first=Tom |year=2002 |work=Building Intelligent Robots |publisher=Brown University Department of Computer Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029045949/http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/tld/courses/cs148/02/programming.html |archivedate=29 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. For example, [[PostScript]] programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.&lt;ref name=nara2&gt;R. Narasimahan, Programming Languages and Computers: A Unified Metatheory, pp. 189--247 in Franz Alt, Morris Rubinoff (eds.) Advances in computers, Volume 8, Academic Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-12-012108-5}}, p.193 : "a complete specification of a programming language must, by definition, include a specification of a processor--idealized, if you will--for that language." [the source cites many references to support this statement]&lt;/ref&gt; In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ben Ari|first=Mordechai|title=Understanding Programming Languages|publisher=John Wiley and Sons| year=1996|quote=Programs and languages can be defined as purely formal mathematical objects. However, more people are interested in programs than in other mathematical objects such as groups, precisely because it is possible to use the program—the sequence of symbols—to control the execution of a computer. While we highly recommend the study of the theory of programming, this text will generally limit itself to the study of programs as they are executed on a computer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming languages differ from [[natural language]]s in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
; Abstractions
: Programming languages usually contain [[abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] for defining and manipulating [[data structure]]s or controlling the [[control flow|flow of execution]]. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the [[abstraction principle (programming)|abstraction principle]];&lt;ref&gt;David A. Schmidt, ''The structure of typed programming languages'', MIT Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-262-19349-3}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; this principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Expressive power
: The [[theory of computation]] classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing. All [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] languages can implement the same set of [[algorithm]]s. [[SQL-92|ANSI/ISO SQL-92]] and [[Charity (programming language)|Charity]] are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet often called programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital Equipment Corporation|title=Information Technology - Database Language SQL (Proposed revised text of DIS 9075)|url=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt|work=ISO/IEC 9075:1992, Database Language SQL|accessdate=29 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621035823/http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Eshadow/sql/sql1992.txt|archivedate=21 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Charity Development Group|title=The CHARITY Home Page|url=http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/charity1/www/home.html|date=December 1996|accessdate=29 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718010551/http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/charity1/www/home.html|archivedate=18 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}, ''Charity is a categorical programming language...'', ''All Charity computations terminate.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Markup languages]] like [[XML]], [[HTML]], or [[troff]], which define [[structured data]], are not usually considered programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points.html XML in 10 points] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906083110/http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points.html |date=6 September 2009 }} [[W3C]], 1999, ''XML is not a programming language.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Thomas|title=HTML &amp; XHTML: the complete reference|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2003|isbn=0-07-222942-X|page=25|quote=''HTML is not a programming language.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dykes|first1=Lucinda|first2=Ed|last2=Tittel|title=XML For Dummies, 4th Edition|publisher=Wiley|year=2005|isbn=0-7645-8845-1|page=20|quote=''...it's a markup language, not a programming language.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined.

The term ''computer language'' is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Edmunds, The Prentice-Hall standard glossary of computer terminology, Prentice-Hall, 1985, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Lando, Anne Lapujade, Gilles Kassel, and Frédéric Fürst, ''[http://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~site-ic/site/IMG/pdf/ICSOFT2007_final.pdf Towards a General Ontology of Computer Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707093557/http://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~site-ic/site/IMG/pdf/ICSOFT2007_final.pdf |date=7 July 2015 }}'', [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icsoft/icsoft2007-1.html ICSOFT 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427063709/http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icsoft/icsoft2007-1.html |date=27 April 2010 }}, pp. 163-170&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Bajpai, ''Introduction To Computers And C Programming'', New Age International, 2007, {{ISBN|81-224-1379-X}}, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.&lt;ref&gt;R. Narasimahan, Programming Languages and Computers: A Unified Metatheory, pp. 189--247 in Franz Alt, Morris Rubinoff (eds.) Advances in computers, Volume 8, Academic Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-12-012108-5}}, p.215: "[...] the model [...] for computer languages differs from that [...] for programming languages in only two respects. In a computer language, there are only finitely many names--or registers--which can assume only finitely many values--or states--and these states are not further distinguished in terms of any other attributes. [author's footnote:] This may sound like a truism but its implications are far reaching. For example, it would imply that any model for programming languages, by fixing certain of its parameters or features, should be reducible in a natural way to a model for computer languages."&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C. Reynolds]] emphasizes that [[formal specification]] languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Reynolds, ''Some thoughts on teaching programming and programming languages'', [[SIGPLAN]] Notices, Volume 43, Issue 11, November 2008, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of programming languages}}

===Early developments===
Very early computers, such as [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], were programmed without the help of a [[stored program]], by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.

Slightly later, programs could be written in [[machine language]], where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an "opcode" that selects the "add" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from [[punched card]]s or paper tape or [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] or toggled in on switches on the [[front panel]] of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed ''[[first-generation programming language]]s'' (1GL).

The next step was development of so-called ''[[second-generation programming language]]s'' (2GL) or [[assembly language]]s, which were still closely tied to the [[instruction set architecture]] of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.

The first ''[[high-level programming language]]s'', or ''[[third-generation programming language]]s'' (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was [[Plankalkül]], developed for the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] by [[Konrad Zuse]] between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Raúl Rojas|Rojas, Raúl]], et al. (2000). "Plankalkül: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation". Institut für Informatik, Freie Universität Berlin, Technical Report B-3/2000. [http://www.zib.de/zuse/Inhalt/Programme/Plankalkuel/Plankalkuel-Report/Plankalkuel-Report.htm (full text)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018204625/http://www.zib.de/zuse/Inhalt/Programme/Plankalkuel/Plankalkuel-Report/Plankalkuel-Report.htm |date=18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Mauchly]]'s [[Short Code (computer language)|Short Code]], proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an [[electronic computer]].&lt;ref name=Sebesta&gt;Sebesta, W.S Concepts of Programming languages. 2006;M6 14:18 pp.44. {{ISBN|0-321-33025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[machine code]], Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into [[machine code]] every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent [[machine code]].

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Manchester Mark2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Manchester Mark 1]] ran programs written in [[Autocode]] from 1952.]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Manchester]], [[Alick Glennie]] developed [[Autocode]] in the early 1950s. A [[high-level programming language|programming language]], it used a [[compiler]] to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the [[Manchester Mark 1|Mark 1]] computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first [[compiler|compiled]] high-level programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|last2=Pardo|first2=Luis Trabb|title=Early development of programming languages|journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology|volume=7|pages=419–493|publisher=Marcel Dekker |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpYX_lNI0VMC|title=Digitized: The Science of Computers and how it Shapes Our World|author=Peter J.

The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by [[Tony Brooker|R. A. Brooker]] in 1954 and was called the "Mark 1 Autocode". Brooker also developed an autocode for the [[Ferranti Mercury]] in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the [[EDSAC|EDSAC 2]] was devised by [[David Hartley (computer scientist)|D. F. Hartley]] of  [[University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory]] in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, [[Atlas Autocode]] was developed for the University of Manchester [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas 1]] machine.

In 1954, [[FORTRAN]] was invented at IBM by [[John Backus]]. It was the first widely used [[high-level language|high-level general purpose programming language]] to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |title=Fortran creator John Backus dies - Tech and gadgets- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117182533/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS302/99S/Outlines/outline.02.html |title=CSC-302 99S : Class 02: A Brief History of Programming Languages |publisher=Math.grin.edu |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715042920/http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS302/99S/Outlines/outline.02.html |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still a popular language for [[high-performance computing]]&lt;ref name=hpc&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1820518|author=Eugene Loh|title=The Ideal HPC Programming Language|journal=Queue|date=18 June 2010|publisher=Association of Computing Machines|volume=8|issue=6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015345/http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1820518|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's [[TOP500|fastest supercomputers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = HPL - A Portable Implementation of the High-Performance Linpack Benchmark for Distributed-Memory Computers |accessdate = 2015-02-21 |url = http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150215031500/http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/ |archivedate = 15 February 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early programming language was devised by [[Grace Hopper]] in the US, called [[FLOW-MATIC]]. It was developed for the [[UNIVAC I]] at [[Remington Rand]] during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an [[English language|English]] programming language and implemented a prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper (1978) p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sammet (1969) p.&amp;nbsp;316&lt;/ref&gt; Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of [[COBOL]], since only it and its direct descendant [[AIMACO]] were in actual use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sammet (1978) p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refinement===
The increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for ''[[low-level programming language]]s'' or ''[[system programming language]]s''. These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages and can be used to perform tasks which require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking.
   
The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use:
* [[APL (programming language)|APL]] introduced ''[[array programming]]'' and influenced [[functional programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Wexelblat: ''History of Programming Languages'', Academic Press, 1981, chapter XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ALGOL]] refined both ''structured procedural programming'' and the discipline of [[programming language specification|language specification]]; the "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language [[ALGOL 60]]" became a model for how later language specifications were written.
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], implemented in 1958, was the first dynamically typed ''[[functional programming]]'' language
* In the 1960s, [[Simula]] was the first language designed to support ''[[object-oriented programming]]''; in the mid-1970s, [[Smalltalk]] followed with the first "purely" object-oriented language.
* [[C (programming language)|C]] was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language for the [[Unix]] operating system and remains popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~flab/languages.html|author=François Labelle|title=Programming Language Usage Graph|work=[[SourceForge]]|accessdate=21 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617055109/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Eflab/languages.html|archivedate=17 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}. This comparison analyzes trends in number of projects hosted by a popular community programming repository. During most years of the comparison, C leads by a considerable margin; in 2006, Java overtakes C, but the combination of C/C++ still leads considerably.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Prolog]], designed in 1972, was the first ''[[logic programming]]'' language.
* In 1978, [[ML (programming language)|ML]] built a polymorphic type system on top of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], pioneering ''[[Type system|statically typed]] [[functional programming]]'' languages.
Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.

The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of ''[[structured programming]]'', and whether programming languages should be designed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Semicolon Wars|journal=American Scientist|first1=Brian|last1=Hayes|volume=94|issue=4|year=2006|pages=299–303|doi=10.1511/2006.60.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]], in a famous 1968 letter published in the [[Communications of the ACM]], argued that [[Goto|GOTO]] statements should be eliminated from all "higher level" programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=Edsger W.|authorlink=Edsger Dijkstra|title=Go To Statement Considered Harmful|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=11|issue=3|date=March 1968|pages=147–148|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF|accessdate=2014-05-22|doi=10.1145/362929.362947|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513014557/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF|archivedate=13 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation and growth===
[[File:Bangalore India Tech books for sale IMG 5261.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A selection of textbooks that teach programming, in languages both popular and obscure. These are only a few of the thousands of programming languages and dialects that have been designed in history.]]

The 1980s were years of relative consolidation. [[C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], a systems programming language derived from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[Fifth-generation programming language|"fifth generation" languages]] that incorporated logic programming constructs.&lt;ref&gt;Tetsuro Fujise, Takashi Chikayama, Kazuaki Rokusawa, Akihiko Nakase (December 1994). "KLIC: A Portable Implementation of KL1" ''Proc. of FGCS '94, ICOT'' Tokyo, December 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132105/http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }} KLIC is a portable implementation of a concurrent logic programming language [[KL1]].&lt;/ref&gt; The functional languages community moved to standardize [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.

One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of ''modules'' or large-scale organizational units of code. [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Bender|url=http://readscheme.org/modules/|title=Mini-Bibliography on Modules for Functional Programming Languages|work=ReadScheme.org|accessdate=27 September 2006|date=15 March 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924085057/http://readscheme.org/modules/|archivedate=24 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic [[website]]s. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of "[[Write once, run anywhere]]" ([[UCSD Pascal]] had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel, rather they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).

Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), and database integration such as Microsoft's [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]].

''[[Fourth-generation programming language]]s'' (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. ''[[Fifth generation programming language]]s'' (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an [[algorithm]] written by a programmer.

==Elements==
All programming languages have some [[language primitive|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.

===Syntax===
{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)}}
[[File:Python add5 parse.png|thumb|367px|[[Parse tree]] of [[Python (programming language)|Python code]] with inset tokenization]]
[[File:Python add5 syntax.svg|thumb|292px|[[Syntax highlighting]] is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is [[Python (programming language)|Python]].]]
A programming language's surface form is known as its [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.

The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal]] or hard-coded in a [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]]). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.

Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus–Naur form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:
&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt;
expression ::= atom | list
atom       ::= number | symbol
number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
symbol     ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*
list       ::= '(' expression* ')'
&lt;/source&gt;

This grammar specifies the following:
* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';
* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';
* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;
* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and
* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.

The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: &lt;code&gt;12345&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(a b c232 (1))&lt;/code&gt;.

Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]]. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.

Using [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:
* "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.
* "John is a married bachelor." is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.

The following [[C (programming language)|C language]] fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation &lt;code&gt;*p &gt;&gt; 4&lt;/code&gt; has no meaning for a value having a complex type and &lt;code&gt;p-&gt;im&lt;/code&gt; is not defined because the value of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is the [[null pointer]]):

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
complex *p = NULL;
complex abs_p = sqrt(*p &gt;&gt; 4 + p-&gt;im);
&lt;/source&gt;

If the [[type declaration]] on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable "p" during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.

The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are [[context-free grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sipser|year=1996|title=[[Introduction to the Theory of Computation]]|publisher=PWS Publishing|isbn=0-534-94728-X |authorlink=Michael Sipser}} Section 2.2: Pushdown Automata, pp.101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an [[undecidable problem]], and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kegler, "[http://www.jeffreykegler.com/Home/perl-and-undecidability Perl and Undecidability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817183115/http://www.jeffreykegler.com/Home/perl-and-undecidability |date=17 August 2009 }}", ''The Perl Review''. Papers 2 and 3 prove, using respectively [[Rice's theorem]] and direct reduction to the [[halting problem]], that the parsing of Perl programs is in general undecidable.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Lisp macro|Lisp's macro system]] and Perl's &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Hall, 1995, [http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/Lisp-Notes/Macros.html Lecture Notes: Macros] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806054148/http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/Lisp-Notes/Macros.html |date=6 August 2013 }}, [[PostScript]] [http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/Lisp-Notes/Macros.ps version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817211709/http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/Lisp-Notes/Macros.ps |date=17 August 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
The term [[Semantics#Computer science|''semantics'']] refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form ([[#Syntax|syntax]]).

====Static semantics====
The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms.&lt;ref name="Aaby 2004"/&gt; For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every [[identifier]] is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a [[case statement]] are distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lee Scott, ''Programming language pragmatics'', Edition 2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, {{ISBN|0-12-633951-1}}, p. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that [[subroutine]] calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a [[logic]] called a [[type system]]. Other forms of [[static code analysis|static analyses]] like [[data flow analysis]] may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have [[definite assignment analysis]], a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.

====Dynamic semantics====
{{main|Semantics of programming languages}}
Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control flow|control structures]] conditionally execute [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. The ''dynamic semantics'' (also known as ''execution semantics'') of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into [[formal semantics of programming languages]], which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.

===Type system===
{{Main|Data type|Type system|Type safety}}

A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have ''type loopholes'', usually unchecked [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casts]] that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to [[type checking|type check]] programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, [[type inference|infer types]], relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as ''[[type theory]]''.

====Typed versus untyped languages====
A language is ''typed'' if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable, with the implication that it is not applicable to other types.&lt;ref name="typing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|author=Andrew Cooke|title=Introduction To Computer Languages|accessdate=13 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140215/http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the data represented by &lt;code&gt;"this text between the quotes"&lt;/code&gt; is a [[String literal|string]], and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will be rejected by the compilers. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected when the program is run ("dynamic" type checking), resulting in a run-time [[Exception handling|exception]]. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to be written to handle this exception and, for example, always return "-1" as the result.

A special case of typed languages are the ''single-type'' languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as [[REXX]] or [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]], and have only one data type{{dubious|date=March 2018}}-—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.

In contrast, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[assembly language]]s, allows any operation to be performed on any data, which are generally considered to be sequences of bits of various lengths.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; High-level languages which are untyped include [[BCPL]], [[Tcl]], and some varieties of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].

In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the point of view of [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting ''all'' operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casting]]).

====Static versus dynamic typing====
In ''[[Type system|static typing]]'', all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt;

Statically typed languages can be either ''[[Manifest typing|manifestly typed]]'' or ''[[Type inference|type-inferred]]''. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declarations]]). In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] all infer types in certain limited cases.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms. Type inference in Generic Java—the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|parametric polymorphism]] extensions—is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the Types mailing list: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073839/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 December 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073849/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 January 2002). C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.

''[[Type system|Dynamic typing]]'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with ''run-time values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type [[Software bug|errors]] cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making [[debugging]] more difficult. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are all examples of dynamically typed languages.

====Weak and strong typing====
''[[Weak typing]]'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a [[String (computer science)|string]] as a number.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at [[compile time]] and even at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

''[[Strongly typed programming language|Strong typing]]'' prevents the above. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.&lt;ref name="typing"/&gt; Strongly typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]''.

An alternative definition for "weakly typed" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]] and [[JavaScript]], which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression &lt;code&gt;2 * x&lt;/code&gt; implicitly converts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.
''Strong'' and ''static'' are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''. Thus [[C (programming language)|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|date=20 February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714212928/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism|author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]]|work=Manuscript (1985)|accessdate=9 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619072646/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|archivedate=19 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be "weakly, statically typed". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the '''void*''' pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as &lt;code&gt;(int)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(char)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Standard library and run-time system===
{{main|Standard library}}

Most programming languages have an associated core [[Library (computing)|library]] (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.

The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a string literal is defined as an instance of the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/code&gt; class; similarly, in [[Smalltalk]], an [[anonymous function]] expression (a "block") constructs an instance of the library's &lt;code&gt;BlockContext&lt;/code&gt; class. Conversely, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.

==Design and implementation==
Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing ''language families'' of related languages branching one from another.&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;Steven R. Fischer, ''A history of language'', Reaktion Books, 2003, {{ISBN|1-86189-080-X}}, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levenez"&gt;{{cite web|author=Éric Lévénez|title=Computer Languages History|year=2011|url=http://www.levenez.com/lang/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107162045/http://www.levenez.com/lang/|archivedate=7 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety, since it has a precise and finite definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/Projects/Nuprl/cs611/fall94notes/cn2/subsection3_1_3.html|author=Jing Huang|title=Artificial Language vs. Natural Language|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903084542/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/Projects/Nuprl/cs611/fall94notes/cn2/subsection3_1_3.html|archivedate=3 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While [[constructed languages]] are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.

Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one "universal" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.&lt;ref&gt;IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966). The title reflected IBM's goals for unlimited subsetting capability: ''PL/I is designed in such a way that one can isolate subsets from it satisfying the requirements of particular applications.'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL/I&amp;oldid=19175|title=PL/I|work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=29 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010947/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL%2FI&amp;oldid=19175|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}). [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.&lt;/ref&gt; The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:
* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of [[programmer]]s.
* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.
* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.
* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.
* Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.

One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.: ''The Mythical Man-Month,'' Addison-Wesley, 1982, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|English-like programming languages}}
[[Natural language programming]] has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed [[natural language programming]] as "foolish".&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Edsger W. [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html On the foolishness of "natural language programming."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120201526/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html |date=20 January 2008 }} EWD667.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Perlis]] was similarly dismissive of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlis|first=Alan|url=http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html|title=Epigrams on Programming|work=SIGPLAN Notices Vol. 17, No. 9|date=September 1982|pages=7–13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117034445/http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html|archivedate=17 January 1999|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid approaches have been taken in [[Structured English]] and [[SQL]].

A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language ''specification'' and ''implementation''.

===Specification===
{{Main|Programming language specification}}

The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language [[programmer|users]] and the [[programming language implementation|implementors]] can use to agree upon whether a piece of [[source code]] is a valid [[computer program|program]] in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.

A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:
* An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in [[natural language]] (e.g., as in the [[C (programming language)|C language]]), or a [[formal semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] (e.g., as in [[Standard ML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milner|first=R.|authorlink=Robin Milner |author2=[[Mads Tofte|M. Tofte]] |author3=[[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|R. Harper]] |author4=D. MacQueen |title=The Definition of Standard ML (Revised)|publisher=MIT Press|year=1997|isbn=0-262-63181-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Kelsey|author2=William Clinger|author3=Jonathan Rees|title=Section 7.2 Formal semantics|work=Revised&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_7.2|date=February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706081110/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_7.2|archivedate=6 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifications).
* A description of the behavior of a [[compiler|translator]] for the language (e.g., the [[C++]] and [[Fortran]] specifications). The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language.
* A [[reference implementation|''reference'' or ''model'' implementation]], sometimes [[Meta-circular evaluator|written in the language being specified]] (e.g., [[Prolog]] or [[REXX|ANSI REXX]]&lt;ref&gt;[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] — Programming Language Rexx, X3-274.1996&lt;/ref&gt;). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.

===Implementation===
{{Main|Programming language implementation}}

An ''implementation'' of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.

The output of a [[compiler]] may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of [[BASIC]] compile and then execute the source a line at a time.

Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run several orders of magnitude faster than those that are interpreted in software.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is [[just-in-time compilation]]. Here the [[virtual machine]], just before execution, translates the blocks of [[bytecode]] which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.

==Proprietary languages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly [[domain specific language]]s or internal [[scripting language]]s for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.

Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, [[Oracle Corporation]] asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the [[Java programming language]],&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft]]'s [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) as a closed environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/|title=Guide to Programming Languages {{!}} ComputerScience.org|work=ComputerScience.org|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include [[MATLAB]], [[VBScript]], and [[Wolfram Language]].  Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-erlang1/index.html|title=The basics|date=2011-05-10|website=www.ibm.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 June 2009|url=http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/|title=HOPL: an interactive Roster of Programming Languages|publisher=[[Murdoch University]]|location=Australia|quote=This site lists 8512 languages.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220044217/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/|archivedate=20 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Software is commonly built with 5 programming languages or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Philip|conference=Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering - EASE '15|last1=Mayer|first2=Alexander|last2=Bauer|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2745802.2745805|publisher=ACM|date=2015|location=New York, NY, USA|isbn=978-1-4503-3350-4|pages=4:1–4:10|doi=10.1145/2745802.2745805|accessdate=18 September 2015|quote=Results: We found (a) a mean number of 5 languages per project with a clearly dominant main general-purpose language and 5 often-used DSL types, (b) a significant influence of the size, number of commits, and the main language on the number of languages as well as no significant influence of age and number of contributors, and (c) three language ecosystems grouped around XML, Shell/Make, and HTML/CSS. Conclusions: Multi-language programming seems to be common in open-source projects and is a factor which must be dealt with in tooling and when assessing development and maintenance of such software systems.|title=An empirical analysis of the utilization of multiple programming languages in open source projects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using [[pseudocode]], which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.

A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A [[programmer]] uses the [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called [[language primitive|primitives]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|author=Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman|accessdate=3 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050622/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|archivedate=26 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Programming|Programming]]'' is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.

Programs for a computer might be [[Execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[Batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, or a user might type [[Command (computing)|commands]] in an [[Session (computer science)|interactive session]] of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. In this case the "commands" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a [[Unix shell]] or other [[command-line interface]]), without compiling, it is called a [[scripting language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Measuring language usage===
{{Main|Measuring programming language popularity}}

Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, [[COBOL]] is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.

Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:

==Dialects, flavors and implementations==
A '''dialect''' of a programming language or a [[data exchange language]] is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new [[dialect]]. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a [[domain-specific language]], often a subset. In the [[Common Lisp|Lisp]] world, most languages that use basic [[S-expression]] syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Clojure]]. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The [[BASIC programming language]] has [[List of BASIC dialects|many dialects]].

The explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying "If you've seen one Forth... you've seen ''one'' Forth."

==Taxonomies==
{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}
There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.

The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel). [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].

In broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use,'' with [[general-purpose programming language]]s distinguished from [[domain-specific programming language]]s. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called [[imperative programming]] languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of [[declarative programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Gunter, ''Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-262-57095-5}}, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; More refined paradigms include [[procedural programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[logic programming]]; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An [[assembly language]] is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, [[system programming language]]s, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|title=TUNES: Programming Languages|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203251/http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wirth|first=Niklaus|authorlink=Niklaus Wirth|title=Recollections about the development of Pascal|journal=Proc. 2nd [[SIGPLAN|ACM SIGPLAN]] conference on history of programming languages|pages=333–342|year=1993|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378|accessdate=30 June 2006|doi=10.1145/154766.155378|isbn=0-89791-570-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use [[English language]] keywords, while [[Non-English-based programming languages|a minority do not]]. Other languages may be classified as being [[Esoteric programming language|deliberately esoteric]] or not.

{{History of the Jews in England}}

The '''resettlement of the Jews in England''' was an informal arrangement during the Commonwealth of England in the mid-1650s, which allowed Jews to practise their faith openly. It forms a prominent part of the [[history of the Jews in England]]. It happened directly after two events. Firstly a prominent rabbi [[Menasseh ben Israel]] came to the country from the Netherlands to make the case for Jewish resettlement, and secondly a Spanish [[New Christian]] (a supposedly converted Jew, who secretly practised his religion) merchant Antonio Robles requested that he be classified as a Jew rather than Spaniard during the war between England and Spain.

Historians have disagreed about the reasons behind the resettlement, particularly regarding [[Oliver Cromwell]]’s motives, but the move is generally seen as a part of a current of religious and intellectual thought moving towards liberty of conscience, encompassing [[philosemitic]] [[millenarianism]] and [[Hebraic]]ism, as well as political and trade interests favouring Jewish presence in England. The schools of thought that led to the resettlement of the Jews in England is the most heavily studied subject of Anglo-Jewish history in the period before the Eighteenth Century.&lt;ref&gt;Gow, Andrew Colin and Fradkin, Jeremy (2016).

OUP {{ISBN|9780199646920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1290, King [[Edward I of England]] had issued an [[Edict of Expulsion|edict expelling all Jews from England]].&lt;ref name=bbc2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/350.shtml|title=Readmission of Jews to Britain in 1656|author=Tara Holmes|date=24 June 2011|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[English Reformation]], which started in the 1530s, brought a number of changes that benefited Jews in the long term.  Doctrines and rituals of the Roman Catholic church that hurt Jews were eliminated, especially those that emphasised their role in the death of Jesus. Further [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|anti-Catholicism]], with the Pope as [[antichrist]], came to replace anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S.; Levy, Richard S. (2008).

University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|9780472086092}}. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The period of the [[English Civil War]]s and [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], were marked by both widespread [[Millennialism|millennial]] beliefs and a beginning of religious toleration. Significantly, millenarianism in England often had a strong [[Hebraist]] character, that emphasised the study of Hebrew and Judaism. This often extended to seeing the English as the [[British Israelism|new Israelites]],&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978).

{{main|History of the Marranos in England}}
After both the [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492, which expelled Jews from Spain in 1492, and [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|similar measures in Portugal]] in 1496, some [[converso]] traders (Jewish converts to Christianity, who often practised Judaism in secret, sometimes also known as [[New Christians]] or derogatively as [[Marrano]]s) settled in London and Bristol.{{refn|In addition to these small communities of ‘[[port Jew]]s’, Henry VIII consulted rabbis on the biblical legitimacy of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and during the reign of Edward VI the Regius professor of Hebrew at Cambridge was the converso Hebraist [[Immanuel Tremellius]]. Elizabeth had a Jewish physician, [[Roderigo Lopez|Roderigo Lopes]], and her spymaster [[Francis Walsingham]]’s network of intelligencers included the Portuguese Marrano traders, Hector Nuñes and Dunstan Añez, as well as Lopes. Further, [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] travelled to the New World with Jewish mining expert [[Joachim Gans]] in 1584. It is estimated that there were roughly 80 to 90 Portuguese converses in Elizabethan London.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, John P (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o6TaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 ''The Life and Economics of David Ricardo''] Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN| 9781461561293}} pps.71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/african-freedom-in-tudor-england-dr-hector-nuness-request ''African freedom in Tudor England: Dr Hector Nunes’ petition''] ourmigrationstory.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} The small community was largely linked by trade to Antwerp, and was expelled altogether in 1609. It was with London’s growing importance as a trading city that Jews from the Netherlands began to settle in the country once more from the 1630s. It is from this first that the current Jewish population of the UK has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Todd M. (2002).

===Religious toleration and liberty of conscience===
The 1640s and 1650s in England were marked by intense debates about religious toleration, marked by speeches and tracts by radical puritans and dissenters who called for liberty of conscience. This extreme diversity of opinion about religious toleration was sorted into 12 schools of thought in the seminal study of the period by [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W.K. Jordan]].{{refn|These categories were: orthodox Presbyterians, moderate Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, Latitudinarians, Cambridge Platonists, rationalists and sceptics, Erastians, the rank and file, Anglican extremists, moderate Anglicans, and Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Wilbur Kitchener (1938 and 1940). ''The Development of Religious Toleration in England. Vols. III and IV''. in Coffey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note|text.}} John Coffey uses a simpler three point schema:  anti-tolerationists, conservative tolerationists, and radical tolerationists, pointing out that although the latter were in a minority, they formed an important part of the debate.&lt;ref name=Coffey2006&gt;Coffey, John (2006). [https://www.academia.edu/30764101/_The_toleration_controversy_during_the_English_Revolution_in_C._Durston_and_J._Maltby_eds_Religion_in_Revolutionary_England_Manchester_University_Press_2006_ The Toleration Controversy during the English Revolution]. in C. Durston and J. Maltby, eds, Religion in Revolutionary England. Manchester University Press, 2006. pps.42-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless it is important to remember that although figures such as [[William Walwyn]], [[Sir Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]], [[John Milton]], and others made powerful apologia for religious toleration, their frame of reference was theological, rather than secular in nature and they were not calling for religious pluralism as is understood today.&lt;ref&gt;Walsham, Alexandra (2006).[https://books.google.com/books?id=MwNlIIGnckYC&amp;pg=PA233 Charitable Hatred: Tolerance and Intolerance in England, 1500-1700]. Manchester University Press. p.232-233. {{ISBN|9780719052392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zagorin, Peter (2003).

Princeton University Press. pps.195-196. {{ISBN|9781400850716}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early and mid Seventeenth century was also marked by a rise in Hebraism, the study of Jewish scriptures, which were often used to discuss political issues such as the existence of a monarchy or republic, and religious toleration. This debate used Jewish sources to justify its conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kim Ian (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TraYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT654 ‘A King Like Other Nations’: Political Theory and The Hebrew Republic in the Early Modern Age] in Kileen, Kevin, Smith, Helen, Willie, Rachel Judith (2015). The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in Early Modern England, c. 1530-1700. OUP Oxford. {{ISBN|9780191510595}}. &lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent scholar in the field was the MP and jurist, [[John Selden]], whose thought was influenced by [[Erastus]] and [[Grotius]]. Selden proposed minimal government intervention on matters of religion, a view he modelled on the [[Hebrew republic|Hebrew Commonwealth]]. He in turn influenced similar approaches in [[John Milton]] (whose plea for freedom of the press, the [[Areopagitica]] (1644), directly named him), [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] (the latter of whom, proposed settling Jews in Ireland in his book ''[[The Commonwealth of Oceana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gertrude Himmelfarb|Himmelfarb, Gertrude]] (2011).

Encounter Books. {{ISBN|9781594035715}}. pps.144-146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric M. Nelson|Nelson, Eric]] (2011).

Overall the strongest political group of the 1640s and 50s, the English Puritans, had a negative view of toleration, seeing it as a concession to evil and heresy. It was often associated with tolerating the heresies of [[Arminianism]], the philosophy of free will and free thought, and [[Socinianism]], a doctrine of [[Anti-trinitarianism]]. But despite this Puritan hostility to toleration, England did see a certain religious laissez-faire emerge (for instance, the [[Rump Parliament]] repealed the [[recusancy]] laws in 1650). This was partly due to the impossibility of stopping religious free expression, but it also became a part of the cause of the [[New Model Army|new model army]].&lt;ref&gt;Worden, Blair (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=evIKK1WdYdcC&amp;pg=PA68 ''God's Instruments: Political Conduct in the England of Oliver Cromwell'']. OUP. p.68. {{ISBN|9780199570492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrinal policies of the protectorate were largely conservative, however this Puritan train of thought could also point towards liberty of conscience. For [[Congregationalists]], truth lay in the spirit rather than institutions; like the [[Cambridge Platonists|Platonists]] they searched for internal unity amidst external diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Worden (2012). pps. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Puritans valued conscience, which could be neither forced nor tested, over ritual and ceremony. So rather than toleration, the key debate among key figures in the Protectorate revolved around [[liberty of conscience]]. For [[Blair Worden]], Cromwell’s religious policy was rooted in a search for union of believers, rather than toleration of differing beliefs, and religious persecution was the largest obstacle to this union. However, liberty of conscience extended only to "God’s peculiar" and not heretics (such as [[Quakers]], Socinians, and [[Ranters]]).&lt;ref&gt;Worden (2012). pps. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great increase of religious freedom and the ecclesiastical diversity in Cromwellian England, this marked a revolutionary change and led to increasing toleration in the years after the interregnum ended.&lt;ref&gt;Worden (2012). pps. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, while the loosely Calvinist Cromwell allowed the punishment of men such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]] and the [[Quaker]] [[James Nayler]], and accepted the restrictions on religious tolerance found in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]] of 1657. But on the other hand, his entourage included men who wanted more liberty of belief than he allowed. These non-sectarian ‘merciful men’ or [[politiques]], who wanted to understand and tolerate beliefs different to their own, included [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]], [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], [[Charles Worsley|Sir Charles Worsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Worden, Blair (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=evIKK1WdYdcC&amp;pg=PA85 ''God's Instruments: Political Conduct in the England of Oliver Cromwell'']. OUP. p.85-86. {{ISBN|9780199570492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millenarian 'admissionists'===
The toleration of Jews was largely borne by the hope of [[Conversion of the Jews|converting them to Christianity]]. [[Leonard Busher]] was one of the first to call for the readmission of the Jews to England and the toleration of their faith in 1616. Lawyer and MP, [[Henry Finch]] and the scholar [[Joseph Mede]] both wrote of the benefits of the conversion of the Jews in the 1620s. The Scottish minister [[John Wemyss]] advocated readmitting Jews to Christian lands with a view to converting them in the 1630s. So, by the 1640s the imminent conversion of the Jews was a widespread belief among Puritans. Indeed during that decade the Christians who were most liberal towards Jews are also those who were most committed to their conversion. A number of these ‘admissionists’ were close to Cromwell, including [[John Sadler (Town Clerk of London)|John Sadler]], [[John Dury]], and [[Hugh Peter]]. Other notable readmissionists include exiled Royalist cleric [[Thomas Barlow (bishop)|Thomas Barlow]] and the Dissenter [[Henry Jessey]]. The [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] were another example of Puritan millenarians who saw the readmission of the Jews as hastening the kingdom of Christ. The exiled Royalist [[Edward Nicholas|Sir Edward Nicholas]] is one of the few admissionists who did not seem interested in conversion. By contrast, the anti-admissionists were often animated by the belief that it would be difficult or impossible to convert the Jews. [[William Prynne]]’s anti-Semitic pamphlet ''A Short Demurrer'', which was printed on the eve of the Whitehall Conference, and the pamphlet ''Anglo-Judaeus or The History of the Jews Whilst Here in England'' by W.H. both doubt that the Jews would be converted once in England.&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1tQUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century]. Brill Archive. P.18-32&lt;/ref&gt; Many millenarians at the time emphasised the chosen role of England in God’s plan, and this was often accompanied by the identification the Jews as the true Israel of the Bible. Indeed, they saw the Jews as a superior group, sharing some characteristics with the chosen nation of England. This belief was rooted in the literal interpretation of the Biblical primacy of the Jews found in the writings of [[Thomas Brightman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman and Yates (2014). p.167&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that if the Jews were specially favoured by God, the English must listen to their appeals for help.&lt;ref&gt;Crome, Andrew (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qcokBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189 ''The Restoration of the Jews: Early Modern Hermeneutics, Eschatology, and National Identity in the Works of Thomas Brightman'']. Springer. {{ISBN|9783319047614}}. p.189&lt;/ref&gt; These philo-semitic figures, who also believed in the restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land, included [[Jeremiah Burroughs]], [[Peter Bulkley|Peter Bulkeley]] (whose father had given Brightman’s funeral sermon), [[John Fenwicke]], and [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Crome (2014). p.179, 184-188&lt;/ref&gt;

==1649 to 1654: First steps towards resettlement==

The original petition for readmission was submitted by Johanna and Ebenezer Cartwright, two English baptists living in Amsterdam, to [[Thomas Fairfax]]’s Council of War in January 1649. As well as asking that Jews be allowed to live in England, their petition also expressed the wish that the Jews "shall come to know the Emanuell" and that they be transported to the "Land promised to their fore-fathers". It can be seen as a distillation of the Judeo-centric trends of Puritan thought that had developed over the previous century since [[John Bale]] (1495 – 1563). However, the petition was sent the day before the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I|high court was established to try Charles I]], so in the ensuing turmoil the Cartwrights never received an answer.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert O. (2013). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SjJpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 ''More Desired than Our Owne Salvation: The Roots of Christian Zionism'']. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199993253}}. pps. 95-117&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Amsterdam-based Rabbi and diplomat [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] wrote in his book ''Hope of Israel'' of the necessity of the Jews being "spread out to the ends of the earth" (Daniel 12:7) before they could be redeemed. The book was originally published in Dutch and Latin in 1650, and then in English (dedicated to Parliament and the Council of State) in 1652.&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1tQUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century]. Brill Archive. P.24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1651 Ben Israel met [[Oliver St John]] and his envoys on their mission to secure an Anglo-Dutch coalition. The English were impressed by learning and manner, and advised him to formally apply for Jewish readmission to England.&lt;ref name=sachar1994&gt;Sachar, Howard M. (1994). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2RowAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA313 ''Farewell Espana: The World of the Sephardim Remembered''] p.313-314. Knopf Doubleday. {{ISBN|9780804150538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1653, at Oliver St John’s suggestion, Cromwell issued an official directive to authorise, "Menasseh ben Israel, a rabbi of the Jewish nation, well respected for his learning and good affection to the State, to come from Amsterdam to these parts." Fearing local anti-English opinion so soon after war, ben Israel turned down the invitation. But by the middle of the decade, Cromwell was taking advice from [[Marrano]] trader [[Simon de Caceres]]. At de Caceres suggestion, Cromwell dispatched Marrano physician Abraham de Mercado and his son Raphael to [[History of the Jews in Barbados|Barbados]] (which a few years previously had already started admitting Jews escaping from the Portuguese reconquest of [[Dutch Brazil]]), where he explored the possibility of Jews setting in [[History of the Jews in Jamaica|Jamaica]]. There they would be offered full civil rights and even land grants.&lt;ref name=sachar1994 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiefel, Barry L. (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mMu7BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128 ''Jewish Sanctuary in the Atlantic World: A Social and Architectural History'']. Univ of South Carolina Press. {{ISBN|9781611173215}}. p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some difference of opinion as to Oliver Cromwell’s opinions regarding the readmission of the Jews. It has been pointed out that he held many of the same hopes regarding the readmission and conversion of the Jews as the millenarians. [[Paul Rycaut]], later ambassador to the port of [[Smyrna]] recalled the Whitehall Conference, "When they all met, he (Cromwell) ordered the Jews to speak for themselves. After that he turned to the clergy, who inveigled much against the Jews as a cruel and cursed people. Cromwell in his answer to the Clergy called them ‘Men of God’ and desired to be informed by the whether it was not their opinion that the Jews were one day to be called into the Church? He then desired to know whether it was not every Christian man’s duty to forward that good end all he could?… was it not then our duty… to encourage them to settle ere where they could be taught the thuth…[sic]"&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel (1978). P.30&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been pointed out that Cromwell held more practical beliefs. Cromwell believed that Jews could be used as skilled purveyors of foreign intelligence (which would assist his imperial ambitions).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia. (1973). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1iiWzpYwfCcC&amp;pg=PT484&amp;lpg=PT484 Cromwell, Our Chief of Men.] Hachette. 2011. {{ISBN|9781780220697}} This view first appeared in [[Lucien Wolf]]’s essay ''Cromwell's Jewish Intelligencers: A Paper Read at Jews' College Literary Society, May 10th, 1891''.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, toleration of Protestant sects made political sense for Cromwell as it prevented disorder and promoted harmony. He justified the readmission of the Jews using this same tolerant approach, as well as believing that it would improve trade (he saw the Jews as an important part of Amsterdam’s financial success).&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, David (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=j1Vj6dH1PxAC&amp;pg=PA67 Oliver Cromwell.] p. 67-68. Heinemann. {{ISBN|9780435327569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition with the Dutch for trade and the increasingly protectionist commercial policy that led to the [[Navigation Acts#The 1651 Act|Navigation Act]] in October 1651 made [[Oliver Cromwell]] want to attract the rich Jews of Amsterdam to London so that they might transfer their important trade interests with the [[Spanish Main]] from the Netherlands to England. The mission of [[Oliver St John]] to Amsterdam, though failing to establish a coalition between English and Dutch commercial interests as an alternative to the Navigation Act, had negotiated with [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] and the Amsterdam community. A pass was granted to Menasseh to enter England, but he was unable to use it because of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654.

==1655 and 1656: Informal resettlement achieved==

The years 1655 and 1656 were to prove decisive in the history of the resettlement of the Jews in England. The first of these was the visit of Menasseh ben Israel and the second was the case of the Murrano trader Antonio Rodrigues Robles.

===Menasseh Ben Israel's petition===
Menasseh ben Israel’s son Samuel had arrived in England accompanied by trader David Dormido&lt;ref name=AngloJewishDict&gt;eds. Rubinstein, William D.; Jolles, Michael and Rubinstein, Hilary L.

Palgrave Macmillan. p.227&lt;/ref&gt; in 1653 to investigate the possibility of the resettlement of the Jews. In May 1655, he was sent back to Amsterdam in order to try to convince his father to visit England. The rabbi came to England in September 1655 with three other local rabbis, where they were lodged as guests of Cromwell.&lt;ref name=sachar1994 /&gt; There he printed his "humble address" to Cromwell.{{refn|ben Israel’s petition was titled ’To His Highness the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, the Humble Addresses of Menasseh ben Israel, a Divine, and Doctor of Physick, in behalf of the Jewish Nation’.

He concluded by asking for the Jews to be allowed to settle in the commonwealth.|group=note}} (When ben Israel began his stay in London it is reckoned that there were about 20 [[New Christian]] families living in the city.)&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Todd M.

The lawyers declared no opposition to the Jews' residing in England, but both the clergymen and merchants were opposed to readmission, leading Cromwell to stop the discussion to prevent an adverse decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sigal, Philip (1986).

===The Robles case===

Early in the following year (1656), the question came to a practical issue through the declaration of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660)|war against Spain]], which resulted in the arrest of [[Antonio Rodrigues Robles]], one of the community of Iberian New Christians who traded between London and the Canary Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=71429|title=Robles, Antonio Rodrigues|first=Edgar|last=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robles petitioned for the return of his seized property on account of his being ‘of the Hebrew nation’ rather than Spanish. At the same time six leading members of the New Christian community petitioned Cromwell for permission to gather to worship and acquire a burial ground. Although no formal permission was granted, some assurances must have been given because in the summer Menasseh asked for the Torah scroll to be sent over from Amsterdam, and in the autumn Moses Athias moved from Hamburg to act as religious preceptor. By December 1656 they had rented a house for use as a synagogue, and services began in January of 1657.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/London/city_creechurch/index.htm Jewish Community and Records - Creechurch Lane Synagogue] http://www.jewishgen.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In February of 1657 the new community, represented by [[Antonio Fernandez Carvajal]] and [[Simon de Caceres]], acquired land near [[Mile End]] for use as a Synagogue. Historian Todd Endelman makes the point that it is unlikely this activity could have happened without Cromwell’s permission that they could live as professing Jews. The informal nature of the resettlement also meant the forces ranged against it had no target and never united to form any significant opposition. Further, at a later date it meant there were no restrictive laws to repeal when Jews wanted fuller citizenship rights. By the end of the decade the number of Jewish families had risen to thirty five.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Todd M. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=RNyvgPAuvhAC&amp;pg=PA26 The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000]. University of California Press. {{ISBN|9780520935662}} pps.26-27, 29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1657 [[Solomon Dormido]], a nephew of Menasseh Ben Israel, was admitted to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] as a duly licensed broker of the City of London, without taking the usual oath involving a statement of faith in [[Christianity]], (when he was finally sworn in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1668, the oath was changed for him).&lt;ref name=AngloJewishDict /&gt; Carvajal had previously been granted letters of [[denization]] for himself and his son, which guaranteed certain rights of citizenship.

==Debating the return of the Jews==
During the years 1655-56 the question of the return of Jews to England was fought in a [[pamphlet war]]. Conservative opponents including [[William Prynne]] opposed the return while the Quaker [[Margaret Fell]] was in favour. Christian supporters believed the conversion of Jews was a sign of the [[end times]] and the readmission to England was a step towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Debate over the Resettlement of Jews in England, 1655–56|url=https://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_4/debate.htm|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of debate had the advantage of not raising [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] feelings too strongly; and it likewise enabled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], on his [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] in 1660, to avoid taking any action on the petition of the merchants of London asking him to revoke Cromwell's concession. He had been assisted during his exile by several Jews of royalist sympathies, such as Andrea Mendes da Costa ([[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]], wife of Charles II), Antonio Mendes (the physician brother of Andrea, who had cured Catherine of [[erysipelas]] while in Portugal) and Augustine Coronel-Chacon. In 1664 a further attempt was made by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire|Earl of Berkshire]] and [[Paul Ricaut]] to bring about the expulsion of the Jews, but the [[King-in-Council]] assured the latter of the continuance of former favour. Similar appeals to prejudice were made in 1673, when Jews, for meeting in Duke's Place for a religious service, were indicted on a charge of rioting, and in 1685, when thirty-seven were arrested on the Royal Exchange; but the proceedings in both cases were put a stop to by direction of the [[Privy Council]]. The status of the Jews was still very indeterminate. In 1684, it was contended by the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] that they were alien [[infidel]]s, and perpetual enemies to the English crown. Even the [[Attorney-General]] declared that they resided in England only under an implied licence. As a matter of fact, the majority of them were still aliens and liable to all the [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] that condition carried with it.

==Help from and to Jews abroad==
[[William III of England|William III]] is reported to have been assisted in his ascent to the English throne by a loan of 2,000,000 [[guilders]] from [[Antonio Lopez Suasso]] (1614–1685) (of the well-known [[Lopes Suasso]] family), later made first Baron [[d'Avernas le Gras]] by [[Charles II of Spain]]. William did not interfere when in 1689 some of the chief Jewish merchants of London were forced to pay the duty levied on the goods of aliens, but he refused a petition from [[Jamaica]] to expel the Jews. William's reign brought about a closer connection between the predominantly Sephardic communities of London and Amsterdam; this aided in the transfer of the European finance centre from the Dutch capital to the English capital. Over this time a small [[German people|German]] [[Ashkenazi]] community had arrived and established their own [[synagogue]] in 1692, but they were of little mercantile consequence, and did not figure in the relations between the established Jewish community and the government.

Early in the eighteenth century the Jewish community of London comprised representatives of the chief Jewish financiers in northern [[Europe]]; these included the [[Mendez da Costa]], [[Abudiente]], [[Joseph Salvador|Salvador]], [[Lopez]], Fonseca, and [[Seixas]] families. The utility of these prominent Jewish merchants and financiers was widely recognised. [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]] in particular made great use of the services of Sir [[Solomon de Medina]], and indeed was publicly charged with taking an annual [[subvention]] from him. The early merchants of the resettlement are estimated to have brought with them a capital of £1,500,000 into the country; this amount is estimated to have increased to £5,000,000 by the middle of the 18th century.

As early as 1723 an act of Parliament allowed Jews holding land to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian", when registering their title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecil Roth]], ''A History Of The Jews In England'' (1941), [http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Cecil.Roth/A.History.of.the.Jews.in.England/P.09.The.Jews.under.Anne.and.the.First.Hanoverians.1702-60.htm accessible here] "An Act of 1722, which added to Roman Catholic disabilities by enforcing the Oath of Abjuration on all landowners, was followed the next year by a further measure (to George I, cap. 4) exempting Jews from the necessity of including in it the words 'on the true faith of a Christian';"&lt;/ref&gt; Only once more would this allowance be made&lt;ref name="Henriq-PREJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henriques |first=H. S. Q. |date=Jan 1907 |title=The Political Rights of English Jew |jstor=1451130 |journal=[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]] |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=298–341 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the passage of the [[Plantation Act 1740]], but more significantly the act allowed Jews who had or would have resided in [[British America]] for seven years to become naturalised British subjects.

Shortly afterwards a similar bill was introduced into the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], where it passed the [[Irish House of Commons|Commons]] in 1745 and 1746, but failed to pass the [[Irish House of Lords|Lords]] in 1747; it was ultimately dropped. Meanwhile, during the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rising of 1745 the Jews had shown particular loyalty to the government. Their chief financier, [[Samson Gideon]], had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London.

{{Wiktionary}}

A '''review''' is an evaluation of a publication, service, or company such as a [[film|movie]] (a [[Film criticism|movie review]]), [[video game]] (video game review), [[musical composition]] ([[music criticism|music review]] of a composition or recording), [[book]] ([[book review]]); a piece of hardware like a [[car]], [[home appliance]], or [[computer]]; or an event or performance, such as a [[live concert|live music concert]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[Musical theater|musical theater show]], [[dance show]], or [[art exhibition]]. In addition to a critical evaluation, the review's author may assign the work a [[content rating|rating]] to indicate its relative merit. More loosely, an author may review current events, trends, or items in the news. A compilation of reviews may itself be called a review. ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', for instance, is a collection of essays on literature, culture, and current affairs. ''[[National Review]]'', founded by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]],&lt;ref name="“nationalreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=William F. Buckley Jr.|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/author/william-f-buckley-jr|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an influential [[conservatism|conservative]] magazine, and ''[[Monthly Review]]'' is a long-running [[socialist]] periodical.&lt;ref name="“monthlyreview.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Monthly Review|url=http://monthlyreview.org/about/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User review==
{{main article|User review}}

A user review refers to a review written by a user or consumer for a product or a service based on her experience as a user of the reviewed product. Popular sources for consumer reviews are e-commerce sites like [[Amazon.com]], [[Zappos]] or lately in the Yoga field for schools such as Banjaara Yoga and Ayurveda, and social media sites like [[TripAdvisor]] and [[Yelp]]. [[E-commerce]] sites often have consumer reviews for products and sellers separately. Usually, consumer reviews are in the form of several lines of texts accompanied by a numerical rating. This text is meant to aid in shopping decision of a prospective buyer. A consumer review of a product usually comments on how well the product measures up to expectations based on the specifications provided by the manufacturer or seller. It talks about performance, reliability, quality defects, if any, and value for money. Consumer review, also called 'word of mouth' and 'user generated content' differs from 'marketer generated content' in its evaluation from consumer or user point of view. Often it includes comparative evaluations against competing products. Observations are factual as well as subjective in nature. Consumer review of sellers usually comment on service experienced, and dependability or trustworthiness of the seller. Usually, it comments on factors such as timeliness of delivery, packaging, and correctness of delivered items, shipping charges, return services against promises made, and so on.

Consumer reviews online have become a major factor in business [[reputation]] and brand image due to the popularity of TripAdvisor, Yelp, and online review websites. A negative review can damage the reputation of a business and this has created a new industry of [[reputation management]] where companies attempt to remove or hide bad reviews so that more favourable content is found when potential customers do research.

An ''expert review'' usually refers to a review written by someone who has tested several peer products or services to identify which offers the best value for money or the best set of features. An example of this is Amazon Vine. [[Amazon Vine]] is a program which was introduced to "help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/vine/help|title=Amazon.co.uk - Amazon Vine Programme|website=www.amazon.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program is invite-only and is designed to generate reviews for product vendors that Amazon works with.

One type of user review can be in the physical world, such as a video reviewing a product or software. This is common on platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo.

A ''bought review'' is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review their new product.

==Book review==
A [book review] (or book report) is a form of criticism in which a book is analyzed based on content, style, and merit. It is often carried out in periodicals, as school work, or online. Its length may vary from a single paragraph to a substantial [essay]. In the case of a work of poetry or fiction, or of nonfiction in which the literary merits of the work are an important element, a review will commonly use the methods of [[literary criticism]]. Such a review often contains evaluations of the book on the basis of personal taste. Reviewers, in literary periodicals, often use the occasion of a book review for a display of learning or to promulgate their own ideas on the topic of a fiction or [[non-fiction]] work. At the other end of the spectrum, some book reviews resemble simple plot summaries. Reviews of non-fiction works intended for instructional or informational purposes may focus more directly on concerns such as practical usefulness and reader-friendliness.

==Music reviews==

===Performance reviews===
Reviews of live music performances are typically short articles that tell readers about the performers or group(s) that were involved and the pieces or songs that were performed. The comments made by reviewers fall, roughly into two categories: technical comments and subjective/artistic comments. The elements in the "technical" category include rhythmic "togetherness", intonation, errors or slip-ups, and so on. These elements are fairly "black and white"; a pianist playing a concerto either played the right notes on a climactic scale run, or she missed it. The subjective comments refer to elements which are a matter of taste. The balance between the different elements in a review (information about the performer or group; information about the pieces/songs; commentary about the technical and subjective elements of the performance) depends on the audience that a music critic is writing for. Music reviewers writing in local newspapers or general-interest magazines may not be able to assume that the readers will be familiar with music performers and pieces/songs, so they may decide to include a great deal of "background" information.

===Recording reviews===
Music critics and music writers also review recordings of music, including individual songs or pieces or entire albums. In the case of a review of an entire album, the reviewer will not only judge the individual songs or pieces; they will also judge how well all of the songs or pieces work together or go together.

The age of digital downloads may considerably change the album review.  Where previously albums were purchased as collections of songs, often with a common theme, the rise of individual song downloads may have significant impact on consumers' exposure to an artist's music.  Die-hard fans will most likely continue to explore an artist's complete work, but individuals will most likely make significantly different choices and "cherry-pick" songs they have been exposed to.  The concept of "singles" or individual hits marked for retail has been around for long time; however, the price for a single in the days of CDs or 45's was much closer to the complete album price.  When you consider that each song on an artist's album is often priced at the same amount, the odds of the average consumer purchase the entire album instead of selecting the "hit" songs decreases significantly.

===Composition reviews===
In Classical music, music critics may also do reviews of compositions, even if the piece or song has never been performed and it only exists on manuscript paper in a score. To review a composition in this fashion, the critic will use music theory skills such as harmonic analysis and thematic analysis, along with their knowledge of idioms and compositional practices.etc

==Motion picture, television and video reviews==
A [[Film criticism|motion picture review]] is a work of film criticism addressing the merits of one or more motion pictures. Generally, the term "movie review" implies a work of [[Film criticism|journalistic film criticism]] rather than of academic criticism. Such reviews have appeared in newspapers and printed periodicals since the beginning of the film industry, and now are published in general-interest websites as well as specialized film and film review sites. Television programs and other videos are now commonly reviewed in similar venues and by similar methods.

==Bought review==
A ''bought review'' is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new product pays a reviewer to review his new product. Primarily used in the car, movie, and game industry this system creates a kind of undercover advertising. Bought reviews tend to be biased due to the informative value of reviews. In some cases, a bought review may be independent, if the person that is hired to do the review has a strong reputation for independence and integrity. Even if a "bought review" from a respected critic is actually independent, the perception of potential bias will remain, due to the financial relationship between the company and the critic.

A similar type of review that may be biased is the so-called "[[puff piece]]", a review of "[a product]", film, or event that is written by a sympathetic reviewer or by an individual who has a connection to the product or event in question, either in terms of an employment relationship or other links. For example, a major media conglomerate that owns both print media and record companies may instruct one of its employees in one of its newspapers to do a review of an album which is being released by the conglomerate's record company. Although some journalists may assert their professional independence and integrity, and insist on producing an unbiased review, in other cases, writers may succumb to the pressure and pen a biased "puff piece" which praises the product or event while omitting any discussion of any shortcomings. In some cases, "puff pieces" purport to provide a review of the product or event, but instead merely provide "[[peacock words]]" ("An amazing recording"); "[[weasel words]]"  and tabloid-style filler which is peripheral or irrelevant to assessing the qualities of the product or event ("During the filming, there were rumors that romantic sparks flew between the two co-leads, who were often seen talking together on the set").

Several online review manipulation strategies have also been reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gössling|first1=Stefan|last2=Hall|first2=C. Michael|last3=Andersson|first3=Ann-Christin|title=The manager's dilemma: a conceptualization of online review manipulation strategies|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|date=12 January 2016|volume=21|issue=5|pages=484–503|doi=10.1080/13683500.2015.1127337}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as writing fake reviews and offering monetary compensation to remove negative reviews. Among these strategies, selectively soliciting customers to write positive reviews is gaining high popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Magno|first1=Francesca|last2=Cassia|first2=Fabio|last3=Bruni|first3=Attilio|title=“Please write a (great) online review for my hotel!” Guests’ reactions to solicited reviews|journal=Journal of Vacation Marketing|date=27 January 2017|pages=135676671769057|doi=10.1177/1356766717690574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding this is the fact that unhappy customers are more likely to leave reviews than happy ones, businesses feel like they have to increase their number of reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tagggly.com/business/blog/43-seven-tips-for-yelp-success.html|title=Seven Tips For Yelp Success|last=|first=|date=|website=tagggly.com|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-fulfilling prophecy''' is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to [[positive feedback]] between belief and behavior. Although examples of such [[prophecy|prophecies]] can be found in literature as far back as [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], it is 20th-century [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] who is credited with coining the expression "self-fulfilling prophecy" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article ''Self-Fulfilling Prophecy'', Merton defines it in the following terms: 
{{quote|The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a ''false'' definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come ''true''. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In other words, a positive or negative prophecy, strongly held belief, or [[delusion]]—declared as truth when it is actually false—may sufficiently influence people so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy.

Self-fulfilling prophecy are effects in ''[[behavioral confirmation]] effect'', in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complementary to the [[self-defeating prophecy]].

==History of the concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Merton's concept of the ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' stems from the [[Thomas theorem]], which states that "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences".&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Child in America: Behavior Problems and Programs |last=Thomas |first=W. I. |authorlink=W. I. Thomas |year=1928 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn= |pages=572 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to their perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/nominal-interest-rates-and-money-supply-and-demand-1147766|title=How Money Supply and Demand Determine Nominal Interest Rates|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.

Merton took the concept a step further and applied it to recent social phenomena. In his book ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', he conceives of a [[bank run]] at the fictional Last National Bank, over which Cartwright Millingville presides. It is a typical bank, and Millingville has run it honestly and quite properly. As a result, like all banks, it has some [[Asset|liquid assets]] (cash), but most of its assets are invested in various ventures. Then one day, a large number of customers come to the bank at once—the exact reason is never made clear. Customers, seeing so many others at the bank, begin to worry. False rumours spread that something is wrong with the bank, and more customers rush to the bank to try to get some of their money out while they still can. The number of customers at the bank increases, as does their annoyance and excitement, which in turn fuels the false rumours of the bank's [[insolvency]] and upcoming [[bankruptcy]], causing more customers to come and try to withdraw their money. At the beginning of the day—the last one for Millingville's bank—the bank was not insolvent. But the rumour of insolvency caused a sudden demand of withdrawal of too many customers, which could not be answered, causing the bank to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. Merton concludes this example with the following analysis:

{{quote|The parable tells us that public definitions of a situation (prophecies or predictions) become an integral part of the situation and thus affect subsequent developments. This is peculiar to human affairs. It is not found in the world of nature, untouched by human hands. Predictions of the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] do not influence its orbit. But the rumoured insolvency of Millingville's bank did affect the actual outcome. The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfilment.&lt;ref name="merton"&gt;{{cite book |title= Social Theory and Social Structure|last= Merton|first= Robert K|authorlink= Robert K. Merton|year= 1968|publisher= [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-0-02-921130-4|oclc= 253949|pages= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Merton concluded that the only way to break the cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy is by redefining the propositions on which its false assumptions are originally based.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In economic "expectations models" of inflation, peoples' expectations of future inflation lead them to spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising. This demand for higher nominal interest rates and increased spending in the present, in turn, create inflationary pressure and can cause inflation even if the expectations of future inflation are unfounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The expectations theory of inflation played a large role in [[Paul Volcker]]'s actions during his tenure as the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] in combating the "[[stagflation]]" of the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':

{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the "Oedipus effect", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. … For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences. But in biology, too—even in molecular biology—expectations often play a role in bringing about what has been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |year=1976 |publisher=Open Court |location=LaSalle, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87548-343-6 |oclc=2927208 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early precursor of the concept appears in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'': "During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment" (chapter I, part II).

===Applications===
Examples abound{{examples|date=May 2014}} in studies of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the related [[self-perception theory]]; people will often change their [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] to come into line with what they profess publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco-Villanueva, M. A., [http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 El Efecto “Pricebo”: Cómo los precios pueden influenciar la percepción sobre la calidad del cannabis y sus implicaciones en las políticas de precios"], ''Pensamiento Crítico,'' vol. 22, n. 2, pp 175-210&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the "[[War on Poverty]]". Theodore Brameld noted: "In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brameld |first=T. |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=Education as self-fulfilling prophecy |journal=Phi Beta Kappa |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=8–11, 58–61 [p. 9]|url= |quote= }} Quoted by Wilkins (1976), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=William E. |authorlink= |year=1976 |title=The Concept of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=Sociology of Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–183 |issn=0038-0407|quote= |doi=10.2307/2112523 |jstor= 2112523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the "inevitability of war" is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The role of expectancy |title=The Tensions That Cause Wars |last=Allport |first=G. |authorlink= |editor=Cantrill, H. |year=1950 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana |isbn= |pages=43–78 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher [[William James]] as "[[The Will to Believe]]." But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Just as, in Merton's example, the belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, so too, on the positive side, confidence in the bank's prospects may help brighten them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Similarly, Stock-exchange panic episodes, and speculative bubble episodes, can be triggered with the belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.

A more Jamesian example: a swain, convinced that the fair maiden ''must'' love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than he would had his initial prophecy been defeatist.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is extensive evidence{{where|date=May 2014}} of "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", where the seemingly private expectations of individuals can predict the outcome of the world around them. The mechanisms by which this occurs are also reasonably well understood: it is simply that our own expectations change our behaviour in ways we may not notice and correct. In the case of the "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", others pick up on non-verbal behaviour, which affects their attitudes. A famous{{according to whom|date=May 2014}} example includes a study where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were "going to blossom".{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}  Oddly, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvements.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal-2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenthal |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Covert communication in laboratories, classrooms, and the truly real world |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |publisher=Blackwell |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=151–154 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8721.t01-1-01250|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Rosenthal2003.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pygmalion in the Classroom|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Robert|last2=Jacobson|first2=Lenore|year=2003|publisher=Crown House|isbn=9781904424062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In Canadian ice hockey, junior league players are selected based on skill, motor coordination, physical maturity, and other individual merit criteria. However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0–11 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0-316-01792-3|pages=20–25|chapter=1 – The Matthew Effect|laysummary=http://www.rugbyiq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199:is-it-because-of-talent-that-athletes-succeed&amp;catid=102:mental-toughness&amp;Itemid=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same [[relative age effect]] has been noticed in Belgian soccer after 1997, when the start of the selection year was changed from August 1 to January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helsen|first=WF |author2=Starkes, JL |author3=Van Winckel, J|title=Effect of a change in selection year on success in male soccer players|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2000-11-01|volume=12|issue=6|pages=729–735|pmid=11534065|doi=10.1002/1520-6300(200011/12)12:6&lt;729::AID-AJHB2&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype==
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
This specific form of self-fulfilling prophecy is very common and takes many forms. For example, the expectancy for a political party to act in a certain way—based on [[Internalized racism|race]], religion, gender and much more—can eventually lead the said party to imitate the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Personality. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 492). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, media, and the arts==
In literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.

===Classical===
Many myths, legends and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. "Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change". (Wilkins 1976:177).&lt;/ref&gt; In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.&lt;!--own what?--&gt; The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.

====Greek====
[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]
The best known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.

Although the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Danaë]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.

Greek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked—but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88&lt;/ref&gt; In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.

People do not necessarily have to unsuccessfully avoid a prophecy in order for the prophecy to be self-fulfilling. For example, when it was predicted that [[Zeus]] would overthrow his father, [[Cronus|Cronos]], and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, he actively waged war against him in a direct attempt to fulfill this prophecy. This makes the prophecy a self-fulfilling one because it was the prophecy itself that gave Zeus the inspiration to do it in the first place.

====Roman====
[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]
The story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him like he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.

====Persian====
Another example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is detailed by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his account of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams. Both dreams involved something particular (in the first dream, a flood, while in the second dream, a fruit bearing vine) emerging from his daughter Mandane's pelvis and covering the entirety of Asia. After consulting the Magi, he was informed that the dreams
foreshadowed the birth of a child who would eventually rule in his place. Terrified by the prophecies, Astyages summoned [[Harpagus]] and commanded him to kill the child after it's born. Harpagus, however, was reluctant to kill the child and so assigned the task to one of Astyages' cowherds. The cowherd likewise hesitated and so he and his wife devised a plan to expose their own child, that was born dead, to a desolate place in the mountains while raising the other child as their own. The child was afterwards named Cyrus. One day, when Cyrus was 10 years old, an incident with one of the children he was playing with brought him before king Astyages to give account for his actions. While listening to Cyrus' words, Astyages became suspicious that Cyrus could be the child he wanted to kill. After pressuring his cowherd to relay to him everything about the child, the cowherd finally revealed everything about how he happened upon the child and how he decided to raise him as his own. Astyages, angered with Harpagus summoned him as well and Harpagus likewise revealed the truth. In revenge, the king killed Harpagus' son and later made this act known to Harpagus. However, he spared Cyrus' life as the magi, attempting to further clarify the prophecy to him, accidentally misinterpreted it and thus saved Cyrus. After some time Harpagus, possibly driven by revenge, took advantage of Cyrus' prosperous growth and Astyages' misdeeds to persuade him to revolt against Astyages. His efforts eventually proved successful as Cyrus became king and Astyages was imprisoned. {{sfn|Herodotus|p=1.107-130}}

====Arabic====
A variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "[[The Tale of Attaf]]", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]
Self-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

====Russian====
[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad "The Song of the Wise Oleg". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].

====European fairy tales====
Many fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.

Another fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.

In some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.

====Shakespeare====
[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.

The later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should "Beware Macduff" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.

===Modern===
Similar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symoné]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it.

====New Thought====
The [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that "like attracts like" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, ''Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour'', Journal of Australian Studies: 101&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone's intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the [[placebo]] and [[nocebo]] effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web

==Causal loop==
{{see also|Causal loop|Newcomb's paradox}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, 37–49&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he cannot change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sensitization''' is a non-associative [[learning]] process in which repeated administration of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] results in the progressive amplification of a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shettleworth |first=S. J. |year=2010 |title=Cognition, Evolution and Behavior |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Oxford |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitization often is characterized by an enhancement of response to a whole class of stimuli in addition to the one that is repeated. For example, repetition of a painful stimulus may make one more responsive to a loud noise.
==History==
[[Eric Kandel]] was one of the first to study the neural basis of sensitization, conducting experiments in the 1960s and 1970s on the gill withdrawal reflex of the seaslug ''[[Aplysia]]''. Kandel and his colleagues first habituated the reflex, weakening the response by repeatedly touching the animal's siphon. They then paired noxious electrical stimulus to the tail with a touch to the siphon, causing the gill withdrawal response to reappear. After this sensitization, a light touch to the siphon alone produced a strong gill withdrawal response, and this sensitization effect lasted for several days. (After Squire and Kandel, 1999&lt;ref name=Squire&gt;Squire LR, Kandel ER (1999). ''Memory: From Mind to Molecules.'' New York: Scientific American Library; New York: W.H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-6037-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2000, Eric Kandel was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his research in neuronal learning processes.

==Neural substrates of sensitization==
{{addiction glossary|reverse citation order=yes}}
The neural basis of behavioral sensitization is often not known, but it typically seems to result from a cellular receptor becoming more likely to respond to a stimulus. Several examples of neural sensitization include:
* Electrical or chemical stimulation of the rat [[hippocampus]] causes strengthening of [[synaptic signal]]s, a process known as [[long-term potentiation]] or LTP.&lt;ref name=Collingridge&gt;Collingridge GL, Isaac JT, Wang YT (2004). "Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity". ''Nat Rev Neurosci'' 5(12): 952–962, {{PMID|15550950}}, {{DOI|10.1038/nrn1556}}.&lt;/ref&gt; LTP of [[AMPA receptor]]s is a potential mechanism underlying memory and learning in the brain.
* In "[[Kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling]]", repeated stimulation of hippocampal or [[amygdala|amygdaloid]] neurons in the [[limbic system]] eventually leads to [[seizure]]s in laboratory animals. After sensitization, very little stimulation may be required to produce seizures. Thus, kindling has been suggested as a model for [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in humans, where stimulation of a repetitive type (flickering lights for instance) can cause epileptic seizures.&lt;ref name=Morimoto&gt;Morimoto K, Fahnestock M, Racine RJ (2004). "Kindling and status epilepticus models of epilepsy: Rewiring the brain". ''Prog Neurobiol'' 73(1): 1–60, {{PMID|15193778}}, {{DOI|10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.03.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy report symptoms of negative effects such as anxiety and depression that might result from limbic dysfunction.&lt;ref name=Teicher&gt;Teicher MH, Glod CA, Surrey J, Swett C, Jr (1993). "Early childhood abuse and limbic system ratings in adult psychiatric outpatients". ''J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci'' 5(3): 301–306, {{PMID|8369640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "central sensitization," [[nociceptive neuron]]s in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]]s of the [[spinal cord]] become sensitized by peripheral tissue damage or inflammation.&lt;ref name=Ji&gt;Ji RR, Kohno T, Moore KA, Woolf CJ (2003). "Central sensitization and LTP: Do pain and memory share similar mechanisms?". ''Trends Neurosci'' 26(12): 696–705, {{PMID|14624855}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of sensitization has been suggested as a possible causal mechanism for chronic pain conditions.  The changes of central sensitization occur after repeated trials to pain.  Research from animals has consistently shown that when a trial is repeatedly exposed to a painful stimulus, the animal’s pain threshold will change and result in a stronger pain response.  Researchers believe that there are parallels that can be drawn between these animal trials and persistent pain in people.  For example, after a back surgery that removed a herniated disc from causing a pinched nerve, the patient may still continue to “feel” pain.  Also, newborns who are circumcised without anesthesia have shown tendencies to react more greatly to future injections, vaccinations, and other similar procedures.  The responses of these children are an increase in crying and a greater hemodynamic response (tachycardia and tachypnea).&lt;ref&gt;Gudin J. (2004). Medscape Neurobiology: Expanding Our Understanding of Central Sensitization. Medscape: Medscape Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drug sensitization]] occurs in [[drug addiction]], and is defined as an increased effect of drug following repeated doses (the opposite of [[drug tolerance]]). Such sensitization involves changes in brain [[mesolimbic]] [[dopamine]] transmission, as well as a protein inside mesolimbic neurons called [[FosB#Delta FosB|delta FosB]]. An associative process may contribute to addiction, for environmental stimuli associated with drug taking may increase craving. This process may increase the risk for relapse in addicts attempting to quit.&lt;ref name= Robinson&gt;Robinson TE, Berridge KC (1993). "The neural basis of drug craving: An incentive-sensitization theory of addiction". ''Brain Res Brain Res Rev'' 18(3): 247–291, {{PMID|8401595}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Allergic Sensitization – There is an acute response (early stages) and a late-phase response (later stages).  In the early stages, the Antigen-Presenting Cell causes a response in a TH2 lymphocyte which produce the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4).  The TH2 lymphocytes interact with B cells and together they produce IgE.  IgE circulates around and binds to receptors of cells leading to an acute inflammatory response.&lt;ref&gt;Janeway, Charles; Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik (2001). Immunobiology; Fifth Edition. New York and London: Garland Science. pp. e–book. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4101-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, sensitization is commonly referring to commencement of allergic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Janeway C, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik M, eds. (2001). Immunobiology 5: The Immune System in Health and Disease. New York: Garland Pub., {{ISBN|0-8153-3642-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allergic sensitization development varies with age, with younger children at the greatest risk of developing allergic sensitization.&lt;ref name="Croner1992"&gt;Croner S (1992). "Prediction and detection of allergy development: influence of genetic and environmental factors". J. Pediatr. 121 (5 Pt 2): S58–63. {{doi|10.1016/S0022-3476(05)81408-8}}. {{PMID|1447635}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a variety of tests to diagnose allergic conditions.  Tests that are commonly used place potential allergens on the skin of the patient and looking for a reaction to look for an allergen-specific IgE (Immunoglobulin E).  They have shown that IgE levels are at their greatest before 10 years of age and fall vastly until one reaches 30.&lt;ref name="Croner1992"/&gt;  There is a school of thought that believes that there are different genetic loci for different ethnicities for the same inflammatory disease.&lt;ref&gt;De Swert LF (1999). "Risk factors for allergy". Eur. J. Pediatr. 158 (2): 89–94. {{doi|10.1007/s004310051024}}. {{PMID|10048601}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this thought, asthma has different chromosomal locations in people of European, Hispanic, Asian, and African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes KC, Grant AV, Hansel NN, Gao P, Dunston GM (2007). "African Americans with asthma: genetic insights". Proc Am Thorac Soc 4 (1): 58–68. {{doi|10.1513/pats.200607-146JG}}. {{PMC|2647616}}. {{PMID|17202293}}. Archived from the original on 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-sensitization==

'''Cross-sensitization'''&lt;!--term redirects here; bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt; is a phenomenon in which sensitization to a stimulus is generalized to a related stimulus, resulting in the amplification of a particular response to both the original stimulus and the related stimulus.&lt;ref name="pmid19679518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brumovsky PR, Gebhart GF | title = Visceral organ cross-sensitization - an integrated perspective | journal = Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic &amp; Clinical | volume = 153 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 106–15 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19679518 | pmc = 2818077 | doi = 10.1016/j.autneu.2009.07.006 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22378593"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malykhina AP, Wyndaele JJ, Andersson KE, De Wachter S, Dmochowski RR | title = Do the urinary bladder and large bowel interact, in sickness or in health? ICI-RS 2011 | journal = Neurourology and Urodynamics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 352–8 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22378593 | pmc = 3309116 | doi = 10.1002/nau.21228 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-sensitization to the neural and behavioral effects of [[addictive drug]]s are well characterized, such as sensitization to the locomotor response of a stimulant resulting in cross-sensitization to the motor-activating effects of other stimulants.  Similarly, [[reward sensitization]] to a particular addictive drug often results in [[reward cross-sensitization]], which entails sensitization to the [[reward system|rewarding property]] of other addictive drugs in the same [[drug class]] or even certain [[natural reward]]s.

In animals, ''cross-sensitization'' has been established between the consumption of many different types of [[Substance abuse|drugs of abuse]] - in line with the [[gateway drug theory]] - and also between [[sugar]] consumption and the [[self-administration]] of drugs of abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid17617461"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avena NM, Rada P, Hoebel BG | title = Evidence for sugar addiction: behavioral and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–39 | date = 2008 | pmid = 17617461 | pmc = 2235907 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a causal factor in pathology==
Sensitization has been implied as a causal or maintaining mechanism in a wide range of apparently unrelated pathologies including [[addiction]], allergies, asthma, [[overactive bladder]]&lt;ref name="pmid27245505"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reynolds WS, Dmochowski R, Wein A, Bruehl S | title = Does central sensitization help explain idiopathic overactive bladder? | journal = Nature Reviews. Urology | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 481–91 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27245505 | pmc = 4969200 | doi = 10.1038/nrurol.2016.95 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some medically unexplained syndromes such as [[fibromyalgia]] and [[multiple chemical sensitivity]]. Sensitization may also contribute to psychological disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[panic anxiety]] and [[mood disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen JB, Schulkin J (1998). "From normal fear to pathological anxiety". ''Psychol Rev'' 105(2): 325–350, {{DOI|10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325}} {{PMID|9577241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antelman&gt;Antelman SM (1988).

While studies have shown the effects of [[solitary confinement]] to be detrimental to some inmates, '''solitary confinement of women''' has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the [[United States]] are roughly comparable to those for men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/|title=FAQ|date=2012-01-31|website=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career. Conversely, solitary confinement has also has a very positive effect on women. This article explores both sides of the argument.

== Incidence ==
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Solitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bottos, Shauna. 2007. ''Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature''. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2001-01-01|title=Telling the Story: A Study in the Segregation of Women Prisoners|jstor=29768065|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=196–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. 2014. “Worse Than Second-Class: Solitary Confinement of Women in the United States.” Retrieved May 2, 2016 (https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/worse_than_second-class.pdf).
&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disciplinary segregation ===
An offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wichmann, Cherami and Kelly Taylor. 2004.

&lt;/ref&gt; According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preasmyer|first=Amy|date=2014|title=Together we can make a difference|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Administrative segregation ===
Administrative segregation, or “ad seg," is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rojo|first=Misty|date=2014|title=Solitary Torture in Women’s Prisons|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Voluntary ====
Women prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2006-01-01|title=TO BE, ONE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE: Spatio—temporality in Prison Segregation|jstor=23639455|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=587–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary ====
Women prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Women put in segregation ===
In general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaylor, Cassandra. 1998. “It's Like Living in A Black Hole: Women of Color and Solitary Confinement in the Prison Industrial Complex.” ''New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement'' 385:390-420.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Arkles, Gabriel. 2009. "Safety and Solidarity Across Gender Lines: Rethinking Segregation of Transgender People in Detention." Temple ''Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review'' 18(2):515-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Consequences for women ==
Solitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They “experience segregation ''as women''”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
Being put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to [[claustrophobia]], anger, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[hallucinations]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=The Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766384|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=Follow-Up Report on the Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766385|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Fire Inside'' magazine, written by offenders in California women’s prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehorn|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Surviving Solitary|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

All of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===
Women in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in [[sexual harassment]] ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women’s right to the privacy of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is [[sexualization|sexualized]] and humiliating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some prisons, women in segregation wear a "[[Babydoll|baby doll]]," a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Beyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be especially devastating for women whose [[mental state]]s are already deteriorating, due to prior [[mental illness]] or to the effects of being in segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional [[sanitary napkin|sanitary pads]] during their menstrual periods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to ''The Fire Inside'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Separation from children ===
Women are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.

=== Reentry ===
Women who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As one California prisoner who wrote for ''The Fire Inside'' prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Stages of the SHU|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive effects ==
Solitary confinement is also known to have very positive effects on women. For example, ones needs are taken care of as food, shelter and a warm place to sleep are provided for the women. Moreover, a small solitary confinement cell is usually locked by a door or by bars, meaning that they are safe and secure from other violent inmates. Security survellance ensures that a female solitary confinement inmate has the highest welfare standards avaliable to them. Many women begin to love their solitary confinement cell and take comfort in the fact they are being taken care of. &lt;ref&gt;Solitarie en femme, K.Chould p.33-54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in solitary confinement ==
In general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margo|first=Schlanger,|date=2013-01-01|title=Prison Segregation: Symposium Introduction and Preliminary Data on Racial Disparities|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/461/|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5433|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12|website=www.bjs.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Representations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerness|first=Bonnie|last2=Lewey|first2=Jamie Bissonette|date=2014-01-01|title=Race and the Politics of Isolation in U.S. Prisons|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgender inmates in solitary confinement ==
[[Transgender]] or [[gender variance|gender nonconforming]] people are overrepresented in prisons, especially transgender people of color. This could be partly due to the fact that they are disproportionately homeless or living in poverty, conditions which more often lead to incarceration, and because they are targeted by the police and perceived as violent or sexually promiscuous (transgender women in particular). These misconceptions can also be used as reasons that guards place transgender inmates in solitary confinement. The issues that cisgender women face in prisons in general and in solitary confinement in particular can be exacerbated for transgender women, and for transgender men as well. For example, transgender inmates are much more likely to be sexually assaulted than their [[cisgender]] counterparts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Allegedly to protect against this kind of thing, transgender offenders are often put into solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Transgender women are sometimes put in male prisons and then separated from the general prison population and put in “protective custody,” which functions in the same ways as solitary confinement,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and in fact transgender inmates are sometimes put into segregation facilities that have worse conditions than the ones that cisgender inmates are in.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edney|first=Richard|date=2004-11-01|title=TO KEEP ME SAFE FROM HARM? TRANSGENDER PRISONERS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF IMPRISONMENT|url=https://ojs.deakin.edu.au/index.php/dlr/article/view/247|journal=Deakin Law Review|volume=9|issue=2|pages=328–338|issn=1835-9264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to be for their own safety, since most harassment and assault comes from other prisoners. However, this does not prevent the violence perpetrated by prison guards. Further, while transgender women are often put into confinement to keep them from becoming victims of violence, they are sometimes held near inmates who have been put into confinement because of past violent actions, and then experience violence from those inmates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Being in solitary confinement can have consequences for transgender women’s mental and physical health, in particular because transgender people are already more likely to suffer from depression or other mental illness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prisoners, and especially those in solitary confinement, do not always have access to the necessary medications, and transgender people specifically are often denied access to the hormones that they take.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Transgender inmates in some prisons are able to form communities with each other or with cisgender inmates, and these relationships both help prevent violence and help support those who have experienced it. Studies have been reported in which men have bonded together to prevent a transgender woman in their facility from being sexually assaulted, and to help transgender women get access to medication they needed. These groups sometimes commit violent acts to defend or avenge a friend who has been hurt, as in the case in a New York men’s prison when a group of men killed another man who had attacked a young female transgender inmate; however, despite this violence, it is evident that transgender women sometimes form strong and protective bonds with other inmates that are taken away in solitary confinement. In fact, this is sometimes the purpose of segregating inmates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Despite all this, some transgender women, just like some cisgender women, do in fact request to be put into solitary confinement for their own safety. This is not the norm, however, and most women find it to be a painful and harmful experience.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[File:Steven C. Hayes.jpg|thumb|(2007)]]
'''Steven C. Hayes''' (born August 12, 1948){{refn|name=Cloud}} is a [[clinical psychologist]] and Nevada Foundation Professor at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] Department of Psychology, where he runs the leading Ph.D. program in [[Applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]], and coined the term ''[[clinical behavior analysis]]''. He is known for devising a behavior analysis of human language and cognition called [[relational frame theory]], and its clinical application to various psychological difficulties, such as anxiety. Hayes also developed a widely-used and evidence-based procedure often used in counseling called [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), which relies heavily on [[counterconditioning]] techniques, such as [[mindfulness]] (a ''private behavior'' in [[radical behaviorism]]).

==Career==

Hayes has been President of Division 25 of the [[American Psychological Association]], of the American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology, the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy (now known as the [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]]), and the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]. He was the first Secretary-Treasurer of the American Psychological Society (now known as the [[Association for Psychological Science]]), which he helped form. 

Hayes' work is somewhat controversial, particularly with his coined term "relational frame theory" to describe stimulus equivalent research in relation to an elaborate form of B.F. Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' (also referred to as verbal [[operant]]s).{{refn|name=Cloud}} 

An author of 38 books and 550 articles, in 1992 he was listed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] as the 30th "highest impact" psychologist in the world during 1986-1990 based on the citation impact of his writings during that period.

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' columnist John Cloud, "Steven Hayes is at the top of his field. A past president of the distinguished Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, he has written or co-written some 300 peer-reviewed articles and 27 books. Few psychologists are so well published".{{refn|name=Cloud}}

The '''Student Peace Alliance''' is a nonpartisan student action organization advocating peace across the United States of America. Founded at [[Brandeis University]] in the Spring of 2006 by Aaron Voldman and Julia Simon-Mishel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.brandeis.edu/clubs/spa The Brandies Chapter website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Student Peace Alliance is a [[501(c)4]] organization, and has 100 chapters in the United States at high schools, colleges, and community youth organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeacealliance.org/content/section/17/187/. The Peace Alliance Website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
The Student Peace Alliance calls for a U.S. Department of Peace to effectively and efficiently implement policies that would centralize and unify peace building efforts domestically and abroad. With a legislative bill in the U.S. House of representatives (H.R. 808) that currently has 70 co-sponsors, Student Peace Alliance coordinates supportive efforts on a local and national level through various actions including, policy suggestions, research, citizen lobbying efforts, and peaceful non-violent  demonstrations.

Peace of the Pie Action : The annual Mother's Day "Peace of the Pie" National Action Day! On May 11 (the Friday before Mother's Day), members of SPA and [[Peace Alliance]] take pies to their local Congressional offices, letting members of Congress know that "Peace wants a Piece of the Pie, which is 2% of the Federal Defence Budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080602/LIVING/80601012/1004 Burlington Free Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Greater Alliance==
The Greater Alliance, all of which have the goal of promoting peace and policies for peace, consists of the Peace Alliance, Student Peace Alliance, and Global Alliance for Ministries and Departments of Peace. Founded in 2004 by Maryanne Williamson, the Peace Alliance is an organization dedicated to, in coordination with national efforts, raising grassroots awareness in local communities about violence prevention and peace programs in order to influence congressional decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txdop.com/ The Peace Alliance goals]&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2005, and operating in over 30 countries around the world, [[The Global Alliance for Ministries and Departments of Peace]] works on an international level promoting peaceful dialogue between nations through peace summits and global initiatives to establish Departments and Ministries of Peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesinitiativefordepartmentsofpeace.org/ People for the departments of peace.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swarm''' is the name of an open-source [[agent-based model]]ing simulation package, useful for simulating the interaction of [[Intelligent agent|agent]]s (social or biological) and their [[emergence|emergent]] collective behaviour.  Swarm was initially developed at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in the mid-1990s, and since 1999 has been maintained by the non-profit [[Swarm Development Group]].  Also known as the Swarm Simulation System,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm_main_page Swarm]&lt;/ref&gt; it is available for free &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_software_main_page download Software main page downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; and use, covered by the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early development work on Swarm was completed by Chris Langton (SFI), Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (SFI), Manor Askenazi (SFI), Glen Ropella (SFI), Marcus Daniels (SFI), and Alex Lancaster (SFI). Since that time, many hundreds of people around the world have contributed to the continued open source development of the suite of Swarm ABM tools.

== Applications ==

=== Scientific applications===
Agent-based modeling seeks to replicate these complexities and adaptations in computational environments where these interactive [[emergent behavior]]s can be analyzed multi-dimensionally. By defining and assigning agencies reflective of prescribed behaviors, known or estimated, to active software agents in a [[computer simulation]], scientists can approximate experimental results not possible in natural temporal frameworks.

Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms afford scientists the opportunity to conduct and [[Scientific visualization|visualize]] experiments in these synthetic macro and microenvironments for testing scientific theories, natural data sets, and other analyses while free of pressing constraints like time, volume, hazards, or many other parameters.

=== Commercial applications ===
Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include:
* [[supply chain optimization]] and [[logistics]];
* modeling of [[consumer behavior]], including [[word of mouth]] and [[social network]] effects;
* [[distributed computing]];
* [[workforce management]];
* [[traffic management]]; and
* [[Investment management|portfolio management]].
In these and other applications, the system of interest is simulated by capturing the behavior of individual agents and their interconnections. Agent-based modeling tools can be used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the overall, emergent system behavior.

[[File:Auklet flock Shumagins 1986.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A flock of [[auklet]]s exhibit swarm behaviour]]

'''Swarm behaviour''', or '''swarming''', is a [[Collective animal behaviour|collective behaviour]] exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving ''en masse'' or [[Animal migration|migrating]] in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.&lt;ref name=Bouffanais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bouffanais|first1=Roland|title=Design and Control of Swarm Dynamics|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-287-750-5|edition=First|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789812877505}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term, ''swarming'' is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term ''[[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]'' or ''murmuration'' can refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, ''[[herd behaviour|herding]]'' to refer to swarm behaviour in [[tetrapods]], and [[shoaling and schooling|''shoaling'' or ''schooling'']] to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. [[Phytoplankton]] also gather in huge swarms called [[Algal bloom|''blooms'']], although these organisms are [[algae]] and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term “swarm” is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a [[Swarm robotics|robot swarm]], an [[earthquake swarm]], or a swarm of stars.

From a more abstract point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion of a large number of [[Self-propelled particles|self-propelled entities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = O'Loan|author2 = Evans|doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|title = Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking|year = 1998|journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General|volume = 32|issue = 8|pages = L99–L105|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode = 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an [[emergence|emergent]] behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by [[active matter]] physicists as a phenomenon which is not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the [[statistical physics]] of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Swarm behaviour was first simulated on a computer in 1986 with the simulation program [[boids]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reynolds CW | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | isbn = 0-89791-227-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The model was originally designed to mimic the flocking behaviour of birds, but it can be applied also to schooling fish and other swarming entities.

==Models==

{{See also|Collective animal behaviour}}

In recent decades, scientists have turned to modeling swarm behaviour to gain a deeper understanding of the behaviour.

===Mathematical models===
[[File:Metric vs topological distance in schools of fish.png|right|thumb|400px|In the [[metric distance]] model of a [[fish school]] (left), the focal fish (yellow) pays attention to all fish within the small zone of repulsion (red), the zone of alignment (lighter red) and the larger zone of attraction (lightest red). In the [[Topological space|topological distance]] model (right), the focal fish only pays attention to the six or seven closest fish (green), regardless of their distance.]]

Early studies of swarm behaviour employed mathematical models to simulate and understand the behaviour. The simplest mathematical models of animal swarms generally represent individual animals as following three rules:
* Move in the same direction as their neighbours
* Remain close to their neighbours
* Avoid collisions with their neighbours

The [[boids]] computer program, created by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, simulates swarm behaviour following the above rules.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Many subsequent and current models use variations on these rules, often implementing them by means of concentric "zones" around each animal. In the "zone of repulsion", very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbours to avoid collision. Slightly further away, in the "zone of alignment", the focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. In the outermost "zone of attraction", which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seek to move towards a neighbour.

The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of a given animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish rely on both vision and on [[hydrodynamic]] perceptions relayed through their [[lateral line]]s, while Antarctic [[krill]] rely both on vision and hydrodynamic signals relayed through [[antenna (biology)|antennae]].

However recent studies of starling flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are.&lt;ref name="Ballerini et al"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711437105 |vauthors=Ballerini M, Cabibbo N, Candelier R, Cavagna A, Cisbani E, Giardina I, Lecomte V, Orlandi A, Parisi G, Procaccini A, Viale M, Zdravkovic V |title= Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=1232–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18227508 |pmc=2234121|arxiv = 0709.1916 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.1232B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a [[topological]], rather than a metric, rule. It remains to be seen whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high-speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildenbrandt H, Carere C, Hemelrijk CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemelrijk CK, Hildenbrandt H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode=2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index|title=Zwermen en scholen - Swarming - Permanente expo - Bezoek onze expo's &amp; workshops! - Science LinX - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk|title=Onderzoek aan de Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Over ons - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary models===
In order to gain insight into why animals evolve swarming behaviours, scientists have turned to evolutionary models that simulate populations of evolving animals. Typically these studies use a [[genetic algorithm]] to simulate [[evolution]] over many generations. These studies have investigated a number of hypotheses attempting to explain why animals evolve swarming behaviours, such as the [[selfish herd theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Critical Interplay Between Density-dependent Predation and Evolution of the Selfish Herd | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2463372.2463394 | journal = Proceedings of GECCO 2013 | pages = 247–254 | doi = 10.1145/2463372.2463394 | isbn = 9781450319638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ward CR, Gobet F, Kendall G | year = 2001 | title = Evolving collective behavior in an artificial ecology | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=569757 | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–209 | doi = 10.1162/106454601753139005 | pmid=11580880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reluga TC, Viscido S | year = 2005 | title = Simulated evolution of selfish herd behavior | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304005715 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 234 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–225 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.035 | pmid=15757680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wood AJ, Ackland GJ | year = 2007 | title = Evolving the selfish herd: emergence of distinct aggregating strategies in an individual-based model | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1618/1637 | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 274 | issue = 1618 | pages = 1637–1642 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2007.0306 | pmid=17472913 | pmc=2169279}}&lt;/ref&gt; the predator confusion effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Hintze A, Dyer FC, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviour | url = http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/85/20130305 | journal = J.

===Emergence===
{{Main|Emergence}}

The concept of emergence—that the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind [[Self-organization|self-organizing systems]].&lt;ref name="importance-ppt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/wdorsey-88049-hierarchy-life-biology-education-ppt-powerpoint/ |accessdate=6 October 2009 |title=Hierarchy of Life |date=14 September 2008 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]] leading to emergence in the natural world occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scents from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviours and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.

===Stigmergy===
{{Main|Stigmergy}}

The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of each other.&lt;ref name=Marsh2007 /&gt;

===Swarm intelligence===
{{Main|Swarm intelligence}}

[[Swarm intelligence]] is the [[collective behaviour]] of [[decentralization|decentralized]], [[Self-organization|self-organized]] systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on [[artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by [[Gerardo Beni]] and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of [[Cellular automaton|cellular robotic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beni, G., Wang, J. Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems, Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26–30 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm intelligence systems are typically made up of a population of simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] such as [[boids]] interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the [[emergence]] of intelligent global behaviour, unknown to the individual agents.

Swarm intelligence research is multidisciplinary. It can be divided into natural swarm research studying biological systems and artificial swarm research studying human artefacts. There is also a scientific stream attempting to model the swarm systems themselves and understand their underlying mechanisms, and an engineering stream focused on applying the insights developed by the scientific stream to solve practical problems in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dorigo | first1 = M | last2 = Birattari | first2 = M | year = 2007 | title = Swarm intelligence | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Swarm_intelligence | journal = Scholarpedia | volume = 2 | issue = 9| page = 1462 | doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.1462 | bibcode = 2007SchpJ...2.1462D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algorithms===
Swarm algorithms follow a Lagrangian approach or an [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Eulerian]] approach.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li YX, Lukeman R, Edelstein-Keshet L | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Minimal mechanisms for school formation in self-propelled particles | url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~keshet/Papers/YXL_Lukeman_LEK.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 237 | issue = 5| pages = 699–720 | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2007.10.009 |bibcode = 2008PhyD..237..699L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a [[Field (physics)|field]], working with the density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a hydrodynamic approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms.&lt;ref&gt;Toner J and Tu Y (1995) "Long-range order in a two-dimensional xy model: how birds fly together" ''Physical Revue Letters,'' '''75 (23)(1995), 4326–4329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topaz C, Bertozzi A | year = 2004 | title = Swarming patterns in a two-dimensional kinematic model for biological groups | url = | journal = SIAM J Appl Math | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 152–174 | doi = 10.1137/S0036139903437424 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.88.3071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topaz C, Bertozzi A, Lewis M | year = 2006 | title = A nonlocal continuum model for biological aggregation | url = | journal = Bull Math Bio | volume = 68 | issue = 7| pages = 1601–1623 | doi = 10.1007/s11538-006-9088-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an [[agent-based model]] following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm.

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralized coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time.&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995" /&gt; SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buhl J, ((Sumpter DJT)), Couzin D, Hale JJ, Despland E, Miller ER, Simpson SJ | display-authors = etal | year = 2006 | title = From disorder to order in marching locusts | url = http://webscript.princeton.edu/~icouzin/website/wp-content/plugins/bib2html/data/papers/buhl06.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5778| pages = 1402–1406 | doi = 10.1126/science.1125142 | pmid = 16741126 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1402B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarming systems give rise to [[emergent behaviour]]s which occur at many different scales, some of which are both universal and robust.

[[Particle swarm optimization]] is another algorithm widely used to solve problems related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by [[James Kennedy (social psychologist)|Kennedy]] and [[Russell C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the [[Candidate solution|problem space]] through successive generations using [[stochastic optimization]] to find the best solutions. The solutions it finds are called [[Point particle|particles]]. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the [[Maxima and minima|best local value]] obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple [[mathematical formulae|mathematical rules]]. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications.&lt;ref&gt;Hu X [http://www.swarmintelligence.org/tutorials.php Particle swarm optimization: Tutorial].

===Insects===
[[File:Mueckenschwarm 50p 1600kbit.ogv|thumb|right|Swarm of [[nematocera]], flying around a treetop]]

The behaviour of insects that live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, has always been a source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner.&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts&gt;Bonabeau E and Theraulaz G (2008) "Swarm Smarts". In ''Your Future with Robots'' Scientific American Special Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely [[Self-organization|self-organized]]. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts /&gt;

====Ants====
[[File:Ants eating fruit.jpg|thumb|right|A swarm of [[ant]]s which have discovered a food source]]

Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet a colony of ants collectively achieves complex tasks such as constructing nests, taking care of their young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czaczkes|first1=T.J.|last2=Grüter|first2=C.|last3=Ratnieks|first3=F. L. W.|title=Trail pheromones: an integrative view of their role in colony organisation|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=581–599|doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-010814-020627|pmid=25386724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of the best food source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a [[pheromone]] chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beckers|first1=R.|last2=Deneubourg|first2=J. L.|last3=Goss|first3=S|title=Modulation of trail laying in the ant Lasius niger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and its role in the collective selection of a food source|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1993|volume=6|issue=6|pages=751–759|doi=10.1007/BF01201674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for the best food source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source are more likely to be those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=S.|last2=Aron|first2=S.|last3=Deneubourg|first3=J. L.|last4=Pasteels|first4=J.

The successful techniques used by [[ant]] colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems. This area of [[biomimetics]] has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of "foraging trails", fault-tolerant storage and networking algorithms.&lt;ref name="SANdisk"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicke E, Byde A, Cliff D, Layzell P |year=2004 |chapter=An ant-inspired technique for storage area network design |title=Proceedings of Biologically Inspired Approaches to Advanced Information Technology: First International Workshop, BioADIT 2004 LNCS 3141 |pages=364–379 |editor1=A.

====Bees====
[[File:Bee swarm feb08.jpg|thumb|Bees swarming on a shrub]]
{{Main|Bees algorithm|Swarming (honey bee)}}

When a honey bee swarm emerges from a hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a suitable new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the [[waggle dance]] to indicate direction and distance to others in the cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as ''[[Apis dorsata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=BP|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of ''Apis dorsata'' Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=1998|volume=47|pages=94–95|doi=10.1007/s000400050015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.&lt;ref&gt;Milius, Susan [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/43117/title/Swarm_Savvy Swarm Savvy], How bees, ants and other animals avoid dumb collective decisions; Science News, May 9th, 2009; Vol.175 #10 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081003081637.htm Bee Swarms Follow High-speed 'Streaker' Bees To Find A New Nest]; ScienceDaily (Nov. 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = Thomas D. | last2 = Visscher | first2 = P.

====Cockroaches====
Similar to ants, [[cockroach]]es leave chemical trails in their faeces as well as emitting airborne [[pheromones]] for swarming and mating. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches can exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent behaviour]],&lt;ref name="viegas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessdate=10 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704111419/http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which group or swarm behaviour emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and other European institutions created a set of tiny [[robot]]s that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]]. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Locusts====
[[File:Schwarm Wanderheuschrecke.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th century depiction of a swarm of [[desert locust]]s]]
{{see also|Marching locusts}}

''[[Locusts]]'' are the swarming phase of the short-horned [[grasshopper]]s of the family [[Acrididae]]. Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly [[pest (organism)|damaging crops]]. The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2&amp;nbsp;grams) in plants every day. That means one million locusts can eat more than one ton of food each day, and the largest swarms can consume over 100,000 [[tonne]]s each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/locust.html Locust ''Locustidae''] ''National Geographic''. Retrieved 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming in locusts has been found to be associated with increased levels of [[serotonin]] which causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, become mutually attracted, and breed much more easily. Researchers propose that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding and studies have shown that increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs or, in some species, simply encountering other individuals causes an increase in levels of serotonin. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety can be induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7858996.stm|title=Locust swarms 'high' on serotonin|date=29 January 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.00648 |vauthors=Rogers SM, Matheson T, Despland E, Dodgson T, Burrows M, Simpson SJ |date = November 2003|title=Mechanosensory-induced behavioural gregarization in the desert locust ''Schistocerca gregaria'' |journal=J.

An individual locust's response to a loss of alignment in the group appears to increase the randomness of its motion, until an aligned state is again achieved.

====Insect migration====
[[File:Monarch flock.jpg|thumb|Cluster of [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]]. Monarch butterflies migrate to [[Santa Cruz, California]] where they [[overwinter]]]]
{{Main|Insect migration}}
{{see also|Lepidoptera migration}}
[[Insect migration]] is the seasonal movement of [[insect]]s, particularly those by species of [[dragonflies]], [[beetle]]s, [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s. The distance can vary from species to species, but in most cases these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from [[bird migration]].

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates both north and south as the birds do on a regular basis. But no single individual makes the entire round trip. Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Robert Michael, "National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies", p712-713, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, {{ISBN|0-394-51914-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as [[diapause]] and may live seven months or more.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |title=Monarch, Danaus plexippus |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121215095741/http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |archivedate=2012-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of the position of the sun in the sky&lt;ref&gt;Gugliotta, Guy (2003): [http://ipm.osu.edu/trans/053_231.htm Butterflies Guided By Body Clocks, Sun Scientists Shine Light on Monarchs' Pilgrimage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305034410/http://ipm.osu.edu/trans/053_231.htm |date=2006-03-05 }}.

{{See also|Reverse migration (birds)}}

Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sekercioglu, C.H.|year=2007|title=Conservation ecology: area trumps mobility in fragment bird extinctions|journal=Current Biology |volume=17|pages=R283–R286|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.019|pmid=17437705|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]]es than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.

Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it is assumed that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V formation is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long [[Bird migration|migratory]] routes. All the birds except the first fly in the [[upwash]] from one of the [[wingtip vortices]] of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a [[V formation]] save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090521201002/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA401264 Drag Reduction from Formation Flight.

Other animals may use similar drafting techniques when migrating. [[Lobster]]s, for example, migrate in close single-file formation "lobster trains", sometimes for hundreds of miles.

The Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s and storks pass through areas such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Falsterbo]], and the [[Bosphorus]] at migration times. More common species, such as the [[European honey buzzard]], can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the [[Central America]]n migratory bottleneck. This concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the [[passenger pigeon]]. During migration the flocks were a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide and 300 miles (500&amp;nbsp;km) long, taking several days to pass and containing up to a billion birds.

}}

The term "shoal" can be used to describe any group of fish, including mixed-species groups, while "school" is used for more closely knit groups of the same species swimming in a highly synchronised and polarised manner.

Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of capture), enhanced [[foraging]] success, and higher success in finding a mate.&lt;ref name="Pitcher 1993"&gt;Pitcher TJ and Parish JK (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22Behaviour+of+teleost+fishes%22+%22%22Functions+of+shoaling+behaviour+in+teleosts%22%22&amp;num=50&amp;ei=JzYKSpyWM42GkQSM992bBA "Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts"] In: Pitcher TJ (ed) ''Behaviour of teleost fishes''. Chapman and Hall, New York, pp 363–440&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased [[hydrodynamic]] efficiency.&lt;ref name="Hoare et al. 2000"&gt;Hoare DJ, Krause J, Peuhkuri N and Godin JGJ (2000) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119004845/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ''Body size and shoaling in fish''] Journal of Fish Biology, 57(6) 1351-1366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish use many traits to choose shoalmates. Generally they prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognised). The "oddity effect" posits that any shoal member that stands out in appearance will be preferentially targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble them. The oddity effect would thus tend to homogenise shoals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snekser JL, Ruhl N, Bauer K, McRobert SP | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Sex and Phenotype on Shoaling Decisions in Zebrafish | url = http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 23 | issue =  | pages = 70–81 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725190329/http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One puzzling aspect of shoal selection is how a fish can choose to join a shoal of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance. Experiments with [[zebrafish]] have shown that shoal preference is a learned ability, not innate. A zebrafish tends to associate with shoals that resemble shoals in which it was reared, a form of [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engeszer RE, Ryan MJ, Parichy DM | year = 2004 | title = Learned Social Preference in Zebrafish | url = http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/ryan/Publications/2004/2004CurrBiol14%20881.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 10| pages = 881–884 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.042 | pmid = 15186744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open questions of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals are responsible for the direction of shoal movement. In the case of [[fish migration|migratory]] movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of [[golden shiner]] (a kind of [[minnow]]) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1314 |author=Reebs, S.G. |title=Can a minority of informed leaders determine the foraging movements of a fish shoal? |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=403–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10675263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May and July huge numbers of [[sardine]]s spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and then follow a current of cold water northward along the east coast of South Africa. This great migration, called the [[sardine run]], creates spectacular feeding frenzies along the coastline as marine predators, such as dolphins, sharks and gannets attack the schools.

====Krill====

Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Current Biology |year=2006 |volume=16 |pmid=16461267 |issue=3 |pages=83–4 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.044 |title=Satiation gives krill that sinking feeling |author1=Geraint A. Tarling  |author2=Magnus L. Johnson |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;Howard, D.: "[http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1198/chapters/133-140_Krill.pdf Krill]", pp.&amp;nbsp;133–140 in Karl, H.A. et al.

====Copepods====
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|right|This copepod has its antenna spread (click to enlarge). The antenna detects the pressure wave of an approaching fish.]]
{{See also|Hunting copepods}}

[[Copepod]]s are a group of tiny [[crustacean]]s found in the sea and lakes. Many species are [[plankton]]ic (drifting in sea waters), and others are [[benthos|benthic]] (living on the ocean floor). Copepods are typically {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2}} long, with a teardrop shaped body and large [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Although like other crustaceans they have an armoured [[exoskeleton]], they are so small that in most species this thin armour, and the entire body, is almost totally transparent. Copepods have a compound, median single eye, usually bright red, in the centre of the transparent head.

Copepods also swarm. For example, monospecific swarms have been observed regularly around [[coral reef]]s and [[sea grass]], and in lakes. Swarms densities were about one million copepods per cubic metre. Typical swarms were one or two metres in diameter, but some exceeded 30 cubic metres. Copepods need visual contact to keep together, and they disperse at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamner | first1 = WM | last2 = Carleton | first2 = JH | year = 1979 | title = Copepod swarms: Attributes and role in coral reef ecosystems | url = http://72.48.224.78/lo/toc/vol_24/issue_1/0001.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Limnol.

Spring produces [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of swarming [[phytoplankton]] which provide food for copepods. Planktonic copepods are usually the dominant members of the [[zooplankton]], and are in turn major food organisms for many other marine animals. In particular, copepods are prey to [[forage fish]] and [[jellyfish]], both of which can assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. Some copepods have extremely fast [[escape response]]s when a predator is sensed and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres (see animated image below).

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Jelly cc4.jpg|Swarms of [[jellyfish]] also prey on copepods
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Planktonic copepods are important to the [[carbon cycle]]. Some scientists say they form the largest animal [[biomass]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Johannes Dürbaum |author2=Thorsten Künnemann |lastauthoramp=yes |date=November 5, 1997 |title=Biology of Copepods: An Introduction |url=http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |publisher=[[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526164720/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |archivedate=May 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They compete for this title with [[Antarctic krill]]. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the [[secondary productivity]] of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean [[carbon sink]] than [[krill]], and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently believed to be the world's largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of [[greenhouse gas|human carbon emissions]], thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.

====Algal blooms====
Many single-celled organisms called [[phytoplankton]] live in oceans and lakes. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an [[algal bloom]]. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey R and Scott M (2010) [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Phytoplankton/page1.php What are phytoplankton] [[NASA Earth Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOAA_HAB&gt;[http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf Harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616173236/http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} 2009, [[NOAA]], Center of Excellence for Great Lakes and Human Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
Scientists have attributed swarm behavior to plants for hundreds of years. In his 1800 book, ''Phytologia: or, The philosophy of agriculture and gardening'', [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote that plant growth resembled swarms observed elsewhere in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Phytologia.html?id=YggpAAAAYAAJ|title=Phytologia: Or, The Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening. With the Theory of Draining Morasses and with an Improved Construction of the Drill Plough|last=Darwin|first=Erasmus|date=1800-01-01|publisher=P. Byrne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was referring to more broad observations of plant morphology, and was focused on both root and shoot behavior, recent research has supported this claim.

Roots, in particular, display observable swarm behavior, growing in patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and indicate the presence of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, and it is this purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciszak|first=Marzena|last2=Comparini|first2=Diego|last3=Mazzolai|first3=Barbara|last4=Baluska|first4=Frantisek|last5=Arecchi|first5=F.

Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root's apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baluška|first=František|last2=Mancuso|first2=Stefano|last3=Volkmann|first3=Dieter|last4=Barlow|first4=Peter W.|date=2010-07-01|title=Root apex transition zone: a signalling–response nexus in the root|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138510000889|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=15|issue=7|pages=402–408|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forces act to inform any number of growing "main" roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to [[stolon]] growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961862730|title=Plant behaviour and intelligence|last=J.|first=Trewavas, A.|date=2014|publisher=Oxford university press|isbn=9780199539543|oclc=961862730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bacteria====

Swarming is also used to describe groupings of some kinds of [[Bacteria#Predators|bacteria]] such as [[myxobacteria]].

The mathematical modelling of [[flocking behaviour]] is a common technology, and has found uses in animation. Flocking simulations have been used in many films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabbai |first=J.M.E. |title=Complexity and the Aerospace Industry: Understanding Emergence by Relating Structure to Performance using Multi-Agent Systems |year=2005 |publisher=University of Manchester Doctoral Thesis |place=Manchester |url=http://www.gabbai.com/academic/complexity-and-the-aerospace-industry-understanding-emergence-by-relating-structure-to-performance-using-multi-agent-systems/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Crowd simulation|generate crowds]] which move realistically. Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of a group of bats using the [[boids]] system. [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] made use of similar technology, known as [[Massive (software)|massive]], during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

An ant-based computer simulation using only six interaction rules has also been used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore R (2008) [http://computing-reports.open.ac.uk/2008/TR2008-25.pdf "A multi-agent system approach to a simulation study comparing the performance of aircraft boarding using pre-assigned seating and free-for-all strategies"] ''Open University'', Technical report No 2008/25.&lt;/ref&gt; Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by [[Douglas A. Lawson]] uses swarm theory, or [[swarm intelligence]]—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, and it turns out that that's the best solution for the airline," Lawson explains. As a result, the "colony" of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. "We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," says Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm "Planes, Trains and Ant Hills: Computer scientists simulate activity of ants to reduce airline delays"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124132227/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |date=2010-11-24 }} ''Science Daily'', 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herd behaviour]] in [[marketing]] has been used to explain the dependencies of customers' mutual behaviour. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported a recent conference in [[Rome]] on the subject of the simulation of adaptive human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Swarming the shelves: How shops can exploit people's herd mentality to increase sales? | publisher= The Economist | date= 2006-11-11 | page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shared mechanisms to increase impulse buying and get people "to buy more by playing on the herd instinct." The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including [[smart card]] technology and the use of [[RFID|Radio Frequency Identification Tag]] technology. A "swarm-moves" model was introduced by a [[Florida Institute of Technology]] researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can "increase sales without the need to give people discounts."

Partially inspired by [[Colony (biology)|colonies of insects]] such as ants and bees, researchers are modelling the behaviour of [[Swarm robotics|swarms]] of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the [[emergent behaviour]] of the swarm is more complex.&lt;ref name=Bouffanais /&gt; The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a [[superorganism]], exhibiting [[swarm intelligence]].

{{main|Swarming (military)}}

[[Swarming (military)|Military swarming]] is a behaviour where autonomous or partially autonomous units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup. ''Pulsing'', where the units shift the point of attack, is also a part of military swarming. Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization.&lt;ref name=Edwards-2000&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Swarming on the Battlefield: Past, Present, and Future
 | author= Edwards, Sean J.A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically military forces used principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but now active research consciously examines military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.

Merely because multiple units converge on a target, they are not necessarily swarming. Siege operations do not involve swarming, because there is no manoeuvre; there is convergence but on the besieged fortification. Nor do [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla ambushes]] constitute swarms, because they are "hit-and-run". Even though the ambush may have several points of attack on the enemy, the guerillas withdraw when they either have inflicted adequate damage, or when they are endangered.

In 2014 the U. S. [[Office of Naval Research]] released a video showing tests of a swarm of small autonomous drone attack boats that can steer and take coordinated offensive action as a group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/tech/innovation/navy-swarm-boats/ U.S. Navy could 'swarm' foes with robot boats], ''CNN'', 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==

* There is a popular myth that [[lemming]]s commit [[mass suicide]] by swarming off cliffs when they migrate. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit. This fact combined with some unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings gave rise to the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |title=Lemming Suicide Myth Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior |first=Riley |last=Woodford |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103112042/http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Piranha]] have a reputation as fearless fish that swarm in ferocious and predatory packs. However, recent research, which started "with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting", discovered that they were in fact rather fearful fish, like other fish, who schooled for protection from their predators, such as cormorants, caimans and dolphins. A researcher described them as "basically like regular fish with large teeth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/science/24obse.html?_r=1 Red-Bellied Piranha Is Really Yellow] ''New York Times'', 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21445">'''Target costing''' is an approach to determine a product’s [[life-cycle cost]] which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. It involves setting a target cost by subtracting a desired [[profit margin]] from a competitive market price.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A target cost is the maximum amount of cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. Target costing decomposes the target cost from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, target costing spreads the competitive pressure faced by the company to product’s designers and suppliers. Target costing consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting [[Product lifecycle|product life cycle]]. The cardinal rule of target costing is to never exceed the target cost. However, the focus of target costing is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of [[cost reduction]] determined by the target costing process.

== Definition ==
Target costing is defined as "a disciplined process for determining and achieving a full-stream cost at which a proposed product with specified functionality, performance, and quality must be produced in order to generate the desired profitability at the product’s anticipated selling price over a specified period of time in the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifton, Bird, Albano &amp; Townsend|title=Target Costing; Market-Driven Product Design|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-8247-4611-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition encompasses the principal concepts: products should be based on an accurate assessment of the wants and needs of customers in different market segments, and cost targets should be what result after a sustainable profit margin is subtracted from what customers are willing to pay at the time of product introduction and afterwards.

The fundamental objective of target costing is to manage the business to be profitable in a highly competitive marketplace. In effect, target costing is a proactive cost planning, [[cost management]], and [[cost reduction]] practice whereby costs are planned and managed out of a product and business early in the design and development cycle, rather than during the later stages of product development and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maskell &amp; Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|publisher=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Target costing was developed independently in both USA and Japan in different time periods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burrows, G., Chanhall, R.H.|title=Target costing: first and second comings|url=|journal=Accounting History Review |volume=22 |issue=2 |date=July 2012 |pages=127–142|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target costing was adopted earlier by American companies to reduce cost and improve productivity, such as [[Ford Motor]] from 1900s, American Motors from 1950s-1960s. Although the ideas of target costing were also applied by a number of other American companies including [[Boeing]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[Northern Telecom]], few of them apply target costing as comprehensively and intensively as top Japanese companies such as [[Nissan]], [[Toyota]], [[Nippondenso]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=IMA – Institute of Management Accounts|date=1994|title=Implementing Target Costing|url=|publisher=The Society of Management Accounts of Canada|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target costing emerged from Japan from 1960s to early 1970s with the particular effort of Japanese automobile industry, including Toyota and Nissan. It did not receive global attention until late 1980s to 1990s when some authors such as Monden (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Monden, Yasuhiro  |author2=Kazuki Hamada |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1991|title=Target costing and kaizen costing in Japanese automobile companies|url=|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurai (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakurai, Michiharu|date=1989|title=Target costing and how to use it|url=|journal=Journal of Cost Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanaka (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka, Takao|date=1993|title=Target costing at Toyota|url=|journal=Journal of Cost Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cooper (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper, Robin|date=1992|title=Implementing activity based cost management|url=|publisher=The Institute of Management Accountants|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the way that Japanese companies applied target costing to thrive in their business (IMA 1994). With superior implementation systems, Japanese manufacturers are more successful than the American companies in developing target costing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional [[cost-plus pricing]] strategy has been impeding the productivity and profitability for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gagne, M.L.  |author2=Discenza, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1995|title=Target costing|url=|journal=Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=16–22|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hibbets, A.R., Albright, T., and Funk, W.|date=2005|title=The competitive environment and strategy of target costing implementers: evidence from the field|url=|journal=Journal of Managerial Issues |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=65–81|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a new strategy, target costing is replacing traditional cost-plus pricing strategy by maximizing [[customer satisfaction]] by accepted level of quality and functionality while minimizing costs.

== Process of target costing ==
The process of target costing can be divided into three sections: the first section involves in market-driven target costing, which focuses on studying market conditions to identify a product’s allowable cost in order to meet the company’s long-term profit at expected selling price; the second section involves performing cost reduction strategies with the product designer’s effort and creativity to identify the product-level target cost; the third section is component-level target cost which decomposes the production cost to functional and component levels to transmit cost responsibility to suppliers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Target costing process redraw.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Target costing process&lt;/div&gt;]]

=== Market-driven target costing ===
Market driven target costing is the first section in the target costing process which focuses on studying market conditions and determining the company’s [[profit margin]] in order to identify the allowable cost of a product. Market driven costing can go through 5 steps including: establish company’s long-term sales and profit objective; develop the mix of products; identify target selling price for each product; identify profit margin for each product; and calculate allowable cost of each product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Company’s long-term sales and profit objectives are developed from an extensive analysis of relevant information relating to customers, market and products. Only realistic plans are accepted to proceed to the next step. [[Product lining|Product mix]] is designed carefully to ensure that it satisfies many customers, but also does not contain too many products to confuse customers. Company may use simulation to explore the impact of overall profit objective to different product mixes and determine the most feasible product mix. Target selling price, target profit margin and allowable cost are identified for each product. Target selling price need to consider to the expected market condition at the time launching the product. Internal factors such as product’s functionality and profit objective, and external factors such as company’s image or expected price of competitive products will influence target selling price. Company’s long-term profit plan and life-cycle cost are considered when determining target profit margin. Firms might set up target profit margin based on either actual profit margin of previous products or target profit margin of product line. Simulation for overall group profitability can help to make sure achieving group target. Subtracting target profit margin from target selling price results in allowable cost for each product. Allowable cost is the cost that can spend on the product to ensure meeting profit target if selling it at target price. It is the signal about the magnitude of cost saving that team need to achieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Product-level target costing ===
Following the completion of market-driven costing, the next task of the target costing process is product-level target costing. Product-level target costing concentrates on designing products that satisfy the company's customers at the allowable cost. To achieve this goal, product-level target costing is typically divided into three steps as shown below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Product-level target costing redraw.png|thumb|center|upright=2|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Product-level target costing&lt;/div&gt;]]

The first step is to set a product-level target cost. Since the allowable cost is simply obtained from external conditions without considering the design capabilities of the company as well as the realistic cost for manufacturing, it may not be always achievable in practice. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the unachievable allowable cost to an achievable target cost that the cost increase should be reduced with great effort. The second step is to discipline this target cost process, including monitoring the relationship between the target cost and the estimated product cost at any point during the design process, applying the cardinal rule so that the total target costs at the component-level does not exceed the target cost of the product, and allowing exceptions for products violating the cardinal rule. For a product exception to the cardinal rule, two analyses are often performed after the launch of the product. One involves reviewing the design process to find out why the target cost was unachieved. The other is an immediate effort to reduce the excessive cost to ensure that the period of violation is as short as possible. Once the target cost-reduction objective is identified, the product-level target costing comes to the final step, finding ways to achieve it. Engineering methods such as [[value engineering]] (VE), [[DFMA|design for manufacture and assembly]] (DFMA), and [[quality function deployment]] (QFD) are commonly adopted in this step.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Target costing and value engineering ==

[[Value engineering]] (VE), also known as value analysis (VA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=Lawrence|title=Techniques of Value Analysis Engineering|date=March 9, 2015|publisher=Lawrence D. Miles Value Foundation|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays a crucial role in the target costing process, particularly at the product level and the component level. Among the three aforementioned methods in achieving the target cost, VE is the most critical one because not only does it attempt to reduce costs, but also aims to improve the functionality and quality of products. There are a variety of practical VE strategies, including zero-look, first-look and second-look VE approaches, as well as [[Product teardown|teardown]] approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Target Costing and Value Engineering|last=Cooper &amp; Slagmulder|publisher=Productivity Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Portland, OR, USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the complexity of problems in the real world, implementing the target costing process often relies on the [[computer simulation]] to reproduce stochastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=Jurgen|title=Neural networks for cost estimation: Simulations and pilot application|journal=International Journal of Production Research|date=2000|volume=38|issue=6|pages=1231–1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many firms use simulation to study the complex relationship between selling prices and profit margins, the impact of individual product decisions on overall group profitability, the right mix of products to enhance overall profit, or other economic modeling to overcome organizational inertia by getting the most productive reasoning. In addition, simulation helps estimate results rapidly for dynamic process changes.

== Factors affecting target costing ==
The factors influencing the target costing process is broadly categorized based on how a company's strategy for a product's quality, functionality and price change over time. However, some factors play a specific role based on what drives a company's approach to target costing.

=== Factors influencing market-driven costing ===
Intensity of competition and nature of the customer affect market-driven costing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khandwalla|first1=Pradip|title=The Effect of Different Types of Competition on the Use of Management Controls|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|date=Autumn 1972|volume=10|issue=2|pages=275–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors introducing similar products has been shown to drive rival companies to expend energy on implementing target costing systems such as in the case of Toyota and Nissan or [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]]. The costing process is also affected by the level of customer sophistication, changing requirements and the degree to which their future requirements are known. The [[automotive]] and [[camera]] industry are prime examples for how customers affect target costing based on their exact requirements.

=== Factors influencing product-level costing ===
[[Product strategy]] and product characteristics affect product-level target costing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Characteristics of product strategy such as number of products in line, rate of redesign operations and level of innovation are shown to have an effect. Higher number of products has a direct correlation with the benefits of target costing. Frequent redesigns lead to the introduction of new products that have created better benefits to target costing. It has to be noted that the value of historical information reduces with greater innovation, thereby, reducing the benefits of product level target costing.

The degree of complexity of the product, level of investments required and the duration of product development process make up the factors that affect the target costing process based on product characteristics. Product viability is determined by the aforementioned factors. In turn, the target costing process is also modified to suit the different degrees of complexity required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Factors influencing component-level costing ===
Supplier-Base strategy is the main factor that determines component-level target costing because it is known to play a key role in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of [[horizontal integration]], power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. Horizontal integration captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive target costing if the [[buying power]] of firms is high enough. In turn, this may lead to better benefits. More cooperative supplier relations have been shown to increase mutual benefits in terms of target costs particularly at a component level.

== Applications ==
Aside from the application of target costing in the field of manufacturing, target costing are also widely used in the following areas.

=== Energy ===
An Energy Retrofit Loan Analysis Model has been developed using a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo (MC) method]] for target costing in [[Efficient energy use|Energy Efficient]] buildings and construction. MC method has been shown to be effective in determining the impact of financial uncertainties in project performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~tommelein/papers/2012-Lee-PhD.pdf|title=Application of Target Value Design to Energy Efficiency Investments|last=Lee|first=Hyun Woo|date=Spring 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Target Value Design Decision Making Process (TVD-DMP) groups a set of energy efficiency methods at different optimization levels to evaluate costs and uncertainties involved in the energy efficiency process. Some major design parameters are specified using this methods including Facility Operation Schedule, Orientation, [[Plug load]], [[HVAC]] and [[lighting]] systems.

The entire process consists of three phases: initiation, definition and alignment. Initiation stage involves developing a business case for energy efficiency using target value design (TVD) training, organization and compensation. The definition process involves defining and validating the case by tools such as values analysis and bench marking processes to determine the allowable costs. By setting targets and designing the design process to align with those targets, TVD-DMP has been shown to achieve a high level of collaboration needed for energy efficiency investments. This is done by using [[risk analysis]] tools, pull planning and rapid estimating processes.

=== Healthcare ===
Target costing and target value design have applications in building healthcare facilities including critical components such as [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]]s (NICUs). The process is influenced by unit locations, degree of comfort, number of patients per room, type of supply location and access to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybkowski, Shepley|date=Summer 2012|title=Target Value Design: Applications to Newborn Intensive Care Units|url=|journal=Health Environments Research &amp; Design Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[National Vital Statistics System|National Vital Statistics]] Reports, 12.18% of 2009 births were premature and the cost per infant was $51,600. This led to opportunities for NICUs to implement target value design for deciding whether to build a single-family room or more open-bay NICUs. This was achieved using set-based design analysis which challenges the designer to generate multiple alternatives for the same functionality. Designs are evaluated keeping in mind the requirements of the various stakeholders in the NICU including nurses, doctors, family members and administrators. Unlike linear point-based design, set-based design narrows options to the optimal one by eliminating alternatives simultaneously defined by user constraints.

=== Construction ===
About 15% construction project in Japan adopted target costing for their cost planning and management as recognized by Jacomit (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacomit, A.M, Granja. A.D., Picchi, F.A.|date=2008|title=Target costing research analysis: reflections for construction industry implementation|url=|journal=16th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction. Manchester, UK. 16–18 July|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., target costing research has been carried out within the framework of lean construction as target value design (TVD) method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballard, G.|date=2000|title=Lean Project Delivery System|url=|journal=Lean Construction Institute White Paper N8. Revision 1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been disseminated widely over construction industry in recent years. Research has proven that if being applied systematically, TVD can deliver a significant improvement in project performance with average reduction of 15% in comparison with market cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimina, D., Ballard, G., Pasquire, C.|date=2012|title=Target value design: using collaboration and a lean approach to reduce construction cost|url=|journal=Construction Management and Economics |volume=30 |pages=383–398|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
TVD in construction project considers the final cost of project as a design parameter, similar to the capacity and aesthetics requirements for the project. TVD requires the project team to develop a target cost from the beginning. The project team is expected not to design exceeding the target cost without the owner’s approval, and must use different skills to maintain this target cost. In some cases, the cost can increase but the project team must commit to decrease and must try their best to decrease without impacting on other functions of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan, J., Coci, L.|date=2012|title=Recommended Practices for the Application of Lean Construction Methods to Building New Australian LNG Capacity|url=|journal=Engineers Australia. Western Australia Division|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teleological behaviorism''' is a variety of [[behaviorism]]. Like all other forms of [[Behaviorism]] it relies heavily on attention to outwardly observable human behaviors. Similarly to other branches of behaviorism, teleological behaviorism takes into account cognitive processes, like emotions and thoughts, but does not view these as empirical causes of behavior. Teleological behaviorism instead looks at these emotions and thoughts as behaviors themselves. Teleological behaviorism differs from other branches of Behaviorism through its focus on human capacity for self-control and also emphasizes the concept of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The founder of teleological behaviorism is [[Howard Rachlin]], an Emeritus Research Professor of Psychology at the [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]]. Originally focusing his work on operant behavior, he eventually became interested in the concepts of free-will as they applied to [[Behavioral Economics]] and turned his interest to the related field of teleological behaviorism from there. A large influence for Rachlin’s work was Aristotle’s early philosophies on the mind, specifically how “Artistotle’s classification of movements in terms of final rather than efficient causes corresponds to [[B.F. Skinner]]’s conception of an operant as a class of movements with a common end”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mele|1994|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept that Rachlin is referring to is Artistotle’s concept of [[Telos (philosophy)|Telos]], “the final cause” that drives us all forward towards a common end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachlin also found heavy inspiration in the writings and work of Tolman and Bandura after their work in Behaviorism. An example of Artistotle’s concept of Telos could come from the concept of drinking water. While most behaviorists would approach drinking water as a direct reaction to being thirsty, Rachlin would also consider the long-term effects and consider that the person is drinking water so that they do not eventually die of thirst. This far-sighted view offers a different viewpoint into the behaviors of human beings that may not be explained as clearly by operant conditioning, a concept of Behavioral Psychology that mostly focuses upon the short-term reactions that someone has learned. 

On the subject of self-control, Rachlin states that it is less of a subject of knowing that one should not do something and more a matter of patience. He considers those with strong self-control simply more “long-term behaviorally-oriented” or “far-sighted.” This concept of considering further implications in the future is related to many other fields, particularly Rachlin’s second interest of Behavioral Economics. He likens the ability to weight the options of the future to avoiding making short-term poor investments in exchange for profitable, more beneficial ones at a much later point in time. 

Many people{{who|date=April 2012}} criticize Rachlin for his perspective, however, as his concepts of simply considering the potential reactions to certain situations over a longer time frame have been hailed as being closer to a self-help practice of making good investments and life choices than it is close to an actual Psychological practice. His main counter to this argument is that through this approach he has managed to help people by preparing them for potential negative outcomes in the future and trained them to recognize their own potential outcomes behind their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachlin also has a different viewpoint on the subject of [[Free Will]] than most other people. He writes, “the meaning of free will lies not in what may or may not be going on in people’s heads or elsewhere in their bodies, but rather in how the term free will is actually used by the community to describe and to guide overt behavior” {{harv|Rachlin|2007}}. In other words, society’s definitions and expectations are what guide us in terms of what they consider right and wrong as any other external factors do. Our definitions of free-will are contingent upon how much we let them affect our actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3059">'''The Corner House''' is a [[Non-profit organization|not for profit]] [[company limited by guarantee]] founded in 1997 in the [[United Kingdom]]. According to its [[website]], it aims "to support democratic &amp; community movements for environmental &amp; [[social justice]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/about/item.shtml?cmd&amp;#91;402&amp;#93;=x-402-49653|title=About The Corner House|accessdate=2008-04-23|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, The Corner House and the [[Campaign Against Arms Trade]] sought a [[judicial review]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]]'s discontinuation of an investigation by the [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]] into the [[Al-Yamamah_arms_deal|Al Yamamah arms deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7086171.stm|title= BAE inquiry decision challenged|accessdate=2008-04-23|publisher=[[BBC News Online|BBC News website]]|date=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court initially declared the Serious Fraud Office's discontinuation unlawful in April 2008, but this decision was unanimously reversed by the House of Lords in July of the same year.

==Legal analysis==
The principle had already been established in ''[[Leila Khaled|Khalid]]'' that where the Crown had no choice, a prosecution could be dropped in the face of an extreme threat.&lt;ref&gt;Corner House (High Court) at 81-83&lt;/ref&gt; The question was therefore simply whether the Director of the Serious Fraud Office had done 'all that could reasonably be done had been done to resist the threat'.&lt;ref&gt;Corner House (High Court) at 170-1&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008 the [[High Court of Justice]] ruled that the [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]] had acted unlawfully in dropping the investigation for failing to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7339231.stm|title=UK wrong to halt Saudi arms probe|accessdate=2008-04-23|publisher=[[BBC News Online|BBC News website]]|date=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 30 July of the same year, this decision was unanimously reversed by the House of Lords. They overruled both the factual and principled basis of the High Court's decision. As a matter of principle, they ruled the courts could only declare the decision unlawful if it was outside of the Director's power, not merely unreasonable. Factually, they held that his decision was in any case reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;Corner House (House of Lords) Lord Bingham at 40-1 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22124">A '''thermodynamic potential''' (in fact, rather energy&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.4"&gt;ISO/IEC 80000-5, Quantities an units, Part 5 - Thermodynamics, item 5-20.4 Helmholtz energy, Helmholtz function&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.5"&gt;ISO/IEC 80000-5, Quantities an units, Part 5 - Thermodynamics, item 5-20.5, Gibbs energy, Gibbs function&lt;/ref&gt; than potential) is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity used to represent the [[thermodynamic state]] of a [[physical system|system]]. The concept of thermodynamic potentials was introduced by [[Pierre Duhem]] in 1886. [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] in his papers used the term ''fundamental [[function (mathematics)|functions]]''. One main thermodynamic potential that has a physical interpretation is the [[internal energy]] {{mvar|U}}. It is the energy of configuration of a given system of [[conservative force]]s (that is why it is called potential) and only has meaning with respect to a defined set of references (or data). Expressions for all other thermodynamic energy potentials are derivable via [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]]s from an expression for {{mvar|U}}. In [[thermodynamics]], external forces, such as [[gravity]], are typically disregarded when formulating expressions for potentials. For example, while all the [[working fluid]] in a [[steam engine]] may have higher energy due to gravity while sitting on top of [[Mount Everest]] than it would at the bottom of the [[Mariana Trench]], the [[gravitational potential energy]] term in the formula for the internal energy would usually be ignored because ''changes'' in gravitational potential within the engine during operation would be negligible. In a large system under even homogeneous external force, like the earth atmosphere under gravity, the intensive parameters (&lt;math&gt;p, T, \rho&lt;/math&gt;) should be studied locally having even in equilibrium different values in different places far from each other (see thermodynamic models of [[troposphere]]].

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=Potentials}}

== Description and interpretation ==
Five common thermodynamic potentials are:&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1353"&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1353&lt;/ref&gt;
{{table of thermodynamic potentials}}
where {{mvar|T}} = [[temperature]], {{mvar|S}} = [[entropy]], {{mvar|p}} = [[pressure]], {{mvar|V}} = [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]. The Helmholtz free energy is in ISO/IEC standard called Helmholtz energy&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.4"/&gt; or Helmholtz function. It is often denoted by the symbol {{mvar|F}}, but the use of {{mvar|A}} is preferred by [[IUPAC]],&lt;ref&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1376&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO]] and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 80000-5:2007, item 5-20.4&lt;/ref&gt; {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of particles of type {{mvar|i}} in the system and {{mvar|&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[chemical potential]] for an {{mvar|i}}-type particle. For the sake of completeness, the set of all {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also included as natural variables, although they are sometimes ignored.

These five common potentials are all energy potentials, but there are also [[free entropy|entropy potentials]]. The [[thermodynamic square]] can be used as a tool to recall and derive some of the potentials.

Just as in [[mechanics]], where [[potential energy]] is defined as capacity to do work, similarly different potentials have different meanings:
* [[Internal energy]] ({{mvar|U}}) is the capacity to do work plus the capacity to release heat.
* [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.5"/&gt; ({{mvar|G}}) is the capacity to do non-mechanical work.
* [[Enthalpy]] ({{mvar|H}}) is the capacity to do non-mechanical work plus the capacity to release heat.
* [[Helmholtz free energy|Helmholtz energy]]&lt;ref name="ISO 80000-5 20.4"/&gt; ({{mvar|F}}) is the capacity to do mechanical plus non-mechanical work.
From these meanings (which actually apply in specific conditions, e.g. constant pressure, temperature, etc), we can say that {{math|Δ''U''}} is the energy added to the system, {{math|Δ''F''}} is the total work done on it, {{math|Δ''G''}} is the non-mechanical work done on it, and {{math|Δ''H''}} is the sum of non-mechanical work done on the system and the heat given to it.
Thermodynamic potentials are very useful when calculating the [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium results of a chemical reaction]], or when measuring the properties of materials in a chemical reaction. The chemical reactions usually take place under some constraints such as constant pressure and temperature, or constant entropy and volume, and when this is true, there is a corresponding thermodynamic potential that comes into play. Just as in mechanics, the system will tend towards lower values of potential and at equilibrium, under these constraints, the potential will take on an unchanging minimum value. The thermodynamic potentials can also be used to estimate the total amount of energy available from a thermodynamic system under the appropriate constraint.

In particular: (see [[principle of minimum energy]] for a derivation)&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

* When the entropy {{mvar|S}} and "external parameters" (e.g. volume) of a [[closed system]] are held constant, the internal energy {{mvar|U}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium. This follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics and is called the principle of minimum energy. The following three statements are directly derivable from this principle.
* When the temperature {{mvar|T}} and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the Helmholtz free energy {{mvar|F}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.
* When the pressure {{mvar|p}} and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the enthalpy {{mvar|H}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.
* When the temperature {{mvar|T}}, pressure {{mvar|p}} and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the Gibbs free energy {{mvar|G}} decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.

== Natural variables ==
The variables that are held constant in this process are termed the '''natural variables''' of that potential.&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1352"&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1352&lt;/ref&gt; The natural variables are important not only for the above-mentioned reason, but also because if a thermodynamic potential can be determined as a function of its natural variables, all of the thermodynamic properties of the system can be found by taking partial derivatives of that potential with respect to its natural variables and this is true for no other combination of variables. On the converse, if a thermodynamic potential is not given as a function of its natural variables, it will not, in general, yield all of the thermodynamic properties of the system.

Notice that the set of natural variables for the above four potentials are formed from every combination of the {{mvar|T}}-{{mvar|S}} and {{mvar|P}}-{{mvar|V}} variables, excluding any pairs of [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variables]]. There is no reason to ignore the {{math|''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} − {{math|''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} conjugate pairs, and in fact we may define four additional potentials for each species.&lt;ref&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1355&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[IUPAC]] notation in which the brackets contain the natural variables (other than the main four), we have:

{| class="wikitable" style="background: white"
|- 
|'''Formula'''
|'''Natural variables'''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;U[\mu_j]=U-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~S,V,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;F[\mu_j]=U-TS-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~T,V,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;H[\mu_j]=U+pV-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~S,p,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;G[\mu_j]=U+pV-TS-\mu_jN_j&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;~~~~~T,p,\{N_{i\ne j}\},\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If there is only one species, then we are done.  But, if there are, say, two species, then there will be additional potentials such as &lt;math&gt;U[\mu_1,\mu_2] = U-\mu_1 N_1-\mu_2 N_2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. If there are {{mvar|D}} dimensions to the thermodynamic space, then there are {{math|[[power of two|2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;]]}} unique thermodynamic potentials. For the most simple case, a single phase ideal gas, there will be three dimensions, yielding eight thermodynamic potentials.

== The fundamental equations ==
{{main|Fundamental thermodynamic relation}}
The definitions of the thermodynamic potentials may be differentiated and, along with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, a set of differential equations known as the ''fundamental equations'' follow.&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1354"&gt;Alberty (2001) p. 1354&lt;/ref&gt; (Actually they are all expressions of the same fundamental thermodynamic relation, but are expressed in different variables.) By the [[first law of thermodynamics]], any differential change in the internal energy {{mvar|U}} of a system can be written as the sum of heat flowing into the system and work done by the system on the environment, along with any change due to the addition of new particles to the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W+\sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δQ''}} is the [[infinitesimal]] heat flow into the system, and {{math|''δW''}} is the infinitesimal work done by the system, {{mvar|&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[chemical potential]] of particle type {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of type {{mvar|i}} particles. (Note that neither {{math|''δQ''}} nor {{math|''δW''}} are [[exact differential]]s. Small changes in these variables are, therefore, represented with {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/VAR&gt;}} rather than {{math|d}}.)

By the [[second law of thermodynamics]], we can express the internal energy change in terms of state functions and their differentials. In case of reversible changes we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = p\,\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;

where
: {{mvar|T}} is [[temperature]],
: {{mvar|S}} is [[entropy]],
: {{mvar|p}} is [[pressure]],
and {{mvar|V}} is [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], and the equality holds for reversible processes.

This leads to the standard differential form of the internal energy in case of a quasistatic reversible change:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S - p\mathrm{d}V+\sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|S}} and {{mvar|V}} are thermodynamic functions of state, the above relation holds also for arbitrary non-reversible changes. If the system has more external variables than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalizes to:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T \, dS - \sum_i X_i \, dx_{i} + \sum_j \mu_j \, dN_j&lt;/math&gt;

Here the {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[generalized forces]] corresponding to the external variables {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Applying [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]] repeatedly, the following differential relations hold for the four potentials:

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"  style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em"
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||                ||&lt;math&gt;T\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;p\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}F&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;S\,\mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;p\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}H&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||                ||&lt;math&gt;T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;V\mathrm{d}p&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\!\!=&lt;/math&gt;  ||&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;S\,\mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;V\mathrm{d}p&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;+\sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that the infinitesimals on the right-hand side of each of the above equations are of the natural variables of the potential on the left-hand side.
Similar equations can be developed for all of the other thermodynamic potentials of the system. There will be one fundamental equation for each thermodynamic potential, resulting in a total of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;}} fundamental equations.

The differences between the four thermodynamic potentials can be summarized as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(pV) = \mathrm{d}H - \mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}G - \mathrm{d}F &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(TS) = \mathrm{d}U - \mathrm{d}F = \mathrm{d}H - \mathrm{d}G &lt;/math&gt;

== The equations of state ==
We can use the above equations to derive some differential definitions of some thermodynamic parameters. If we define {{math|&amp;Phi;}} to stand for any of the thermodynamic potentials, then the above equations are of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Phi=\sum_i x_i\,\mathrm{d}y_i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are conjugate pairs, and the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the natural variables of the potential {{math|&amp;Phi;}}. From the [[chain rule]] it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;x_j=\left(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y_j}\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ≠ ''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the set of all natural variables of {{math|&amp;Phi;}} except {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} . This yields expressions for various thermodynamic parameters in terms of the derivatives of the potentials with respect to their natural variables. These equations are known as [[equation of state|''equations of state'']] since they specify parameters of the [[thermodynamic state]].&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; If we restrict ourselves to the potentials {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|F}}, {{mvar|H}} and {{mvar|G}}, then we have:

:&lt;math&gt;
+T=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-p=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
+V=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial p}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
-S=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
  =\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
~\mu_j=
\left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial N_j}\right)_{X,Y,\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where, in the last equation, {{mvar|ϕ}} is any of the thermodynamic potentials {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|F}}, {{mvar|H}}, {{mvar|G}} and &lt;math&gt;{X,Y,\{N_{j\ne i}\}}&lt;/math&gt; are the set of natural variables for that potential, excluding {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} . If we use all potentials, then we will have more equations of state such as

:&lt;math&gt;
-N_j=\left(\frac{\partial U[\mu_j]}{\partial \mu_j}\right)_{S,V,\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and so on. In all, there will be {{mvar|D}}&amp;nbsp;equations for each potential, resulting in a total of {{math|''D'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;}} equations of state. If the {{mvar|D}}&amp;nbsp;equations of state for a particular potential are known, then the fundamental equation for that potential can be determined. This means that all thermodynamic information about the system will be known, and that the fundamental equations for any other potential can be found, along with the corresponding equations of state.

== The Maxwell relations ==
{{Main|Maxwell relations}}

Again, define {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be conjugate pairs, and the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be the natural variables of some potential {{math|&amp;Phi;}}.  We may take the "cross differentials" of the state equations,  which obey the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y_j}
\left(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y_k}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne k}\}}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}
=
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}
\left(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y_j}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}
\right)_{\{y_{i\ne k}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

From these we get the [[Maxwell relations]].&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1353"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; There will be {{sfrac|(''D'' − 1)|2}} of them for each potential giving a total of {{sfrac|''D''(''D'' − 1)|2}} equations in all. If we restrict ourselves the {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|F}}, {{mvar|H}}, {{mvar|G}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial S}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial p}\right)_{S,\{N_i\}} =
+\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}} =
+\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial p}\right)_{T,\{N_i\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equations of state involving the chemical potential we get equations such as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial N_j}\right)_{V,S,\{N_{i\ne j}\}} =
\left(\frac{\partial \mu_j}{\partial S}\right)_{V,\{N_i\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and using the other potentials we can get equations such as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial N_j}{\partial V}\right)_{S,\mu_j,\{N_{i\ne j}\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \mu_j}\right)_{S,V\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial N_j}{\partial N_k}\right)_{S,V,\mu_j,\{N_{i\ne j,k}\}} =
-\left(\frac{\partial \mu_k}{\partial \mu_j}\right)_{S,V\{N_{i\ne j}\}}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Euler integrals ==
Again, define {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be conjugate pairs, and the {{mvar|y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be the natural variables of the internal energy.
Since all of the natural variables of the internal energy {{mvar|U}} are [[extensive quantity|extensive quantities]]

:&lt;math&gt;U(\{\alpha y_i\})=\alpha U(\{y_i\})&lt;/math&gt;

it follows from [[Homogeneous function|Euler's homogeneous function theorem]] that the internal energy can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;U(\{y_i\})=\sum_j y_j\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial y_j}\right)_{\{y_{i\ne j}\}}&lt;/math&gt;

From the equations of state, we then have:

:&lt;math&gt;U=TS-pV+\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the expressions for the other main potentials we have:

:&lt;math&gt;F=  -pV+\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H=TS   +\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G=      \sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

As in the above sections, this process can be carried out on all of the other thermodynamic potentials. Note that the Euler integrals are sometimes also referred to as fundamental equations.

== The Gibbs–Duhem relation ==
Deriving the [[Gibbs–Duhem equation]] from basic thermodynamic state equations is straightforward.&lt;ref name="Alberty 2001 p1354"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran &amp; Shapiro, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callen (1985) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Equating any thermodynamic potential definition with its Euler integral expression yields:

:&lt;math&gt;U=TS-PV+\sum_i \mu_i N_i&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating, and using the second law:

:&lt;math&gt;dU=TdS-PdV+\sum_i\mu_i\,dN_i&lt;/math&gt;

yields:

:&lt;math&gt;0=SdT-VdP+\sum_i N_i d\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the Gibbs–Duhem relation. The Gibbs–Duhem is a relationship among the intensive parameters of the system. It follows that for a simple system with {{mvar|I}} components, there will be {{math|''I'' + 1}} independent parameters, or degrees of freedom. For example, a simple system with a single component will have two degrees of freedom, and may be specified by only two parameters, such as pressure and volume for example. The law is named after [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Pierre Duhem]].

== Chemical reactions ==
Changes in these quantities are useful for assessing the degree to which a chemical reaction will proceed. The relevant quantity depends on the reaction conditions, as shown in the following table. {{math|Δ}} denotes the change in the potential and at equilibrium the change will be zero.

{| class="wikitable"
! !! Constant {{mvar|V}} !! Constant {{mvar|p}}
|-
! Constant {{mvar|S}}
| {{math|Δ''U''}} || {{math|Δ''H''}}
|-
! Constant {{mvar|T}}
| {{math|Δ''F''}} || {{math|Δ''G''}}
|}

Most commonly one considers reactions at constant {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|T}}, so the Gibbs free energy is the most useful potential in studies of chemical reactions.

==Views==
After a natural or human-caused disaster, people may be urged to "go beyond thoughts and prayers," by donating blood or sending aid or money to help the victims. After the Las Vegas shooting, authorities said that although thoughts and prayers are appreciated, the most effective way to help was to give blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://qz.com/1092031/las-vegas-shooting-people-are-lining-up-at-blood-banks-to-help-the-victims/|title=Beyond thoughts and prayers: People line up at blood banks to help the victims of the Las Vegas shooting|last=Rigby|first=Sam|date=2 October 2017|work=Quartz|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
As "thoughts and prayers" became associated with post-tragedy condolences, commentators have criticized the phrase as a form of civilian or political [[slacktivism]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Willingham |first=AJ |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/thoughts-and-prayers-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html |title=How 'thoughts and prayers' went from common condolence to cynical meme |publisher=CNN |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2007 [[Virginia Tech shooting]], [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', called on politicians to "move beyond thoughts and prayers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=186561 |title=Beyond Thoughts and Prayers |author=vanden Heuvel, Katrina |date=16 April 2007 |work=The Nation |accessdate=3 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428201334/http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut?pid=186561 |archivedate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her post, vanden Heuvel referred to a press release by [[Paul Helmke]], then-president of the [[Brady Campaign]], who offered his thoughts and prayers but also stated "it is long overdue for us to take some common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://bradycampaign.org:80/media/release.php?release=884 |title=Nation Again Grieves Over A Tragedy "Of Monumental Proportions |author=Helmke, Paul |date=16 April 2007 |publisher=Brady Campaign |accessdate=3 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502133307/http://bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=884 |archivedate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, following the [[Umpqua Community College shooting]], President [[Barack Obama]] said that "thoughts and prayers [do] not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America next week or a couple months from now."{{efn|name=Obamastatement}} The [[White House]] subsequently announced that Obama would continue to take more executive action on the subject of [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/05/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-1052015|title=Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 10/5/2015|work=The White House|date=October 5, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2015, in the wake of the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|San Bernardino mass shooting]], Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (D-CT) tweeted his frustration with the phrase "thoughts and prayers", a sentiment echoed by the cover of the ''New York Daily News'', which included tweets from senators and representatives the newspaper characterized as "meaningless platitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/san-bernardino-chris-murphy-connecticut-tweet/index.html |title=Connecticut senator has had enough of 'thoughts' and 'prayers' |author=Diamond, Jeremy |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]], [[Phil Plait]] wrote that while it was "natural and very human" to "send their thoughts and express their grief ... it's cynically hypocritical when politicians do it ''and nothing else''", later noting it was "particularly galling" to see "all the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]]-funded lawmakers tweeting their 'thoughts and prayers'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2016/06/13/orlando_shooting_we_need_to_do_more_than_send_thoughts_and_prayers.html |title=Orlando: What can you do in the Face of Another Senseless Gun Tragedy |author=Plait, Phil |date=13 June 2016 |work=Slate |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accompanying ''Slate'' post provided a selected list of members of Congress who had tweeted "thoughts and prayers" along with the amount of campaign contributions they had received from gun rights groups, based on research provided by Igor Volsky of the [[Center for American Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/06/12/gop_congressmen_offering_thoughts_and_prayers_for_orlando_accepted_nra_donations.html |title=GOP Congressmen Offer "Thoughts and Prayers."

Some critics of the phrase "thoughts and prayers" point to the [[Epistle of James]] in the Christian [[New Testament]] to argue that action is needed in addition to expressions of faith. Verses commonly cited to back up this argument include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/10/03/why-thoughts-and-prayers-is-starting-to-sound-so-profane/ |title=Acts of Faith: Why ‘thoughts and prayers’ is starting to sound so profane |author=Powers, Kirsten |date=3 October 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/10/las_vegas_mass_shooting.html |title=Opinion: Your thoughts and prayers haven't stopped mass shootings |author=DeBerry, Jarvis |date=2 October 2017 |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans, Louisiana |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|James|2:14–2:16|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Defense===
Laura Coward, a writer for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', defended the use of the phrase "thoughts and prayers", acknowledging the inadequacy of not taking actions, but arguing that prayer "jolts us and disrupts us, removing us from our comfort zones [... it] takes us to uncomfortable places – spiritually, physically and emotionally – and asks us to do the hard work of accepting more than one perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-defense-of-offering-our-thoughts-and-prayers_us_57817fb5e4b0f06648f505d9 |title=In Defense of Offering Our 'Thoughts and Prayers' |author=Coward, Laura |date=9 July 2016 |website=Huffpost |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Ross, a writer for ''[[RedState]]'', asks that victims should "not [be] used as pawns in another political debate about guns" since "[w]e shouldn't blame anyone but the perpetrator for crimes committed, [...] that means we can do nothing on our own – in that moment – apart from submitting thoughts and prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/06/13/thoughts-prayers-always-needed-terror-strikes/ |title="Thoughts And Prayers" Are Always Needed After Terror Strikes |author=Ross, Kimberly |date=13 June 2016 |newspaper=RedState |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
In his third stand up special "Thoughts and Prayers", comedian [[Anthony Jeselnik]] skewers people who tweet out "thoughts and prayers" on the day of a tragedy, calling it a way for those people to garner attention in the face of a tragedy and saying that tweeting thoughts and prayers is so useless that it achieves "less than nothing".&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

In 2016, a web-based video game, ''Thoughts and Prayers: The Game'', was published to argue that thoughts and prayers have had no effect on saving lives in the context of mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/computer-game-shows-just-how-effective-your-thoughts-and-prayers-are.html |title=This Is Not Your Average Shooting Game |author=Kircher, Madison Malone |date=17 June 2016 |work=New York |accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth episode of the fourth season of animated series ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', titled "Thoughts and Prayers", presents a real-life shooting that delays the opening of a new movie featuring gun violence.&lt;ref name=Browbeat-171002 /&gt;

In June 2017, the air date for an episode of ''[[The Carmichael Show]]'' entitled "Shoot-up-able", which showed the main character surviving a mass shooting, was postponed by two weeks so that it did not air 14 June, the same night as the shooting at which Representative Scalise and three others were shot, or the [[San Francisco UPS shooting|UPS shooting in San Francisco]], where three were killed by a shooter who later committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/06/15/nbc_postponed_a_carmichael_show_episode_about_mass_shootings.html |title=NBC Decides It's Too Soon for a ''Carmichael Show'' Episode About Mass Shootings |author=Adams, Sam |date=15 June 2017 |work=Slate |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-reschedules-carmichael-show-mass-shooting-episode-1016464 |title=NBC Reschedules 'Carmichael Show' Mass Shooting Episode |author=Stanhope, Kate |date=26 June 2017 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August 2018, after court documents were made public showing the [[National Rifle Association#Finances|NRA was having financial issues]], mocking tweets were made offering thoughts and prayers for the NRA's troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pitofsky |first1=Marina |title=Twitter users troll NRA for financial woes, calling for 'thoughts and prayers.' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/04/nra-thoughts-and-prayers-twitter/905413002/ |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=USA Today |date=4 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11779">[[Image:Toroidal coordinates.png|thumb|350px|right|Illustration of toroidal coordinates, which are obtained by rotating a two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis separating its two foci.  The foci are located at a distance 1 from the vertical ''z''-axis.  The red sphere is the σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;30° isosurface, the blue torus is the τ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.5 isosurface, and the yellow half-plane is the φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;60° isosurface.  The green half-plane marks the ''x''-''z'' plane, from which φ is measured.  The black point is located at the intersection of the red, blue and yellow isosurfaces, at Cartesian coordinates roughly (0.996,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1.725,&amp;nbsp;1.911).]]

'''Toroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis that separates its two foci.  Thus, the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; in [[bipolar coordinates]] become a ring of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane of the toroidal coordinate system; the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis is the axis of rotation. The focal ring is also known as the reference circle.

==Definition==

The most common definition of toroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; equals the angle &lt;math&gt;F_{1} P F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to opposite sides of the focal ring

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The coordinate ranges are &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;\sigma\le\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\le\phi &lt; 2\pi.&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate surfaces===
[[Image:Apollonian circles.svg|thumb|right|350px|Rotating this two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the vertical axis produces the three-dimensional toroidal coordinate system above.  A circle on the vertical axis becomes the red [[sphere]], whereas a circle on the horizontal axis becomes the blue [[torus]].]]

Surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; correspond to spheres of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( x^{2} + y^{2} \right) +
\left( z - a \cot \sigma \right)^{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{\sin^{2} \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that all pass through the focal ring but are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting tori of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2} +
\left( \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}} - a \coth \tau \right)^{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{\sinh^{2} \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the focal ring. The centers of the constant-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; spheres lie along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, whereas the constant-&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; tori are centered in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane.

===Inverse transformation===

The (σ, τ, φ) coordinates may be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') as follows.  The azimuthal angle φ is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \phi = \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The cylindrical radius ρ of the point P is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and its distances to the foci in the plane defined by φ is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{1}^{2} = (\rho + a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{2}^{2} = (\rho - a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Bipolar coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|Geometric interpretation of the coordinates σ and τ of a point '''P'''.  Observed in the plane of constant azimuthal angle φ, toroidal coordinates are equivalent to [[bipolar coordinates]].  The angle σ is formed by the two foci in this plane and '''P''', whereas τ is the logarithm of the ratio of distances to the foci.  The corresponding circles of constant σ and τ are shown in red and blue, respectively, and meet at right angles (magenta box); they are orthogonal.]]

The coordinate τ equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the focal distances

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the coordinate σ equals the angle between the rays to the foci, which may be determined from the [[law of cosines]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \sigma = -\frac{4a^{2} - d_{1}^{2} - d_{2}^{2}}{2 d_{1} d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the sign of σ is determined by whether the coordinate surface sphere is above or below the ''x''-''y'' plane.

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the toroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = h_\tau = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\phi = \frac{a \sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{a^3 \sinh \tau}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi =
\frac{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^{3}}{a^{2}\sinh \tau} 
&amp; \left[ 
\sinh \tau 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma}
\left( \frac{1}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right) \right. \\[8pt]
&amp; {} \quad + 
\left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}
\left( \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right) + 
\frac{1}{\sinh \tau \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Toroidal harmonics==
===Standard separation ===

The 3-variable [[Laplace equation]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Phi=0&lt;/math&gt;

admits solution via [[separation of variables]] in toroidal coordinates. Making the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi=U\sqrt{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

A separable equation is then obtained. A particular solution obtained by [[separation of variables]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi= \sqrt{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}\,\,S_\nu(\sigma)T_{\mu\nu}(\tau)V_\mu(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

where each function is a linear combination of:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_\nu(\sigma)=e^{i\nu\sigma}\,\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,e^{-i\nu\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
T_{\mu\nu}(\tau)=P_{\nu-1/2}^\mu(\cosh\tau)\,\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,Q_{\nu-1/2}^\mu(\cosh\tau)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
V_\mu(\phi)=e^{i\mu\phi}\,\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,e^{-i\mu\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where P and Q are [[associated Legendre functions]] of the first and second kind. These Legendre functions are often referred to as toroidal harmonics.

Toroidal harmonics have many interesting properties.  If you make a variable substitution &lt;math&gt;z=\cosh\tau&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; then, for instance, with vanishing order &lt;math&gt;\mu=0&lt;/math&gt; (the convention is to not write the order when it vanishes) and &lt;math&gt;\nu=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{-\frac12}(z)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{1+z}}K\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{1+z}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P_{-\frac12}(z)=\frac{2}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2}{1+z}}K \left( \sqrt{\frac{z-1}{z+1}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\!K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,\!E&lt;/math&gt; are the complete [[elliptic integrals]] of the [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the first kind|first]] and [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the second kind|second]] kind respectively.  The rest of the toroidal harmonics can be obtained, for instance, in terms of the complete elliptic integrals, by using recurrence relations for associated Legendre functions.

The classic applications of toroidal coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] for which toroidal coordinates allow a [[separation of variables]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which toroidal coordinates do not allow a separation of variables. Typical examples would be the [[electric potential]] and [[electric field]] of a conducting torus, or in the degenerate case, an electric current-ring (Hulme 1982).

===An alternative separation===
Alternatively, a different substitution may be made (Andrews 2006)

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi=\frac{U}{\sqrt{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\frac{a\sinh\tau}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Again, a separable equation is obtained. A particular solution obtained by [[separation of variables]] is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi= \frac{a}{\sqrt{\rho}}\,\,S_\nu(\sigma)T_{\mu\nu}(\tau)V_\mu(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

where each function is a linear combination of:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_\nu(\sigma)=e^{i\nu\sigma}\,\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,e^{-i\nu\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
T_{\mu\nu}(\tau)=P_{\mu-1/2}^\nu(\coth\tau)\,\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,Q_{\mu-1/2}^\nu(\coth\tau)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
V_\mu(\phi)=e^{i\mu\phi}\,\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,e^{-i\mu\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that although the toroidal harmonics are used again for the ''T''&amp;nbsp; function, the argument is &lt;math&gt;\coth\tau&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\cosh\tau&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; indices are exchanged. This method is useful for situations in which the boundary conditions are independent of the spherical angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, such as the charged ring, an infinite half plane, or two parallel planes. For identities relating the toroidal harmonics with argument hyperbolic
cosine with those of argument hyperbolic cotangent, see the [[Whipple formulae]].

In 2001, Amnesty International released the report "Stopping the Torture Trade."  The term '''torture trade''' refers to the manufacture, marketing, and export of tools commonly used for torture, like restraints and high-voltage electro-shock weapons.

==Global manufacture==
High-voltage electro-shock weapons were first developed in the US in the 1990s.  They include electro-shock batons, stun guns, stun shields, dart-firing stun guns, and stun belts.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; From 1997 to 2000, US companies earned over $13 million exporting stun guns, electro-shock batons and [[optical sight]]ing devices to [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. More than 150 companies worldwide are involved in the manufacturing or marketing of [[torture]] devices, almost half of which are in the [[US]].&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Amnesty International|title=Stopping the Torture Trade|year=2001|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/002/2001/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest electro-shock manufacturers are located in the [[US]], [[mainland China]], [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Companies that produce electro-shock weapons, restraints and sprays say their products are nonlethal if used by security officials with proper training.  Nonetheless, Amnesty International has documented cases of companies selling stun belts to countries who Amnesty International suspects of committing human rights abuses, like [[China]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], without providing training.

The following table includes some of the countries identified by Amnesty International from 1998-2000 as engaged in the manufacture, distribution, supply, or brokerage of stun weapons and restraints.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt;

==Types of devices==
[[Image:Taser-x26.jpg|A Stun Gun making an electrical arc between its two electrodes|thumb|right]]
One type of electro-shock weapon is the remote-controlled [[stun belt]]. Stun belts send 50,000 volt shocks through the victim using electrodes placed near the kidneys. The shock causes incapacitation and severe pain.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt;

Electo-shock weapons are one of the most common tools of torture.  Electro-shock weapons are appealing because they leave no mark, although the physical and psychological effects are crippling.  Shocks are often applied to sensitive areas like the soles of feet or genitals.  Effects include severe pain, loss of muscle control, nausea, convulsions, fainting, and involuntary defecation and urination.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Internationally, electro-shock torture is used on children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable populations.

==Opposition campaign==
[[Amnesty International]] has asked companies worldwide to stop the manufacture, marketing, and trade of electro-shock and restraint devices; governments to ban the trade of torture devices; and individuals to write local government representatives and companies asking them to take these steps.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; The Amnesty International campaign focuses on the trade of [[restraints]], [[pepper spray]]s&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;According to [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/002/2001/en/ Amnesty International], chemical spray was used in large quantities to quell a protest in Lusaka, Zambia in July 1997 and the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle. Amnesty International reported that it had been manufactured by the UK company Pains-Wessex. Subsequently, Amnesty called for an export ban when the receiving regime is either not fully trained in the use of chemical spray, or had shown usage "contrary to the manufacturer’s instructions".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electroshock weapons]].&lt;ref name=AI/&gt;&lt;ref name=AI2&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Amnesty International|title=Continuing concerns about taser use|date=26 March 2006|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/030/2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
In the [[European Union]], Regulation No. 1236/2005, in effect since 2006, prohibits trade in goods which have no practical use other than torture, and requires licences for the export of goods which could have a use in torture as well as other legitimate uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summaries of EU Legislation. Ban on trade in instruments of torture.|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/external_trade/r12535_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say the regulation contains too many loopholes to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Wright|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=EU to Ban Torture Technology|date=13 March 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/mar/13/research.science1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A proposal for amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 was put forward by the [[European Commission]] on 14 January 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:a9b0d53e-7e18-11e3-b889-01aa75ed71a1.0002.05/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]&lt;/ref&gt; and approved by the [[European Parliament]] on 30 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Council of the EU, [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/06/30-torture-goods/ Torture Goods: Council confirms agreement with EP], 30 June 2016, accessed 7 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The new regulation will ban the brokering of equipment which is subject to a ban and the supply of technical assistance regarding the supply of banned goods.

The US has also made regulatory changes to limit torture trade. The [[Department of Commerce]] created a separate export commodity code for electro-shock devices to make it easier to track them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|title=Revisions to the Commerce Control List To Update and Clarify Crime Control License Requirements|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-08-11/html/E9-19099.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; All companies are now required to have export licenses, although there are still many loopholes. US companies can use [[drop shipping]] or paying an intermediary country with loose regulations to export banned goods to the importing country. In 1997, one US company was caught exporting electro-shock guns and pepper spray without a license by mislabeling them as “Fountain pens, Keychains, Child Sound device, [and] Electrical voltage units.”&lt;ref name=AI/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">'''Transtextuality''' is defined as the "textual transcendence of the [[Text (literary theory)|text]]".  According to [[Gérard Genette]] transtextuality is "all that sets the text in relationship, whether obvious or concealed, with other texts" and it "covers all aspects of a particular text".&lt;ref name=Sprog&gt;
Genette, Gérard. The architext: an introduction. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992: 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;Genette described transtextuality as a "more inclusive term" than [[intertextuality]].&lt;ref name=Aber&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem09.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Literatura&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:DiqcS2irWZ8J:www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/49-5/str17.pdf+transtextuality&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgCxuUyOfM1Gr8ooQzawNPApLXCmWOVcsXUhZ_1IUB2EqkhccBeiz87cZGuEtKLkM4X43uMnnn5ngrnoq0EyhYvi8QSLFIGb7QjmCCLrKpSH_PLoxNRdSKdjkj6xiViYoeiEVIY&amp;sig=AHIEtbS5uv1WprtZ1QYdvHZIJi3CToJOrA ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subtypes==
Genette provided five subtypes of transtextuality, namely: intertextuality, [[paratextuality]], [[architextuality]], [[metatextuality]], and [[hypertextuality]] (also known as [[hypotextuality]]).&lt;ref name=Aber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Literatura/&gt;

===Description===
The following are the descriptions for the five subtypes of transtextuality:

*Intertextuality could be in the form of quotation, plagiarism, or allusion.
*Paratextuality is the relation between one text and its paratext that surrounds the main body of the text. Examples are titles, headings, and prefaces.
*Architextuality is the designation of a text as a part of a genre or genres
*Metatextuality is the explicit or implicit critical commentary of one text on another text
*Hypotextuality or hypertextuality is the relation between a text and a preceding hypotext; wherein the text or genre on which it is based but which it transforms, modifies, elaborates or extends. Examples are parody, spoof, sequel, and translation.  In information technology, hypertextuality is a text that takes the reader directly to other texts.&lt;ref name=Aber/&gt;

An '''upset''' occurs in a [[competition]], frequently in [[Election|electoral]] [[politics]] or [[sports]], when the party popularly expected to win (the favorite), either loses to or draws/ties a game with an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] whom the majority expects to lose, defying the [[conventional wisdom]].

The meaning of the word has sometimes been erroneously attributed to the surprising defeat of the horse [[Man o' War]] by the horse [[Upset (horse)|Upset]] (the loss was the only one in Man o' War's career); the term pre-dates that 1919 race by at least several decades. In its sports coverage immediately following Upset's victory, ''[[the Washington Post]]'' wrote, "One might make all sorts of puns about it being an upset."

==Origin==
In 2002, George Thompson, a lexicographic researcher, used the full-text online search capabilities of ''[[the New York Times]]'' databases to trace the usage of the verb ''to upset'' &lt;!-- adjective? --&gt; and the noun ''upset''. The latter was seen in usage as early as 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/upset "Upset"] at Wordorigins.org.  Retrieved April 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson's research debunked one popular theory of the term's origin, namely that it was first used after the Thoroughbred racehorse Upset became the only horse to defeat [[Man o' War]] in 1919.

The meaning of the word "upset" has long included "an overthrowing or overturn of ideas, plans, etc." (see [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] definition 6b), from which the sports definition almost surely derived. "Upset" also once referred to "a curved part of a bridle-bit, fitting over the tongue of the horse", (now the port of a [[curb bit]]) and though the modern sports meaning of "upset" was first used far more for horse races than for any other competition, there is no evidence of a connection. The name of the horse "Upset" came from the "trouble" or "distress" meaning of word (as shown by the parallelism of the name of Upset's stablemate, [[Regret (horse)|Regret]]).

'''Victimisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''victimization''') is the process of being victimised or becoming a [[wikt:victim|victim]]. The field that studies the process, rates, incidence, effects, and prevalence of victimisation is called [[victimology]].

==Peer victimisation==
{{Main|Peer victimisation}}
Peer victimisation is the experience among children of being a target of the [[aggressive]] behaviour of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates.&lt;ref name=twenty&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hawker D.S.J. |author2=Boulton M.J. | year = 2000 | title = Twenty years' research on peer victimisation and psychosocial maladjustment: a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 441–455 | doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary Victimization==
===Prevalence===
Secondary victimization (also known as post crime victimization &lt;ref&gt; "post-crime victimization or secondary victimization". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  or double victimization &lt;ref&gt;Doerner, William (2012). Victimology. Burlington, MA: Elseiver, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-4377-3486-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to further victim-blaming from criminal justice authorities following a report of an original victimization. &lt;ref&gt; "post-crime victimization or secondary victimization". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of victimization are high, with an estimated 5.7 million individuals experiencing at least one victimization in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Justice Statistics. (2016). Criminal victimization. U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these are cases of criminal offenses, the reported rates of violent victimization are disproportionately low. Less than half (42%) report any violent crime of threatened or real force, such as physical assault, battery, or weapons offenses. Additionally, under a quarter (23%) report rape, childhood, or sexual assault to the police. Further, out of the portion that does report sexual assault or rape, about half describe the experience as upsetting, frustrating, and useless.&lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Monroe, L.M., Kinney, L.M., Weist, M.D. (2005). The experience of sexual assault: Findings from a statewide victim needs assessment. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, 767-776.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to increase criminal reports of victimization, authorities and law enforcement personnel often discount individuals’ violent experiences and fail to attend to both the necessary legal actions and interpersonal actions. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability===
When institutions or criminal justice system personnel fail to support the victimized individual, victims are vulnerable to secondary victimization. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (1999). Secondary victimization of rape victims: Insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence. Violence and Victims, 14, 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; While the appropriate and legal way to respond to primary victimization is to report the event, authorities often deny, do not believe, or blame the victim (Campbell &amp; Raja, 1999; Campbell &amp; Raja, 2005). In turn, up to 90% of victims report experiencing negative social reaction and attribute the incident as a “second rape” or “second assault” &lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Research suggests that victim of sexual violence or assault are the least likely to receive support or resources following reporting. &lt;ref&gt;Filipas, H. &amp; Ullman, S.E. (2001). Social reactions to sexual assault victims from various support groups. Violence and Victims, 6, 673-92. &lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to perceived lack of evidence, social stigma, and overall discomfort when dealing with sexual incidences. In a study of rape victims undergoing prosecution for their assault, those who felt their detectives responded empathetically and with understanding were likelier to pursue prosecution, felt their experiences were important, and their cases deserved to be heard. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Empathetic and supportive responses from authorities could potentially improve mental and physical health in rape survivors and additionally, improve reporting rates and lessen judgmental attitudes from the criminal justice system. Because sexual violence is a sensitive subject for all parties, criminal justice personnel may avoid, ignore, or publicly misconstrue their opinions about the situation as an effort to separate themselves or cope with dangerous and uncomfortable situations. Studies suggest these misconceptions by the system may further damage individuals’ mental health and a safer world. &lt;ref&gt;Mendonca, R.D., Gouveia-Pereira, M., &amp; Miranda, M. (2016). Belief in a just world and secondary victimization: The role of adolescent deviant behavior. Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 82-87. &lt;/ref&gt; This could be combatted with accepting, non-accusatory perspectives, aiding in accuracy the sexual violence reports. Several authors speculate authorities’ supportive approach benefits the victim and promotes a just world. &lt;ref&gt;Mendonca, R.D., Gouveia-Pereira, M., &amp; Miranda, M. (2016). Belief in a just world and secondary victimization: The role of adolescent deviant behavior. Personality and Individual Differences, 97, 82-87. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stromwall, L.A., Alfredsson, H., &amp; Landstrom, S. (2013). Blame attributions and rape: Effects of belief in a just world and relationship level. Legal and Criminological Psychology, 18, 254-261. &lt;/ref&gt; In this way, previous victims might report and seek appropriate resources in the future.

Those exposed to traumatic victimization are vulnerable to experiencing secondary victimization. If social needs such as empathy, support, and understanding are not met, individuals are prone to this phenomenon. While anybody who has experienced victimization is susceptible to secondary victimization, prevalence rates are significantly elevated for some populations. This includes females, children, racial and sexual minorities, and those sexually assaulted by an acquaintance or stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M.A., Valentine, S.E., Woodward, E.N., &amp; Pantalone, D.W. (2017). Secondary victimization of sexual minority men following disclosure of sexual assault: ‘Victimizing me all over again…’. Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy, 14, 275-288. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, those experiencing a certain type of violence are at increased likelihood to experience secondary victimization. These include physical assault, sexual assault, and domestic violence &lt;ref&gt;Laing, L. (2017). Secondary victimization: Domestic violence survivors navigating the family law system. Violence Against Women, 23, 1314-1335. &lt;/ref&gt; Notably, rape victims are at highest risk of secondary victimization from the criminal justice system, with about half who report describing the process as distressing. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (1999). Secondary victimization of rape victims: Insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence. Violence and Victims, 14, 261-275.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12083-000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting Victimization===
As a consequence of social rejections and insensitivities to acknowledging trauma or violence, individuals are increasingly apt to continue not reporting. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt; This can be detrimental to victims’ mental health, as sexual violence often happens more than once and not reporting violence helps to maintain a repeated cycle of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, E.R., Menon, S.V., Bystrynski, J., &amp; Allen, N.E. (2017). Sexual assault victimization and pathology: A review and meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 56, 65-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing violence is associated with negative mental and physical outcomes, including shame, emotion dysregulation, psychological stress, loss of resources, and mental health pathology. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women’s mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis about sexual assault victimization and psychopathology, there was a medium-sized effect overall effect size was moderate after accounting for several mental health diagnoses including depression, anxiety, suicidality, disordered eating, and substance abuse. &lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, E.R., Menon, S.V., Bystrynski, J., &amp; Allen, N.E. (2017). Sexual assault victimization and pathology: A review and meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 56, 65-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that sexual assault victimization is significantly related to mental health distress even after controlling for other associated symptoms. Additionally, women who experience secondary victimization are likelier to have both adverse physical health and mental health implications and are also unlikely to seek services and treatment. &lt;ref&gt;Monroe, L.M., Kinney, L.M., Weist, M.D. (2005). The experience of sexual assault: Findings from a statewide victim needs assessment. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, 767-776.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; Given these individuals are likely in a troubled state, pressures of reporting are cognitively taxing. To report crime, especially sexual crimes, implicates a further level of vulnerability. When victims are met with hostile reactions, they are reinforced to not report. This is not only harmful to the individual, but to society, in that perpetrators are thus permitted to continue committing crimes and abuse. As a consequence of victim-blaming and other negative attitudes towards victims, reported rates of criminal abuse are low and distress in victims is high. &lt;ref&gt;Orth, U. (2002). Secondary victimization of crime victims by criminal proceedings. Social Justice Research, 15, 313-325. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with Criminal Justice System===
Despite high rates of secondary victimization, reporting rates are low. It is not unusual for criminal justice personnel to discourage victims from prosecuting their sexual assault cases due to victim-blaming behaviors and discounting victims’ traumatic experiences. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Wasco, S.M., Ahrens, C.E., Sefl, T., &amp; Barnes, H.E. (2001). Preventing the “Second Rape”: Rape survivors’ experiences with community service providers. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 12, 1239-1259. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12083-000&lt;/ref&gt; One incident that attracts much controversy in the criminal justice system is reporting violent crimes on one’s intimate partner. Women who report rape by an intimate partner are seen as less credible by the system and law enforcement are more likely to encourage dropping the case. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal standards of obeying an intimate partner and thus encompassing rape culture are prevalent in the criminal justice system. &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. (2010). The linkage between secondary victimization by law enforcement and rape case outcomes. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26, 328-347.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is a legal crime that is being reported, victims are often turned away feeling alienated, hopeless, and unworthy and have limited options for resources beyond the system. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women’s mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragmented Memory===
A possible explanation of why the criminal justice system is unlikely to believe many victims is due to victims’ fragmented memory. It is not uncommon for victims of sexual abuse to also have a traumatic brain injury or other neurobiological reactions due to assault. &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R., Dworkin, E., &amp; Cabral, G. (2009). An ecological model of the impact of sexual assault on women’s mental health. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse, 10, 225-246. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. &amp; Raja, S. (2005). The sexual assault and secondary victimization of female veterans: Help-seeking experiences with military and civilian social systems. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 97-106. &lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Campbell explains how molecular changes occur in response to trauma, and how this can influence discrepancies in victims’ reports and recollections of the event. After a traumatic incident, chemical alterations in the brain change, impacting encoding and processing the memory &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Not only do neurobiological changes affect victims’ memories, but emotion dysregulation, repression, suppression, dissociation, and avoidance of the event are also common reactions in victims &lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, E., Clark, D.M., &amp; Ehlers, A. (2001). A prospective investigation of the role of cognitive factors in persistent Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after physical or sexual assault. Behavior Research and Therapy, 39, 1063-1084. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ehlers, A., &amp; Clark, D. M. (2000). A cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 38, 319–345. doi:10.1016/s0005-7967(99)00123-0&lt;/ref&gt; These cognitive and neurobiological factors are rarely considered when a victim reports an assault. &lt;ref&gt;Venema, R.M. (2016). Police officer schema of sexual assault reports. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 31, 872-899. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. &lt;/ref&gt;. During the time law enforcement personnel gather information about the event, they could be met with victims explaining their stories inconsistently due to a fragmented memory. Either by a neurobiological change or psychological response to particularly distressing trauma, victims may fall prey to the inability to coherently portray details of the event, thus taking away credibility and facilitating secondary victimization. &lt;ref&gt;Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revictimisation==
The term '''revictimisation''' refers to a pattern wherein the victim of abuse and/or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimised again, either shortly thereafter&lt;ref name="Finkelhor-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Finkelhor | first1 = D. | last2 = Ormrod | first2 = RK. | last3 = Turner | first3 = HA. | title = Re-victimization patterns in a national longitudinal sample of children and youth | journal = Child Abuse Negl | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–502 |date=May 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.03.012 | pmid = 17537508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child.  This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Assault Revictimization |journal=Research &amp; Advocacy Digest |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=1 |first=Janet|last=Anderson|publisher=The Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messman&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0272-7358(96)00019-0|title=Child Sexual Abuse and its Relationship to Revictimization in Adult Women|author1=Messman Terri L. |author2=Long Patricia J. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397–420|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While an exact percentage is almost impossible to obtain, samples from many studies suggest the rate of revictimisation for people with histories of sexual abuse is very high.  The vulnerability to victimisation experienced as an adult is also not limited to sexual assault, and may include [[Domestic violence|physical abuse]] as well.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Reasons as to why revictimisation occurs vary by event type, and some mechanisms are unknown.  Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors.  Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Revictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex.  Multiple theories exist as to how this functions.  Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of [[Learning theory (education)|learning]]; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood.  The victim believes that abusive behaviour is "normal" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve, it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships.  Another theory draws on the principle of [[learned helplessness]].  As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver.&lt;ref name=messman/&gt;  One theory goes that this state of being unable to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight back or flee]] the danger leaves the last primitive option:  freeze, an offshoot of [[Apparent death|death-feigning]].

== Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims ==

In adulthood, the freeze response can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wheeler S. |author2=Book A.S. |author3=Costello K. | year = 2009 | title = Psychopathic traits and perceptions of victim vulnerability | url = | journal = Criminal Justice and Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 635–648 | doi=10.1177/0093854809333958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often [[make excuses]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimise]] what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities.

==Self-victimisation==
{{Main|Victim playing}}
Self-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such to justify abuse of others, to manipulate others, a [[coping strategy]] or [[attention seeking]].

==Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality)==
{{Main|Victim mentality}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates of victimisation in United States==
Levels of criminal activity are measured through three major data sources: the [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR), self-report surveys of criminal offenders, and the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS). However, the UCR and self-report surveys generally report details regarding the offender and the criminal offense; information on the victim is only included so far as his/her relationship to the offender, and perhaps a superficial overview of his/her injuries. The NCVS is a tool used to measure the existence of actual, rather than only those reported, crimes—the victimisation rate&lt;ref name="NCVS"&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm National Crime Victimization Survey Official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;—by asking individuals about incidents in which they may have been victimised. The National Crime Victimization Survey is the [[United States]]' primary source of information on crime victimisation.

Each year, data is obtained from a nationally represented sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimisation in the United States.  This survey enables the (government) to estimate the likelihood of victimisation by [[Rape]] (more valid estimates were calculated after the surveys redesign in 1992 that better tapped instances of sexual assault, particularly of [[Date rape]]),&lt;ref name=Doerner&gt;{{cite book|last=Doerner|first=William|title=Victimology|year=2012|publisher=Elseiver, Inc.|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-1-4377-3486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robbery]], [[assault]], [[theft]], household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS), the NCVS reveals that, from 1994 to 2005, violent crime rates have declined, reaching the lowest levels ever recorded.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; Property crimes continue to decline.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt;

In 2010, the [[National Institute of Justice]] reported that American adolescents were the age group most likely to be victims of violent crime, while American men were more likely than American women to be victims of violent crime, and blacks were more likely than Americans of other races to be victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name="NIJ2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/victims-victimization/welcome.htm | title=Victims and Victimization | date=20 September 2010 | accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In employment law==
Victimisation is a concept in [[employment law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= This section provides general information on employment law in the UK|publisher=UK Film Council|year=2009|url= http://www.diversitytoolkit.org.uk/workinginfilm/employmentlaw/discriminationlaw/harassment/|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wave power''' is the capture of energy of [[wind wave]]s to do useful [[mechanical work|work]] – for example, [[electricity generation]], [[water desalination]], or [[pump]]ing water. A machine that exploits wave [[power (physics)|power]] is a '''wave energy converter''' (WEC).

Wave power is distinct from [[tidal power]], which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Waves and tides are also distinct from [[ocean currents]] which are caused by other forces including [[wave breaking|breaking waves]], [[wind]], the [[Coriolis effect]], [[cabbeling]], and differences in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]].

Wave-power generation is not a widely employed commercial technology, although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidelands.org/wave-tidal3.php|title=Wave and Tidal Energy Experiments in San Francisco and Santa Cruz|author=Christine Miller|accessdate=2008-08-16|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the world's first commercial Wave Power Device, the [[Islay LIMPET]] was installed on the coast of [[Islay]] in Scotland and connected to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edie.net/news/0/Worlds-first-commercial-wave-power-station-activated-in-Scotland/3492/&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator [[wave farm]] was opened in Portugal at the [[Aguçadoura Wave Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Joao Lima.

Waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves, there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves. Both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave [[crest (physics)|crest]], as well as friction on the water surface by the wind, making the water to go into the [[shear stress]] causes the growth of the waves.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

[[Wave height]] is determined by wind speed, the duration of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the depth and topography of the seafloor (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves. When this limit has been reached the sea is said to be "fully developed".

In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed, [[wavelength]], and water [[density]].

[[Ocean surface wave#Science of waves|Oscillatory motion]] is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for [[standing waves]] ([[clapotis]]) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing [[microseism]]s.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book| first=O.M. | last=Phillips | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1977 | edition=2nd | isbn=0-521-29801-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power.

The waves propagate on the ocean surface, and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the [[group velocity]]. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is called the wave energy [[flux]] (or wave power, which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device).

=== Wave power formula ===

In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the [[wavelength]], the wave [[energy flux]] is&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The energy flux is &lt;math&gt;P = \tfrac{1}{16} \rho g H_{m0}^2 c_g,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c_g&lt;/math&gt; the group velocity, see {{Cite book

    \approx \left(0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} \right) H_{m0}^2\; T_e,
&lt;/math&gt;

with ''P'' the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''m0''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[significant wave height]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; the wave energy [[period (physics)|period]], ''ρ'' the water [[density]] and ''g'' the [[Earth's gravity|acceleration by gravity]]. The above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the wave height. When the significant wave height is given in metres, and the wave period in seconds, the result is the wave power in kilowatts (kW) per metre of [[wavefront]] length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Waves in ocean engineering|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=0080435661|pages=35–36|author=Tucker, M.J.|edition=1st|author2=Pitt, E.G. |editor=Bhattacharyya, R. |editor2=McCormick, M.E.|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/wave%20power.htm|title=Wave Power|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wave Energy Potential on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711052514/http://ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/24110728/10 Academic Study: Matching Renewable Electricity Generation with Demand: Full Report].

Example: Consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline,  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds. Using the formula to solve for power, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
  P \approx 0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} (3 \cdot \text{m})^2 (8 \cdot \text{s}) \approx 36 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}},
&lt;/math&gt;

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.

In major storms, the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7&amp;nbsp;MW of power across each metre of wavefront.

An effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux. As a result, the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device.

=== Wave energy and wave-energy flux ===

In a [[sea state]], the average(mean) [[energy density]] per unit area of [[gravity wave]]s on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;{{cite book | first=Y. | last=Goda | title=Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures | year=2000 | publisher=World Scientific | isbn=978-981-02-3256-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{16}\rho g H_{m0}^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Here, the factor for random waves is {{frac|1|16}}, as opposed to {{frac|1|8}} for periodic waves – as explained hereafter. For a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \eta=a\,\cos\, 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with wave amplitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\,&lt;/math&gt; the wave energy density per unit horizontal area is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{2}\rho g a^2,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{8}\rho g H^2&lt;/math&gt; using the wave height &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H\,=\,2\,a\,&lt;/math&gt; for sinusoidal waves. In terms of the variance of the surface elevation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0=\sigma_\eta^2=\overline{(\eta-\bar\eta)^2}=\frac{1}{2}a^2,&lt;/math&gt; the energy density is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\rho g m_0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Turning to random waves, the last formulation of the wave energy equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is also valid (Holthuijsen, 2007, p. 40), due to [[Parseval's theorem]]. Further, the [[significant wave height]] is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_{m0}=4\sqrt{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to the factor {{frac|1|16}} in the wave energy density per unit horizontal area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

where ''E'' is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the sum of [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy,&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; both contributing half to the wave energy density ''E'', as can be expected from the [[Equipartition theorem#Potential energy and harmonic oscillators|equipartition theorem]]. In ocean waves, surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few [[decimetre]]s.

As the waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is the [[group velocity]]. As a result, the wave energy [[flux]], through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reynolds |first=O. | authorlink=Osborne Reynolds | year=1877 |title=On the rate of progression of groups of waves and the rate at which energy is transmitted by waves | journal=Nature | volume=16 | pages=343–44 | doi = 10.1038/016341c0 |bibcode = 1877Natur..16R.341. }}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal | title=On progressive waves | author=Lord Rayleigh (J.

with ''c&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' the group velocity (m/s).
Due to the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]] for water waves under the action of gravity, the group velocity depends on the wavelength ''λ'', or equivalently, on the wave [[period (physics)|period]] ''T''. Further, the dispersion relation is a function of the water depth ''h''. As a result, the group velocity behaves differently in the limits of deep and shallow water, and at intermediate depths:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda/&gt;

=== Deep-water characteristics and opportunities ===

Deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength, which is the common situation in the sea and ocean. In deep water, longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster. The deep-water group velocity is half the [[phase velocity]]. In [[waves and shallow water|shallow water]], for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth, as found quite often near the coast, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity.&lt;ref name=Dean_Dalrymple&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists |author1=R.

== History ==

The first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799, and was filed in Paris by [[Pierre-Simon Girard|Girard]] and his son.&lt;ref name=cle2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clément|year=2002 |title=Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=405–431 |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00009-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to light and power his house at [[Royan]], near [[Bordeaux]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/0-Archive/EWPP%20archive/1976%20Leishman%20and%20Scobie%20NEL.pdf|format=PDF |title=The Development of Wave Power|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device.&lt;ref name=morris2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris-Thomas |year=2007 |title=An Investigation Into the Hydrodynamic Efficiency of an Oscillating Water Column |journal=Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=273–278 |doi=10.1115/1.2426992 |last2=Irvin |first2=Rohan J. |last3=Thiagarajan |first3=Krish P.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the UK alone.&lt;ref name=cle2002/&gt;

Modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by [[Yoshio Masuda]]'s experiments in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |title=Wave Energy Research and Development at JAMSTEC|accessdate=2009-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701162330/http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea, with several hundred units used to power navigation lights. Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft, which was proposed in the 1950s by Masuda.&lt;ref name=ey2006&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.iwwwfb.org/Abstracts/iwwwfb21/iwwwfb21_15.pdf |author1=Farley, F.

T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Radical design options for wave-profiling wave energy converters |booktitle=International Workshop on Water Waves and Floating Bodies |location=Loughborough |accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]]. A number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves, among whom notably were [[Stephen Salter]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Kjell Budal]] and [[Johannes Falnes]] from [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (now merged into [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), [[Michael E. McCormick]] from [[U.S. Naval Academy]], [[David Evans (mathematician)|David Evans]] from [[Bristol University]], Michael French from [[University of Lancaster]], [[John Nicholas Newman|Nick Newman]] and [[C. C. Mei]] from [[MIT]].

Stephen Salter's [[1974 in science|1974 invention]] became known as [[Salter's duck]] or ''nodding duck'', although it was officially referred to as the Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/EWPP%20archive/duck%20efficiency%20&amp;%20survival%20notes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Edinburgh Wave Energy Project|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, as the oil price went down, wave-energy funding was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea. More recently, following the issue of climate change, there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy, including wave energy.&lt;ref name=falnes2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falnes, J. |year=2007 |title=A review of wave-energy extraction |journal=Marine Structures |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=185–201 |doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2007.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid-connected wave test site is situated at Billia Croo, on the western edge of the Orkney mainland, and is subject to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site. Wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include [http://www.aquamarinepower.com/ Aquamarine Power], [http://www.pelamiswave.com/ Pelamis Wave Power], [http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/wave-clients/scottishpower-renewables/ ScottishPower Renewables] and [http://www.wello.eu/ Wello].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern technology ==

Wave power devices are generally categorized by the '''method''' used to capture the energy of the waves, by '''location''' and by the '''power take-off system'''. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: [[hydraulic ram]], [[Peristaltic pump|elastomeric hose pump]], pump-to-shore, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric turbine]], air turbine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060523114110/http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2003/ece441/groups/g12/White_Papers/Kelly.htm Embedded Shoreline Devices and Uses as Power Generation Sources] ''Kimball, Kelly, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linear motor|linear electrical generator]]. When evaluating [[wave energy]] as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.

[[File:Wave energy concepts overview numbered.png|thumb|300px|Generic wave energy concepts: 1. Point absorber, 2. Attenuator, 3. Oscillating wave surge converter, 4. Oscillating water column, 5. Overtopping device, 6. Submerged pressure differential]]

=== Point absorber buoy ===

This device floats on the surface of the [[water]], held in place by cables connected to the seabed. The point-absorber is deﬁned as having a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength λ. A good point absorber has the same characteristics as a good wave-maker. The wave energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves. Buoys use the rise and fall of swells to generate [[electricity]] in various ways including directly via [[linear alternator|linear generators]],&lt;ref name="Seabased"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seabased AB wave energy technology|url=http://www.seabased.com/en/technology/seabased-wave-energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters&lt;ref name="PowerBuoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=PowerBuoy Technology — Ocean Power Technologies|url=http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/powerbuoy-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydraulic pumps.&lt;ref name="CETO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perth Wave Energy Project - Carnegie’s CETO Wave Energy technology|url=https://arena.gov.au/projects/perth-wave-energy-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms. The presence of the buoys may affect fish, marine mammals, and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites. Potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines. Energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline, resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface attenuator ===

These devices act similarly to [[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|point absorber buoys]], with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. Environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys, with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Oscillating wave surge converter ===

These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. [[Energy]] is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Environmental concerns include minor risk of collision, artificial reefing near the fixed point, [[Electromotive force|EMF]] effects from subsea cables, and energy removal effecting sediment transport.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt; Some of these designs incorporate [[parabolic reflector]]s as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture. These capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCormick |first1=Michael E. |first2=R. Cengiz |last2=Ertekin |title=Renewable sea power: Waves, tides, and thermals – new research funding seeks to put them to work for us |journal=Mechanical Engineering |publisher=ASME |volume=131 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the wave energy is captured at a wave source, power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the [[electrical grid]] by [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] [[submarine power cable|power cables]].&lt;ref name=nyt20100316&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/business/energy-environment/17power.html Underwater Cable an Alternative to Electrical Towers], Matthew L. Wald, ''[[New York Times]]'', 2010-03-16. Retrieved 2010-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oscillating water column ===

[[Oscillating Water Column]] devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore. With an air chamber integrated into the device, swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="“grnflea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracting Energy From Ocean Waves|url=http://grnflea.com/extracting-energy-from-ocean-waves/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines, potentially affecting [[birds]] and other [[marine organisms]] within the vicinity of the device. There is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Overtopping device ===

Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be either on shore or floating offshore. Floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting [[benthic organism]]s, organisms becoming entangled, or EMF effects produced from [[subsea cable]]s. There is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Submerged pressure differential ===
Submerged pressure differential based converters are a comparatively newer technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurniawan|first=Adi|last2=Greaves|first2=Deborah|last3=Chaplin|first3=John|date=2014-12-08|title=Wave energy devices with compressible volumes|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/470/2172/20140559|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=470|issue=2172|pages=20140559|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0559|issn=1364-5021|pmc=4241014|pmid=25484609|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47040559K}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing flexible (usually reinforced rubber) membranes to extract wave energy. These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off fluid system. This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow, which drives a turbine and electrical generator. Submerged pressure differential converters frequently use flexible membranes as the working surface between the ocean and the power take-off system. Membranes offer the advantage over rigid structures of being compliant and low mass, which can produce more direct coupling with the wave’s energy. Their compliant nature also allows for large changes in the geometry of the working surface, which can be used to tune the response of the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions.

A submerged converter may be positioned either on the sea floor or in midwater. In both cases, the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the [[free surface]]. Wave loads also diminish in [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] proportion to the distance below the free surface. This means that by optimizing the depth of submergence for such a converter, a compromise between protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be found. Submerged WECs also have the potential to reduce the impact on marine amenity and navigation, as they are not at the surface. Examples of submerged pressure differential converters include [http://www.m3wave.com/m3tech M3 Wave], [http://www.bomborawave.com Bombora Wave Power]'s mWave, and [http://calwave.energy CalWave].

== Environmental effects ==

{{further|Environmental impact of electricity generation#Wave}}

Common environmental concerns associated with [[marine energy]] developments include:

* The risk of [[marine mammal]]s and [[fish]] being struck by tidal [[turbine]] blades;
* The effects of [[electromagnetic field|EMF]] and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices;
* The physical presence of [[marine energy]] projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and [[seabird]]s with attraction or avoidance;
* The potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as [[sediment transport]] and [[water quality]].

The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|archivedate=November 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential ==

The worldwide resource of coastal wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunn |first=Kester |last2=Stock-Williams |first2=Clym |date=August 2012 |title=Quantifying the global wave power resource |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112001310 |journal=Renewable Energy |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=44 |pages=296–304 |access-date=27 February 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south [[temperate zones]] have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing [[westerlies]] in these zones blow strongest in winter.

== Challenges ==

There is a potential impact on the marine environment. Noise pollution, for example, could have negative impact if not monitored, although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly.&lt;ref name="ocs"/&gt; Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/mre/background.asp Marine Renewable Energy Programme], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Retrieved 2011-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Hackett]]:''Economic and Social Considerations for Wave Energy Development in California'' [http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-500-2008-083/CEC-500-2008-083.PDF CEC Report Nov 2008] Ch2, pp22-44 [[California Energy Commission]]|Retrieved 2008-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"/&gt; Since 2008, Seabased Industry AB (SIAB) has deployed several units of wave energy converters (WECs) manufactured with different designs. Offshore deployments of WECs and underswater substation are being complicated procedures. SIAB discussed these deployments in terms of economy and time efficiency, as well as safety. Certain solutions are suggested for the various problems encountered during the deployments. It is found that the offshore deployment process can be optimized in terms of cost, time efficiency and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzigiannakou|first=Maria Angeliki|last2=Dolguntseva|first2=Irina|last3=Leijon|first3=Mats|date=2017-03-25|title=Offshore Deployments of Wave Energy Converters by Seabased Industry AB|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/5/2/15|journal=Journal of Marine Science and Engineering|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=15|doi=10.3390/jmse5020015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave farms ==

{{Main|Wave farm}}A group of wave energy devices deployed in the same location is called [[wave farm]], wave power farm or wave energy park. Wave farms represent a solution to achieve larger electricity production. The devices of a park are going to interact with each other hydrodynamically and electrically, according to the number of machines, the distance among them, the geometric layout, the wave climate, the local geometry,  the control strategies. The design process of a wave energy farm is a multi-[[optimization problem]] with the aim to get a high power production and low costs and power fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giassi|first=Marianna|last2=Göteman|first2=Malin|date=April 2018|title=Layout design of wave energy parks by a genetic algorithm|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=154|pages=252–261|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything''''' ({{ISBN|1591841380}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LCCN|2006051390}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], first published in December 2006. It explores how some [[company (law)|companies]] in the early 21st century have used [[mass collaboration]] and [[open-source]] technology, such as [[wiki]]s, to be successful.

==Concepts==
According to Tapscott, Wikinomics is based on four ideas: Openness, Peering, Sharing, and Acting Globally. The use of mass collaboration in a business environment, in recent history, can be seen as an extension of the trend in business to [[Outsourcing|outsource]]: externalize formerly internal business functions to other business entities. The difference however is that instead of an organized business body brought into being specifically for a unique function, mass collaboration relies on free individual agents to come together and cooperate to improve a given operation or solve a problem. This kind of outsourcing is also referred to as [[crowdsourcing]], to reflect this difference. This can be incentivized by a reward system, though it is not required.

The book also discusses seven new models of mass collaboration, including:
* [[Peering]]: For example, page 24, "[[Marketocracy]] employs a form of peering in a mutual fund ({{mutual fund|MOFQX}}) that harnesses the collective intelligence of the investment community...Though not completely open source, it is an example of how meritocratic, peer-to-peer models are seeping into an industry where conventional wisdom favors the lone super-star stock advisor."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA24 Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 24.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ideagoras: For example, page 98, linking experts with unsolved research and development problems. The company [[InnoCentive]] is a consulting group that encapsulates the idea of ideagoras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA24 Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 97.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Prosumer]]s: For example, page 125, where it discusses the social video game [[Second Life]] as being created by its customers. When customers are also the producers, you have the phenomenon: Prosumer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA24 Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 124.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* New Alexandrians: This idea is about the Internet and sharing knowledge.

The last chapter is written by viewers, and was opened for editing on February 5, 2007.

===Central Concepts of Wikinomics in the Enterprise===

According to Tapscott and Williams, these four principles are the central concepts of wikinomics in the enterprise:

# Openness, which includes not only open standards and content but also financial transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas and resources
# Peering, which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum. Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux as the "quintessential example of peering."
# Sharing, which is a less proprietary approach to (among other things) products, intellectual property, bandwidth, scientific knowledge
# Acting globally, which involves embracing globalization and ignoring "physical and geographical boundaries" at both the corporate and individual level.

===Coase's Law===

In the chapter ''The Perfect Storm'', the authors give an overview of the economic effects of the kind of transactions [[Web 2.0]] permits. According to the authors, [[Coase theorem|Coase's Law]] (see [[Ronald Coase]]) governs the expansion of a business:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A firm will tend to expand until the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market.&lt;ref name='wikinomics56'&gt;Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies, the cost of transactions has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law. That is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A firm will tend to expand until the cost of carrying out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the costs of organizing the same transaction within the firm.&lt;ref name='wikinomics56'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Thus, the authors think that with the costs of communicating dramatically dropping, firms who do not change their current structures will perish. Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets.

==Reception==
A review of this book in the ''Harvard Business Review'' states "like its title, the book's prose can fall into breathless hype."&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business Review, March 2007 v85 i3 p34(1)&lt;/ref&gt; A review of this book in ''Choice'' recommends the book for "general readers and practitioners," but cautions that the authors "present an optimistic overview of successful collaborations and business ventures", "use unique terms (e.g., [[marketocracy]], prosumption, [[knowledge commons]])", should have given "more consideration [to] the darker sides of human motivation as well as [[groupthink]] and mass mediocrity", and "primarily draw on their own observations of businesses and trends for the ideas presented".&lt;ref&gt;''Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries,'' August 2007 v44 i12 p2147&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapscott and Williams released a followup to Wikinomics, titled ''Macrowikinomics: Rebooting Business and the World'', on September 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://dontapscott.com/books/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macrowikinomics.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
