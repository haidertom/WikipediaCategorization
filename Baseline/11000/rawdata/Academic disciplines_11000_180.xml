'''AgroParisTech''' (officially [[French language|French]] ''Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l'environnement'', or ''Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences'')&lt;ref&gt;English naming according to [http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf English brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209013409/http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a French university-level institution, also known as a "[[Grande Ecole]]". It was founded on January 1, 2007, by the merger of three life sciences [[grandes écoles]].

Leader in life sciences and agronomy, AgroParisTech is one of the foremost and most prestigious Grandes Ecoles. AgroParisTech is one of the founding members of the [[Université Paris-Saclay]], which will be the largest European multidisciplinary campus. AgroParisTech will consequently be moving to the [[Paris-Saclay]] [[business cluster| business]] and [[research-intensive cluster| research-intensive]] cluster in 2018.

AgroParisTech is a member of the [[UniverSud Paris]] and the [[Paris Institute of Technology]] (or Paris Tech). The latter is a consortium of ten graduate institutes of science and engineering. AgroParisTech is also part of 'The Life and Environmental Science and Technology Hub' of the [[Paris]] region, together with [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[Cemagref]], [[AFSSA]], the [[Ecole nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort]], and the [[Versailles National School of Landscape architecture]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}


== History==
AgroParisTech is the merger of three graduate institutes of science and engineering located around [[Paris]]:
* ''[[Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon|Institut national agronomique Paris-Grignon]]'' (INA P-G), founded in 1826
* [[French National School of Forestry|''École nationale du génie rural, des eaux et des forêts'']] (ENGREF), founded in 1964
* ''[[École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Agricoles et Alimentaires|École nationale supérieure des industries agricoles et alimentaires]]'' (ENSIA), founded in 1893.

The public higher education system in France includes universities and other institutions called the “[[Grandes Ecoles]]”. The “Grandes Ecoles” are the best rated pathways for higher education in Engineering and Management. The vast majority of the chief executives in major French companies and of top managers in the French Administration are graduates from the “Grandes Ecoles”. The features are:
* A very selective admission process through which students are either admitted by a nationwide entrance exam (notably after two or three years of “[[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|prépas]]”) or by the virtue of excellent academic records;
* 5 years (Master’s degrees) to 8 years (PhD and post-Master’s degrees) of higher education;
* The degree course at the “Grandes Ecoles” includes compulsory internships in laboratories and companies, in France or abroad
* The prestige of the “Grandes Ecoles” and  contacts with major enterprises provide an easy access to the job market.

==Organization==
AgroParisTech is organized into five departments:
* Agronomy, Forestry, Water and Environmental Science and Technology,
* Life Science and Health,
* Science and Engineering for Food and Bioproducts,
* Social science, Economics and Management,
* Modeling: Mathematics, Informatics and Physics

==Academic programs==
AgroParisTech offers different Masters:
* 3 different Masters of Engineering (MEng):
** [[Agronomy]]
** Food Science and Engineering
** Forestry
* 2 Masters of Science (MSc)
* 1 Master's program with 5 domains that cover most fields of Life Science and Technology
* one of 7 partner universities in the Master of Science in European Forestry program

It also offers:
* a wide range of Ph.D. programs.
* 1 Post-Master's degree for Management and Administration in environmental sciences and policies, proposed by [[ENGREF]], a post-graduate institute of [[AgroParisTech]].
* 9 Post-master professional certificates (one-year post graduate training)

==Research programmes==
AgroParisTech has:
* 39 research laboratories,
* 300 researchers

Students of '''Ascended Master Teachings''' organizations (also known as '''Ascended Master Activities''') believe that their doctrine has been given to humanity by the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]], individuals believed to have lived in physical bodies, acquired the wisdom and mastery needed to become immortal and free of the cycles of "re-embodiment" and karma, and have attained their "ascension", a state of "one-ness" with [[God]]. This knowledge is believed to have previously been taught for millions of years only within "Ascended master retreats" and "Mystery schools".

Adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that this wisdom was partially released by the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning in 1875, by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]], and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the ''Ascended Masters'' through [[Guy Ballard]] in the [[I AM Activity]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 89, 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book I''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 1 - 78, 91 - 102, 120 - 143, 215 - 216&lt;/ref&gt; However, Theosophists maintain the concept of ''Ascended Masters'' are a corruption of the original Theosophical concept of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].

The term ''Ascended Master'' was first introduced in 1934 by Guy Ballard with the publication of ''Unveiled Mysteries'', a book which he said was dictated to him by the Ascended Master: [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934 page vii: "The time has arrived, when the Great Wisdom, held and guarded for many centuries in the Far East, is now to come forth in America, at the command of those Great Ascended Masters who direct and protect the evolution of mankind upon this Earth."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other ''Ascended Master Teachings'' are contained in [[The Bridge to Freedom]] (1951),&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' (1951-1961) Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Summit Lighthouse]] (1958), (Known also as The [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref name="Lewis, James R. 1994"&gt;Lewis, James R.

&lt;!-- ''Note: This is a summary of the beliefs held by adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings and reflects their point of view. They tend to capitalize all words and terms directly relating to the Divine nature, qualities, and activities.'' --&gt;

==Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life==

Students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that there is One God, the "Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life", "The One", Who is the Source of all Life, Light, and Love in existence, and that all forms of existence and consciousness emanate from this "Allness of God" - "The One". ''The Voice of the I AM'' states "All Life is One" &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press December 1940 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is "One Substance, One Energy, One Power, One Intelligence" as the Source of all consciousness and creation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press July 1942 page 7&lt;/ref&gt; This Divine Being and Mind is considered to be above and distinct from all creation (in the sense of classical [[theism]]), transcending all creation yet interpenetrating all existence. Belief in this "One God" stresses the essential unity of the spiritual and material components of the universe. God creates through Individualized Identities that have distinct Self-Consciousness and that make up the Spiritual Hierarchy of Creation, yet remain connected through the flow of the "River of Life" and "Lifestream" to the "One Undivided God" - the "All in All" - the "Good" - the "Source from which all Life, Light, and Love come." There is always an uninterrupted "Oneness" that is maintained with the "Allness" of God. From the "One God" all other realities, including hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

==The Individualized "I AM" Presence==

Adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that each person is an incarnation of an "Individualized Presence" of the "Most High Living God" - the "Mighty I AM Presence" - as part of our very Nature and Being. God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Ascended Master Saint Germain]], believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have previously been embodied as [[Plato]], [[Proclus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Francis Bacon]], and numerous others, was quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When one individualizes within the Absolute, All-Pervading Life, he chooses of his own [[free will]] to become an intensified individual focus of Self-Conscious Intelligence. He is the conscious director of his future activities. Thus, having once made his choice, he is the only one who can fulfill that Destiny — which is not inflexible circumstance but a definitely designed Plan of Perfection." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/um/index.htm Unveiled Mysteries]''. Saint Germain Press 1934. pages 42, 97, 136 - 137, 142, 167 - 168, 171 - 172, 225 - 226, 228, 236&lt;/ref&gt; When You, the 'Mighty I AM Presence,' will to come forth into an Individualized Focus of Conscious Dominion and use the Creative Word, 'I AM,' Your First Individual Activity is the Formation of a Flame. Then you, the 'Individualized Focus' of the 'Mighty I AM Presence,' begin your Dynamic Expression of Life. This Activity, We term Self-consciousness, meaning the Individual who is conscious of his Source and Perfection of Life, expressing through himself." &lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Twin Flames==

Saint Germain explained through Guy Ballard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The 'Almighty God Flame,' breathing within Itself, projects Two Rays into the 'Great Sea of Pure Electronic Light.' This Intelligent Light-substance becomes the clothing, as it were, for these Rays of the 'Mighty I AM Presence.' Each Ray has all the Attributes of the Godhead within It, and no imperfection can ever enter into or register upon It. The Individualized Flame sends down into each Ray a Focal Point, or Spark, forming a Heart Center upon which gathers the 'Electronic Light Substance,' creating the Electronic Body." &lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1937, ''The Voice of the I AM'' article on this subject elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When the Ascension of both has taken place, each is the complete balance of all masculine and all feminine qualities within himself. Then the Threefold Flame of Life is completely unfolded, the individual becomes Master at Cosmic Levels of creation and does work with [[Planetary system|systems of worlds]], as well as in this physical world. Thus, that which came out of the Great Central Sun as One Flame becomes Three complete Flames, each of the same full Limitless Power and Activity as the Great Central Sun. This becomes the Cosmic Activity of the Power of the 'Three times Three'. "When both Rays have made the Ascension, then the individual works with systems of worlds instead of just in one world. This is the way the Godhead is ever expanding the Perfection of Itself throughout Infinity and keeping order throughout [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]]." &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press July 1937 pages 9 - 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beliefs about Ascended Masters==

It is believed that Ascended Masters are individuals who were once embodied on Earth and learned the lessons of life in their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the matter planes, balanced at least 51% of negative karma, and fulfilled their [[Dharma]] (Divine Plan). An Ascended Master has become God-like and a source of unconditional Love to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own God Self, the "I AM" Presence. It is claimed that they serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of Spirit, and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the Spiritual Hierarchy for Earth, and members of the Great Brotherhood of Light, also known as the Great White Lodge or [[Great White Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through [["I Am" Activity|The "I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of those believed by the ones proposing these teachings to be Ascended Masters would be the [[Master Jesus]], [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mary the Mother of Jesus]], St. [[Paul of Tarsus]] (aka [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]]), Melchizedek, [[Archangel Michael]], [[Metatron]],  [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]] and [[Kuthumi]], as well as dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Profiles of the Ascended Masters Pages 13-394--Lists more than 250 different Ascended Masters&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unveiled Mysteries'' records:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Truly the Great Ascended Masters are Gods. It is no wonder in the mythology of the ancients that their activities have been brought down to us in the guise of myth and fable. They wield Tremendous God Power at all times because they hold with unwavering determination to the Great God Presence and hence all Power is given unto them for they are All-Perfection.
"'When Jesus said, ''All these things I have done, ye shall do and even greater things shall ye do,'' he knew whereof he spoke,' continued Saint Germain. 'He came forth to reveal the Conscious Dominion and Mastery that it is possible for every human being to attain and express  while still here on Earth." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Great Sea of Universal Light, Life, and Love==

''Unveiled Mysteries'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Try to think upon this Power, which is within you. Call into use the Great Sea of Universal Substance from which you may draw without limit. It obeys, without exception, the direction of thought, and records any quality imposed upon it, through the activity of the feeling nature in mankind. Universal Substance is obedient to your conscious will at all times. It is constantly responding to humanity's thought and feeling whether they realize it or not. There is no instant at which human beings are not giving this Substance one quality or another, and it is only through the knowledge that the individual has conscious control and manipulation of a Limitless Sea of It that he begins to understand the possibilities of his own Creative Powers, and the responsibilities resting upon him in the use of his thought and feeling." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spiritual Hierarchy==
{{Main|Spiritual Hierarchy}}
Adherents of these ''Ascended Master Teachings'' believe that the All-Pervading Presence of God does not act nor create except through Its Individualizations. All creation comes forth through These Individual Identities and is sustained by Them. According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, this [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] is a "[[Great chain of being|Universal Chain]]" of Individualized God Free Beings fulfilling Attributes and Aspects of God's Infinite Selfhood.  Included in this Cosmic Hierarchical scheme are [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logoi]], [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings attendant to the Sun|Elohim]], Sons and Daughters of God, [[Ascended Master]]s, [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings|Cosmic Beings]], the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings attendant to the Sun|Twelve Solar Hierarchies]], Archangels, Angels, [[Elementals|Beings of the Elements]], and Twin Flames of the Alpha-Omega Polarity sponsoring [[Planetary system|Systems of Worlds]] and entire [[Galaxy|Galactic Systems]].  This ''Universal Order of Divine Self-Expression'' is the means whereby [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|God in the Great Central Sun]] steps down [ [[spiritual energy]] from ] the Presence and Essence of [[Spiritual Hierarchy#God|His Universal Being / Consciousness]] in order that all Life in [[Space-time|time and space]] might give and receive [[Agape|Unconditional Divine Love]]. One's placement on this "Ladder of Life" in the Spirit / Matter Universes is determined by one's level of Spiritual Attainment - measured by Awareness and Manifestation of balanced  Love, Wisdom, and Power - as well as the embodying of other Divine Qualities."

==Use of "I AM" in decrees, affirmations, and invocations==

A characteristic of students of the Ascended Master Teachings is the use of God's Creative Name - "I AM" - in the use of Decrees, Fiats, Adorations, and Affirmations to invoke and send forth the Light of God to Bless Life, to bring forth the Perfect Divine solution for every situation, and to fulfill the Divine Plan. It is believed to be a way of externalizing more Divine Light, Divine Love, and Divine Life into the lower planes of creation through the dynamic force of sound vibration as creative energy.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

''The Magic Presence'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Only the Self-conscious Individual has ALL the Attributes and Creative Power of the 'Mighty I AM Presence.' Only He can know who and what He is, and express the Fullness of the Creative Power of God whenever He decrees, by the use of the Words, 'I AM.' The outer human part of this activity is what We call the personality. It is but the vehicle through which Perfection should be expressed into the outer substance of the Universe.

"Within the 'Pure God-Flame' is a Breath that pulsates constantly. This `Great Fire-Breath' is a Rhythmic Outpouring of Divine Love, Its Three Attributes being 'Love, Wisdom, and Power in action.' These pour out constantly, into the 'Infinite Sea of Pure Electronic Light.' This Light is the Universal Substance or Spirit, out of which all forms are composed. It is intelligent, mark you, because It obeys law through the command of the Individual who says, or is conscious of, 'I AM.' These Two Words are the Acknowledgment and Release of the Power to Create and bring forth into outer existence, whatever quality follows That Acknowledgment. For Intelligence to act there must be Intelligence to be acted upon, and the Universal Substance, being like a photographic film, takes the record of what-ever quality the Individual imposes upon It through his thought, feeling, and spoken word. The Words 'I AM' whether thought, felt, or spoken, release the Power of Creation instantly. Make no mistake about this. Intelligence is Omnipresent, and It is within the Electronic Light." &lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Violet Flame==

Use of the "[[Violet (color)|Violet]] Flame of Divine Love" is considered to be the [[Seven Rays|7th Ray]] aspect of the Holy Spirit and the "Sacred Fire" that transmutes and consumes the "cause, effect, record, and memory" of sin or negative karma. Also called the "Flame of Transmutation", the "Flame of Mercy", the "Flame of Freedom", and the "Flame of Forgiveness". "Our God is a Consuming Fire" in ''Deuteronomy'' 4:24 (KJV) and ''Hebrews'' 12:29 (KJV) is believed to be refer to this "Sacred Fire of God".

The "Violet Fire" is held to be a raising, transforming, purifying action of "Divine Love" from the "Heart of God" in the "Great Central Sun". It acts to transmute and consume human creation that is not worthy of becoming Immortal, and all negative karmic causes, effects, records, and memories, without the need to individually balance that karma face-to-face with each person back to the earliest beginning of one's individualized manifestation on this or any other world.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

==Ascension==
{{Main|Initiation (Theosophy)}}
The Ascension is believed to be the returning to complete "Oneness with God" - "raising the outer atomic structure of the physical, emotional, and mental bodies into the Electronic Structure of the I AM Consciousness", becoming an Ascended Master, eventually a Cosmic Being, and beyond. The Ascension into Immortality through reunion with the God Self requires the consuming of at least 51% of the records and memories of "negatively qualified karma" as well as:

===Mastery of the matter planes===

It is believed that the "Individualized Flames of Perfection", emanating as lifestreams taking physical embodiment, can develop further attributes that express a unique Identity, and attain the fullness of the use of Light. This is done by mastery over [[Plane (esotericism)|matter planes]] that have a slower vibratory action, thus requiring more energy and concentration to externalize form. This allows for the development of greater skills of creation and "Causal Body Momentums" of various "Divine Qualities". Physical embodiment gives each individual the opportunity to expand these attributes and faculties through matter substance, and to become a "master of energy" through thought and feeling. This allows for accomplishments and added power which one who does not ever embody on a planet does not possess. Thus an individual may expand the "Flame in the Heart", and expand the "Perfection of the Allness of God's Love" in the created universe, eventually becoming an Ascended Master and later a Cosmic Being.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, gaining "mastery over matter planes" means learning to consciously use 100% of one's Creative Power of thought, feeling, and spoken word to create greater perfection, joy, and love in the world, as opposed to using thoughts, feelings, and words to create greater limitations, bondage, and chaos in one's own experience and in the world at large through carelessness and lack of awareness of the extent of one's influence in the world. "Matter planes" refers to the differentiations of atomic and molecular structure in which evolution takes place, the lower planes (dimensions / wavelength frequency resonance) sometimes correlated with physical solids, liquids, and gases; the higher subplanes of the Physical Octave are sometimes referred to as [[Etheric plane|"etheric"]] and are not normally perceivable by the physical senses. The emotional and mental octaves are also made up of electrons and atoms of feeling and thought substance and differentiated into levels of density and vibratory rate.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"To understand the above explanation concerning the electron and the conscious control the individual has through his thought and feeling to govern the atomic structure of his own body is to understand the One Principle Governing form throughout Infinity. When man will make the effort to prove this to himself or within his own atomic flesh body, he will then proceed to Master Himself. When he has done that, all else in the Universe is his willing co-worker to accomplish whatsoever he wills through Love." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fulfillment of the Divine Plan===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Within the Life of every human being is the Power by which he can express all that the Ascended Masters express every moment — if he but chooses to do so. All Life contains Will but only Self-Conscious Life is free to determine upon its own course of expression. Hence, the individual has free choice to express either in the human, limited body or the Super-Human, Divine Body. He is the chooser of his own field of expression. He is the Self-determining Creator. He has willed and chosen to live as Self-Conscious Life. . . . When one individualizes within the Absolute, All-Pervading Life he chooses of his own free will to become an intensified individual focus of Self-Conscious Intelligence. He is the conscious director of his future activities. Thus, having once made his choice, he is the only one who can fulfill that Destiny - which is not inflexible circumstance but a definitely designed Plan of Perfection.&lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Threefold Flame==

The Threefold Flame of Life is the Immortal Flame within the Heart of the children of Light and Sons and Daughters of God, and is an actual extension of the Heart of the I AM Presence of each Lifestream in embodiment on Earth.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

==The fall of man==

It is believed that since the "fall of man" during the time of the incarnation of the [[Root race#The fourth root race (Atlantean)|Fourth Root Race]], imperfection, limitations and discord increasingly entered into our world. The memory body is considered to have become known as a "soul", and this temporary personality has taken on the sense of a self that is separated and not connected to God. It is believed that a "Dictation" from Maitreya further clarified this matter through the "Messenger", [[Geraldine Innocente]], on September 27, 1954 when what occurred during the time of the "Fourth Root Race" was described:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Curiosity, rebellion against holding true to the Divine Pattern and the use of thought and feeling in creation of imperfection, began the building of what you call the 'soul'. It is a consciousness apart from the full Purity of God. The first thought a man had that was imperfect and impure, energized by a secret feeling, was a cause and that, sent out into the atmosphere, created an effect. Like a boomerang, the effect came back into the consciousness and made a record. That record was the beginning of an impression. Energy sent out in a certain manner returned to affect the lifestream who had sent it forth and there began to be created a shadow between the I AM Presence and the human consciousness. Endeavoring to contact the Presence, the individual would find these 'tramp' thoughts and feelings flowing through that line of contact until more and more imperfect was the conscious use of them. Finally, those centers got completely away from the control of the ego and acted independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'', February 1956 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989) Purported address from Maitreya on September 27, 1954 "through" Geraldine Innocente&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dictations==

Within The "I AM" Activity, contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as "Messengers", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of The "I AM" Activity. Those Addresses (known as "Dictations") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, published in the monthly periodical, ''The Voice of The "I AM"'', and some were collected and reprinted in the books of ''The Saint Germain Series''. In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other "Ascended Master Activities" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004. Describes the religious organizations based on a belief in the Ascended Master Teachings, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pages 330 - 334&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that further instruction from the Ascended Masters and the rest of the Spiritual Hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as [[The Bridge to Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' 1951 - 1961 Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Summit Lighthouse]],&lt;ref name="Lewis, James R. 1994" /&gt; and The Temple of The Presence.

==Dawning Golden Age==

Students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that this world is destined to again have a [[Golden Age]], a "Heaven on Earth", that will be permanent, unlike previous Golden Ages millions of years ago.&lt;ref name="Law_of_Life_I" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"In your beloved America, in the not so far distant future, will come forth a similar recognition of the Real Inner Self, and this her people will express in high attainment. She is a Land of Light, and Her Light shall blaze forth, brilliant as the sun at noonday, among the nations of the Earth. She was a Land of Great Light, ages ago, and will again come into her spiritual heritage, for nothing can prevent it." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

"The Divine Plan for the future of North America is a condition of intense activity in the greatest peace, beauty, success, prosperity, spiritual illumination, and dominion. She is to carry the Christ Light and be the Guide for the rest of the Earth, because America is to be the Heart Center of the 'Golden Age' that is now dimly touching our horizon. The greater portion of the land of North America will stand for a very long time." &lt;ref name="Unveiled_Mysteries" /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Aquarian Church==
The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on ''The [[Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' transcribed from the [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] by [[Levi Dowling|Levi H. Dowling]].  The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups.  The book "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel" by ACCU founder Rev. Dr. Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church's teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk, the Saint Germain Series published Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from "The Lost Years of Jesus" compiled by [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] and published by The Summit Lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Jacob L. "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==

[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' Albany, New York: 1994 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

The '''Ateliers d'Art Sacré''' (Studios of Sacred Art) was an artistic movement based in Paris in the first half of the 20th century that aimed to create church art that avoided the artificiality of traditional academic or realist work.

==Foundation==

The Ateliers d'Art Sacré were founded on 5 November 1919 after [[World War I]] (1914-18) by [[Maurice Denis]] (1870–1943) and [[Georges Desvallières]] (1861–1950) as part of a broad movement in Europe to reconcile the church with modern civilization.{{sfn|Rinuy|2002}}
Their aim was to train artists and crafts people in the practice of Christian art and to provide tasteful religious works of traditional and modern style to churches, particularly those that had been devastated by the war.{{sfn|Lebée|2014}}
Denis said that he was against academic art because it sacrificed emotion to convention and artifice, and was against realism because it was prose and he wanted music. Above all he wanted beauty, which was an attribute of divinity.{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}

==Activities==

The artists were largely involved in decoration of the [[Église Saint-Esprit (Paris)|Église Saint-Esprit]] in Paris, where the iconography shows the milestones in church history.
In this church, built in 1928-35 by the architect [[Paul Tournon]], murals were painted by forty artists including Maurice Denis, Georges Desvallières, [[Henri Marret]], Jean Dupa, Pauline Peugniez and  [[Robert Poughéon]].
In the Way of the Cross of Saint-Michel de Picpus, decorated in 1934 under the direction of Henri de Maistre, the personality of the artists was effaced for the sake of the collaborative work.{{sfn|Lebée|2014}}
The number of church commissions for the Ateliers was not enough for them to survive.{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}

The Dominican [[Marie-Alain Couturier]] (1897–1954) was a member of the Ateliers. 
He argued that a masterpiece, even if made by a non-believer, would always be more effective than a religious work of lesser value.{{sfn|Dekoninck|Trémolières|2010|p=9}}
He gradually moved away from the influence of Maurice Denis, his master, and developed an admiration for [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]].{{sfn|Rossi|2010}}
The Canadian painter [[Jean Dallaire]] (1916–1965) was another artist who joined the Ateliers, but then became interested in Picasso and the surrealists.{{sfn|Jean Dallaire, Musée des beaux-arts du Canada}}

[[File:BLOSUM62.gif|thumb|400px|The BLOSUM62 matrix]]
In [[bioinformatics]], the '''BLOSUM''' ('''BLO'''cks '''SU'''bstitution '''M'''atrix) matrix is a [[substitution matrix]] used for [[sequence alignment]] of [[protein]]s. BLOSUM matrices are used to score alignments between [[Evolutionary divergence|evolutionarily divergent]] protein sequences.  They are based on local alignments. BLOSUM matrices were first introduced in a paper by [[Steven Henikoff]] and Jorja Henikoff.&lt;ref name=henikoff&gt;{{cite journal| year=1992| journal=PNAS | volume=89 | pages=10915–10919|  pmid=1438297 | title = Amino Acid Substitution Matrices from Protein Blocks | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10915 | author = Henikoff, S. |author2=Henikoff, J.G.| issue=22| pmc=50453}}&lt;/ref&gt; They scanned the [[BLOCKS database]] for very [[Conserved sequence|conserved regions]] of protein families (that do not have gaps in the sequence alignment) and then counted the relative frequencies of [[amino acids]] and their substitution probabilities. Then, they calculated a [[odds ratio|log-odds]] score for each of the 210 possible substitution pairs of the 20 standard amino acids. All BLOSUM matrices are based on observed alignments; they are not extrapolated from comparisons of closely related proteins like the [[Point accepted mutation|PAM Matrices]].

==Biological background==
The genetic instructions of every replicating [[Cell (biology)|cell]] in a living organism are contained within its DNA.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch16/&gt; Throughout the cell's lifetime, this information is transcribed and replicated by cellular mechanisms to produce proteins or to provide instructions for daughter cells during [[cell division]], and the possibility exists that the DNA may be altered during these processes.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch16&gt;{{Cite book| title=Biology: Australian Version| author =Campbell NA |author2=Reece JB |author3=Meyers N|author4=Urry LA |author5=Cain ML |author6=Wasserman SA |author7=Minorsky PV |author8=Jackson RB | contribution=The Molecular Basis of Inheritance| edition=8th| year=2009| pages=307–325| publisher=Pearson Education Australia| isbn=9781442502215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=campbell-ch17&gt;{{Cite book| title=Biology: Australian Version| author =Campbell NA |author2=Reece JB |author3=Meyers N|author4=Urry LA |author5=Cain ML |author6=Wasserman SA |author7=Minorsky PV |author8=Jackson RB | contribution=From Gene to Protein| edition=8th| year=2009| pages=327–350| publisher=Pearson Education Australia| isbn=9781442502215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a [[mutation]]. At the molecular level, there are regulatory systems that correct most — but not all — of these changes to the DNA before it is replicated.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch17/&gt;&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{Cite book| title=Fundamentals of Molecular Biology|vauthors=Pal JK, Ghaskadbi SS | contribution=DNA Damage, Repair and Recombination| edition=1st| year=2009| pages=187–203| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=9780195697810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functionality of a protein is highly dependent on its structure.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch5&gt;{{Cite book| title=Biology: Australian Version| author =Campbell NA |author2=Reece JB |author3=Meyers N|author4=Urry LA |author5=Cain ML |author6=Wasserman SA |author7=Minorsky PV |author8=Jackson RB | contribution=The Structure and Function of Large Biological Molecules| edition=8th| year=2009| pages=68–89| publisher=Pearson Education Australia| isbn=9781442502215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing a single amino acid in a protein may reduce its ability to carry out this function, or the mutation may even change the function that the protein carries out.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch17/&gt; Changes like these may severely impact a crucial function in a cell, potentially causing the cell — and in extreme cases, the organism — to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-ratios-and-lethal-genes-557 |title=Mendelian Ratios and Lethal Genes |first=Ingrid |last=Lobo |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |year=2008 |accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the change may allow the cell to continue functioning albeit differently, and the mutation can be passed on to the organism's offspring. If this change does not result in any significant physical disadvantage to the offspring, the possibility exists that this mutation will persist within the population. The possibility also exists that the change in function becomes advantageous.

The 20 amino acids translated by the genetic code vary greatly by the physical and chemical properties of their side chains.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch5/&gt; However, these amino acids can be categorised into groups with similar physicochemical properties.&lt;ref name=campbell-ch5/&gt; Substituting an amino acid with another from the same category is more likely to have a smaller impact on the structure and function of a protein than replacement with an amino acid from a different category.

Sequence alignment is a fundamental research method for modern biology. The most common sequence alignment for protein is to look for similarity between different sequences in order to infer function or establish evolutionary relationships. This helps researchers better understand the origin and function of genes through the nature of [[Homology (biology)|homology]] and [[Conserved sequence|conservation]]. Substitution matrices are utilized in algorithms to calculate the similarity of different sequences of proteins; however, the utility of Dayhoff Matrix has decreased over time due to the requirement of sequences with a similarity more than 85%. In order to fill in this gap, Henikoff and Henikoff introduced BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix) matrix which led to marked improvements in alignments and in searches using queries from each of the groups of related proteins.&lt;ref name=henikoff/&gt;

==Terminology==
BLOSUM: Blocks Substitution Matrix, a [[substitution matrix]] used for [[sequence alignment]] of [[protein]]s.

Scoring metrics (statistical versus biological): When evaluating a sequence alignment, one would like to know how meaningful it is. This requires a scoring matrix, or a table of values that describes the probability of a biologically meaningful amino-acid or nucleotide residue-pair occurring in an alignment. Scores for each position are obtained frequencies of substitutions in blocks of local alignments of protein sequences.&lt;ref name= pertsemlidis&gt;{{cite journal| date = September 2001| journal= Genome Biology | volume=2 | pages= reviews2002.1–2002.10| title = Having a BLAST with bioinformatics (and avoiding BLASTphemy) | author = pertsemlidis A. | author2= Fondon JW.3rd | pmid = 11597340 | issue=10 | pmc=138974 | doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-10-reviews2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sets of BLOSUM matrices exist using different alignment databases, named with numbers. BLOSUM matrices with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences, while those with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences. For example, BLOSUM80 is used for less divergent alignments, and BLOSUM45 is used for more divergent alignments. The matrices were created by merging (clustering) all sequences that were more similar than a given percentage into one single sequence and then comparing those sequences (that were all more divergent than the given percentage value) only; thus reducing the contribution of closely related sequences. The percentage used was appended to the name, giving BLOSUM80 for example where sequences that were more than 80% identical were clustered.

BLOSUM r: the matrix built from blocks with less than r% of similarity
– E.g., BLOSUM62 is the matrix built using sequences with less than 62% similarity (sequences with ≥ 62% identity were clustered)
– Note: BLOSUM 62 is the default matrix for protein BLAST. Experimentation has shown that the BLOSUM-62 matrix is among the best for detecting most weak protein similarities.&lt;ref name=henikoff/&gt;

==Construction of BLOSUM matrices==
BLOSUM matrices are obtained by using blocks of similar amino acid sequences as data, then applying statistical methods to the data to obtain the similarity scores.
Statistical Methods Steps : 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.utm.my/aibig/images/saberi/Bioinformatics/blosum_matrices_slides_final.pdf |title=BLOSSUM MATRICES: Introduction to BIOINFORMATICS |year=2009 |website=UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA |accessdate=9 September 2014 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eliminating Sequences===
Eliminate the sequences that are more than r% identical. There are two ways to eliminate the sequences. It can be done either by removing sequences from the block or just by finding similar sequences and replace them by new sequences which could represent the cluster. Elimination is done to remove protein sequences that are more similar than the specified threshold.

===Calculating Frequency &amp; Probability===
A database storing the sequence alignments of the most conserved regions of protein families. These alignments are used to derive the BLOSUM matrices. Only the sequences with a percentage of identity lower than the threshold are used.
By using the block, counting the pairs of amino acids in each column of the multiple alignment.

===Log odd ratio===
It gives the ratio of the occurrence each amino acid combination in the observed data to the expected value of occurrence of the pair.
It is rounded off and used in the substitution matrix.

&lt;math&gt;LogOddRatio=2 \log_2{\left( \frac{P \left(O \right)}{P \left(E \right)} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In which &lt;math&gt;P \left(O \right)&lt;/math&gt; is the possibility of observed and &lt;math&gt;P \left(E \right)&lt;/math&gt; is the possibility of expected.

===BLOSUM Matrices===
The odds for relatedness are calculated from log odd ratio, which are then rounded off to get the substitution matrices BLOSUM matrices.

===Score of the BLOSUM matrices===
A scoring matrix or a table of values is required for evaluating the significance of a sequence alignment, such as describing the probability of a biologically meaningful amino-acid or nucleotide residue-pair occurring in an alignment. Typically, when two nucleotide sequences are being compared, all that is being scored is whether or not two bases are the same at one position. All matches and mismatches are respectively given the same score (typically +1 or +5 for matches, and -1 or -4 for mismatches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.cs.uic.edu/~msivaram/Bio_Tools.PDF |title =CS#594 - Group 13 (Tools and softwares) |author1=Murali Sivaramakrishnan |author2=Ognjen Perisic |author3=Shashi Ranjan |website = University of Illinois at Chicago - UIC |accessdate =9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it is different for proteins. Substitution matrices for amino acids are more complicated and implicitly take into account everything that might affect the frequency with which any amino acid is substituted for another. The objective is to provide a relatively heavy penalty for aligning two residues together if they have a low probability of being homologous (correctly aligned by evolutionary descent). Two major forces drive the amino-acid substitution rates away from uniformity:  substitutions occur with the different frequencies, and lessen functionally tolerated than others. Thus, substitutions are selected against.&lt;ref name= pertsemlidis/&gt;

Commonly used substitution matrices include the blocks substitution (BLOSUM) &lt;ref name=henikoff/&gt;  and point accepted mutation (PAM) &lt;ref name=dayhoff&gt;{{Cite book | last = Margaret O.| first = Dayhoff| title = Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure| publisher = National Biomedical Research Foundation| chapter = 22|pages = 345–352| volume=5 | date = 1978| location = Washington DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= States&gt;{{cite journal| year=1991| journal= Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology | volume=3 | pages= 66–70| title = Improved sensitivity of nucleic acid database searches using application-specific scoring matrices. | author = States DJ. | author2= Gish W.| author3 = Altschul SF. | issn = 1046-2023 | doi=10.1016/s1046-2023(05)80165-3| citeseerx= 10.1.1.114.8183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  matrices. Both are based on taking sets of high-confidence alignments of many homologous proteins and assessing the frequencies of all substitutions, but they are computed using different methods.&lt;ref name= pertsemlidis/&gt;

Scores within a BLOSUM are log-odds scores that measure, in an alignment, the logarithm for the ratio of the likelihood of two amino acids appearing with a biological sense and the likelihood of the same amino acids appearing by chance. The matrices are based on the minimum percentage identity of the aligned protein sequence used in calculating them.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDFltuQo1dMC&amp;pg=PA673&amp;lpg=PA673&amp;dq=blosum+matrix | title=Handbook of Nature-Inspired And Innovative Computing | isbn=978-0-387-40532-2 | author=Albert Y. Zomaya | year=2006 | publisher=Springer | location=New York, NY}}page 673&lt;/ref&gt; Every possible identity or substitution is assigned a score based on its observed frequencies in the alignment of related proteins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Education/BLASTinfo/Scoring2.html NIH "Scoring Systems"]&lt;/ref&gt; A positive score is given to the more likely substitutions while a negative score is given to the less likely substitutions.

To calculate a BLOSUM matrix, the following equation is used: 
:&lt;math&gt;S_{ij}= \left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)\log{\left( \frac{p_{ij}}{q_i * q_j} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of two amino acids &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; replacing each other in a homologous sequence, and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt; are the background probabilities of finding the amino acids &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in any protein sequence. The factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a scaling factor, set such that the matrix contains easily computable integer values.

==An example - BLOSUM62==
BLOSUM62: midrange

BLOSUM80: more related proteins

BLOSUM45: distantly related proteins

An article in [[Nature Biotechnology]]&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite journal| year=2008| journal=Nat. Biotechnol. | volume=26 | pages=274–275| title = BLOSUM62 miscalculations improve search performance | doi = 10.1038/nbt0308-274 | url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n3/full/nbt0308-274.html | author = Mark P Styczynski |author2=Kyle L Jensen|author3=Isidore Rigoutsos|author4=Gregory Stephanopoulos| pmid=18327232| issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that the BLOSUM62 used for so many years as a standard is not exactly accurate according to the algorithm described by Henikoff and Henikoff.&lt;ref name=henikoff /&gt; Surprisingly, the miscalculated BLOSUM62 improves search performance.&lt;ref name=article /&gt;

The BLOSUM62 matrix with the amino acids in the table grouped according to the chemistry of the side chain, as in (a). Each value in the matrix is calculated by dividing the frequency of occurrence of the amino acid pair in the BLOCKS database, clustered at the 62% level, divided by the probability that the same two amino acids might align by chance. The ratio is then converted to a logarithm and expressed as a log odds score, as for PAM. BLOSUM matrices are usually scaled in half-bit units. A score of zero indicates that the frequency with which a given two amino acids were found aligned in the database was as expected by chance, while a positive score indicates that the alignment was found more often than by chance, and negative score indicates that the alignment was found less often than by chance.

==Some uses in bioinformatics==

===Research applications===
BLOSUM scores was used to predict and understand the surface gene variants among hepatitis B virus carriers&lt;ref name = Roque-Afonso/&gt; and T-cell epitopes.&lt;ref name = Nielsen/&gt;

====Surface gene variants among hepatitis B virus carriers====
DNA sequences of HBsAg were obtained from 180 patients, in which 51 were chronic HBV carrier and 129 newly diagnosed patients, and compared with consensus sequences built with 168 HBV sequences imported from GenBank. Literature review and BLOSUM scores were used to define potentially altered antigenicity.&lt;ref name = Roque-Afonso&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Antivir Ther | volume=12 | issue=8 | pages=1255–1263 | year=2007  |vauthors=Roque-Afonso AM, Ferey MP, Ly TD | title=Viral and clinical factors associated with surface gene variants among hepatitis B virus carriers. | pmid=18240865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reliable prediction of T-cell epitopes====
A novel input representation has been developed consisting of a combination of sparse encoding, Blosum encoding, and input derived from hidden Markov models. this method predicts T-cell epitopes for the genome of hepatitis C virus and discuss possible applications of the prediction method to guide the process of rational vaccine design.&lt;ref name = Nielsen&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Protein Science | volume=12 | issue=5| pages=1007–1017 | year=2003  |vauthors=Nielsen M, Lundegaard C, Worning P | title=Reliable prediction of T‐cell epitopes using neural networks with novel sequence representations |url=http://tools.immuneepitope.org/analyze/pdf/nielsen_2003_protein_sci.pdf | doi=10.1110/ps.0239403|display-authors=etal | pmid=12717023 | pmc=2323871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in BLAST===
BLOSUM matrices are also used as a scoring matrix when comparing DNA sequences or protein sequences to judge the quality of the alignment. This form of scoring system is utilized by a wide range of alignment software including [[BLAST]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html#head9 |title =The Statistics of Sequence Similarity Scores |website =National Centre for Biotechnology Information |accessdate =20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparing PAM and BLOSUM====
In addition to BLOSUM matrices, a previously developed scoring matrix can be used. This is known as a [[Point accepted mutation|PAM]]. The two result in the same scoring outcome, but use differing methodologies. BLOSUM looks directly at mutations in motifs of related sequences while PAM's [[extrapolate]] evolutionary information based on closely related sequences.&lt;ref name="henikoff"/&gt;

Since both PAM and BLOSUM are different methods for showing the same scoring information, the two can be compared but due to the very different method of obtaining this score, a PAM100 does not equal a BLOSUM100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.birec.org/sandbox/omamasaudtutorial |title =PAM and BLOSUM Substitution Matrices |last =Saud |first =Omama |year =2009 |website =Birec |accessdate =20 October 2013 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130309015755/http://birec.org/sandbox/omamasaudtutorial |archivedate =9 March 2013 |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bioscope''' show was a [[music hall]] and [[funfair|fairground]] attraction consisting of a travelling [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The heyday of the Bioscope was from the late 1890s until [[World War I]].

Bioscope shows were fronted by the largest [[fairground organ]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_bioscope.html "Hollycombe Steam Museum bioscope show"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these formed the entire public face of the show. A stage was usually in front of the organ, and dancing girls would entertain the crowds between film shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html "Fairground Heritage Trust"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703073622/http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-bioscopes.html |date=July 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Films shown in the Bioscope were primitive, and the earliest of these were made by the showmen themselves. Later, films were commercially produced.

Bioscope shows were integrated, in Britain at least, into the Variety shows in the huge Music Halls which were built at the end of the nineteenth century.

After the Music Hall Strike of 1907 in London, bioscope operators set up a trade union to represent them. There were about seventy operators in London at this point.

==Modern use==
In South Africa "Bioscope" or in [[Afrikaans]] "bioskoop" is an archaic word for the cinema and some people (especially older generations) still use it regularly.

In modern day Dutch, "bioscoop" is a wide-spread term, and the equivalent of the English "movie theater" or "cinema".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9578">'''Bog-wood''', also known as '''abonos''' and '''morta''', especially amongst pipe smokers,&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Đenović|first=Davorin|title=What is abonos-morta?|url=http://davorinmortapipes.wordpress.com/what-is-abonos-morta/|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a material from trees that have been buried in [[peat]] [[bog]]s and preserved from [[Decomposition|decay]] by the [[acid]]ic and [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] bog conditions, sometimes for hundreds or even thousands of years.  The wood is usually stained brown by [[tannin]]s dissolved in the acidic water. Bog-wood represents the early stages in the [[fossil]]isation of wood, with further stages ultimately forming [[Jet_(lignite)|jet]], [[lignite]] and [[coal]] over a period of many millions of years. Bog-wood may come from any tree species naturally growing near or in bogs, including [[oak]] (''Quercus'' &amp;ndash; "bog oak"), pine (''[[Pinus]]''), yew (''[[Taxus]]''), swamp cypress (''[[Taxodium]]'') and kauri (''[[Agathis]]''). Bog-wood is often removed from fields and placed in [[clearance cairn]]s. It is a rare form of timber that is claimed to be "comparable to some of the world's most expensive tropical hardwoods".&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Huge 5,000-year-old oak unearthed | work = BBC | accessdate = 2012-09-27 | date = 2012-09-26 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-19722595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation process==
Bog-wood is created from the trunks of  trees that have lain in bogs, and bog-like conditions such as lakes, river bottoms and swamps, for centuries and even millennia. Deprived of oxygen, the wood undergoes the process of fossilization and morta formation.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?" /&gt;

Water flow and depth play a special role in the creation of morta. Currents bind the minerals and iron in the water with tannins in the wood, naturally staining the wood in the process. This centuries-long process, often termed "maturation," turns the wood from golden-brown to completely black, while increasing its hardness to such a level that it can only be carved with the use of specialty cutting tools.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?" /&gt;

While the time necessary for the oak to transform into abonos varies, the "maturation" commonly lasts thousands of years. Due to the ecological reasons mentioned above, no two trunks can be found of the same color.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?" /&gt;

==Excavation sites==
[[File:Bog-wood from Sava river, BiH.jpg|thumb|Bog-wood from Sava river, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]]
Sites of quality bog-wood in the world are very rare. In the sites expected to yield it, morta is hard to find, and access to the river bank and its bed is often difficult. Therefore, extensive preparations and the engagement of professional divers are necessary for morta recovery. Morta is located in conditions of total darkness, and its extraction marks its first exposure to light after centuries of entombment.

In England and Ireland, the three main types of bog-wood that can be found are Yew, Oak and Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maureenmcghee.com/about/history-of-bog-oak/|title=History of Irish Bog Oak|last=McGhee|first=Maureen|website=Maureen McGhee|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reserves of the ancient wood can also be found in Russia and Ukraine, where the northern region has a climate favorable to the growth of oak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teltinc.com/about-1/|title=OUR PRODUCTS|website=teltinc.com|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Croatia, bog-wood is typically found in the valley of the [[Sava|Sava River]] and its tributaries. The age of morta found in Croatian rivers ranges from several hundred years in the southern rivers to the oldest retrieved so far, from the [[Krapina River]], dated at 8290 years old.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?" /&gt;

In Serbia, bog-wood over 8,000 years old is found in the valleys of the [[Danube River]], [[Sava|Sava River]] and their tributaries, primarily in the province of [[Vojvodina]].

Saving the wood for further processing is a very delicate matter. Extracted logs must be wrapped in waterproof material and meticulously dried to prevent warping. The process of wood desiccation is complex, and despite great care, most of the raw wood is unsuitable for further processing. For this reason, the price of high quality raw abonos is quite high.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?" /&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Bog-wood is characterized by natural staining and variations in color, and the direction of growth rings. Well preserved bog-wood is not affected by weather conditions or organisms which would change its strength and appearance.
Semi-dry bog-wood is sometimes of a golden or copper color,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Bog Oak?|url=http://www.teltinc.com/|website=Telt Inc.|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with a tint of some other hue, and is exceptionally hard. Older wood can be completely black, yet possess the rich variations in hue characteristic of “live” wood. This dark hue is a special feature of abonos as a construction material, whether it is used for the making of semi-manufactured goods, veneer or planks.
.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?"/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Bogwood Betta.jpg|right|thumb|Bog wood in an aquarium releases tannins into the water, turning the water brown.]]
Because bog-wood can remain free of decay for thousands of years it is of use in [[dendrochronology]], often providing records much older than living trees. Wooden artefacts lost or buried in bogs become preserved as bog-wood, and are important in [[archaeology]].

Bog-wood may be used in [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] to make furniture or [[wood carving]].  Bog-wood sometimes has aesthetically interesting shapes (similar to [[driftwood]]) and may be use as ornaments. As bog-wood dries out, it may crack or split, but this does not necessarily detract from its aesthetic qualities. Due to its natural color, it is a traditionally favored wood for the carving of dirks (''bìodagan'') and ''[[sgian-dubh]]'' in the [[Scottish Highlands]].

Bog-wood is used in [[aquarium|aquaria]] for ornaments, providing hiding places for fish and a growing surface for plants such as [[Microsorum pteropus|Java fern]]. Additionally, the leaching of organic compounds such as tannins into the water causes a brown coloration.

During the nineteenth century bog oak was used to make carved decorative items such as jewelry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fabulous Fakes: A Passion for Vintage Costume Jewelry|last= Tanenbaum|first= Carole|author2=Rita Silvan|year= 2006|publisher= Madison Press|location= Toronto |page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some parts of the world it is still used to craft unique artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Souvenirs made out of abonos|url=http://abonos-galerija.com/abonos.php?stranica=19|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prized in the Tudor period for its dark hue, bog oak was used to construct the throne of Peter the Great as well in the construction of Venetian palaces and the bedroom suite of Louis XIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bog Oak History|url=http://royaloakglobal.com/BogOakHistory.aspx|website=Royal Oak|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curran &amp; Sons Throne Chair|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/28295/throne-chair|website=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bog-wood souvenirs.jpg|thumb|Souvenirs made out of morta / bog-wood]]

[[File:Morta tobacco pipe.JPG|thumb|Tobacco pipe made of morta / bog-wood]]

One of the uses of morta is for making of [[tobacco pipe]]s. It is an ideal material because of a high percentage of minerals, reaching up to 12%, which makes morta especially resistant to burning. Because underground currents erase all traces of tannin, resin and similar ingredients in bog-wood, pipes constructed of the ancient wood provide a neutral taste during tobacco smoking. Due to the challenges of extraction and processing, today there are a relatively small number of pipemakers who make pipes out of morta.&lt;ref name="What is abonos-morta?"/&gt;

In addition to pipes, bog-wood has traditionally been used to construct decorative objects and items for everyday use. Today, modern drying techniques have made it possible to preserve larger planks of bog oak that are suitable for floor coverings, furniture, doors, window frames, and sculptures.[1]

[[File:Iwakuni Digital TV Repeater.JPG|thumb|[[Iwakuni]] relay station of terrestrial digital television broadcasting]]
A '''broadcast relay station''' also known as a '''satellite station''', '''relay transmitter''', '''broadcast translator''' (U.S.), '''rebroadcaster''' (Canada), '''[[repeater]]''' ([[two-way radio]]), or '''complementary station''' (Mexico) is a broadcast transmitter device which repeats, or [[transponder|transponds]], the signal of a radio or television station to an area not covered by the signal of the originating station. They may expand the [[broadcast range]] of a television or radio station beyond the primary signal's original coverage area or to improve service in a part of the original coverage area. These transmitters may be, but are not usually, used to create a [[single-frequency network]]. They may also be used by an FM or AM radio station to establish a presence on the other band.

Sometimes, a rebroadcaster may be owned by a community group rather than the owner of the primary station. For example, [[WHLS]]/[[WHLX]] of [[Port Huron, Michigan]] purchased a translator, and shortly after that switched to an [[alternative rock]] format without mentioning the original FM translator, except for their legally required top-of-the-hour ID. No AM frequencies have been mentioned.

==Types==

===Broadcast translators===
In its simplest form, a broadcast translator is a facility created to receive a terrestrial broadcast over-the-air on one frequency and rebroadcast the same or substantially identical signal on another frequency. These stations are used in television and radio to cover areas such as valleys or rural villages which are not adequately covered by a station's main signal. They can also be used to expand market coverage by duplicating programming on one band to another.

===Boosters and distributed transmission===
Relays which broadcast within or very near the parent station's coverage area (a "fill-in") on the ''same'' channel or frequency are called "booster" stations in the U.S. However, this can pose difficulties because the signals from the two stations may interfere with each other unless they are carefully designed. [[Co-channel interference|Radio interference]] can be avoided by using exact [[atomic time]] obtained from [[Global positioning system|GPS]] [[satellite]]s to perfectly [[synchronise]] co-channel stations, as in a [[single-frequency network]].

Analog television stations cannot have same-channel boosters unless opposite ([[perpendicular]]) [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] is used, due to video [[synchronization]] issues such as [[ghosting (television)|ghosting]]. In the U.S., no new on-channel UHF signal boosters have been authorized since July 11, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47%3A4.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr#47:4.0.1.1.3.7.3.12 |title=US CFR 47 Part 74G – 74.733 UHF translator signal boosters |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305205415/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47:4.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr#47:4.0.1.1.3.7.3.12 |archive-date=March 5, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed transmission]] (DTx) is the use of several medium-power stations (usually digital) on the same frequency to cover a broadcast area, rather than one high-power station with repeaters on a different frequency. [[Digital television]] stations are technically capable of sharing a channel, however this is more difficult with the [[8VSB]] [[modulation]] and invariable [[guard interval]] used in the [[ATSC]] standard than with [[COFDM]] used in the European and Australian [[DVB-T]] standard. A [[distributed transmission system]] would therefore have tight synchronisation requirements which requires each transmitter to receive its signal from one central source for broadcast at a GPS-synchronised time. DTS (or DTx) are not broadcast repeaters in the conventional sense as they cannot simply receive the signal of one main terrestrial broadcast transmitter for rebroadcast; to do so would introduce a retransmission delay which breaks the precise synchronisation required, causing interference between individual transmitters.

The use of [[virtual channel]]s is another alternative, though this may cause the same channel to appear multiple times on a receiver (once for each relay station), and require the user to manually tune to the best one (which may change due to [[radio propagation]] conditions like weather). Use of boosters or DTx instead causes all relay stations to ideally appear as a single signal, but requires significant [[broadcast engineering]] to work properly and not cause destructive interference.

===Satellite stations===
Some fully licensed stations [[simulcast]] another station. These are relay stations in name only and are generally licensed the same as any other major station. This is unregulated in the U.S. and is widely allowed in Canada, while otherwise the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulates [[radio format]]s to ensure a diverse variety of programming.

U.S. satellite stations may request that the FCC grant an exemption to requirements that a properly staffed [[Television studio|broadcast studio]] be maintained in the [[city of license]] or (in rural states) that television programming be simulcast in both [[NTSC-M|analogue]] and [[ATSC|digital]] during [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]]. These stations most often cover vast but sparsely populated regions (in economic hardship) or are operated as statewide [[educational television|non-commercial educational]] [[NPR|radio]] and [[PBS|television]] systems.

===Semi-satellites===
A television rebroadcaster often sells local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter, and may also air a very limited amount of distinct programming from their parent station. Some such "semi-satellites" broadcast their own local newscasts, or separate news segments during part of the [[News broadcasting|newscast]]. For example, [[CHEX-TV-2]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], aired daily late afternoon and early evening news and community programs separate from its parent station, [[CHEX-DT|CHEX-TV]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel12.ca/about.php CHEX-TV-2 Durham: About Channel 12] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223135228/http://www.channel12.ca/about.php |date=February 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] prohibits this on FM translator stations, and only allows it on different fully licensed stations.

In some cases, a semi-satellite is a formerly autonomous full-service station which is being programmed remotely through [[centralcasting]] or broadcast automation in order to avoid the cost of retaining a full local staff. [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT]], an [[owned-and-operated station]] of the [[Canadian French|French language]] network [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] in [[Toronto]], is a ''de facto'' semi-satellite of its stronger [[Ottawa]] sibling [[CBOFT-DT|CBOFT]] as its programming has long either been identical or differed only in local news and advertising. A financially weak privately owned broadcaster in a small market can easily become a ''de facto'' semi-satellite by gradually curtailing local production and relying on a commonly owned station in a larger city for programming ([[WWTI]] in [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], relies on [[WSYR-TV]] in this manner). [[Broadcast automation]] allows substitution of any [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] or [[digital subchannel]] content which the broadcaster was unable to obtain for both cities.

Some defunct full-service stations (such as [[CJSS-TV]] in [[Cornwall, Ontario]], now [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV-8]]) have been turned into full satellites and originate nothing. If programming from the parent station must be removed or substituted due to local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|sports blackouts]], the modified signal is ''de facto'' that of a semi-satellite station.

===National networks===
Most broadcasters outside of North America maintain a national network and use several relay transmitters to provide the same service to a region or entire nation. In comparison to the other types of relays explained above, the transmitter network is often created and maintained by an independent authority, often paid for using [[television license]] fees, and multiple major broadcasters use the same transmitters.

In North America, a similar pattern of regional network broadcasting is sometimes employed by statewide or province-wide [[educational television]] networks such as [[Kentucky Educational Television]], [[UNC-TV]], [[Vermont Public Television]], [[Wisconsin Public Television]], [[TVOntario]] or [[Télé-Québec]]; a state or province establishes one educational station and extends it with multiple full-power transmitters to cover the entire jurisdiction with no capability for local programming origination. In the U.S., a regional network of rebroadcast sites may in turn join the national [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] as an individual member station.

==Relay transmitters by country==

===Canada===
In Canada, "rebroadcaster" or "rebroadcasting transmitter" are the terms most commonly used by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).

====Television====
A television rebroadcaster may be permitted to sell local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter. On rarer occasions, they may also air a very limited amount of distinct programming from their parent station. Some such "semi-satellites" broadcast their own local newscasts, or separate news segments during part of the newscast.

There is no strict rule for the [[call sign]] of a television rebroadcaster. Some transmitters have distinct call signs from the parent station (for example, [[CFGC-TV|CFGC]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] is a rebroadcaster of [[CIII-DT|CIII]]), while others use the call sign of the originating station followed by a number (e.g., the former [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT-17]] in [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], Ontario). Officially, the latter type includes the television station's "-TV" suffix between the call sign and the number, although in media directories this is often left out for convenience.

In the latter case, the numbers are usually applied sequentially, starting from one and denoting the chronological order in which the station's rebroadcast transmitters began operation. Some broadcasters may, at their discretion, use a system in which the number denotes the actual broadcast channel of the transmitter (e.g., [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV-47]] in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]]). A broadcaster cannot, however, mix the two numbering systems under a single call sign – the transmitters are either ''all'' numbered sequentially or ''all'' numbered by their analogue channel position. On the rare occasion that the sequential numbering reaches 99 (e.g., [[TVOntario]]'s former broadcast transmitters), rather than being numbered as 100 the next transmitter is assigned a new call sign and numbered as one. Translators which share the same frequency (such as [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]]'s former repeaters CBLET, CBLHT, CBLAT-2 and CH4113, all on channel 12) are also given distinct call signs.

Digital rebroadcasters may be numbered using the television channel number of the analogue signal which they replaced; TVOntario's CICO-DT-53 (digital UHF 26, [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]]) is one example (that station was converted in 2011 solely to vacate an out-of-core analogue channel, UHF 53, and retains CICO-TV-53's former analogue UHF television call sign numbering as one of the few surviving TVO repeaters).

[[Low-power broadcasting|Low-power]] rebroadcasters may also have a call sign which consists of the letters "CH" followed by four numbers. For example, [[CH2649]] in [[Valemount, British Columbia]] is a rebroadcaster of [[Vancouver]]'s [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]]. Rebroadcasters of this type are numbered strictly sequentially to the order in which they were licensed by the CRTC, and their call signs have no inherent relationship to those of the parent stations or of other rebroadcasters. Although the next number in the sequence, CH2650 in [[Anzac, Alberta]], is also a rebroadcaster of CHAN, this is simply because CH2649 and CH2650 happened to be licensed simultaneously – the following number, CH2651, is a rebroadcaster (also in Anzac) of [[Edmonton]]'s [[CITV-DT|CITV]]. A single station's rebroadcasters are not necessarily all named in the same manner. [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]], for example, had some retransmitters which had their own call signs, some which used CBLT followed by a number ''and'' some transmitters with CH numbers.

All CBC and Radio-Canada owned-and-operated retransmitters were shut down permanently on August 1, 2012, along with most TVOntario transmitters (which often were located at Radio-Canada sites) and some [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]] (APTN) transmitters in the far north. Private commercial broadcasters continue to operate some full-power rebroadcasters as a means of obtaining "must carry" status on [[cable television]] systems.

Transmitters in small markets with one (or no) originating stations were in most cases not required to convert to digital, even if operating at full-power. Transmitters broadcasting on high-band UHF channels 52–69 were required to vacate those channels by August 31, 2011; some (such as a [[CKWS-DT|CKWS-TV]] retransmitter in [[Brighton, Ontario]], and three of the TVOntario sites) did go digital as part of a move to a lower frequency but do not provide [[high-definition television]] service, extra [[digital subchannel]]s or any functionality beyond that of the original analogue site.

====Radio====
As in television, a radio rebroadcaster may have either a distinct call sign or use the calls of the originating station followed by a numeric suffix. In the case of radio, however, the numeric suffix is always sequential.

For a rebroadcaster of an [[FM radio|FM]] station, the numeric suffix is appended to the FM suffix. For example, rebroadcasters of [[CJBC-FM]] in Toronto are numbered CJBC-FM-1, CJBC-FM-2, etc. Where an [[AM radio|AM]] station has a rebroadcaster operating on the FM band, the numeric suffix instead falls ''between'' the four-letter call sign and the FM suffix – for example, CKSB-1-FM is an FM rebroadcaster of the AM station [[CKSB (AM)|CKSB]], while CKSB-FM-1 would be a rebroadcaster of [[CKSB-FM]].

As a broadcaster is limited to no more than two stations on one radio band in a market, one possible means to obtain a third FM signal in-market is to use a rebroadcaster of the AM station to move that signal onto low-power FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2008/080728/nerw.html#can |title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush |publisher=Fybush.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sarnia, [[Blackburn Radio]] already owns [[CFGX-FM]] (99.9) and [[CHKS-FM]] (106.3); its third Sarnia station [[CHOK]] (1070) uses an FM repeater for in-city coverage as "Country 103.9" FM, although officially the AM signal remains the station's primary transmitter.

Low-power radio rebroadcasters may also have a call sign which consists of the letters "VF" followed by four numbers; however, a call sign of this type may also denote a low-power station which originates its own programming and is not a rebroadcaster. Some stations licensed under the CRTC's experimental broadcasting guidelines, a special class of short-term license (similar to [[special temporary authority]])  sometimes granted to newer [[campus radio|campus]] and [[community radio]] operations, may have another distinct class of call sign which consists of three letters from anywhere within Canada's ITU prefix range followed by three digits – e.g. [[CFU758]] or VEK565. Some other stations within this license class, however, have been assigned conventional C''xxx'' call signs.

Occasionally, former rebroadcasters have been converted to originating stations in their own right, but have retained their former call sign instead of being reassigned a new one of their own. Such stations include [[CITE-FM-1]] in [[Sherbrooke]], [[CBF-FM-8]] in [[Trois-Rivières]] and [[CBAF-FM-15]] in [[Charlottetown]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/1994/DB94-339.HTM{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ; compare with
http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/1993/PB93-136.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} where CBAF-FM-15 was considered by the CRTC as a rebroadcaster.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], translator and booster stations are given the call sign of the parent station.

====Television====
The majority of television stations in Mexico are operated as repeaters of the networks they broadcast. Translator stations in the Mexico are given call signs which begin with XE and XH. [[Televisa]] and [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|Azteca]] each maintain two networks with national reach. Televisa's [[XEW-TV|Canal de las Estrellas]] network includes 128 separately licensed stations, the most in Mexico, while Azteca's networks incorporate 88 and 91 stations. These stations may have the capability to insert local advertising. Azteca's stations in larger cities may include local news and a limited amount of regional content; Televisa prefers to use its non-national [[Gala TV (Mexico)|Gala TV]] network and [[Televisa Regional]] stations as outlets for its local production. On top of the listed number of transmitters for each network, many have multiple translators of their own that serve areas with little or no signal within their defined coverage area, known as ''equipos complementarios de zona de sombra'' ({{lang-en|shadow channels}}). Most shadow channels air the same programming as their parent station, with several notable exceptions. The northern and central regional network [[Multimedios Televisión]] out of [[Monterrey]] uses the same sort of system to a smaller extent (its [[XHSAW-TDT]] serves in the shadow channel role to main station [[XHAW-TDT]] within Monterrey), but mainly offers regional outputs for local newscasts and advertising formed around a master schedule.

There are two main national networks of non-commercial television stations in Mexico. One is the [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Canal Once]] or XEIPN-TDT network run by the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional]] (IPN). This operates 13 transmitters of its network and airs its programs on 4 more under a contract with the [[Sistema Quintanarroense de Comunicación Social|Quintana Roo state network]]. The other network, operated by the [[Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano]] (SPR), incorporates 26 stations (16 in operation), most of which are entirely digital. The SPR transmitters are located almost exclusively in cities where the IPN never built its own stations and carry Canal Once as one of the five educational networks in the multiplex of the digital station.

Additionally, 26 of Mexico's 32 states own and operate television services of their own. 16 of these incorporate more than one transmitter. The largest by number of stations is [[Telemax (television network)|Telemax]], the state network of Sonora, which operates 59 transmitters. Many transmitters in state networks broadcast at very low [[effective radiated power]]s (ERP).

Lastly, a small number of stations are owned by municipalities or translator associations. These are relatively uncommon, and like state networks, transmit at extremely low power.

Transmitters rebroadcasting Mexico City stations into [[Baja California]] and other communities along the Pacific coast normally operate on a two-hour delay relative to the originating station; there is a one-hour delay in [[Sonora]], and [[Quintana Roo]] (which as of 2015 is now one hour ahead of central Mexico) receives programs one hour later (but live) than they are broadcast to most of Mexico.

====Radio====
While comparatively rare, a number of FM shadow channels also exist (approximately 10 to 15). These are required to be co-channel to the stations they retransmit.

The state with the most FM shadow channels is [[Quintana Roo]], whose seven FM shadows represent about half of the national total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/contenidogeneral/industria/cuadroestadisticodedistribuciondeestacionesmarzo2016.pdf|title=IFT Table of Distribution of Stations, March 2016|author=|date=|publisher=[[Federal Telecommunications Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more FM shadows are authorized but not in this table: [[XETIA-FM]]/[[XEAD-FM]] Ajijic, Jal. and [[XHRRR-FM (Veracruz)|XHRRR-FM]] Tecolula, Ver.

===United States===
{{update|the digital transition|date=June 2013}}

====Radio====
As of July 2009, the basic [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations on translators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/47cfr74.1201.htm |title=FCC regulations CFR 47 Part 74 Subpart L: FM Broadcast Translator Stations and FM Broadcast Booster Stations |publisher=Edocket.access.gpo.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* FM translators may be used for cross-band translation. This removed the restriction that prevented FM translators from retransmitting AM signals.
* No translator or booster may transmit anything other than the live [[simulcast]] of its licensed parent station, except for emergency warnings (such as [[Emergency Alert System|EAS]]), and 30 seconds per hour of fundraising.
* The parent station must [[Station identification|identify]] all of its translators and boosters between 7 and 9 a.m., 12:55 and 1:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 4 and 6 p.m. each broadcast day; or each must be equipped with its own automated [[Information appliance|device]] (audio or [[Frequency-shift keying]] [FSK]) for hourly identification.
* Maximum power is 250 watts ERP for a translator, and 20% of the maximum allowable ERP for the primary station's class for a booster. There is no limit on [[HAAT|height]] for fill-in translators (those that exist within the primary [[service contour]] of the primary station).
* A translator or booster must stop transmitting if the parent station's signal is lost (this helps prevent unauthorized retransmission of other stations).

There is one loophole by which programming may differ between a main station and an FM translator: an [[HD Radio]] signal may contain [[digital subchannel]]s with different programming from the main analogue channel, and a translator may operate in such a way as to broadcast programming taken from the originating station's HD2 subchannel as the translator's main analogue signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2008/080728/nerw.html#pa |title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush |publisher=Fybush.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W237DE]] (95.3, [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]) broadcasts the programming format formerly carried by WTCY (1400 AM, now [[WHGB]]), but it actually gets this signal from a [[WNNK]] (104.1 FM) HD2 digital subchannel for analogue rebroadcast at the WNNK tower site on 95.3's main signal. As such, it technically is still legally an FM repeater of an FM station, even though each signal would be heard as delivering unique content by users of standard analogue [[FM radio]] receivers.

Commercial stations may own their translators or boosters when that translator or booster exists within the primary service contour of the parent station (they can only fill in where [[terrain]] blocks the signal). In fact, boosters may only be owned by the primary station. Translators outside of a primary station's service contour cannot be owned by the primary station, nor can they receive any financial support from the primary station. Most translators operate by picking-up the signal of the main station off the air with a directional antenna and sensitive receiver, and directly retransmitting the signal. They also may not transmit in the FM "[[reserved band]]" from 88 to 92 [[MHz]], where only [[Non-commercial educational|non-commercial]] stations are allowed. Non-commercial stations may broadcast in the commercial band, however. Unlike commercial stations, they can also relay programming to translators via [[satellite]], so long as those translators are in the reserved band. Translators in the commercial band may only be fed by a direct off-the-air signal from another FM station or translator. Non-fill-in commercial band translators may not be fed by satellite, as spelled out in FCC rule 74.1231(b).&lt;ref&gt;http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/47cfr74.1231.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All stations may use any means to feed boosters.

All U.S. translator and booster stations are low-power and have a [[list of broadcast station classes|class D]] license, making them secondary to other stations (including the parent). They must accept any [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from full-power (100-watt or more on FM) stations, while not causing any of their own. Boosters must not interfere with the parent station within the [[community of license]]. Licenses are automatically renewed with that of the parent station and do not require separate applications, though each may still be challenged with a petition to deny.

FM booster stations are given the full call sign (always including an "-FM" [[suffix]], even if there is none assigned) of the parent station, plus a [[serial number]], such as [[WRIF|WXYZ-FM]]1, WXYZ-FM2, etc.

FM translator stations may use sequential numbered call signs, consisting of "K" or "W", followed by a three-digit number (201 through 300 corresponding to frequencies 88.1 to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) followed by a pair of sequentially assigned letters. The format is similar to that used by numbered television translators, where the number refers to the permanent channel assignment.

As of October 2008, the largest terrestrial radio translator system in the U.S. belongs to [[KUER-FM]], the non-commercial radio outlet of the [[University of Utah]], with 33 translator stations ranging from [[Idaho]] to [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;KUER-FM on-air broadcast statement, accessed Oct. 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television====
Unlike FM, [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations may operate as either translators or originate their own programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/47cfr74.701.htm |title=FCC regulations – US CFR 47 Part 74 Subpart G – Low Power TV, TV Translator, and TV Booster Stations |publisher=Edocket.access.gpo.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translator stations in the U.S. are given call signs which begin with a "W" or "K" (respectively east or west of the [[Mississippi River]], as with regular stations), followed by a channel number, and two [[serial number|serial letter]]s for each channel (the first stations on that channel are AA, AB, AC, and so on). Television channels are always two-digit, from 02 to 51 (formerly 02 to 83); while [[FM radio]] channels are from 200 (87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) to 300 (107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz), one every 0.2&amp;nbsp;MHz (for example, W42BD or K263AF). The presence of an X after the number in these call signs does not indicate an experimental broadcasting license as it may in other services, as all 26 letters are included in the sequence. The highest pair of letters used, {{As of|January 2011|lc=on}}, is ZS (K13ZS-D is a translator of [[KTSC (TV)|KTSC]] in [[Sargents, Colorado]]).&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?call=K13ZS |title=TV Query Results – Video Division (FCC) USA |publisher=Fcc.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbered translator stations (a format such as "W70ZZ") are typically low-power repeaters, often 100 watts or less on FM, and 1,000 or less on television. The former "translator band", [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television channels [[channel 70|70]] through [[channel 83|83]], was originally occupied primarily by these low-powered translators. The combination of low power and high frequencies provided a very limited range for these broadcasts. This band was reallocated to [[cellular telephone]] services in the 1980s, with the handful of remaining transmitters from these channels moved to lower frequencies.

Full-power repeaters (such as [[WPBS-TV]]'s identical twin transmitter [[WNPI-TV]]) are normally assigned "-TV" call signs like those of any other full-power station. These "satellite stations" do not bear numbered call signs and must operate in the same manner as other full-power broadcasters. This [[simulcasting]] is generally not regulated by the FCC, except where a station's owner seeks to be exempted from requirements such as restrictions on owning multiple full-service stations in the same market, limits on overlap in coverage area between commonly owned stations or requirements that each full-service station have a local studio and a skeleton staff capable of originating programming locally. These exemptions are normally justified on the basis of "economic hardship", where a heavily rural location unable to support a full-service originating station of its own may be able to sustain a full-power rebroadcaster. Some stations (such as [[KVRR]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota]]) are actually chains of as many as four full-power transmitters, each with its own call sign and license, covering a vast but sparsely populated region.

LPTV stations may also choose a regular four-letter call sign with an "-LP" suffix (shared with [[low-power FM]] [LPFM]) for analog or "-LD" for digital, generally done only if the station originates programming. [[Class A television service|Class A television]] stations are assigned calls with "-CA" and "-CD" suffixes instead. Digital stations which use numerals get a "-D" suffix (as in W42BD-D). All of these are despite the fact most of the full-power digital television stations had their "-DT" (originally "-HD") suffixes dropped by the FCC before "-D" and "-LD" were implemented. Digital LPTV stations have their digital RF channel numbers as part of their digital call signs, which means it may be different from the [[virtual channel]] (the analog number).

Numbered broadcast translators which are moved permanently to another frequency are normally issued new call signs to reflect the updated channel assignments. The same is not true of displaced translators using another frequency temporarily under special technical authority. For instance, [[K55KD]] could retain its call sign while displaced temporarily to [[Channel 57 virtual TV stations in the United States|channel 57]] to resolve interference to [[MediaFLO]] users, while W[[Channel 81|81]]&lt;nowiki&gt;AA&lt;/nowiki&gt; would have received new calls when channel 81 was deleted from the bandplan. On the rare occasion that a station moves back to its original channel, it is given its old call sign, as they are not reused by other stations like regular call signs can be.

=====Digital transition=====
Low-power television stations are not required to simulcast a digital signal, nor were they required to shut down analog operation in June 2009 when full-power U.S. television stations had to do so.

Full-power stations used for simulcasting another station were, like other full-service television broadcasters, required to convert fully to digital in June 2009. The FCC defines these "TV satellite stations" as "full-power broadcast stations authorized under Part 73 of the Commission's rules to retransmit all or part of the programming of a parent station that is typically commonly owned." As most satellite stations operate in small or sparsely populated areas that have an insufficient economic base to support full-service operations, many were granted FCC authorization on a case-by-case basis to [[flash-cut]] from analog to digital on the same channel instead of simulcasting in both formats during the digital transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-07-1847A1.txt |title=FCC, DTV Transition – Approval of "Flash Cut" Requests, April 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no current or future digital television mandates had been forced on existing low-power television stations, Congress passed legislation in 2008 funding low-power stations which went digital by the conversion date or shortly thereafter. Some low-power stations were forced to change frequency to accommodate full-power stations which moved to UHF or operated digital companion channels on UHF during the digital transition period.

By 2008, existing [[Channel 55 virtual TV stations in the United States|channel 55]] licensees (both low-power and full-power) were being encouraged to relocate early to free spectrum for Qualcomm's (now-defunct) [[MediaFLO]] transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=1690 |title=Qualcomm Gets FCC Nod For MediaFLO Spectrum |publisher=Phone Scoop |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109183947/http://www2.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=1690 |archive-date=January 9, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, any remaining LPTV broadcasters on UHF channels 52 through 69 were forced onto lower channels; in many cases, transmitters on the original UHF 70–83 translator band were forced to relocate twice (channels 70–83 were lost to mobile phones in 1983; followed by channels 52–69 between 2009 and 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcchicago.com/station/digitaltv/Scpecialized_TV_Stations.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028130626/http://www.nbcchicago.com/station/digitaltv/Scpecialized_TV_Stations.html |date=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many low-power broadcast translators also were directly affected by a parent station's conversion to digital television. Translators which received an analog over-the-air signal from a full-service television station for rebroadcast needed to convert receiving equipment in much the same way that individual viewers needed to deploy [[CECB|digital converters]]. While the signal transmitted by the repeater may remain in analog format, the uplink had to be changed. In the United States, 23% of the 4,000 licensed translators have received a US$1000 federal government subsidy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/technology/ci_11667413 Many rural TVs will go dark, not digital], David Migoya, ''[[Denver Post]]'', February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which covers a small portion of the cost of this additional equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20090201/NEWS01/902010304 Low-power rural stations will continue in analog for several more years] • RICHARD ECKE • Great Falls (Montana) Tribune • February 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many other translators silently went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]] after the digital transition deadline or did not apply for new channels after UHF channels 52–69 were removed from the bandplan.

Some small translators operated by direct conversion of a parent station's signal to another frequency for rebroadcast, without any other local signal processing or demodulation. For example, [[W07BA]], a 16-watt repeater for [[WSYR-TV]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?list=0&amp;facid=73114 |title=TV Query Results – Video Division (FCC) USA |publisher=Fcc.gov |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was by design a very simple piece of broadcast apparatus; it merely shifted the main station's signal from channel nine to channel seven to cover a small valley in [[Dewitt, New York|Dewitt]]. After [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital transition]], Syracuse became a [[ultra-high frequency|UHF]] island and WSYR-TV's main [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] signal became a 100&amp;nbsp;kW digital broadcast on channel 17. Therefore, there is no longer a channel 9 signal in any format available to feed the tiny repeater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.9wsyr.com/blogs/plugged_in_the_dtv_switch/archive/2008/04/04/2846869.aspx |title=Plugged In: the DTV Switch – What's all this DTV stuff, anyway?, Jeff Hartman, WSYR-TV ABC 9 Syracuse, April 2008 |publisher=Community.9wsyr.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516181434/http://community.9wsyr.com/blogs/plugged_in_the_dtv_switch/archive/2008/04/04/2846869.aspx |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators in remote locations, where no [[electrical power distribution|commercial power]] is available, were also expected to have problems in deploying extra equipment to handle an uplink's digital conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times-standard.com/localnews/ci_11204138 |title=Further complications loom for digital television conversion, Jessie Faulkner, Times-Standard, Eureka CA, 12 December 2008 |publisher=Times-standard.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many translators continue analog broadcasts (and a minority transitioned to digital themselves), some distant rural communities expected to find all local translator signals gone as a result of originating stations' transition to digital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevadabroadcasters.org/dtv-translator-status.pdf Nevada Translator Stations – Status Report for Digital Transition, Nevada Broadcasters Association, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226060205/http://www.nevadabroadcasters.org/dtv-translator-status.pdf |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many originating stations which were marginally available over-the-air as analog signals were irretrievably lost to digital conversion in certain locations (VHF [[Band I]] signals moving to UHF often losing the most range). This often meant that the parent station was no longer receivable over-the-air at the relay site. As an interim solution to this problem, communities that are permitted to do so by state and federal laws have chosen to purchase Ku-Band ([[Echostar Communications Corporation|Echostar]], [[Hughes Corporation|Hughes]], etc.) or C-Band satellite receivers for their translator stations: the satellite input is simply rebroadcast as their analog translator output. Retransmitting the local channels from the satellite has the same problems as if the service area residents purchased individual service themselves: signal latency, atmospheric conditions (e.g.: torrential rain or snow accumulation on the [[Low-noise block downconverter|receiving device]]), satellite equipment issues, etc.

A digital-to-digital repeater or broadcast translator is possible; in North America, the [[ATSC]] specifications allow such repeaters to leave the [[virtual channel]] numbering and guide ([[Program and System Information Protocol]] [PSIP]) of the originating station unchanged, so that the rebroadcaster appears to the viewer as if it were on the same channel numbers as the original station. Some full-power television stations that have lost coverage after the digital transition have applied for digital replacement translators to fill in the gaps in some of the station's lost coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-36A1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Those "fill-in" translators use the same call letters, suffix and facility IDs as their main full-power station.

A few local translator districts (in which one municipal or county-level group had operated multiple low-power analog retransmitters fed from multiple distant stations) consolidated all programming on [[digital subchannel]]s of a single digital television transmitter on a new channel. These rebroadcast stations insert PSIP virtual channel numbering and call signs locally.

Most digital [[television set]]s and [[digital video recorder]]s include analog and [[ATSC tuner|digital tuner]]s, however most digital television [[set-top box]]es fail to display analog stations or even to include [[analog passthrough]] for RF from the [[television antenna]] (the way a [[VCR]] does). This is an issue primarily with [[coupon-eligible converter box]]es and caused grave concern among low-power television operators and border stations; the [[Community Broadcasters Association]] filed a [[lawsuit]] claiming it violated the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]], the law on which the FCC based its digital mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepuson.com/index2.php KeepUsOn.com: Community Broadcasters Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225044601/http://www.keepuson.com/index2.php |date=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late 2008, 58% of approved coupon-eligible converter models were providing analog pass-through.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtv2009.gov/stats.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
Under U.S. law, full-service local broadcasters are the primary occupants of the [[FM radio]] broadcast band. All LPFM operations, as well as all translators, are considered to be secondary in importance. In theory, this leaves [[low-power FM]] stations and broadcast translators with co-equal status on the FM band. In practice, as the FM broadcast band becomes more crowded, frequencies assigned to translators become unavailable to new LPFM stations or to existing LPFM stations seeking to upgrade their facilities.&lt;ref name="fybush-wavm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2005/051024/nerw.html#ma|title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush|author=|date=|website=www.fybush.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few key distinctions often place small, local LPFM operators at a disadvantage:
* The maximum power for an LPFM station (either 10 or 100 watts, depending on class of station) is less than that of the largest FM broadcast translators (at 250 watts), limiting the reach of the LPFM signal.
* The minimum spacing required (in distance and frequency) to other stations is less strict for translators than for LPFM applicants. While the translator spacing is based on signal contour levels (and therefore takes terrain and obstacles into account), the LPFM stations have a more-restrictive legally-defined minimum distance requirement.&lt;ref name="FCC-05-75A1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-75A1.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 47167.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An LPFM broadcaster is required to generate local content; if there are multiple applicants for the same frequency, those who agree to originate eight or more hours a day of local programming are favoured. Translators are not required to (and are not licensed to) originate anything locally.
* LPFM licenses are normally issued to non-commercial educational entities (such as schools or municipalities) and are subject to strict requirements largely precluding multiple stations under common ownership. The same is not true of translators. A non-commercial translator with no local content and no educational content is free to occupy space even in the non-commercial segment (below 92&amp;nbsp;MHz) of the U.S. FM broadcast band. During the narrow FCC filing windows for new applicants, multiple applications for broadcast translators from the same or related entities can be abused to request every locally available frequency in multiple communities.&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2006/2/Schulman.asp |title=Out of Thin Air |first=Daniel |last=Schulman |authorlink=Daniel Schulman (writer) |journal=Columbia Journalism Review |date=February 2006 |publisher=Cjrarchives.org |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-CJR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/f030506.htm |title=CJR on Godcasting Invasion, DIYmedia, March 5, 2006 |publisher=Diymedia.net |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216103516/http://www.diymedia.net/feature/f030506.htm |archive-date=December 16, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An LPFM license or construction permit cannot lawfully be resold. The same is not true for translators. A few related entities can easily file applications for thousands of individual translator construction permits via automated means, using non-commercial status to gain exemption from any FCC filing fees, then resell these construction permits ''en masse'' or individually for thousands of dollars each – even if the corresponding transmitters have not yet been constructed.&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f022505.htm |title=God Squads Fall From Grace, DIYmedia.net, February 25, 2005 |publisher=Diymedia.net |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125121339/http://diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f022505.htm |archive-date=January 25, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast translators for commercial stations are normally required to receive a signal from their parent full-service FM station [[Wireless|over-the-air]] and retransmit solely within the region which should be covered by the main station (this eliminates the need for a translator except in cases where the [[terrain shielding]] is a problem). This same restriction does not apply to [[non-commercial educational]] stations. Any non-commercial station, even one with no local or educational content to offer, can apply for an unlimited number of translators anywhere to be fed by any means (including via satellite). The end result is a network of hundreds of small local transmitters, none of which broadcast (and none of which can lawfully broadcast) programming of interest to the local community.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"/&gt; All take increasingly scarce available spectrum which otherwise could have been employed by local LPFM stations or used for rebroadcast of local full-service stations.&lt;ref name="Alternet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21639 |title=Right-wing Radio: Religious broadcasters are squeezing community radio right off the FM dial |author=Sarah Posner |publisher=Alternet.org |date=April 5, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related issue involves the use of full-power stations to carry [[broadcast automation|automated]] or satellite-originated programming. Any new full-service station can displace an existing low-power translator or an independent LPFM station; regulations allow this on the presumption that the full-service broadcaster would be more likely to provide a local voice to the community of license. Not all full-service broadcasters live up to this expectation. In some cases (such as the displacement of existing [[NPR|National Public Radio]] repeaters by newly created religious stations in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]]) the result has been the loss of local or educational content.&lt;ref name="newsmine"&gt;[http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=propoganda/religious-radio-targets-npr.txt Religious stations put squeeze on NPR, Blaine Harden, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 15, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; While an exactly opposite outcome to that which legislative intent had anticipated, often a small non-commercial educational translator was carrying content of higher quality than a satellite-fed full-power station for which it is displaced.

=====Great Translator Invasion of 2003=====
An FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/reference-room/special-report/02_rw_fm_trans_8-09.10.03.shtml |title=RW Special Report |publisher=RadioWorld.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821165946/http://www.radioworld.com/reference-room/special-report/02_rw_fm_trans_8-09.10.03.shtml |archive-date=August 21, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them coming from religious broadcasters. Due to the extremely high volume of license applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recnet.com/cdbs/fmq.php?facid=&amp;call=&amp;ccode=1&amp;latd=&amp;lond=&amp;city=&amp;state=&amp;country=US&amp;zip=&amp;party=calvary+chapel&amp;party_type=LICEN&amp;jaws=0 |title=REC Broadcast Query |publisher=Recnet.com |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; LPFM advocates describe this as the ''Great Translator Invasion''.&lt;ref name="CJR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recnet.com/traffic/ |title=REC – 'Traffick' Report – Great Translator Invasion |publisher=Recnet.com |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216105132/http://recnet.com/traffic/ |archive-date=December 16, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lpfm-gti"&gt;[http://www.lpfm.ws/news/gti.php LPFM.WS – Low Power FM – Great Translator Invasion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130142518/http://www.lpfm.ws/news/gti.php |date=January 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few broadcasters have taken advantage of FM translator regulations which allow non-commercial stations to feed distant translators from [[satellite]]-delivered programming hundreds or even thousands of miles outside the parent station's coverage area.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"&gt;[http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002147.html mediageek: Another Kind of Low-Power Station Hogging Radio Spectrum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006142045/http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002147.html |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is a misconception that all translators can be fed by satellites.  Only translators located on the non-commercial portion of the FM band (88.1 to 91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) can be so-called "satellators". All other translators must be fed off the air by direct radio reception, except in the case of so-called "fill-in" facilities that exist within the service contour of a primary station. Translators may also be used to feed other translators, so it is possible to create small chains of translators all fed from one distant station, however, this only works until the chain is broken and, if any one translator fails, the entire network beyond the failed translator would go down. The high volume of application in 2003 overloaded the FCC which issued an emergency hold order on new translator applications&lt;ref name="lpfm-gti"/&gt; until those which had been received were processed; this came after considerable criticism from LPFM lobbyist groups such as Prometheus Radio.&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"/&gt; These translator applications were all on the commercial band and none of them could be used as satellators. It is unknown how the one broadcast group with the most applications planned to deliver programming to all of the translators, but affiliated churches of the parent organization own broadcasting outlets in many of the cities.

Some [[religious broadcasting]] outlets – such as [[Calvary Chapel]]'s [[CSN International|KAWZ]] [[Twin Falls, Idaho]]; [[Educational Media Foundation]]; or [[Family Radio]]'s [[KEBR (FM)|KEBR]] [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] – are relayed by hundreds of FM "translator" stations across the U.S. As these parent stations are owned by non-profit organizations and they exist on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, they are not required to have their translators receive their signal over the air, as would be required for a commercial broadcaster.&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"/&gt; This has been used by a number of religious broadcasters to set up large [[satellite]]-based networks composed almost entirely of "distant translators" – translators outside of the market area (generally a 50-mile radius surrounding the transmitter).

Some LPFM advocates erroneously state that the proliferation of translators has posed difficulties for non-translator station operators, in particular LPFM license applicants who claim that they cannot get stations on the air due to translators eliminating any available channels in an area.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"/&gt; While this may be true for future LPFM applications, it is not true for any existing LPFM broadcasters or LPFM applicants. This is because the last LPFM filing window was in 2001. All translator applications from the 2003 window were required to protect the LPFM applications already pending or authorized at that time. As a result, no LPFM station was denied due to translators.

Since so-called sat-casting translators are only permitted on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, where LPFM stations do not exist, they pose no threat to the ability of existing LPFM licensees to expand their current station facilities.&lt;ref name="fybush-wavm"/&gt; Non-sat-casting translators may present a problem for existing LPFM stations:  if the LPFM station is "bumped" from its existing channel by a new full-power station, there may be no available frequency to which to move.&lt;ref name="Alternet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recnet.com/lpfminfo/encr0205.pdf FAC: 124266 CALL: NEW CHAN: 285 CMTY: ANCHORAGE AK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129140812/http://www.recnet.com/lpfminfo/encr0205.pdf |date=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freepress.net/news/7023 |title=Corporate bigfoot CSN tunes out community stations |publisher=FreePress.net |date=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210055447/http://www.freepress.net/news/7023 |archive-date=February 10, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://72.166.46.24/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017041017/http://72.166.46.24/boston/music/other_stories/documents/03042096.asp |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04509192.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC has, generally, not required LPFM stations to be displaced by full power stations. In such cases, the LPFM may be subject to increased interference from the full-powered move-in, but the FCC has adopted a "live and let live" policy that has been used to keep existing LPFM stations operating.

There is at least one proposed rulemaking that would revise the procedures by which nonprofit groups may apply for translators (thus disallowing more than a certain number of translator applications to be owned by any one entity); in addition, the FCC has modified channel requirements for LPFM broadcasters to open channel space.&lt;ref name="FCC-05-75A1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpfm.ws/news/99-25.php LPFM.WS – Low Power FM – powered by REC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131090841/http://www.lpfm.ws/news/99-25.php |date=January 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; REC Networks has filed a petition with the FCC that would, among other things, require the FCC to give higher priority to LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recnet.com/fcc/RM-11338.pdf |title=Before The |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208073111/http://www.recnet.com/fcc/RM-11338.pdf |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest satellite-fed translator networks are endeavors linked to [[CSN International|Calvary Chapel]] (including [[Radio Assist Ministry]], Horizon Broadcasting, and (formerly) [[Edgewater Broadcasting]] and REACH Media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002496.html mediageek: Something Fishy in Right-Wing-Christian-Translator-land, Grabbing Spectrum away from LPFM, Maybe Profiting from the Venture?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006141922/http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002496.html |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and American Family Radio owned by the [[American Family Association]].&lt;ref name="DIYmedia-godsquads"/&gt; The multiple networks associated with Calvary Chapel have been a particular focus in regard to translator-based networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f030105.htm |title=Religious Broadcasting As Franchise |publisher=DIYmedia.net |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208051521/http://www.diymedia.net/feature/lpfm/f030105.htm |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Wilson |url=http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/3/7/175231/4210 |title=Talk To Action &amp;#124; Reclaiming Citizenship, History, and Faith |publisher=Talk2action.org |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, multiple applications were submitted by different companies linked to Calvary Chapel in particular for the same channel.&lt;ref name="mediageek-2147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recnet.com/fcc/99-25-0325-reply-appA.pdf ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recnet.com/fcc/99-25-0305-reply-appA.pdf |title=RAM-EB Activity.xls |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208073049/http://www.recnet.com/fcc/99-25-0305-reply-appA.pdf |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four separate radio stations operated by Calvary Chapel churches and relaying Calvary Satellite Network programming have been identified as "home stations" for distant translators and there are many home churches in addition to the main "national" Calvary Chapel concerns applying for licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002506.html Mediageek: Calvary Chapel – The Decentralized Christian Clear Channel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008014255/http://www.mediageek.org/archives/002506.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of American Family Radio in particular, there are indications of a deliberate strategy to crowd out rebroadcasters of [[National Public Radio]] stations for political purposes.&lt;ref name="newsmine"/&gt;

Educational Media Foundation, owners of the K-Love [[contemporary Christian music]] radio network, have also been cited as applying for distant translators ''en masse''. {{CN|date=November 2018}}

=====Out-of-band translators=====
{{As of|2009}}, the FCC officially sanctioned the use of FM translators for [[Crossband operation|cross-band carriage]] of AM signals. Although some feel that this poses a threat to LPFM stations, the FCC did not authorize the use of any new FM translators for this purpose and limited cross-band translation to existing translators that had already been authorized as of May 2009. Since no new translators were authorized, there is no increased threat to LPFMs from cross-band translation services. The FCC also allows translation of [[HD Radio]] digital-only channels as inputs for analog FM-only output.

=====Sale of permits=====
Some groups have sold their translator [[construction permit]]s for a large [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]; this is most obvious with the Educational Media Foundation, which has traded both translators and desired call signs with [[iHeartMedia, Inc.|iHeartMedia]] (mainly involving various forms of "LV", "KLV" or "LVE", as was done with [[WLVE]]) in exchange for HD carriage on iHeart stations of K-LOVE and Air1. Other licensees have sold their translator stations for large amounts of money – sometimes tens of thousands of dollars or more, and many times what it costs to build one.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Australia===

====Radio====
Australia's national radio networks ([[Radio National]], [[ABC NewsRadio]], [[Triple J]], [[ABC Classic FM]] and [[SBS Radio]]) each have relay transmitters which allow each service to be broadcast as widely as possible. In order to provide this, the ABC and SBS both allow community-based relay transmitters to rebroadcast radio or television in areas which would otherwise have no service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/reception/services/selfhelp.htm |title=Self-Help Guide to Rebroadcasting – ABC Reception Advice |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial radio broadcasters normally have relay transmitters only if the local geography (such as mountainous terrain) prevents them from broadcasting to their entire market.

====Television====
Since market aggregation in the early 1990s, each television broadcaster transmits its service using multiple relays in order provide the same service throughout Australia's large market areas. While each market is often divided into submarkets due to the legacy of previous commercial broadcasts (for example, [[Southern Cross Nine]] maintains two separate stations in the single Victoria market, [[GLV/BCV|GLV and BCV]]), the only difference between these submarkets in practice is limited to news services or local advertising. Except in major cities, all major television broadcasters use the same network of transmitters, which may have dozens of relay stations in each market. As a result, some areas have had trouble starting [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia|digital]] or [[High-definition television|HD]] services due to problems with certain regional transmitters.

===Europe===
Because most radio and television systems in Europe are national networks, the entire radio or television system in some countries can be considered a collection of relay stations, in which each broadcaster uses a transmitter network (either developed by the public broadcaster or maintained through a government-funded authority) to provide broadcast services to the entire nation.

===Asia===
In most parts of Asia, satellite is the preferred method of getting national signal coverage in most countries (notable exceptions include Singapore, which outright bans civilian ownership of satellite receivers, and Malaysia, which only allows civilian ownership of receivers provided by [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]]). However, terrestrial-wise, the scenario is much like that of Europe – the systems are considered national networks and comprise a collection of relay stations, maintained by a government-funded authority. This is not the case in Japan, where television stations are either owned-and-operated by the networks or are affiliates owned by other media companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5709">'''SCS''' is an acronym for "''Sistema Cablaggio Semplificato''" ("Simplified Cable Solution"). It uses a [[fieldbus]] network protocol and has applications in the field of [[home automation]] and [[building automation]]. It is used mainly in [[Bticino|bTicino]] and [[Legrand (company)|Legrand]] installations.

==General features==
An SCS bus is based on a sheathed [[twisted pair]] formed of two flexible conductors; these are braided and unshielded with isolation 300/500V, [[Extra-low voltage#Separated_or_safety_extra-low_voltage_.28SELV.29|SELV]] as double isolation is required – according to the rules adopted by CEI (International Electrotechnical Committee). The bus is unpolarized, devices are required to support the DC power supply in both polarity.

===Wiring===
Two kind of wiring are possible:
*''Free cabling'' were a mix of bus and star topology are present, better for old houses
*''Star wiring'' were all devices are connected to the switch rack, better for new houses

===Communication===
Across the SCS bus four different types of signals are transmitted in frequency modulation:
* Electricity supply via 27 Vdc
* Data with a frequency clock of 9600&amp;nbsp;Hz
* Sound
* Video
The transmission protocol is the [[CSMA/CA]].

===Functions===
Through the SCS bus you have the following functions:
* Light control
* Automation
* Sound diffusion
* Energy management
* Thermoregulation
* Video intercom
* Alarm system
All the listed functions share the same technology and the same procedures for configuration / installation.

===Configuration===
All devices connected to SCS bus must be manually configured, no autolearn is possible, apart Alarm system and extenders. Configuration assign an address and an operating mode. Two kind of configurations are possible:
*''Physical'' - using numbered jumpers with different values [[resistor]]
*''Virtual'' - using a configuration [[software]] connected with an [[ethernet]] [[Residential gateway|gateway]]. In this case the address and operating mode are written in a non volatile memory in every device. Applying a physical jumper override the virtual configuration wiping the memory.

====Addressing details====
Device addressing use three different 'digits' '''A|PL|GR'''. The A mean the room, the PL is the Point of Load in the room, and GR is the group. Group join loads in same or different rooms in a logical manner. Not all devices has group addressing. All devices must answer to room broadcast called AMB. All devices must answer to general broadcast called GEN. Physical and Virtual addressing has different limitations:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
 ! digits
 ! Physical
 ! Virtual

|-
 ! A
 | 1-9
 | 0-10
 | 11 rooms max in a single SCS domain
|-
 ! PL

 | 0-15
 | A=0,PL=0 is forbidden, so 175 loads are addressable in a single SCS domain
|-
 ! GR
 | 1-9
 | 0-255
 | group
 |}
In big houses and buildings, SCS address extension is possible, were different address domains are connected via some bridges. Only some kind of messages can cross a bridge.

==Certifications==
Devices connected to the SCS bus are [http://www.imq.it/ IMQ]-certified and comply with these product standards ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) EN 50428 - IEC EN 60669-1/A1 - IEC EN 60669-2-1 - IEC EN 50090-2-2 - IEC EN 50090-2-3 ).

==Integration==
You can interact with the SCS bus through a [[Gateway (computer program)|gateway]] and an open high-level [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called [[OpenWebNet]]. Two kind of gateway exist:
*Gateway [[ethernet]] ([[Linux]] based)
*Gateway [[USB]] / [[RS232]]
These gateways are bidirectional; they translate SCS frames into OpenWebNet frames, and the other way round.
The open protocol OpenWebNet shared by [http://www.myopen-legrandgroup.com MyOpen] [[community]], let everybody to build software that interact with SCS devices. SCS protocol is a proprietary bTicino protocol. Interaction with other field bus must happen only writing software that use OpenWebNet.

'''Arthur Coney Tunnard'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21743.htm#i217424] Arthur Christopher Tunnard, M, #217424, b. 7 July 1910&lt;/ref&gt; (1910 in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]] – 1979), later known as Christopher Tunnard, was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born [[landscape architect]], [[garden designer]], city-planner, and author of ''Gardens in the Modern Landscape'' (1938).

==Biography==
Christopher Tunnard was the son of Christopher Coney Tunnard (1879-1939), second son of Charles Thomas Tunnard of Frampton House, near [[Boston, Lincolnshire]] (now a Residential care home) and Madeline Kingscote (b. 7 Jul 1881, d. Jan 1977). He had one younger brother, Peter Kingscote Tunnard (b. 11 December 1919, d. 16 March 1940), died at age 20. Tunnard's uncle was John Charles Tunnard (b. 1873) whose only son was British surrealist artist [[John Tunnard]] (1900–1971). Another uncle was Thomas Monkton Tunnard (b. 1882) of [[Birtles Hall]], vicar of [[Over Alderley]], who married Grace Cook and fathered pianist Viola Mary Tunnard (1916-1974), Thomas Newburgh Tunnar (b. 1919) and gallery owner Peter Humphrey Tunnard (b. 1920).&lt;ref name="Landscape" /&gt;

Born and educated in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], where his [[Lincolnshire]]-born father had moved as a young man, in 1929 Christopher Tunnard went to England and obtained a Diploma from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in 1930.

From 1932-1935 he worked as a garden designer for [[Percy Cane]], an exponent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. He then embarked on a European tour, becoming interested in [[avant-garde]] art and architecture. In 1936, he started his own practice for landscape architecture in London.

His noted landscape projects include his landscape architecture for [[Serge Chermayeff]]'s house [[Bentley Wood (Chermayeff)|Bentley Wood]] at [[East Hoathly with Halland|Halland]], [[Sussex]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apl.ncl.ac.uk/coursework/IThompson/modernism.htm Modernism], History of Environmental Design course notes, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape&lt;/ref&gt; and for his modification of existing 18th-century gardens at the circular [[Art Deco]] [[St Ann's Court]] (a [[Grade II* listed buildings in Runnymede (district)|Grade II* Listed Building]]) in [[Chertsey]] designed by [[Raymond McGrath]], where Tunnard lived for a short time with his then partner, the stockbroker GL Schlesinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Going Full Circle | first = Fay | last = Sweet | newspaper = The Evening Standard | place = London | date = August 8, 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a series of articles for the [[Architectural Review]], later re-published as a manifesto, ''Gardens in the Modern Landscape''. In 1939, he designed the garden for the "All-Europe House" at the [[Ideal Home Show|Ideal Home Exhibition]], [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = An All-Europe House: A Pocket Ideal Home | newspaper = The Times | place = UK | date = April 28, 1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he emigrated to America, at the invitation of [[Walter Gropius]], to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. From 1938 to 1943 Tunnard taught at Harvard. While in Massachusetts, he designed several gardens for modern houses, photos and/or drawings of which he later published in the second edition of his book in 1948. Among them were a small courtyard garden for the Koch House in Cambridge by Edward D. Stone and Carl Koch; planning with Koch the early modern residential development at Snake Hill Road in Belmont; and a garden for an expansive rural site in Lincoln with a new house by architect G. Holmes Perkins, who was on the Harvard faculty with Tunnard.

During the 1943/44 academic year, Tunnard lived in the Greenwich Village with his mother Madeline Kingscote. Madeline had moved to New York City to be near her other son, Peter Kingscote, who was with the Michael Chekhov's Theatre Studio at Ridgefield, CT, 40 miles away. Peter was an aspiring poet and short stories writer, but his career was cut short when he died just 20 years old in mid-1940.&lt;ref name="Landscape" /&gt;

Christopher Tunnard was drafted into the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in 1943 and after the war took a job teaching city planning at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Enjoying the work, he did little further garden design, and reached the post of professor and chairman of the department of city planning. His publications in this area include articles such as ''America's super-cities''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.harpers.org/archive/1958/08/0008790 | title = America's super-cities | first = Christopher | last = Tunnard | journal = Harper's Magazine |date=August 1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of books on city design in the U.S. The best known may be ''Man-made America: Chaos or Control?'' (1963), by Tunnard and [[Boris Pushkarev]],&lt;ref name=yaledisc&gt;{{Citation | title = Yale disciplines three of its staff | newspaper = The Times | date = May 28, 1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which won the 1964 [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science, Philosophy and Religion|in Science, Philosophy and Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1061EFF3A5C147A93C3A81788D85F408685F9 | title = National Book Awards Are Presented to Six Authors; Prizes of $1,000 Given for the Best Works Published in '63 | first = Harold ‘Harry’ | last = Gilroy | newspaper = The New York Times | date = March 11, 1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1964&gt;{{Citation| url = https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1964 | title = National Book Awards – 1964 | publisher = [[National Book Foundation]] | accessdate = 2012-03-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Yale disciplined him by demotion for sending out unauthorized admission letters to prospective students, following an unresolved departmental dispute.&lt;ref name="yaledisc"/&gt;

==Landscape architecture and garden design==
One of Tunnard’s main projects was Chermayeff's [[Bentley Wood (Chermayeff)|Bentley Wood]] in Halland Sussex in 1928. This project was shown in [[Architectural Review]] and his book [[Gardens in the Modern Landscape]].  In describing the gardens surrounding the building, Tunnard refers to them as to being in perfect harmony. The thinning of the trees left shaded lawn that gradually led up to the house and left room for daffodils and evergreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Modern Architecture in the Sussex Landscape | journal = Architectural Review | volume = 85 | year = 1939 | pages = 61–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not a formal garden. The trees are formed in relation to the house in groups or by themselves. This is a concept that Tunnard describes as "letting space flow by breaking down division between usable areas and incidentally increasing their usability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tunnard | first = Christopher | title = Modern Gardens for Modern Houses: Reflections on Current Trends in Landscape Design | journal = Landscape Architecture | year = 1942 | pages = 57–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Tunnard’s projects was at Galby Leicestershire House, in collaboration with architect Raymond McGrath. The building materials for the house were chosen to fit in with the scenery. For example, some remnants of the former great estates of Beaudesert were used to build the new building. In addition, Tunnard wanted the garden to be interpreted as a link between the house and the open landscape, than merely as a formal garden.

==Design philosophy==
Tunnard came to England in a period when garden design was strongly influenced by the work of [[Edwin Lutyens]], [[Gertrude Jekyll]] and [[Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott]]. The eclectic [[Arts and Crafts movement]] was drawing on this background to focus on garden features such as [[crazy paving]], [[pergola]]s, [[sundial]]s, sunken pools and [[statuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A century in a nutshell | first = Timothy ‘Tim’ | last = Richardson | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | place = London | date = November 5, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnard viewed this as "romantic trivialisation" of garden design and in reaction spearheaded a [[Modernism|Modernist]] approach to landscape design, which he expressed in the [[polemic]]al ''Gardens in the Modern Landscape''. His approach avoided decoration, sentimentality and classical allusion in favour of functional minimalist designs. For instance, his acclaimed landscape for Chermayeff's Bentley Wood house, itself Modernist, simply thinned the surrounding woodland and replanted areas with drifts of [[daffodil]]s. His writings influenced a further generation of designers such as [[Thomas Dolliver Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Keep it sleek: Architects and garden design rarely make good bedfellows — with the exception of a new breed of Modernists | first = Timothy ‘Tim’ | last = Richardson | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | place = London | date = April 23, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gardens in the Modern Landscape''==
First published as a series of articles in [[Architectural Review]] from October 1937 to September 1938, [[Gardens in the Modern Landscape]] significantly challenged the then current views of landscape architecture.

[[Geoffrey Jellicoe]] reviewed Gardens in the Modern Landscape in the magazine Architecture Review and overall gave a great praise to Tunnard’s work.  As it debunks previous and most accepted styles of landscape architecture, Tunnard meets with new nature, and questioning and breaking apart most widely accepted conventions, such as symmetry and the containment of the garden to a picture. He described the book as "if you can take the jolts you will be pleasantly introduced to the brave new world of landscape," referring the jolts as this challenge to current conventions.&lt;ref name="Jellicoe, G. The Dynamic Garden 1939 pp. 151-152"&gt;{{Citation | last = Jellicoe | first = G | title = The Dynamic Garden: Gardens in the Modern Landscape | journal = Architectural Review | volume = 85 | year = 1939 | pages = 151–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, Jellicoe reviews the new landscape that Tunnard describes as having a response from readers as either "shocked from it altogether, or carried off their feet with enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="Jellicoe, G. The Dynamic Garden 1939 pp. 151-152"/&gt; 
 
[[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Dan Kiley]] and [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], while together at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard during 1936 to 1938, cite reading Gardens in the Modern Landscape as inspiration against the strict rules of the curriculum of the GSD and a major influence for their work. Walker, Peter, and Melanie Simo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation | title = Invisible Gardens: The Search for Modernism in the American Landscape | place = Cambridge | publisher = The MIT}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence Halprin]] cites [[Gardens in the Modern Landscape]] as a revelation for him and his future career. From the book, the most enduring idea for Halprin being "A garden is a work of art, and it remains a vision for guidance as one tries to extend the garden’s benefits of rest, recreation, and aesethic pleasure to a wider public, in the larger landscape." Walker 150 Moreover, Halprin wanted to study under Tunnard. For his graduate studies, he went to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|GSD]] at Harvard and under Tunnard and other influential men, Halprin studied landscape architecture. Later, with Tunnard, Halprin produced an issue of Task magazine. Walker, Peter, and Melanie Simo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The functional garden==
[[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] derives from a doctrine of "fit for purpose." Is the object made fit its purpose? From this arises a more simple and clear way of planning, and not embellished with materials or things not fit for the purpose. For Tunnad, the creation of modern houses lacked modern surroundings, which he wanted to create. Flowers are not created to just be created but to be enjoyed by children.  Gardens are not necessarily symmetrical because there is no need outside of simply being symmetrical. Tunnard cites the Swedish Garden Architect’s Associations’ paper as describing this new garden as

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;paths and walks are reduced to the minimum and often consist only of stepping stones between which grass or creeping plants are allowed to grow, thus conserving a homogeneity between the unites of the plan. Trees are not numerous in these gardens; most people prefer to have flowering shrubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The styles, axial and symmetrical planning, ostentatious decoration- all this rhetoric has been discarded to make way for simple statement. That which is necessary is such a planning system automatically become that which is good and the need for space filling or accentuating decoration disappears. The designer thus confines decoration to the integers of the plan, whose functions will determine their forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional garden avoids the extremes both of the sentimental expressionism of the wild garden and the intellectual classicism of the "formal" garden; it embodies rather a spirit of rationalism and through an aesthetic and practical ordering of its units provides a friendly and hospitable milieu for rest and recreation. It is, in effect, the social conception of the garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tunnard | first = Christopher | title = Gardens in the Modern Landscape | year = 1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Fletcher Steele]], noted landscape architect, agrees with Tunnard’s views of modern building design, but pointed out that Tunnard’s views as being another style and not a possible universal conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Fletcher | title = Comment on Modern Gardens for Modern Houses: Reflections on Current Trends in Landscape Design | journal = Landscape Architecture | year = 1942 | pages = 57–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==City planning==
Tunnard’s latter years were spent away from landscape architecture. He taught at [[Yale University]] for [[city planning]], became more focused on preserving historic buildings, and wrote many books on urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tunnard, Christopher | title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture | first = James Stevens | last = Curl | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | accessdate = 27 February 2009 | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t1.e6116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eckbo]] stated that landscape architect lost a great man when Tunnard went into city planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eckbo | first = Garrett | title = Letter to the Editor | journal = Landscape Architecture | year = 1980 | page = 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''citation index''' is a kind of [[bibliographic index]], an index of [[citation]]s between publications, allowing the user to easily establish which later documents cite which earlier documents. A form of citation index is first found in 12th-century Hebrew religious literature. Legal citation indexes are found in the 18th century and were made popular by [[citator]]s such as [[Shepard's Citations]] (1873). In 1960, [[Eugene Garfield]]'s [[Institute for Scientific Information]] (ISI) introduced the first citation index for papers published in [[academic journal]]s, first the ''[[Science Citation Index]]'' (SCI), and later the ''[[Social Sciences Citation Index]]'' (SSCI) and the ''[[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]]'' (AHCI). The first automated citation indexing was done by [[CiteSeer]] in 1997. Other sources for such data include [[Google Scholar]] and Elsevier's [[Scopus]].

==History==
The earliest known citation index is an index of biblical citations in [[rabbinic literature]], the ''Mafteah ha-Derashot'', attributed to [[Maimonides]] and probably dating to the 12th century. It is organized alphabetically by biblical phrase. Later biblical citation indexes are in the order of the canonical text. These citation indices were used both for general and for legal study. The Talmudic citation index ''En Mishpat'' (1714) even included a symbol to indicate whether a Talmudic decision had been overridden, just as in the 19th-century ''Shepard's Citations''.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Hass Weinberg, "The Earliest Hebrew Citation Indexes" in Trudi Bellardo Hahn, Michael Keeble Buckland, eds., ''Historical Studies in Information Science'', 1998, p. 51''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bella Hass Weinberg, "Predecessors of Scientific Indexing Structures in the Domain of Religion" in W. Boyden Rayward, Mary Ellen Bowden, ''The History and Heritage of Scientific and Technological Information Systems'', Proceedings of the 2002 Conference, 2004, p. 126''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike modern scholarly citation indexes, only references to one work, the Bible, were indexed.

In English legal literature, volumes of judicial reports included lists of cases cited in that volume starting with ''Raymond's Reports'' (1743) and followed by ''Douglas's Reports'' (1783). Simon Greenleaf (1821) published an alphabetical list of cases with notes on later decisions affecting the precedential authority of the original decision.&lt;ref name='shapiro'/&gt;

The first true citation index dates to the 1860 publication of Labatt's ''Table of Cases...California...'', followed in 1872 by Wait's ''Table of Cases...New York...''. But the most important and best-known citation index came with the 1873 publication of [[Shepard's Citations]].&lt;ref name='shapiro'&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, "Origins of Bibliometrics, Citation Indexing, and Citation Analysis: The Neglected Legal Literature" ''Journal of the American Society of Information Science'' '''43''':5:337-339 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major citation indexing services==
{{main article|Indexing and abstracting service}}
{{main cat|Citation indices}}
General-purpose, subscription-based academic citation indexes include:
*[[Web of Science]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of [[Thomson Reuters]])
*[[Scopus]] by [[Elsevier]], available online only, which similarly combines subject searching with citation browsing and tracking in the sciences and [[social sciences]].
Each of these offer an index of citations between publications and a mechanism to establish which documents cite which other documents. They are not open-access and differ widely in cost: Web of Science and Scopus are available by subscription (generally to libraries).

In addition, [[CiteSeer]] and [[Google Scholar]] are freely available online. 

Several open-access, subject-specific citation indexing services also exist, such as:
*[[INSPIRE-HEP]] which covers high energy physics,   
*[[PubMed]], which covers life sciences and biomedical topics, and 
*[[Astrophysics Data System]] which covers astronomy and physics.

{{Anarchism sidebar}}
'''Collectivist anarchism''' (also known as '''anarcho-collectivism''') is a [[revolutionary]]&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism|anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] as it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"&gt;Bakunin Mikail. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Thus notwithstanding the title, [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "collectivist anarchism" is seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: ''The Philosophy of Freedom''. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]] and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

== The First International ==
[[File:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|left|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]

[[Giuseppe Fanelli]] met Bakunin at [[Ischia]] in 1866.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to [[Barcelona]] to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the [[International Workingmen's Association]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=12–15}} Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish exiles]], the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], to the First National.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=13}} In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} While in Barcelona again, he met with painter [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] and his cousin [[Rafael Farga i Pellicer|Rafael Farga Pellicer]] along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} as well as the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance]] section.

In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action: {{quote|[W]e must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

These ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the Paris Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as [[Marxism|Marxists]] were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a "rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/paris-commune.htm The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term "collectivism" to distinguish themselves from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with [[Karl Marx]]. Bakunin wrote that "we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian ("Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism", 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=marxists.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress (see below), illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was "Marx’s flamboyant chief opponent" and "presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people".&lt;ref&gt;Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/20/00023/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own First International at the [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]] [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Congress]], adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], Black Rose Books, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx’s [[class analysis]] and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging "Marx’s genius", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized "[[authoritarian socialism]]" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] which he adamantly refused.

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government", in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm No profile created for this contactAnarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One |]. Black Rose Books. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the First International, Jose Llunas Pujols, in his essay "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt;

By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full [[communism]]. The anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay "The Collectivist Wages System", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892.

Bakunin's socialism was known as "collectivist anarchism", where "socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor".&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm ''Revolutionary Catechism''], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"/&gt;

=== Critique of Marxism ===
The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that vanguardist socialism including Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.&lt;ref name=GW158&gt;Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', p. 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".&lt;ref name="Struggle.ws"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.&lt;ref name=GW158/&gt; Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.

{{quote|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.|Mikhail Bakunin, ''Statism and Anarchism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm |title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2 |publisher=Gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, [[egalitarian]] society [[Classless society|without social classes]] and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the [[direct action]] of the masses, culminating in [[social revolution]]; and refuse any intermediate stage such as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844: {{quote|As far as learning was concerned, Marx was, and still is, incomparably more advanced than I. I knew nothing at that time of political economy, I had not yet rid myself of my metaphysical observations... He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that "[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader".&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily Tribune (October 2, 1852) on 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Germany'&lt;/ref&gt; Marx wrote to [[Friedrich Engels]] of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: "On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the "[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine".

Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the [[lumpenproletariat]] and the [[proletariat]]. As such, "[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/pubs/marxism_anarchism_roberston.pdf|title="Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict – Part Two" by Ann Robertson.|website=workerscompass.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statism and Anarchy.jpg|thumb|''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'' by Bakunin, Russian first print (1873)]]

=== Comparison with anarcho-communism ===
The difference between collectivist anarchism and [[anarcho-communism]] is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Anarchist communism, like collectivist anarchism, also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of "to each according to his labor", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim "to each according to his needs".&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph sourced by Shatz, Marshall; Guess, Raymond; Skinner, Quentin. The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings. Cambridge University Press. p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while communist anarchism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. It could thus be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could thus be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.

Collectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of [[labour voucher]]s or "personal credit" (such as [[Participatory economics|participatory economists]]). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would "guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue for [[workplace autonomy]] and self-management "the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with anarcho-communism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of "money" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, "[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community becomes stronger, money will disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA3.html%23seca32&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:42:45 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Performance ==
Application of many collectivist anarchists projects have been successful&lt;ref name="libcom.org"&gt;"Workers Power and the Spanish Revolution," by Tom Wetzel, http://libcom.org/library/workers-power-and-the-spanish-revolution-tom-wetzel&lt;/ref&gt; as sources during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] noted in the Catalan region: {{quote|In distribution the collectives' co-operatives eliminated middlemen, small merchants, wholesalers, and profiteers, thus greatly reducing consumer prices. The collectives eliminated most of the parasitic elements from rural life, and would have wiped them out altogether if they were not protected by corrupt officials and by the political parties. Non-collectivised areas benefited indirectly from the lower prices as well as from free services often rendered by the collectives (laundries, cinemas, schools, barber and beauty parlours, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tom Wetzel describes another collectivization: {{quote|Another industry that was totally re-organized was hair-cutting. Before July 19th, there had been 1,100 hairdressing parlors in Barcelona, most of them extremely marginal. The 5,000 assistant hairdressers were among the lowest-paid workers in Barcelona. The Generalitat had decreed a 40-hour week and 15 percent wage increase after July 19th—one of the Esquerra’s attempts to woo worker support. This spelled ruin for many hairdressing shops. A general assembly was held and it was agreed to shut down all the unprofitable shops. The 1,100 shops were replaced by a network of 235 neighborhood haircutting centers, with better equipment and lighting than the old shops. Due to the efficiencies gained, it was possible to raise wages by 40 percent. The entire network was run through assemblies of the CNT barber’s union. The former owners became members of the union.&lt;ref name="libcom.org"/&gt;}}

{{wiktionary}}
'''Comic relief''' is the inclusion of a [[humour|humorous]] character, scene, or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious work, often to relieve tension.

==Definition==
Comic relief usually means a releasing of emotional or other tension resulting from a comic episode interposed in the midst of serious or tragic elements in a drama. Comic relief often takes the form of a bumbling, [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]ing [[sidekick]] of the [[hero]] or [[villain]] in a work of fiction. A sidekick used for comic relief will usually comment on the absurdity of the [[hero]]'s situation and make comments that would be inappropriate for a character who is to be taken seriously. Other characters may use comic relief as a means to irritate others or keep themselves confident.

==Use==
Sometimes comic relief characters will appear in fiction that is [[comic]]. This generally occurs when the work enters a [[drama]]tic moment, but the character continues to be comical  regardless.
[[Greek tragedy]] did not allow any comic relief within the drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/European-History-670/Greek-Tragedy-English-Tragedy.htm|title=Greek Tragedy and English Tragedy|last=Rutherford|first=Sam|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a tradition of concluding a series of several tragic performances with a humorous [[satyr play]]. Even the Elizabethan critic Sidney following [[Horace]]’s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' pleaded for the exclusion of  comic elements  from a tragic  drama. But in the Renaissance England Marlowe among the [[University Wits]] introduced comic relief through  the presentation of crude scenes in Doctor Faustus following the native tradition of Interlude which was usually introduced between two tragic plays. In fact, in the classical tradition the mingling of the tragic and the comic was not allowed.

==Examples==
[[William Shakespeare]] deviated from the classical tradition and used comic relief in ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The Porter scene in ''Macbeth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tromly |first=Frederic B.|date=Spring 1975|title=Macbeth and His Porter |journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=26|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.2307/2869244|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|jstor=2869244}}&lt;/ref&gt; the grave-digger scene in ''Hamlet'' and the gulling of Roderigo provide immense comic relief. The mockery of the fool in ''[[King Lear]]'' may also be regarded as a comic relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Draudt|first=Manfred|year=2002|title=The Comedy of Hamlet|journal=Atlantis|volume=24|issue=2|pages=85–107|issn=0210-6124|url=http://www.atlantisjournal.org/Papers/24_1/draudt.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De architectura.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1521 [[Italian language]] edition of ''De architectura'', translated and illustrated by [[Cesare Cesariano]]]]
[[File:De Architectura027.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Manuscript of Vitruvius; parchment dating from about 1390]]
'''{{lang|la|De architectura}}''' ('''''On architecture''''', published as '''''Ten Books on Architecture''''') is a treatise on [[architecture]] written by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[architect]] and military engineer [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] and dedicated to his patron, the emperor [[Caesar Augustus]], as a guide for [[Caesar Augustus#Building projects|building projects]]. As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kruft, Hanno-Walter. ''A History of Architectural Theory from Vitruvius to the Present'' (New York, Princeton Architectural Press: 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a variety of information on Greek and Roman buildings, as well as prescriptions for the planning and design of military camps, cities, and structures both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments).&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius. ''Ten Books on Architecture'', Ed. Ingrid Rowland with illustrations by Thomas Noble Howe (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press: 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Vitruvius published before the development of cross vaulting, domes, concrete, and other innovations associated with Imperial Roman architecture, his ten books are not regarded as a source of information on these hallmarks of Roman building design and technology.&lt;ref&gt;See William L. MacDonald, ''The Architecture of the Roman Empire: An Introductory Study'' (New Haven, Yale University Press: 1982): 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and contents==
Probably written between 30 and 15 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Directory GmbH|url=http://www.vitruvius-pollio.com/|publisher=Vitruvius-pollio.com|accessdate=03-09-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it combines the knowledge and views of many antique writers, both Greek and Roman, not only on architecture but on the arts, natural history and building technology. Vitruvius cites many authorities throughout the text, often praising Greek architects for their development of temple building and the orders (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), and providing key accounts of the origins of building in the primitive hut.

Though often cited for his famous "triad" of characteristics associated with architecture—utilitas, firmitas and venustas (commodity, firmness and delight)--the aesthetic principles that influenced later treatise writers were outlined in Book III. Derived partially from Latin rhetoric (through Cicero and Varro), Vitruvian terms for order, arrangement, proportion, and fitness for intended purposes have guided architects for centuries, and continue to do so today. The Roman author also gave advice on the qualifications of an architect (Book I) and on types of architectural drawing.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Vitruvius: ''On Architecture'', edited and translated into English by Frank Granger (Cambridge, Harvard University Press: 1931-34).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in ''De architectura''. He covered a wide variety of subjects he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects that may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings.

Vitruvius, thus, deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book {{roman|2}} of ''De architectura'', he advises architects working with bricks to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book {{roman|9}} relates the abstract [[geometry]] of [[Plato]] to the everyday work of the [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]. [[Astrology]] is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while [[astronomy]] is required for the understanding of [[sundial]]s. Likewise, Vitruvius cites [[Ctesibius|Ctesibius of Alexandria]] and [[Archimedes]] for their inventions, [[Aristoxenus]] ([[Aristotle]]'s apprentice) for music, [[Agatharchus]] for theatre, and [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] for architecture.

===Buildings===
[[File:Greekhse1.jpg|right|thumb|Greek house plan by Vitruvius]]
Vitruvius sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the artist's work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from ''De architectura'' is one still quoted by architects:  "Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight."  This quote is taken from Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s version of 1624, and is a plain and accurate translation of the passage in Vitruvius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#3.2 (I.iii.2)]: but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word "commodity", and the tag is usually misunderstood. A modern interpretation of Wotton's English might render it thus: "The ideal building has three elements; it is sturdy, useful, and beautiful."

Vitruvius also studied human proportions (Book {{roman|3}}) and his ''canones'' were later encoded in a very famous drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (''Homo Vitruvianus'', "[[Vitruvian Man]]").

==Roman technology==
[[File:ballista.gif|thumb|left|A Roman Ballista]]

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]]]]
''De architectura'' is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures, such as hoists, [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, and [[pulleys]], as well as war machines such as [[catapult]]s, [[ballistae]], and [[siege engine]]s.  Vitruvius also described the construction of sundials and [[water clock]]s, and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).

===Aqueducts and mills===
Books {{roman|8}}, {{roman|9}}, and {{roman|10}} of ''De architectura'' form the basis of much of what is known about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France.  Numerous such massive structures occur across the former empire, a testament to the power of [[Roman engineering]].  Vitruvius' description of Roman aqueduct construction is short, but mentions key details especially for the way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed.

His book would have been of assistance to [[Frontinus]], a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many [[aqueducts of Rome]]. Frontinus wrote ''[[De aquaeductu]]'', the definitive treatise on 1st-century Roman aqueducts, and discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. The Roman Empire went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no fewer than 16 [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in France demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known, such as the much later [[Hierapolis sawmill]].

===Materials===
Vitruvius described many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting. [[Cement]], [[concrete]], and [[lime (material)|lime]] received in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design.

Vitruvius advised that [[lead]] should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred.  He comes to this conclusion in Book {{roman|8}} of ''De architectura'' after empirical observation of the apparent laborer illnesses in the [[plumbum]] foundries of his time. In 1986, the United States banned the use of lead in plumbing due to lead poisoning's neurological damage. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, and coated the inner surfaces of the pipes, so [[lead poisoning]] was unlikely.
[[File:VitruviusTenBooksMHMorgan1914p295.gif|thumb|right|Design for an Archimedean water-screw]]
Vitruvius related the famous story about Archimedes and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realized the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of [[Eureka (word)|''"Eureka!"'']], and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure gold. He showed the crown had been alloyed with silver, and the king was defrauded.

===Dewatering machines===
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]
[[File:WaterwheelsSp.jpg|right|thumb|Sequence of drainage wheels found in Spanish mine]]
Vitruvius described the construction of the [[Archimedes' screw]] in Chapter 10, although did not mention Archimedes by name.  It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines mentioned in ''De architectura'' include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain and [[Dolaucothi]] in west Wales. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the [[British Museum]], and one from the latter in the [[National Museum of Wales]]. The remains were discovered when these mines were reopened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least {{convert|96|ft|abbr=out}} above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as [[water wheels]] to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, [[fulling]], and so on.

===Force pump===
[[Ctesibius]] is credited with the invention of the [[force pump]], which Vitruvius described as being built from [[bronze]] with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in his ''Pneumatica''. The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentioned its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire engine. One was found at [[Roman Silchester]] or [[Calleva Atrebatum]] in England, and another is on display at the [[British Museum]]. Their functions are not described, but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specified.

Vitruvius also mentioned the several [[automaton]]s [[Ctesibius]] invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function.

===Central heating===
[[File:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa: The part under the ''[[exedra]]'' is covered.]]
Vitruvius described the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the [[hypocaust]], a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so [[fuel efficiency]] is maximized; for example, the ''[[caldarium]]'' is next to the ''[[tepidarium]]'' followed by the ''[[frigidarium]]''. He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]].

===Surveying instruments===
That Vitruvius must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or ''[[chorobates]]'', which he compared favourably with the ''[[groma surveying|groma]]'', a device using [[plumb line]]s. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He described the ''[[Surveyor's wheel|hodometer]]'', in essence a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the [[Peutinger Table]].

===Sea level change===
In Book {{roman|4}} Chapter 1 Subsection 4 of ''De architectura'' is a description of 13 [[Athenian]] cities in [[Asia Minor]], "the land of [[Caria]]", in present-day Turkey. These cities are given as: [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Samos]], [[Teos]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Chius]], [[Erythrae]], [[Phocaea]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Lebedos]], [[Malta#History|Melite]], and later a 14th, [[Smyrna]]eans. Myus, the third city, is described as being "long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage".  This sentence indicates, at the time of Vitruvius's writing, it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from south to north so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case, then since the writing of ''De architectura'', the region has experienced either soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, or speculation of such, during the later-empire many Roman ports suffered from what contemporary writers described as 'silting'. The constant need to dredge ports became a heavy burden on the treasury and some have speculated that this expense significantly contributed to the eventual collapse of the empire. Roman salt works in Essex County, England, today are located at the five-metre contour, implying this was the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilman, Paul |title="Securing a Future for Essex's Past" Heritage Conservation Planning Division, Essex County Council England|publisher=Esri.com|url=http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/1099/essex.html|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Survival and rediscovery==
Vitruvius' work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace ''[[scriptorium]]'' of [[Charlemagne]] in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical [[manuscript]]s is part of what is called the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].) Many of the surviving manuscripts of Vitruvius' work derive from an existing manuscript that was written there, [[British Library]] manuscript Harley 2767.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8557&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=2767 |title=Details of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These texts were not just copied, but also known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, bishop [[Einhard]], asked the visiting English churchman [[Alcuin]] for explanations of some technical terms.  In addition, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, including: Vussin, [[Hrabanus Maurus]], [[Hermann of Reichenau]], [[Hugo of St. Victor]], Gervase of Melkey, [[William of Malmesbury]], Theoderich of St. Trond, [[Peter the Deacon|Petrus Diaconus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Filippo Villani]], [[Jean de Montreuil]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Giovanni de Dondi]], Domenico di Bandino, [[Niccolò Acciaioli]] bequeathed copy to the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence]], [[Bernward of Hildesheim]], and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Many copies of ''De architectura'', dating from the 8th to the 15th centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the [[Middle Ages]] and 92 are still available in public collections, but they appear to have received little attention, possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the loss of most of the original 10 illustrations thought by some to be helpful in understanding parts of the text.

Vitruvius' work was "rediscovered" in 1414 by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Poggio Bracciolini]], who found it in the Abbey of [[St Gallen]], Switzerland. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of [[Renaissance]] thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving.
[[File:De Architectura030.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', illustration in the edition of ''De architectura'' by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521)]]

The first printed edition (''editio princeps''), an ''[[incunabula]]'' version,  was published by the [[Verona|Veronese]] scholar [[Fra Giovanni Sulpitius]] in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496), but none were illustrated. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Fra Giovanni Giocondo]] produced the first version illustrated with [[woodcut]]s in [[Venice]] in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations.

Translations into Italian were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by [[Cesare Cesariano]], a Milanese friend of the architect [[Bramante]], printed in [[Como]] in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languages{{spaced ndash}}the first German version was published in 1528{{spaced ndash}}and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by [[Claude Perrault]], commissioned by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1664.

The first English translation followed in 1692, although [[John Shute (architect)|John Shute]] had drawn on the text as early as 1563 for his book ''The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture''. The 1692 translation was an abridgment based on the French version of Claude Perrault.  English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s 1624 version ''The Elements of Architecture'' was more of a free adaptation than a literal translation, while a 1692 translation was much abbreviated. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius' work had become a popular subject of [[hermeneutics]], with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed.

==Impact==
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|''Vitruvian man'', Leonardo da Vinci, (c. 1485-90)]]
The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the [[Renaissance]], prompting the rebirth of Classical architecture in subsequent centuries. Renaissance architects, such as [[Niccoli]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]], found in ''De architectura'' their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a [[scientific discipline]] as well as emphasising the skills of the [[artisan]].  [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s  best known drawing, ''the [[Vitruvian man]]'', is based on the concepts of proportion developed by Vitruvius.

The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] and the Frenchman [[Salomon de Caus]] were among the first to re-evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and [[science]]s based upon number and [[proportion (architecture)]]. The 16th-century architect [[Palladio]] considered Vitruvius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on Vitruvius' work before conceiving his own architectural precepts.

===Astrolabe===
The earliest evidence of use of the [[stereographic projection]] in a machine is in ''De architectura'' which describes an anaphoric clock (it is presumed, a clepsydra or [[water clock]]) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the 1st to 3rd centuries have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were, it is presumed, fairly widespread among Romans.

'''''De novo'' transcriptome assembly''' is the [[De novo sequence assemblers|de novo sequence assembly]] method of creating a [[transcriptome]] without the aid of a [[reference genome]].

== Introduction ==
As a result of the development of novel sequencing technologies, the years between 2008 and 2012 saw a large drop in the cost of sequencing. Per megabase and genome, the cost dropped to 1/100,000th and 1/10,000th of the price, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wetterstrand KA |title=DNA Sequencing Costs: Data from the NHGRI Large-Scale Genome Sequencing Program Available at: www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts |publisher=Genome.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, only transcriptomes of organisms that were of broad interest and utility to scientific research were sequenced; however, these developed in 2010s [[high-throughput sequencing]] (also called next-generation sequencing) technologies are both cost- and labor- effective, and the range of organisms studied via these methods is expanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Surget-Groba Y, Montoya-Burgos JI |year=2010 |title=Optimization of de novo transcriptome assembly from next-generation sequencing data |journal=Genome Res. |volume=20 |pages=1432–1440 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/10/1432.full |doi=10.1101/gr.103846.109 |pmid=20693479 |issue=10 |pmc=2945192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcriptomes have subsequently been created for [[chickpea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Garg R, Patel RK, Tyagi AK, Jain M |year=2011 |title=De novo assembly of chickpea transcriptome using short reads for gene discovery and marker identification |journal=DNA Res. |volume=18 |pages=53–63 |doi=10.1093/dnares/dsq028 |pmid=21217129 |issue=1 |pmc=3041503}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[planarian]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Adamidi C |year=2011 |title=De novo assembly and validation of planaria transcriptome by massive parallel sequencing and shotgun proteomics |journal=Genome Res. |volume=21 |pages=1193–1200 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/7/1193.abstract |doi=10.1101/gr.113779.110 |pmid=21536722 |issue=7 |pmc=3129261|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Parhyale hawaiensis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Zeng V |year=2011 |title=De novo assembly and characterization of a maternal and developmental transcriptome for the emerging model crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=12 |page=581 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2164-12-581.pdf |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-12-581 |pmid=22118449 |pmc=3282834|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the brains of the [[Nile crocodile]], the [[corn snake]], the [[bearded dragon]], and the [[red-eared slider]], to name just a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Tzika AC |year=2011 |title=Reptilian transcriptome v1.0, a glimpse in the brain transcriptome of five divergent Sauropsida lineages and the phylogenetic position of turtles |journal=EvoDevo |volume=2 |page=19 |url=http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/pdf/2041-9139-2-19.pdf |doi=10.1186/2041-9139-2-19 |pmid=21943375 |issue=1 |pmc=3192992|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining non-model organisms can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the "diversity of fascinating morphological innovations" that have enabled the abundance of life on planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rowan BA, Weigel D, Koenig D |year=2011 |title=Developmental genetics and new sequencing technologies: the rise of nonmodel organisms |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=65–76 |url=http://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/abstract/S1534-5807(11)00213-9 |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.05.021 |pmid=21763609}}&lt;/ref&gt; In animals and plants, the "innovations" that cannot be examined in common model organisms include [[mimicry]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[parasitism]], and [[asexual reproduction]]. ''De novo'' transcriptome assembly is often the preferred method to studying non-model organisms, since it is cheaper and easier than building a genome, and reference-based methods are not possible without an existing genome. The transcriptomes of these organisms can thus reveal novel proteins and their isoforms that are implicated in such unique biological phenomena.

=== ''De novo'' vs. reference-based assembly ===
A set of assembled transcripts allows for initial gene expression studies. Prior to the development of transcriptome assembly computer programs, transcriptome data were analyzed primarily by mapping on to a reference genome. Though genome alignment is a robust way of characterizing transcript sequences, this method is disadvantaged by its inability to account for incidents of structural alterations of mRNA transcripts, such as [[alternative splicing]].&lt;ref name=Birol&gt;{{cite journal |author=Birol I |year=2009 |title=De novo transcriptome assembly with ABySS |journal=Bioinformatics |volume= 25|issue=21 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/21/2872.long |pmid=19528083 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp367 |pages=2872–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a genome contains the sum of all introns and exons that may be present in a transcript, spliced variants that do not align continuously along the genome may be discounted as actual protein isoforms. Even if a reference genome is available, de novo assembly should be performed, as it can recover transcripts that are transcribed from segments of the genome that are missing from the genome assembly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Jeffrey A.|last2=Wang|first2=Zhong|title=Next-generation transcriptome assembly|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=12|issue=10|pages=671–682|doi=10.1038/nrg3068|pmid=21897427|year=2011|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc830328/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcriptome vs. genome assembly ===
Unlike genome sequence coverage levels – which can vary randomly as a result of repeat content in non-coding [[intron]] regions of DNA – transcriptome sequence coverage levels can be directly indicative of gene expression levels. These repeated sequences also create ambiguities in the formation of [[contig]]s in genome assembly, while ambiguities in transcriptome assembly contigs usually correspond to spliced [[isoforms]], or minor variation among members of a gene family.&lt;ref name=Birol/&gt; Genome assembler can't be directly used in transcriptome assembly for several reasons. First, genome sequencing depth is usually the same across a genome, but the depth of transcripts can vary. Second, both strands are always sequenced in genome sequencing, but RNA-seq can be strand-specific. Third, transcriptome assembly is more challenging because transcript variants from the same gene can share exons and are difficult to resolve unambiguously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Method ==

=== RNA-seq ===
{{main article|RNA-seq}}

Once RNA is extracted and purified from cells, it is sent to a high-throughput sequencing facility, where it is first [[Reverse transcription#Process of reverse transcription|reverse transcribed]] to create a cDNA library. This cDNA can then be fragmented into various lengths depending on the platform used for sequencing. Each of the following platforms utilizes a different type of technology to sequence millions of short reads: [[454 Sequencing]], [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], and [[ABI Solid Sequencing|SOLiD]].

=== Assembly algorithms ===
See also [[List_of_RNA-Seq_bioinformatics_tools]].

The cDNA sequence reads are assembled into transcripts via a short read transcript assembly program. Most likely, some amino acid variations among transcripts that are otherwise similar reflect different protein isoforms. It is also possible that they represent different genes within the same gene family, or even genes that share only a conserved domain, depending on the degree of variation.

A number of assembly programs are available (see [[De novo transcriptome assembly#Assemblers|Assemblers]]). Although these programs have been generally successful in assembling genomes, transcriptome assembly presents some unique challenges. Whereas high sequence coverage for a genome may indicate the presence of repetitive sequences (and thus be masked), for a transcriptome, they may indicate abundance. In addition, unlike genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing can be strand-specific, due to the possibility of both [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense and antisense]] transcripts. Finally, it can be difficult to reconstruct and tease apart all splicing isoforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Short read assemblers generally use one of two basic algorithms: overlap graphs and de Bruijn graphs.&lt;ref name=Illumina&gt;{{cite journal|last=Illumina, Inc.|title=De Novo Assembly Using Illumina Reads|year=2010|url=http://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/technotes/technote_denovo_assembly_ecoli.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overlap graphs]] are utilized for most assemblers designed for [[Sequencing#Sanger sequencing|Sanger sequenced]] reads. The overlaps between each pair of reads is computed and compiled into a graph, in which each node represents a single sequence read. This algorithm is more computationally intensive than de Bruijn graphs, and most effective in assembling fewer reads with a high degree of overlap.&lt;ref name=Illumina/&gt;
[[De Bruijn graph]]s align [[k-mer]]s (usually 25-50 bp) based on k-1 sequence conservation to create contigs. The k-mers are shorter than the read lengths allowing fast hashing so the operations in de Bruijn graphs are generally less computationally intensive.&lt;ref name=Illumina/&gt;

=== Functional annotation ===
Functional annotation of the assembled transcripts allows for insight into the particular molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes in which the putative proteins are involved. [[Blast2GO]] (B2G) enables [[Gene Ontology]] based data mining to annotate sequence data for which no GO annotation is available yet. It is a research tool often employed in functional genomics research on non-model species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Conesa A |year=2005 |title=Blast2GO: a universal tool for annotation, visualization and analysis in functional genomics research |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=21 |issue=18 |pages=3674–3676 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/18/3674.long |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti610 |pmid=16081474|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works by [[BLAST|blasting]] assembled contigs against a non-redundant protein database (at NCBI), then annotating them based on sequence similarity. GOanna is another GO annotation program specific for animal and agricultural plant gene products that works in a similar fashion. It is part of the AgBase database of curated, publicly accessible suite of computational tools for GO annotation and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=McCarthy FM |year=2006 |title=AgBase: a functional genomics resource for agriculture |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=7 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/229 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-7-229 |page=229 |pmid=16961921 |pmc=1618847|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following annotation, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enables visualization of metabolic pathways and molecular interaction networks captured in the transcriptome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KEGG PATHWAY Database |url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being annotated for GO terms, contigs can also be screened for [[open reading frames]] (ORFs) in order to predict the amino acid sequence of proteins derived from these transcripts. Another approach is to annotate protein domains and determine the presence of gene families, rather than specific genes.

=== Verification and quality control ===
Since a reference genome is not available, the quality of computer-assembled contigs may be verified either by comparing the assembled sequences to the reads used to generate them (reference-free), or by aligning the sequences of conserved gene domains found in mRNA transcripts to transcriptomes or genomes of closely related species (reference-based). Tools such as Transrate&lt;ref&gt;Transrate: understand your transcriptome assembly. http://hibberdlab.com/transrate&lt;/ref&gt; and DETONATE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Li B ''et al.'' | year = 2014 | title = Evaluation of de novo transcriptome assemblies from RNA-Seq data | url = | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 12| page = 553 | doi=10.1186/s13059-014-0553-5| pmid = 25608678 | pmc = 4298084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allow statistical analysis of assembly quality by these methods. Another method is to design [[PCR]] primers for predicted transcripts, then attempt to amplify them from the cDNA library. Often, exceptionally short reads are filtered out. Short sequences (&lt; 40 amino acids) are unlikely to represent functional proteins, as they are unable to fold independently and form hydrophobic cores.&lt;ref&gt;Karplus, K. pdb-1: Minimum length of Protein Sequence. https://lists.sdsc.edu/pipermail/pdb-l/2011-January/005317.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assemblers ==
The following is a partial compendium of assembly software that has been used to generate transcriptomes, and has also been cited in scientific literature.

=== SeqMan NGen ===

SeqMan NGen, part of [[DNASTAR]]'s software pipeline, includes a de novo transcriptome assembler for small or large transcriptome data sets. SeqMan NGen uses a patented algorithm which utilizes [[RefSeq]] to identify and merge transcripts, and automatically annotates assembled transcripts using DNASTAR's proprietary transcript annotation tool to identify and highlight known and novel genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DNASTAR |url=https://www.dnastar.com/t-sub-solutions-genome-solutions-de-novo-transcriptome-assembly.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SOAPdenovo-Trans ===

SOAPdenovo-Trans is a de novo transcriptome assembler inherited from the SOAPdenovo2 framework, designed for assembling transcriptome with alternative splicing and different expression level. The assembler provides a more comprehensive way to construct the full-length transcript sets compare to SOAPdenovo2.

=== Velvet/Oases ===
{{main article|Velvet assembler}}

The Velvet algorithm uses de Bruijn graphs to assemble transcripts. In simulations, Velvet can produce contigs up to 50-kb N50 length using prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 in mammalian [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Zerbino DR, Birney E |year=2008 |title=Velvet: Algorithms for de novo short read assembly using de Bruijn graphs |journal=Genome Res. |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=821–829 |pmc=2336801 |doi=10.1101/gr.074492.107 |pmid=18349386}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preliminary transcripts are transferred to [[Oases]], which uses [[Shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|paired end read]] and long read information to build transcript isoforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oases: de novo transcriptome assembler for very short reads |url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans-ABySS ===
[[ABySS]] is a parallel, paired-end sequence assembler. Trans-ABySS (Assembly By Short Sequences) is a software pipeline written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Perl]] for analyzing ABySS-assembled transcriptome contigs. This pipeline can be applied to assemblies generated across a wide range of k values. It first reduces the dataset into smaller sets of non-redundant contigs, and identifies splicing events including exon-skipping, novel exons, retained introns, novel introns, and alternative splicing. The Trans-ABySS algorithms are also able to estimate gene expression levels, identify potential [[polyadenylation]] sites, as well as candidate gene-fusion events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trans-ABySS: Analyze ABySS multi-k assembled shotgun transcriptome data |url=http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/trans-abyss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trinity ===
Trinity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trinity |url=http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net|date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; first divides the sequence data into a number of [[de Bruijn graph|de Bruijn graphs]], each representing transcriptional variations at a single gene or locus. It then extracts full-length splicing isoforms and distinguishes transcripts derived from [[paralogous genes]] from each graph separately. Trinity consists of three independent software modules, which are used sequentially to produce transcripts:
* '''Inchworm''' assembles the RNA-Seq data into transcript sequences, often generating full-length transcripts for a dominant isoform, but then reports just the unique portions of alternatively spliced transcripts.
* '''Chrysalis''' clusters the Inchworm contigs and constructs complete de Bruijn graphs for each cluster. Each cluster represents the full transcriptional complexity for a given gene (or a family or set of genes that share a conserved sequence). Chrysalis then partitions the full read set among these separate graphs.
* '''Butterfly''' then processes the individual graphs in parallel, tracing the paths of reads within the graph, ultimately reporting full-length transcripts for alternatively spliced isoforms, and teasing apart transcripts that corresponds to paralogous genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trinity RNA-Seq Assembly – software for the reconstruction of full-length transcripts and alternatively spliced isoforms |url=http://rna-seqblog.com/data-analysis/transcriptome-assembly-tools/trinity-rna-seq-assembly-%E2%80%93-software-for-the-reconstruction-of-full-length-transcripts-and-alternatively-spliced-isoforms/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712025044/http://rna-seqblog.com/data-analysis/transcriptome-assembly-tools/trinity-rna-seq-assembly-%E2%80%93-software-for-the-reconstruction-of-full-length-transcripts-and-alternatively-spliced-isoforms/ |archivedate=July 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Islamic geometric patterns featured in the game are widespread in Iran, and particularly in Bahrami's hometown of [[Isfahan]], including the central [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/416579/engare-game-islamic-design/|title=A Puzzle Game Inspired by the Mathematics of Islamic Art|date=2017-12-14|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's mechanic was inspired by a question asked by Bahrami's high-school [[geometry]] teacher, when he asked students to imagine what shape would be traced by a point fixed to a ball when rolled across a flat surface - the result being a series of loops.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/engare-a-videogame-about-the-mathematical-beauty-of-islamic-art/|title=Engare, a videogame about the mathematical beauty of Islamic art - Kill Screen|date=2016-04-01|work=Kill Screen|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahrami explains that even students who did not understand geometry were interested in the answer to this puzzle,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/12/5696024/engare-mahdi-bahrami|title=An Iranian developer's entrancing game about his culture and the mathematics of art|last=Lien|first=Tracey|date=2014-05-12|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was interested in using ''Engare'' to "explore mathematics in different ways [...] for some people it's easier to explore maths when it's visualised," and that "video games as a medium have great potential [for] these visualisations." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite this, Bahrami says, he did not originally set out to make an [[Educational video game|educational game]]. The game is Bahrami's second to be inspired by traditional Islamic patterns, following ''Farsh,'' a game inspired by [[Persian carpet]]s, which his mother wove when he was growing up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Gameplay ==

''Engare'' has two gameplay modes. The first is a puzzle-solving mode, where the player must recreate a shape shown on-screen by placing a point on a moving object that is drawn into a line as the object moves. As the puzzles become more complex, the player is rewarded with the creation of more and more intricate patterns created from their solution; in later levels these patterns repeat themselves and are coloured in.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/engare-review-spirographs-math-and-islamic-art-blend-for-quite-the-game/|title=Engare review: The geometry of Islamic art becomes a treasure of a game|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; After enough puzzles are solved, a second gameplay mode is unlocked: a pattern [[design tool]] where the player can place dots and lines or colour in tiles to create repeating geometric patterns. These patterns can then be mapped onto a 3-D [[Dome|mosque-like dome]] and explored from different perspectives.

== Reception ==

''Engare'' has been received positively, with a demo version presented at the 2014 [[Game Developers Conference#Experimental Gameplay Workshop|GDC Experimental Gameplay Workshop]] generating positive press coverage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since its release, ''Engare'' has been praised by Sam Machkovech of ''[[Ars Technica]]'', who describes the game as "[feeling] absolutely magical and unique in the gaming realm," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and [[Robin Hunicke]] of [[Electronic Arts|EA]] and [[Funomena]], who was "blown away [by] the cleverness of the puzzles".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rami Ismail of [[Vlambeer]] has praised the game on several occasions, naming it as one of his top 10 games of 2017 in an article for [[Giant Bomb]], and as 'one of the games that he admires the most' in a [[GameSpot]] feature. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/rami-ismails-top-10-games-of-2017/1100-5677/|title=Rami Ismail's top 10 games of 2017|last=Ismail|first=Rami|date=2017-12-26|website=Giant Bomb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-psychonauts-and-other-devs-share-what-games-t/1100-6457827/|title=Nier, Psychonauts, And Other Devs Share What Games They Admire Most|last=|first=|date=2018-03-31|website=GameSpot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been similarly well-received by players on Steam, where it holds an overall 'very positive' rating, and has won several awards, including the Student Showcase at the [[Independent Games Festival]] and the 'Excellence in Design' and 'Culture Award' categories at the [[Iran Computer and Video Games Foundation#Festivals and Exhibitions|Tehran Video Game Festival]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The curation of extraterrestrial samples (astromaterials) obtained by [[sample-return mission]]s take place at facilities specially designed to preserve both the sample integrity and protect the Earth. Astromaterials are classified as either ''non-restricted'' or ''restricted'', depending on the nature of the Solar System body. Non-restricted samples include the [[Moon]], [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, [[Solar wind|solar particles]] and [[space dust]].  Restricted bodies include planets or moons suspected to have either past or present [[Planetary habitability|habitable environments]] to microscopic life, and therefore must be treated as extremely [[biohazard]]ous.

==Overview==

Spacecraft instruments are subject to mass and power constraints, in addition of the limitations imposed by the extreme environment of [[outer space]] on the sensitive science instruments, so bringing extraterrestrial material to Earth is desired for extensive scientific analyses. For the purpose of [[planetary protection]], astromaterial samples brought to Earth by [[sample-return mission]]s must be received and curated in a specially-designed and equipped [[biocontainment]] facility that must also double as a [[cleanroom]] to preserve the science value of the samples.

Samples brought from non-restricted bodies such as the Moon, asteroids, comets, solar particles and space dust, are processed at specialized facilities rated [[Biosafety level]]-3 ('''BSL-3'''). Samples brought to Earth from a planet or moon suspected to have either past or present [[Planetary habitability|habitable environments]] to microscopic life would make it a [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] body, and must be curated at facilities rated Biosafety level-4 ('''BSL-4'''), as agreed in the Article IX of the [[Outer Space Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IX]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the Outer Space Treaty [http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708075800/http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html |date=2013-07-08 }}'' - See Article IX''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CNES'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/5210-planetary-protection-treaties-and-recommendations.php | title = Planetary protection treaties and recommendations | accessdate = 2012-09-11 | author = Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) | date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the existing BSL-4 facilities in the world do not have the complex requirements to ensure the preservation and protection of Earth and the sample simultaneously.&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'&gt;[https://www.space.com/7625-protect-mars-samples-earth.html How to Protect Mars Samples on Earth]. Jeremy Hsu, ''Space.com''. 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While existing BSL-4 facilities deal primarily with fairly well-known organisms, a BSL-4 facility focused on extraterrestrial samples must pre-plan the systems carefully while being mindful that there will be unforeseen issues during sample evaluation and curation that will require independent thinking and solutions.&lt;ref name='Bass 2020'&gt;[https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lifedetection2012/pdf/6013.pdf Planning for the Analytic Environment to Conduct Life Detection Experiments on Samples Returned from Mars: Observations and Issues (2012)] D.

Accessed: 19 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge is that, while it is relatively easy to simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers will want to take a portion and perform analyses.

==Non-restricted materials==

[[File:Stardust Capsule on Ground.jpg|thumb| ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'''s sample-return capsule after reentry to Earth]]

As of 2018, JAXA's [[Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center]] and NASA's [[Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science]] are the only two BSL-3 laboratories in the world exclusively dedicated to the curation of samples from non-restricted bodies.&lt;ref name='Davies 2018'&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/why-sample-return.html What's the benefit of sample-return?] Jason Davis, ''The Planetary Society''. 5 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009281911000031 Curating NASA's extraterrestrial samples—Past, present, and future.] Carlton Allen, Judith Allton, Gary Lofgren, Kevin Righter, Michael Zolensky, etal.

==Restricted materials==

[[File:NIAID Integrated Research Facility - Positive Pressure Personnel Suit.jpg|thumb|Working inside a Biosafety level 4 laboratory with air hoses providing positive air pressure]]
Return-samples obtained from a [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] body, must be curated at facilities rated Biosafety level-4 (BSL-4). Because the existing BSL-4 facilities in the world do not have the complex requirements to ensure the preservation and protection of Earth and the sample simultaneously,&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'/&gt; there are currently at least two proposals to build a BSL-4 facility dedicated to curation of restricted (potentially [[biohazard]]) extraterrestrial materials. 

The first is the [[European Sample Curation Facility]] (ESCF),&lt;ref name='ESCF 2017'&gt;[https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/73091/ICES_2017_323.pdf EURO EURO-CARES Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Facility: Architecture as an enabler of science].

Accessed: 25 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to be built in [[Vienna]], would curate non-restricted samples as well as BSL-4 biocontainment of restricted material obtained from [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] bodies such as [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]], etc.&lt;ref name='ESCF 2017'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The other proposal is by NASA and is tentatively known as the [[Mars Sample-Return Receiving facility]] (MSRRF).&lt;ref name=samplereceivingfacility&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/presentations/200803/04-Atlas-PPSonMSR.pdf|title=Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility|publisher=NASA |author= Ronald Atlas|date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least three different designs were submitted in 2009.&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'/&gt; If funded, this American facility would be expected to take 7 to 10 years from design to completion,&lt;ref name='Assessment 2009'&gt;{{cite report |title=Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Mars Sample Return Missions |publisher=National Research Council |year=2009 |chapter=7: "Sample-Receiving Facility and Program Oversight" |page=59 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12576&amp;page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSRtaskgroup&gt;[http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/summary/msr Mars Sample Return: Issues and Recommendations (Planetary Protection Office Summary)] Task Group on Issues in Sample Return. National Academies Press, Washington, DC (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional two years is recommended for the staff to become proficient and accustomed to the facilities.&lt;ref name='Assessment 2009'/&gt; NASA is also assessing a 2017 proposal to build a mobile and modular BSL-4 facility to secure a sample return capsule at the landing site to conduct preliminary biohazard analyses.&lt;ref name='Mobile BSL4'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170001664.pdf Mobile/Modular BSL-4 Facilities for Meeting Restricted Earth Return Containment Requirements]. M. J. Calaway, F. M. McCubbin, J. H. Allton, R. A. Zeigler, and L. F. Pace. (PDF) NASA. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After completion of biohazard testing, decisions could be made to sterilize the sample or transport all or portions to a permanent quarantine storage facility anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name='Mobile BSL4'/&gt;

The systems of such facilities must be able to contain unknown biohazards, as the sizes of any putative alien  microorganisms or infectious agents are unknown. Ideally it should filter particles of 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm or larger, and release of a particle 0.05&amp;nbsp;µm or larger is unacceptable under any circumstance.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf |date=2016-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this extremely small size limit of 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm is for consideration of [[gene transfer agent]]s (GTAs) which are virus-like particles that are produced by some microorganisms that package random segments of [[DNA]] capable of [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt; These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth microorganisms in the same way.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt; Another reason for the 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm limit is because of the discovery of [[ultramicrobacteria]] as small as 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm across.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt;

Robotic advocates consider that humans represent a significant source of contamination for the samples, and that a BSL-4 facility with robotic systems is the best way forward.&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'/&gt;

The '''genomic epidemiological database for global identification of microorganisms''' or '''global microbial identifier (GMI) '''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GMI|title=Global Microbial Identifier|url=http://www.g-m-i.org/About.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a platform for storing [[whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) data of [[microorganisms]], for the identification of relevant [[genes]] and for the comparison of [[genomes]] to detect and track-and-trace [[infectious disease]] outbreaks and emerging [[pathogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlundt|first=J|title=The time is right for a global genomic database for microorganisms|journal=Health Diplomacy Monitor|year=2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=2–3|url=http://www.ghd-net.org/sites/default/files/Health%20Diplomacy%20Monitor%20Volume%203%20Issue%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database holds two types of information: 1) genomic information of [[microorganisms]], linked to, 2) [[metadata]] of those microorganism such as [[epidemiological]] details. The database includes all genera of microorganisms: [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[parasites]] and [[fungi]].

== Technology ==

For [[genotype|genotyping]] of microorganisms for [[medical diagnosis]], or other purposes, scientists may use a wide variety of [[DNA profiling]] techniques, such as [[PCR]], [[PFGE]] and [[MLST]]. A complication of this broad variety of pre-WGS techniques is the difficulty to standardize between techniques, laboratories and microorganisms, which may be overcome using the complete [[DNA]] code of the genome generated by WGS techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shendure|first=J|title= Next-generation DNA sequencing|journal=Nat. Biotechnol.|year=2008|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1135–1145|doi=10.1038/nbt1486|pmid=18846087}}&lt;/ref&gt; For straight forward diagnostic identification the WGS information of a microbiological sample is fed into a global genomic database and compared using [[BLAST]] procedures to the genomes already present in the database.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;{{cite web|title=genomic epidemiology database|url=http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, WGS data may be used to back calculate to the different pre-WGS genotyping methods, so previous collected valuable information is not lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inouye|first=M|title=Short read sequence typing (SRST):multi-locus sequence types from short reads|journal=BMC Genomics|year=2012|volume=13|pages=388|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-13-338|pmid=22827703|pmc=3460743|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=MV|title=Multilocus sequence typing of total-genome-sequenced bacteria|journal=J Clin Microbiol|year=2012|volume=50|pages=1355–1366|doi=10.1128/JCM.06094-11|pmid=22238442|issue=4|pmc=3318499|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the global microbial identifier the genomic information is coupled to a wide spectrum of metadata about the specific microbial clone and includes important clinical and [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information such as the global finding place(s), treatment options and [[antimicrobial resistance]], making it a general microbiological identification tool.This makes [[Personalized medicine|personalized treatment]] of microbial disease possible as well as real-time tracing systems for global surveillance of [[infectious diseases]] for [[food safety]] and serving [[human health]].

== The initiative ==

The initiative for building the database arose in 2011 and when several preconditions were met : 1) WGS has become mature and serious alternative for other genotyping techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zankari|first=E|title=Genotyping using whole-genome sequencing is a realistic alternative to surveillance based on phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing|journal=J Antimicrob Chemother|year=2013|pmid=23233485|doi=10.1093/jac/dks496|volume=68|issue=4|pages=771–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=WM|title= Next-generation and whole-genome sequencing in the diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory|journal=Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis|year=2012|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1719-17126|doi=10.1007/s10096-012-1641-7|pmid=22678348|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) the price of WGS has started falling dramatically and in some cases below the price of traditional identifications, 3) vast amounts of [[Information technology|IT]] resources and a fast [[Internet]] have become available, and 4) there is the idea that via a cross sectoral and [[One Health]] approach infectious diseases may be better controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Vol 366|title=One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-70961-9|pages=280|url=https://www.springer.com/biomed/virology/book/978-3-642-35845-6?detailsPage=authorsAndEditors#|editor=Mackenzie, J.S. |editor2=Jeggo, M. |editor3=Daszak, P. |editor4=Richt, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wielinga, PR |author2=Schlundt, J |title=Food Safety: At the Center of a One Health Approach for Combating Zoonoses |journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol|year=2013|pmid=22763857|doi=10.1007/82_2012_238|pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting the second millennium, many microbiological laboratories, as well as national health institutes, started genome sequencing projects for sequencing the infectious agents collections they had in their [[biobanks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= A summary of genomic databases|title= Bacterial genome databases|url= http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~pbagga/binf/binf_res/bioinfo_gndb_bact.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= WGS projects info by EBI|title= WGS projects|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/wgs.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby generating private databases and sending model genomes to global nucleotide databases such as [[GenBank]] of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Genome Browser NCBI|title= Genome information by organism |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the nucleotide database of the [[EMBL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Genome Browser EMBL|title= Access to Completed Genomes|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a wealth of genomic information and independent databases for [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes|eukaryotic]] as well as [[List of sequenced bacterial genomes|prokaryotic]] genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Microbial Genomes Database|title=MBGD|url= http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Other genomic databases via EBI|url= http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/databases/genomic2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= DOE's Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) |title= IMG DOEs JGI|url=http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The need to further integrate these databases and to harmonize data collection, and to link the genomic data to metadata for optimal prevention of infectious diseases, was generally recognized by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aarestrup|first=F|title=Integrating Genome-based Informatics to Modernize Global Disease Monitoring, Information Sharing, and Response|journal=Emerg Infect Dis|year=2012|volume=18|issue=11|pages=e1|doi=10.3201/eid/1811.120453|pmid=23092707|pmc=3559169|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, several infectious disease control centers and other organizations took the initiative of a series of international scientific- and policy-meetings, to develop a common platform and to better understand the potentials of an interactive microbiological genomic database.

[[File:Pioneer Helmet.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Pioneer Helmet|The 100–200 fragments of the [[Pioneer Helmet|Pioneer helmet]] were adhered using HMG.]]
'''HMG Heat and Waterproof Adhesive''' (also known as '''HMG''' or '''HMG adhesive''') is a brand of [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] adhesive manufactured by H Marcel Guest Ltd. It is one of the most popular cellulose nitrate adhesives used in [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] work, and is used on materials such as metal, wood, glass, and pottery.{{sfn|Shashoua|Bradley|Daniels|1992|p=114}}{{sfn|HMG product page}}{{sfn|MFA CAMEO|2016}} It is sometimes referred to as "the blue tube", in contrast to "the purple tube", the acrylic B72 Restoration Adhesive also manufactured by the company.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}}

HMG was invented during [[World War II]] by the company's founder, Herbert Falder.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}} Today it is broadly used, including by the [[British Museum]] and the [[York Archaeological Trust]]. In 1997, HMG was used to adhere pieces of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Pioneer Helmet|Pioneer helmet]], which was found broken into between 100 and 200 fragments.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=24–27}}{{sfn|Read|2006|pp=39–42}} Particularly fragile areas had their cracks injected with a solution of HMG diluted 50% with [[acetone]], to consolidate them and prevent them from collapsing; holes made while cleaning away corrosion were likewise injected with pigmented HMG.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=25–26}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=40}} Stronger areas, such as the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] cheek guard, found in eighteen pieces, and the [[nasal helmet|nasal]], were joined directly with the adhesive.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=24–25}} Finally, HMG was also used to adhere glass fibre matting on the inside of the helmet, strengthening weak joins and covering gaps, the latter to provide backing against which gapfill could be applied.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=27}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=42}}

==Technical properties==
HMG is advertised with a {{convert|-18|C|F|abbr=on}} [[flash point]], and a {{convert|100|C|F|abbr=on}} temperature resistance.{{sfn|HMG product page}} It is insoluble in water and soluble in acetone, and is composed of 70% amyl acetate solvent, 25% cellulose nitrate, approximately 5% of the plasticizer dibutyl phthalate,{{sfn|Shashoua|Bradley|Daniels|1992|p=115}} and a small amount of a phenolic resin leveling agent.{{sfn|MFA CAMEO|2016}} The adhesive is touch dry in five minutes, and hard dry in ten.{{sfn|HMG Adhesives|2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18253">'''Hyperkino''' is a standardized system of referencing and [[Annotation|annotating]] films on digital carriers - attaching related content and analysis to individual frames. The name of the method, Hyperkino, is based on the intertwining of the concepts of [[textual criticism]] and [[hypertext]].

== From Theory to Practice ==
Hyperkino was developed by [[Natascha Drubek]] and Nikolai Izvolov between 2005 and 2008:&lt;ref&gt;On the relation of textus and apparatus cf. Michal Kosák, K podobě komentáře: nad filmovou sérií Hyperkino. Slovo a smysl, 10, 2013, č. 20, p. 314-317. http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/499&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have connected the traditional principles of annotation with digital technologies and their markup languages, applying hypermedia principles of commentary to the linear medium of film. HYPERKINO annotations of a film are comparable to the [[footnotes]] and the commentary in historical-critical editions of texts, with the only difference being that they are {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} various media forms (text, sound, pictures). […] The tradition of scholarly editions provides sophisticated ways of preserving texts over centuries, keeping them alive in constantly evolving receptions and commentaries. The idea of indexing a text, turning it into a network of interrelations and linking it with other texts, goes back to the tradition of editing scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperkino.net/hyperkino/What-is-HYPERKINO|title=What is HYPERKINO / hyperkino / convergence - Website Interface|last=Systems|first=eZ|website=hyperkino.net|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Digital humanities scholar Christian Gosvig Olesen stresses the importance of the analytical and theoretical phase preceding practical steps towards developing and designing the Hyperkino method: “In 2006 Drubek and Izvolov penned an article together that formulated this vision, Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats, which was published in the eighth edition of the international film studies review Cinema &amp; Cie.&lt;ref&gt;“Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats”, Cinema &amp; Cie (autumn 2006). A second English edition appeared in Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema, Volume 2, 2008, Issue 2, 205-216. The method was first described in the 2005 Russian original of the article: Natascha Drubek-Meyer/ Nikolaj Izvolov: “Kommentirovannoe izdanie fil’mov na DVD: neobchodimost’ naučnych standartov”. In: Kinovedcheskie zapiski 72, 2005, p. 372-383.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 2006.”

He characterizes Hyperkino as a philological reaction to audio commentaries which were the early and most popular forms of extras on DVDs: &lt;blockquote&gt;The article departed from a critique of current presentations in academic and contextualizing analyses of films on DVD to conceptualize a new way of DVD editorship relying on annotations and a more extensive and effective use of the hyperlinked structure of the DVD format. One of the points of critique was that existing DVD editions much too often overburdened the works in question […] Drubek and Izvolov instead advocated for a use of annotations which could appear in conjunction with the film but also exist independently of it. As the basis of this proposition they proposed a distinction between the film in itself as textus, which should be able to stand alone and be viewed independently of an analytical interpretive layer, and on the other hand an apparatus including all that which is not part of the filmic text itself: notes on the film’s historical context, script, stills or for example correspondences or business documents related to the film’s production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmhistoryinthemaking.com/2013/08/10/what-is-hyperkino-ruscicos-academia-dvd-series-and-the-historical-critical-film-edition/|title=What Is Hyperkino? Ruscico’s Academia DVD series and the historical-critical film edition|last=Olesen|first=Christian Gosvig|date=2013-08-10|website=Film History in the Making|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hyperkino commentaries were made possible by the DVD format, introduced in 1996. In the ten years of its existence this format had produced several noteworthy audio commentaries by either filmmakers or scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterbosma.info/?p=blog&amp;blog=30|title=Hyperkino. Een dvd met voetnoten (2010)|last=Bosma|first=Peter|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it hardly had contributed to creating a standard of critical editions of films on digital carriers. In the academic environment of film studies the digital representation of film seemed to usher in a welcome convergence of film and writing on film. Digital technologies offered an option to explore the old medium of film from a new angle. The idea of a scholarly digital edition of a film surfaced several years after the first “Deluxe” editions of films with “deleted scenes” and other DVD extras were published. Scholarly interest in the DVD was driven by the requirement to have a stable “textus” which could be the basis of citations. In addition, film analysis asked for tools to annotate shots or even single frames in a film without destroying the cinematic text itself by intrusive modifications such as inserting talking heads or acousmatic voices of commentators.
From this perspective Hyperkino was an exercise in understatement compared to other DVD extras. Its principle was a hidden annotation linked to the film frame marked by a minimal sign, usually a number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clicking the number leads the viewer onto an off-screen commentary text section. “These sections we call 'footnotes' for the film. The main difference to current DVD commentaries is the presentation of scholarly research: It happens not in an audio but in a written format which makes the commentary quotable. Every HYPERKINO DVD edition is tantamount to an introductory article about the film published. The film and texts about the film merge on the digital carrier.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/48480_en.html|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service : Final Activity Report Summary - HYFIP (Hypertextual Film Presentation. Designing Digital Editions for the European Cinematographic Heritage)|website=cordis.europa.eu|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyperkino DVDs ==
As a commercially available DVD format Hyperkino materialized itself three years after the programmatic article by Drubek and Izvolov. In 2008 Drubek produced a Hyperkino DVD in Berlin and Prague, publishing Nikolai Izvolov’s reconstruction of [[Lev Kuleshov]]’s until then unpublished first film: ''Proekt inzhenera Praita''.

Gosvig Olesen writes: “First in the fold of the German DVD publisher Absolutmedien and later as the series KinoAcademia published by RUSCICO. The film to launch the format was Lev Kuleshov’s debut feature Proekt inzhenera Prayta (Engineer Prite’s Project), USSR, 1918). Not only was it the first time the film was made available digitally, it had also, as pointed out by film historian Kristin Thompson, for a long time only existed in a version without intertitles, which left the impression that the film was incomplete.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hyperkino editions emphasize the importance of incorporating different versions of the film. Two versions can be found on the German DVD of Engineer Prite’s Project allowing to compare the fragmented film as it lies in Gosfilmofond without intertitles with Izvolov’s 2001 reconstruction of the film which incorporated textual material from a surviving original libretto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinando.com/en/Film/engineer_prites_project_59063/Detail|title=ENGINEER PRITE'S PROJECT|website=cinando.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD contains the TV documentary The Kuleshov Effect (USSR, 1969) by Semyon Raitburt (ЭФФЕКТ КУЛЕШОВА, 1969, Семён Райтбурт). The Hyperkino “footnotes” quote from interviews with Kuleshov and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].

In the following years around a dozen of Hyperkino DVDs were released by the Russian publisher RUSCICO under the series title “Kino Academia” containing the annotations of international film scholars specializing in Russian and Soviet film:  Aleksandr Deriabin, Natascha Drubek, Bernard Eisenschitz, Jeremy Hicks, Nikolai Izvolov, Ekaterina Khokhlova, Milena Musina, Sergei Kapterev, Natalia Riabchikova, and Yuri Tsivian. Not all of the initially announced DVDs have been published yet, due to the high production costs.

In line with the aims described in Drubek’s and Izvolov’s 2005 article, every Hyperkino DVD edition consists of a textus and an apparatus. The apparatus in Hyperkino editions consists of alternative versions and “footnotes” connected to the film. Footnote numbers on all Hyperkino DVDs appear during playback in the upper right corner of the frame. In the RUSCICO editions the textus is on disc 1 (language versions) and the apparatus on disc 2 (film without language versions but with Hyperkino footnotes).

== Awards ==
In 2010 at the Bologna festival Il Cinema Ritrovato three Hyperkino titles were awarded with the  “DVD Awards 2010, VII edition. Best Special Features (Bonus) for their innovative handling of printed and illustrated commentaries”. The three DVDs were:
* THE GREAT CONSOLER (Russia/1933) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Ekaterina Khokhlova
* ENGINEER PRITE’S PROJECT (Russia/1918) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by N. Drubek-Meyer / Nikolai Izvolov
* OCTOBER (Russia/1927) by Sergey Eisenstein, Grigori Aleksandrov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Yuri Tsivian
In the same year Hyperkino received another award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics and Scholars, the “Elephant 2010” (Kinovedenie i kinokritika v elektronnych SMI, novye technologii).

== Reviews and Reactions ==
“The idea of Hyperkino is a sensational breakthrough: imagine what a potential is looming here!”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his article "The Mosaic Approach. In defense of a nonlinear film criticism" Jonathan Rosenbaum describes Hyperkino as "a hybrid form—existing somewhere between reading and watching, like various computer-related activities—is part of what seems forward-looking about them […] What all these forms of criticism suggest is not merely a less linear way of approaching film experience but also a more interactive methodology. The fact that movies are being seen more and more often away from public theaters shouldn't necessarily mean that the way we all experience them and share our experiences is any less social. Perhaps it's more pertinent to note that the very forms of our social interactions in relation to films are changing as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/the-mosaic-approach-20100818|title=The Mosaic Approach by  Jonathan Rosenbaum - Moving Image Source|website=www.movingimagesource.us|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Graffy discusses Hyperkino from the perspective of the “commentarist”: “Engaging with the Hyperkino commentaries leads to thoughts about the fundamental differences between a spoken commentary, the only version most viewers will so far have encountered, and the (predominantly written) Hyperkino approach.” Graffy mentions the time factor which challenged the performance of audio commentators: “bottlenecks, where too much is happening at once for you to cover all you want to say; and longueurs, where you wonder how to fill the space, or worry about extended periods of silence. […] None of these problems exists, of course, for the Hyperkino commentarist – he or she is not time-bound, and the notes can be as short or as long as required. They can also be more scholarly – the notes on Strike especially are full of references to sources both printed and archival – indicating to the scholar/student viewer where to do further research. And, above all, they have the advantage of hybridity, which is why the Hyperkino notes are more than just a book on screen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graffy|first=Julian|year=2010|title=[Hyperkino] DVD Reviews|url=|journal=Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema|volume=4|issue=3|pages=345–354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 film critic and media scholar Joachim Schätz called the Hyperkino publication of the Kuleshov debut a "mediated revolution" (“vermittelte Revolution”)  and Hyperkino "one of the most exciting forms of reflection on film one can experience today."

'''Intercultural communication''' (or [[cross-cultural communication|'''cross-cultural communication''']]) is a discipline that studies [[communication]] across different [[culture]]s and [[social group]]s, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal=Journal of Business and Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | title=3 Tips For Effective Global Communication | date=April 9, 2010 | author=Drary, Tom | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232213/http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | archivedate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/intercultural-communication// |title=Intercultural Communication Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.

The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. “Intercultural Communication in a Globalized World.” In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A. Samovar, Richard E. Porter, and Edwin R. McDaniel, 13 edition, 45-53. Boston, Mass: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intercultural communication'' is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, Gribkova &amp; Starkey, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of interest ==

=== Cross-cultural business communication ===
Cross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.

====Management====
Important points to consider:

* Develop cultural sensitivity
* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.
* Careful encoding
* Use words, pictures, and gestures.
* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.
* Selective transmission 
* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.
* Careful decoding of feedback
* Get feedback from multiple parties.
* Improve listening and observation skills.
* Follow-up actions

====Facilitation====
There is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.

Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extrovertedness, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

These factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of preparedness for change, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.

=== Cultural&amp;nbsp;perceptions ===
There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Individualism|individualistic]] cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.&lt;ref&gt;Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. “Rethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.” Communication Theory 14 (1):78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.

The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and also what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]

== Problems ==
The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.

Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13"&gt;Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13" /&gt;

Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.

==Theories==
The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on [[identity negotiation]] and management, on [[communication network]]s,on [[acculturation]] and [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gudykunst 2003 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engineering effective outcomes ===
*Cultural convergence
**In a relatively closed social system in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to ''converge'' over time toward a state of greater cultural ''uniformity''. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim &amp; W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280–298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Communication accommodation theory]]
**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/9781118540190.wbeic006|chapter=Communication Accommodation Theory|title=The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication|pages=1–21|year=2015|last1=Dragojevic|first1=Marko|last2=Gasiorek|first2=Jessica|last3=Giles|first3=Howard|isbn=9781118540190|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306556/files/2007_gilesogay_cat.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intercultural adaption
**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means "the need to conform" to mainstream "objective reality" and "accepted modes of experience".&lt;ref name="Gudykunst, W. 2003"&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed., 378. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Co-cultural communication theory|Co-cultural theory]]
**In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.

===Identity negotiation or management===
*[[Identity management theory]]
*[[Identity negotiation]]
*Cultural identity theory
*[[Double-swing model]]

=== Communication networks ===
*Networks and outgroup communication competence
*[[Intracultural]] versus intercultural networks
*Networks and acculturation

=== Acculturation and adjustment ===
*Communication acculturation
**This theory attempts to portray "cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety/Uncertainty management
**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors.
*[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]] states
**Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. "Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication."&lt;ref&gt;Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assimilation
** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pauls|first1=Elizabeth|title=Assimilation|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|website=www.britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alienation
** Alienation  frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: " alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giffin|first1=Kim|title=Social alienation by communicaton denial|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=56|issue=4|pages=347–357|doi=10.1080/00335637009383022|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
* [[Meaning of meanings theory]] – "A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Face negotiation theory]] – "Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving"&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standpoint theory]] – An individual's experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social group]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, P. H. (1990). Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. Boston: Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2005 {{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B00DG8M7EU | title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice | publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc | year=2013 | isbn=978-1412927444 | edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stranger theory]] – At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger.  Strangers are a 'hyperaware' of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.
* [[Feminist genre theory]] – Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women's liberation.
* [[Genderlect theory]] – "Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men's report talk focuses on status and independence. Women's support talk seeks human connection."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultural critical studies theory]] – The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite.
* [[Marxism]] – aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.

==History of assimilation==
* Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. 
Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"/&gt;

== Intercultural competence ==

Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt; Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Facts and Figures| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.

'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"&gt;(Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.

People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.
* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.
* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.
* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

=== Basic tools for improvement ===

The following are ways to improve communication competence:
* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.
* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves  and their perception of the world.
* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others
* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.
* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.
* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.
* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;
* Patience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|website=eaglesflight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Active listening&lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarity  &lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"/&gt;

=== Important factors===

* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.
* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.
* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.
* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.
* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"&gt;(Intercultural Communication)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits ===

* Flexibility.
* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.
* Self-reflection.
* Open-mindedness.
* Sensitivity.
* Adaptability.

==Verbal communication==
Verbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.

'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''

* Tone of voice
* Use of descriptive words
* Emphasis on certain phrases
* Volume of voice

The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.

Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.&lt;ref&gt;Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of non-verbal cues'''

* Facial expressions
* Hand gestures
* Use of objects
* Body movement

In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29–31, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, R., &amp; Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonverbal communication ==
Nonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words—though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties.

Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement—e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries.

Occulesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages.

[[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.

[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said—e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.

Object language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts—e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.

Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

The '''International School of Information Management (ISiM)''' is the first Indian [[List of I-Schools|i-School]] and is an autonomous constituent institute of the [[University of Mysore]], located in [[Mysore]] in [[Karnataka]] State, Southern [[India]]. ISiM was conceptualised and established in 2005, in collaboration with the leading information schools in the U.S – namely the School of Information at the [[University of Michigan]], the School of Information Sciences at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the School of Information Studies at [[Syracuse University]], [[International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore|International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Bangalore]], and [[Dalhousie University]] of Canada. ISiM was established with munificent{{clarify|date=April 2012}} grants from the [[Ford Foundation]] and Bangalore based Informatics India Pvt. Ltd.

==Introduction==
[[File:ISiM building.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|ISiM campus at Manasagangothri, University of Mysore, Mysore]]
Each new era and society demands a new breed of professionals. Just as the industrial age heralded management sciences, the information age is engendering the domain of information sciences. With this belief and the concept of an institution focusing exclusively on information studies and research in India, ISiM was established. ISiM was conceptualized and established in 2005, by the University of Mysore, with seed grants from the Ford Foundation and Bangalore based Informatics India Pvt. Ltd., and in partnership with some of the leading information schools in the U.S, namely the School of Information at the University of Michigan, the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, and the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. To strengthen its academic linkages, ISiM signed memorandum of understanding with School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, USA, University of Michigan, USA and Dalhousie University of Canada in 2006.&lt;ref name="ISiMpartners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/partners.htm |title=Partners |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urs, the Executive Director of ISiM, speaking at the launch of ISiM at InfoVision 2005]]
Being a new age school for the knowledge economy, ISiM also defines a new educational model – '''''[[Inverse of Distance Learning]]'''''&lt;ref name="knowISiM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/know%20ISiM.htm |title=Know ISiM |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in which, the students and the school are in Mysore, but, the faculty and mentors are a distributed network of excellence drawn from ISiM’s partners and other institutions.

ISiM is directed by an independent Governing Board, chaired by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, with eminent academics and industry stalwarts as members. ISiM is managed today with some of the finest minds from Academia, Industry and the Government and has on its governing board personalities like [[N. R. Narayana Murthy]], Chairman and Mentor [[Infosys]] Technologies and others like Prof. M. Anandakrishnan, Chairman-IIT Kanpur, Dr.N. Seshagiri, Former Director General, [[National Informatics Centre]], [[New Delhi]], Dr. [[S. Sadagopan]], Founder Director- IIIT, Bangalore, Mr. M. N. Vidyashankar, Principal Secretary, Department of E-Governance, [[Government of Karnataka]], Mr. [[Prasad Ram]], Director and Center Head, [[Google]] India, among others.&lt;ref name="ISiMmanagement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/management.htm |title=Management |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{peacock|date=April 2012}}
With redefining the academia-industry interaction through a process of continuous engagement of students and the industry mentors in open community projects being one of the main visions of ISiM, it envisions to be an innovative institution, shaping and defining the multidisciplinary domain of information, while innovating new institutional models and focusing on preparing information professionals who can help solve the [[information asymmetry]].

ISiM recognizes the multidisciplinary nature of information, and envisions being a ground breaking higher education institution, addressing the challenges of defining this domain. The challenges of the information age require educational institutions to continuously evolve, and ISiM has special focus towards innovating new institutional models. With emphasis on redefining the academia—industry interaction, ISiM encourages continuous engagement of students and industry mentors in Open Community Projects, and by doing so, aims to be a world class institution of higher learning, which prepares professionals who can build information systems to help solve the information asymmetry.&lt;ref name="knowISiM" /&gt;

ISiM graduates find career opportunities as Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Information System Developers, Content Managers, Management Information Analysts, Information Marketers, Knowledge Portal Managers, Knowledge Management leads, Web / Online Content Analysts, Data Analytics / Business Intelligence Specialists, Data Warehousing Professionals, MIS Officers, Archivists, Librarians etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/placements.htm |title=Placements |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of ISiM==
The seed of ISiM was sown during a discussion among like minded peers in the academia and some more members from the industry, and dozens of brainstorming sessions later during the annual Knowledge Summit [http://www.infovision.org.in/ "'''''INFOVISION'''''"] in September 2005, Dr. Som Mittal, the then Director of [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and the current President of [[NASSCOM]] officially launched ISiM. From 2005, ISiM has evolved from being a mere concept to reality, and has defined a new educational model in this process - '''''[[Inverse of Distance Learning]]'''''.

=== Graduation Day 2011===

ISiM celebrated its Graduation Day on Monday, 11 April 2011.  In her Welcome Address, Prof. Shalini Urs, Executive Director of ISiM, drew attention to the objective and tradition of celebrating graduation days. She said, a  graduation day is an academic cultural tradition and is a rite of passage essentially  symbolizing "Inculcation, transformation" and "Return to Society in a changed status."  The purpose of ISiM Graduation Day Celebrations program is to build a sense of  new roles as ISiMians and solidarity.

Dr. P. Anandan, Managing Director, Microsoft Research India, Bangalore, giving the commencement speech, outlined various kinds of aspirations that we, Indians, have seen over the ages, taking examples from Indian PURANAS and history. He said  the only reason why we keep innovating, is that we don't stop aspiring. He stressed upon the fact that we should always aspire towards reaching greater heights, and work hard towards achieving them.  He gave the Ten Commandments for Success that included: being brave; believe in "no boundaries’; failures as learning opportunities; not being limited by success.

Also speaking on the occasion was the chief guest for the ceremony, Shri M. N. Vidyashankar, IAS, Principal Secretary, e-Governance, IT, BT and ST, Government of Karnataka. He underscored the importance of  innovation and said that is the only way for organizations to compete in the current global scenario. He also said that one of the main hurdles in the path of constant innovation was the non-acceptance of technology by members of the general public. Shri Vidyashankar highlighted with an example each for the success of using technology at their department and for the failure of an innovative education system due to the non-acceptance of technology. He also threw light on the fact that though Indians have significantly contributed to the research and innovation successes at Silicon Valley (California), they have not played such a major role in research activities in the Indus Valley (India), and advised the students to work towards a career of innovation.

Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, Prof. V. G. Talawar, in his presidential address stressed on the three Ds: Desire; Determination; Dedication.

The dignitaries distributed the degree certificates to the graduates. On the occasion, two graduates, Mr. Nabhajit Ray (M.Tech Class of 2009) and [https://about.me/nikeshnarayanan Mr. Nikesh Narayanan] (M.Tech Class of 2010), were awarded the "Parvathamma Subbaraya Gold Medal", instituted with munificent grants from Dr. Chudamani, an alumnus of the University of Mysore and currently, the Deputy Librarian at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

'''Law and development''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of law and economic and [[social development]].  It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development.

In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the law reform in [[developing countries]]. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development.  This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former [[Ford Foundation]] officials declared this movement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek &amp; Galanter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. 

The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.lawanddevelopment.net The Law and Development Institute] was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the [http://www.degruyter.com/ldr Law and Development Review] was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development.

The Living Machine is an intensive [[bioremediation]] system that can also produce beneficial byproducts, such as reuse-quality water, ornamental plants and plant products—for building material, energy biomass, animal feed. Aquatic and [[wetland]] plants, [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[protozoa]], [[plankton]], [[snails]] and other organisms are used in the system to provide specific cleansing or trophic functions. The tidal process operates outdoors in tropical and temperate climates. In colder climates, the system of tanks, pipes and filters may be housed in a greenhouse to prevent freezing and raise the rate of biological activity.

The initial development of the technology in the United States is generally credited to Dr. [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], an ecological designer, and evolved out of the [[bioshelter]] concept developed at the now-defunct [[New Alchemy Institute]]. The Living Machine system falls within the emerging discipline of [[ecological engineering]], and many  systems using earlier generations of the technology are built without being dubbed a Living Machine.

==Design theory==
The scale of Living Machine systems ranges from the individual building to community-scale [[public works]]. Some of the earliest Living Machines were used to treat domestic [[wastewater]] in small, [[ecovillages|ecologically-conscious villages]], such as [[Findhorn Foundation|Findhorn Community]] in [[Scotland]],.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/biological/index.php Ecovillage Findhorn: Biological Waste Water Treatment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210005606/http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/biological/index.php |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some treated the mixed municipal wastewater for semi-urban areas, such as [[South Burlington, Vermont]] (this plant closed recently).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/mtb/living_machine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The latest-generation Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machines are being used in major urban office buildings, military bases, housing developments, resorts and institutional campuses.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Dave. [http://www.readthehook.com/83481/cover-tao-poo-can-worrells-green-sewage-system-save-water-and-planet "The Tao of Poo: Can Worrell's Green Sewage System Save Water and Planet?"] ''The Hook''. June 11, 2009. Retrieved 2011-9-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each system is designed to handle a certain volume of water per day, but the system is also tailored for the qualities of the specific influent. For example, if the influent contains high levels of [[heavy metals]], ecological wastewater treament systems must be designed to include the proper [[biota (ecology)|biota]] to accumulate the metals.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Nancy J. 2005, A Safe and Sustainable World: The promise of Ecological Design. Island Press, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; During the “spring cleaning” season, there may be high levels of [[bleach]] in the water. This sudden concentration of a [[toxin]] is an example of a ''steep gradient''.

*''Steep gradients'' are drastic changes in conditions throughout the system that challenge the [[ecosystem]] to become resilient and stable.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed treatment system requires little management, so managers may intentionally create abrupt environmental or [[biochemical]] changes to promote ecosystem self-regulation. This mimics nature’s power and trains the ecosystem to adapt to influent variations.
*Designers seek to increase the surface area of contact that [[biota (ecology)|biota]] have with the sewage to promote high reaction rates. When organisms have ready access to the sewage, they can treat it more thoroughly.
*Ecological [[wastewater treatment]] systems are cellular, as opposed to monolithic, in design. If influent volume or makeup changes, new cells can be added or omitted without halting or disturbing the ecosystem.
*[[Photosynthetic]] plants and algae are important for [[oxygenate|oxygenating]] water, providing a medium for [[biofilms]], sequestering [[heavy metals]] and many other services.
[[biodiversity|Species diversity]] is a design goal that promotes complexity and resiliency in an [[ecosystem]]. Functional redundancy (the presence of multiple species that provide the same function) is an important example of the need for biodiversity. Snails and fish filter sludge and act as diagnostics; when a toxic load enters, snails will rise above the water level on the wall of the tank.

*The micro-ecosystem of a Living Machine system can be integrated with the macro-ecosystem just as ecosystems fade into one another naturally. This connection is commonly made with an outdoor constructed or natural wetland into which the effluent flows. Some living machines are partially or completely open to the outdoors, and this promotes interaction with the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with conventional treatment==
Björn Guterstam critiques conventional wastewater treatment for five different inadequacies that ''living machine'' systems address. This evaluation explains the basis of his five points of contention:&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1996. Ecological engineering for wastewater and its application in New England and Sweden. Ecological Engineering 6 (96- 108).&lt;/ref&gt;

*First, [[Sewage treatment|conventional treatment]] focuses narrowly on treating water and produces an often toxic sludge as a by-product of this cleaning process. ''Living machine'' systems can greatly reduce this sludge by conversion into biomass.
*[[Sewage treatment|Conventional treatment]] uses environmentally harmful chemicals (namely [[chlorine]]) to disinfect effluent following precipitation of solids (sludge) from the wastewater stream.  Ecological treatment uses biological processes instead of chemical inputs.
*Traditional processes do not adequately sequester heavy metals, and the sludge can also contain manmade organic compounds that are extremely difficult to break down. Some critics assert that the disposal of this sludge is not responsibly overseen in the [[United States]], so the excess sludge is sometimes spread on public forest  or even agricultural land, dumped in landfills or the ocean, and sometimes incinerated.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Duff. "Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, A Global Industry and a Toxic Secret." Harper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This not only pollutes the environment with unnaturally high concentrations of toxins but also wastes a valuable resource. Living Machines can sequester heavy metals by plant uptake and the plants can be incinerated and the metals isolated in ash for safe storage. These life-giving machines convert sludge into organic tissues such as fish, flowers and medicinal plants that have human uses.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A contained microsystem can be very successful in recycling nutrients, organic matter, and water. Depending on the toxicity and makeup of the influent, living machines can treat water to tertiary treatment standards and even reach potable standards for most or all metrics. This excellent organic recycling is possible if the [[biosolids]] are not heavily contaminated with persistent pollutants (such as [[aluminum]], which retards biotic growth). Mixed domestic/industrial [[municipal]] influent is more polluted, so a living machine may not always be able to treat every contaminant to levels that would not stress the ecosystem that receives the effluent. In this case, more treatment is necessary, which can be achieved by drainage into [[constructed wetlands]] which provide a different type of ecosystem that provides a fresh lineup of ecological players and services that can further process pollutants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Previous generations of ''Living Machine'' systems have employed clams to filter colloidal materials and fine suspended solids. Conventional treatment runs into engineering troubles when it attempts to handle these microscopic particles.&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1996. Ecological engineering for wastewater and its application in New England and Sweden. Ecological Engineering 6 (96- 108).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Conventional treatment is capital and energy intensive, whereas natural treatment is design intensive (and also management intensive if it is not well designed). The embodied fossil fuel energy in the heavy industrial infrastructure used in traditional activated sludge treatment is much greater than in the construction of a living machine system with a large greenhouse, manufacture of plastic tanks, mechanical aerators, pumps and valves among other equipment.

Guterstam contends that traditional facilities require larger capital investment and demand more labor and energy costs than their ecological counterparts. It is difficult to make a generalization about economic comparisons because thus far ''living machine'' systems have only been built for single commercial buildings. The next step in the development of these systems would be a larger scale ecosystem that has more diversity and higher populations to treat a larger volume of sewage. Until there is an equivalence of scale, economic comparison between the two systems is somewhat awkward and speculative. However, it is safe to say that ''Living Machine'' systems are ecologically superior.

[[Sewage treatment|Conventional wastewater treatment]] is heavily embedded in our industrial toolkit. A worldwide revolution in wastewater treatment would require an entire industry and profession to make a major disciplinary shift from a focus on ''industrial'' engineering to ''ecological'' engineering, applied biology and [[applied ecology|ecology]]. ''Living Machine'' systems have yet to be made on a comparable scale to conventional treatment plants, and this “biology of scale” could bring benefits or drawbacks in efficiency.

==Built components==
In tropical and temperate climates, ''Living Machine'' systems can be outdoors, as the temperature will sustain sufficient biological activity throughout the winter. In cold climates, a greenhouse is used to keep water temperatures warm so that plants do not winterize. Supplemental heating may also be necessary.

Living Machine systems use screens, [[biofilters]], plumbing, large plastic tanks, reed beds, rocks, fans, pumps and other mechanical devices. Every system is tailored to the volume and makeup of the sewage. Some are stand-alone greenhouses, while others are built into larger buildings.

[[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]] and Michael Shaw have a patent on a device called an "ecological fluidized bed" which is essentially a pumice-filled tank with a concentric inner tank that contains wetland plants. Pumps rapidly recirculate water to maximize the filtration rate of this device.&lt;ref&gt;John Todd et al. "Ecological fluidized bed method for the treatment of polluted water." US Patent #548U6291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living Machine System Process==

*“Fixed film ecology” has superseded systems based on hydroponics or a fluid medium. In fixed film systems the wetland cells are filled with a solid aggregate medium extensive surface area for beneficial biofilm (treatment bacteria) growth. Fixed film ecology allows for denser and more diverse micro-ecosystems to form than does a liquid medium. These ecosystems go well beyond bacteria to include a variety of organisms up to and including macro-vegetation.
*Tidal cycles (filling and draining the wetland in accelerated tidal action—12 or more cycles per day) are used to passively bring oxygen into the wetland cells. This action mimics the same type of biological action of natural tidal estuaries. Tidal Flow Wetlands replace the need to blow air into a liquid medium and use gravity to bring atmospheric oxygen into the cell when it is drained.

==Hydroponics and Aquaculture==

Some ecological wastewater treatment systems, including first-generation Living Machine systems, employed hydroponics and even aquaculture. However, these processes are not part of today's Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machine systems.

*The first step of the process is an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] settling tank. This closed anaerobic tank serves as a pre-treatment to allow solids to fall out of suspension and precipitate to the bottom of the reactor to reduce the [[turbidity]] of the water. A variety of [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria are present in this tank; they generate acids and ferment methane. This step may be unnecessary if the influent has low levels of solids.
*Next, the sewage flows through a [[biofilter]] of bark and [[humus|humic]] materials. This gives the influent its first filtration and reduces the odors prevalent in anaerobic conditions.
*The mixture then moves into a series of aerobic tanks. The first tank is a dark, closed-top aerobic reactor that serves as a transitional step. The next tank is an open-top, aerobic reactor that contains [[photosynthetic]] [[algae]] that fix [[oxygen]] back into the formerly [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]], turbid water. This provides [[oxygen]] and organic food (dead algae) for biological [[metabolism]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Microbial communities [[cell growth|proliferate]], and eventually must consume all of the [[photosynthetic]] algae so that the algae do not choke out [[macrophytes]] in later steps.
*Many types of [[bacteria]] immobilize pollutant [[minerals]], but certain [[species]] of bacteria are crucial to [[nutrient]] conversion. Specifically, ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' and ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' work in steps to [[nitrification|nitrify]] [[ammonia]], making it into [[nitrates]], which are available for plant and [[microbial]] uptake. These bacteria need [[calcium carbonate]] to [[catalyst|catalyze]] this reaction, so managers must maintain sufficient calcium levels in the water. Denitrifying bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' convert [[nitrates]] into gaseous [[nitrogen]], which is [[Volatilisation|volatilized]] in these open aerobic tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Nyle and Weil. The Nature and Properties of Soil 14th ed. Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Denitrification is the most desirable sink for nitrogen in living machines.&lt;ref&gt;Teal, John. 1997, “Contribution of Marshes and Salt Marshes to Ecological Engineering.” Chapter 16 in C. Etnier and Bjorn Guterstam. Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt; Protozoa have been shown to be capable of [[coliform]] and [[pathogen]] suppression.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, E.B. and E.G. Carrington, 1979. The fate of enteric bacteria and pathogens during sewage treatment. In: A. James and L Evison (Eds.). Biological Indicators of Water Quality. John Wiley, London, pp. 2001-2032.&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial breakdown is the primary biological treatment of both the conventional [[activated sludge]] process as well as these aquatic ecosystem sludge reactors.
*Higher plants are grown [[hydroponic]]ally in the aerobic tanks and provide multiple services. The most common plant used is [[water hyacinth]] (''Eicchornia crassipies''), which has filamentous aquatic roots with a high specific area. These feather-like roots provide a stable habitat for [[microbes]], and over time a bacterial [[biofilm]] builds up around the roots.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, David. “Parallel Performance Comparison Between Aquatic Root Zone and Textile Medium Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFFAS) Wastewater Treatment Systems.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, S.B. and J.M. Teal. 1996, “The role of plants in ecologically engineered wastewater treatment systems.” Ecological Engineering. 6(1-3): 137-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Water hyacinth, bulrush and other macrophytes sequester heavy metals. The bodies of these plants can be harvested and burned, and the heavy metals can be chemically isolated to take them out of the environment. ''[[Brassica juncea]]'' growing in waste streams has been found to contain up to 10% of its dry weight in lead.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda Kumar, P.B.A., V. Dushenkov, H. Motto and I. Raskin, 1995. Phytoextraction: the use of plants
to remove heavy metals from soils. Environ. Sci. Technol., 29: 1232-1238.
&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Plankton]] carries out multiple functions in the system with varying efficacy. [[Zooplankton]] feed on extremely small (&lt;25&amp;nbsp;µm) particles. In juvenile stages they feed on particles smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, David. “Parallel Performance Comparison Between Aquatic Root Zone and Textile Medium Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFFAS) Wastewater Treatment Systems"&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional waste treatment cannot process these fine suspended solids.&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1996. Ecological engineering for wastewater and its application in New England and Sweden. Ecological Engineering 6 (96- 108).&lt;/ref&gt; Although zooplankton do consume these fine particles, which are difficult for conventional treatment systems to process, the placement of plankton in the system is more valuable as a trophic link. Plankton can eat [[microbes]], which are abundant in the system, and the [[plankton]] is an ideal food for filter-feeding fish and [[mollusks]]. This food chain transfers biomass to higher trophic levels and increases the diversity and complexity of the ecosystem. John Todd thinks that “Since zooplankton can exchange the volume of a natural body of water several times per day it is difficult to overstate their importance in [[ecological engineering]].”&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Björn Guterstam, another one of the most well-published and experienced [[ecological engineering|ecological engineers]], this theoretical role has not been as successful in practice. He concedes that [[phytoplankton]] populations have been limited by toxic and somewhat deoxidized water at the bottom of tanks, as well as light limitations. [[Phytoplankton]] are [[primary production|primary producers]], which provide food for larger zooplankton species, so the zooplankton population drops with its [[photosynthetic]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1997, “Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Realities.” Chapter 7 in C. Etnier and Björn Guterstam. Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt; Because these principles have been implemented only on a small scale, these systems have a lowered buffering capacity due to issues of scale and separation from the macroecosystem, even though genetic and functional diversity is encouraged.
*[[Aquaculture]] can take place in more dilute tanks downstream after the [[eutrophication]]-causing contaminants have been ameliorated. [[Snails]] slide along the tank walls and graze on slime and sludge buildup, cleaning the tank. This self-regulation improves light penetration, which stimulates photosynthetic forms of algae, bacteria and plankton. Filter feeders sift through large volumes of water each day and consume the bacteria and plankton that are small enough to pass through. [[Mollusks]] such as mussels and snails, as well as some fish, are filter feeders. [[Detritus]]-feeding fish consume larger particles of suspended [[biosolids]]. Herbivorous fish are excluded from tanks where macrophytes carry out useful functions (such as [[biofilm]] hosting), but when plants are eventually harvested from the system, this plant tissue can be fed to a tank of herbivorous fish for aquaculture production.&lt;ref&gt;Sifa, Li. 1997 “Aquaculture and its role in ecological wastewater management.” Chapter 3 in C. Etnier and Bjorn Guterstam. Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A single ''[[Anodonta]]'' freshwater clam can filter as much as 40 litres/day of water, absorbing [[colloid]]al materials and other suspended solids at a removal rate of 99.5%. Many freshwater clams are in danger of [[extinction]], in part because some have [[gills]] that perform poorly in polluted environments.&lt;ref&gt;Karnaukhov, V.N., 1979. “The role of filtrator mollusks rich in carotenoid in the self-cleaning of fresh
waters.” Symp. Biol. Hung., 19: 151-167.&lt;/ref&gt; Since some of these clams can sequester colloids from streams or lakes, this provides an ecosystem service by slowing the erosion of soil colloids. Humans can strike up a symbiotic relationship with the clam genera ''Unlo'' and ''[[Anodonta]]'' by providing a clean habitat (when the water reaches the clam tank it is cleaner than some of their wild habitats). In exchange for a good home, the clams could aid humans by filtering colloids and suspended solids out of our wastewater. It is yet to be determined if the clams break up these colloids at all or if it is feasible to recycle clam compost back into field (which increases cation exchange capacity—-an agricultural benefit). Ecological engineering supports symbiotic relations between different species to serve the needs of humans as well as promoting the health of the ecosystem.

==Future horizons==
In a 2000 report to the USEPA on a South Burlington, Vermont, living machine, [[Ocean Arks International]] outlined five key areas which could shape the future of this field.&lt;ref&gt;"Ecological Design: Towards A Post-Engineering Perspective." http://www.oceanarks.org/ecodesign/postengineering/&lt;/ref&gt;
The foremost “possible breakthrough areas” is the ongoing classification of species by the biochemical, biological and ecological roles they play and how those roles effect other species under the context of wastewater treatment. The breakthrough would be to study the function of organisms in hopes of being able to more readily and successfully manage overall ecosystem function. Browne et al. (in press) have looked into the structuring of aquatic systems for water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, B., R.A.F. Seaton &amp; P. Jeffrey, In press. “Some propositions on the structuring of aquatic ecologies for water treatment.” Journal of Environmental Science and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trophic level|Trophic management]] is used to influence entire systems by selective [[predation]] based on diagnosing an imbalance and analyzing the web of ecosystem classifications, roles and relationships. This management technique exploits the close interconnections of the food web, trophic cascade, to send a ripple down through the living community. This stewardship technique is predicated upon an advanced understanding of the conditions in the ecosystem and modeling the dynamic relationships down the trophic cascade. The trophic cascade in lakes has been researched by Carpenter and Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S. R. &amp; J.F. Kitchell, eds. 1993. The Trophic Cascade in Lakes. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living Machine systems have been composed largely in closed greenhouses which can only react minimally with the surrounding ecosystem, and where populations have been heavily managed to foster equilibrium. If a Living Machine were subject to the ecology of invasions, new species would be free to colonize the system, and natural selection would dictate the success of any species. This would be true ecosystem self-design and self-management partnered with human stewardship.

Photosynthetic changes, specifically the control of light exposure is another powerful management practice capable of slowing or accelerating primary production. This is similar to the idea of trophic management, except that it manipulates the other end of the food web.

Finally, there is economic potential for methane generation, market crops such as [[flower]]s, [[fish]], [[tomato]]es, [[lettuce]] and other foods tolerant of [[hydroponic]] conditions, useful plants or medicinals. Combined with the revenue from wastewater treatment these services could turn living machines into pollution sinks and economic generators.&lt;ref&gt;"Ecological Design: Towards A Post-Engineering Perspective." http://www.oceanarks.org/ecodesign/postengineering/&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that a small, well-planned system in a good location can be economically viable. If a living machine can subsist in [[Alaska]], it seems reasonable that [[ecological engineering|ecologically engineered]] [[sewage treatment]] can be tailored to work smoothly in warm [[developing countries]].

Public sanitation and equitable access to water in very poor countries are grave problems. Living machines could be a low-capital approach to treating and recycling water, but skilled biologists may be a limited resource as well. A brick-pool living machine was built by Americans in Auroville, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Architecture for Humanity, "Design Like You Give a Damn." p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8494">{{Disability}}
The '''medical model of disability''', or medical model, arose from the biomedical perception of [[disability]]. This model links a disability diagnosis to an individual's physical body. The model supposes that this disability may reduce the individual's [[quality of life]] and the aim is, with medical intervention, this disability will be diminished or corrected.&lt;ref name="FisherGoodley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Pamela|last2=Goodley|first2=Dan|title=The linear medical model of disability: mothers of disabled babies resist with counter-narratives|journal=Sociology of Health &amp; Illnness|date=January 2007|volume=29|issue=1|pages=66–81|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9566.2007.00518.x|pmid=17286706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical model focuses on curing or managing illness or disability. By extension, the medical model supposes a "compassionate" or [[justice|just]] society invests resources in health care and related services in an attempt to cure or manage disabilities ''medically''. This is in an aim to expand functionality and/or improve functioning, and to allow disabled persons a more "normal" life. The [[medical]] profession's responsibility and potential in this area is seen as central.

== History ==
Before the introduction of the [[biomedical model]], patients relaying their narratives to the doctors was paramount. Through these narratives and developing an intimate relationship with the patients, the doctors would develop treatment plans in a time when diagnostic and treatment options were limited.&lt;ref name="Bury"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bury|first1=Mike|title=Illness narratives: fact or fiction?|journal=Illness Narratives: Fact or Fiction?|date=2001|volume=23|issue=3|page=263|doi=10.1111/1467-9566.00252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could particularly be illustrated with aristocratic doctors treating the elite during the 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawrence|first1=Christopher|title=Medicine in the making of modern Britain : 1700-1920|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780415091688|edition=Digital Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliance of doctors on the narratives of patients diminished with the growth of bio-medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewson|first1=N|title=The disappearance of the sick man from medical cosmology|journal=Sociology|date=1976|volume=10|issue=2|page=225|doi=10.1177/003803857601000202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) introduced a framework for working with disability, publishing the "International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps." The framework proposed to approach disability by using the terms Impairment, Handicap and Disability.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps,1980&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impairment = a loss or abnormality of physical bodily structure or function, of logic-psychic origin, or physiological or anatomical origin
*Disability = any limitation or function loss deriving from impairment that prevents the performance of an activity in the time lapse considered normal for a human being
*Handicap = the disadvantaged condition deriving from impairment or disability limiting a person performing a role considered normal in respect of age, sex and social and cultural factors

=== Components and usage ===
While [[personal narrative]] is present in [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal interactions]], and particularly dominant in Western Culture, personal narrative during interactions with medical personnel is reduced to relaying information about specific symptoms of the disability to medical professionals.&lt;ref name="FisherGoodley"/&gt; The medical professionals then interpret the information provided about the disability by the patient to determine a diagnosis, which likely will be linked to biological causes.&lt;ref name="FisherGoodley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury"/&gt;The medical professionals now define what is "normal" and what is "abnormal" in terms of biology and disability.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;

In some countries, the medical model of disability has influenced legislation and policy pertaining to persons with disabilities on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ayecBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=medical+model+of+disability+china#v=onepage&amp;q=medical%20model%20of%20disability%20china&amp;f=false|title=The Development of Disability Rights Under International Law: From Charity to Human Rights|last=Kanter|first=Arlene S.|date=2014-11-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134444663|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nX-sDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=confronting+discrimination+and+inequality+in+China#v=onepage&amp;q=confronting%20discrimination%20and%20inequality%20in%20China&amp;f=false|title=Confronting Discrimination and Inequality in China: Chinese and Canadian Perspectives|last=Mendes|first=Errol|last2=Srighanthan|first2=Sakunthala|date=2009-04-18|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=9780776617800|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), published in 2001, defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition (such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and depression) and personal and environmental factors (such as negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/|work=WHO|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The altered language and words used show a marked change in emphasis from talking in terms of disease or impairment to talking in terms of levels of health and functioning. It takes into account the social aspects of disability and does not see disability only as a 'medical' or 'biological' dysfunction. That change is consistent with widespread acceptance of the [[social model of disability]].

==Criticism==
The medical model of disability focuses on the individual's limitations and ways to reduce those impairments or using adaptive technology to adapt them to society. Current definitions of disability accept biomedical assistance but focus more on factors causing environmental and social exclusion. Uncritical reliance on the medical model produces unwanted consequences.

Among advocates of [[disability rights]], who tend to subscribe to [[social model of disability|the social model]] instead, the medical model of disability is often cited as the basis of an unintended social [[wikt:degradation|degradation]] of disabled people; further, resources are seen as excessively misdirected towards an almost-exclusively medical focus when those same resources could be used towards things like [[universal design]] and [[inclusion (disability rights)|societal inclusionary practices]]. This includes the monetary and the societal costs and benefits of various interventions, be they medical, surgical, social or occupational, from [[prosthetics]], drug-based and other "cures", and medical tests such as genetic screening or [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]. Often, a medical model of disability is used to justify large investment in these procedures, technologies and research, when adaptation of the disabled person's environment might ultimately be more beneficial to the society at large, as well as financially cheaper and physically more attainable.

Also, some disability rights groups see the medical model of disability as a [[civil rights]] issue and criticise [[charitable organizations]] or medical initiatives that use it in their portrayal of disabled people, because it promotes a [[pity|pitiable]], essentially negative, largely [[disempowered]] image of people with disabilities rather than casting disability as a political, social and environmental problem (see also the [[political slogan]] "[[Piss On Pity]]").

A '''model spectrum''' is an artificial [[spectrum]] of a [[star]] made by recreating the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] features seen in the spectrum. A model spectrum will usually be of a specific [[spectral type]] of [[star]]. It may include other properties of the star, such as a surrounding [[nebula]], presence or lack of an extended [[atmosphere]], or a [[circumstellar dust]] [[accretion disk|disc]].

The '''North Sea Magical Realists''' are a collective of artists resident on the [[North Sea]] coast whose art is loosely influenced by the aesthetics of [[Magical Realism]]. Its leading members include the artists [[Peter Rodulfo]] (b. 1958) and [[Mark Burrell]] (b. 1957). &lt;ref&gt; http://trippgallery.co.uk/exhibition/north-sea-magical-realists &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/mark-burrell-north-sea-magical-realist.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/as-elephant-laughed-and-norfolk.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/rodulfos-mandala-of-loving-kindness.html &lt;/ref&gt; 

Aware of each other's work for a number of years, Burrell and Rudolfo first met in New York USA, when exhibiting at the New York Expo of 1998.

In 2016 Burrell and Rodulfo elected [[Sir Thomas Browne]] as honorary 'Grand-father' of the movement, and simultaneously painted items found in Browne's [[Musaeum Clausum]] (section ''Rarities in Pictures''); Rodulfo painting item number 3 in the medium of oils on canvas (157 x 143&amp;nbsp;cm) with a title of ''Dr. Browne goes Submarining''; Burrell painting item 12 in the medium of alkyd resins on board (50 x 49&amp;nbsp;cm) with a title of ''Silent Presence''. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/NorthSeaMagicalRealism/ &lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 the North Sea Magical Realists held their first show at the Tripp Gallery, Amwell Street, London. Rodulfo and Burrell exhibited paintings, sculptures, etchings and included assemblages by group member Guy Richardson (b.1932)&lt;ref&gt; http://trippgallery.co.uk/exhibition/north-sea-magical-realists/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady Seat of Wisdom College''' (OLSW), formerly '''Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Academy''', is a [[private university|private]] [[Catholic higher education|Catholic]] [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Barry's Bay]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The college offers a three-year program with concentrations in Theology, Philosophy, History, Literature, and Classical and Early Christian Studies, as well as studies in Mathematics, Languages, Sacred Music, Fine Arts, Natural and Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="OLSWAaboutus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seatofwisdom.ca/alumni/after-olsw/|title=After OLSW|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; SWC is known for its conservative values and traditional Catholic teaching.&lt;ref name="Visions and Values"&gt;{{Cite web| title = OLWSA Visions and Values | url = http://seatofwisdom.org/about_us/about_us/vision-and-values.html | accessdate = August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Our Lady Seat of Wisdom grew out of a 1999 study group called “Mater Ecclesiae” in Combermere, Ontario, under the directorship of John Paul Meenan. The centre sought  to provide affordable Catholic education to students wishing to advance their studies after high school. In the early days, studies took place in living rooms, basements, hay lofts, and other areas hosted by local families, while teaching and tuition were free.

In 2000, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pembroke donated the former grounds of St. Joseph’s Convent for use by members of the study centre. In September 2000, Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Academy was established, and the school had its first official academic year which saw nine students and several teachers. In 2003, "the Academy" as it was called, added a second year of study to their program, and a third year in 2004.

By the beginning of the 2015-2016 academic year, the student body had grown to 108 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cardinalnewmansociety.org/college/lady-seat-wisdom|title=Our Lady Seat of Wisdom - Cardinal Newman Society|newspaper=Cardinal Newman Society|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, there were 136 students and a student-faculty ratio of 13:1.

SWC has been featured in [[The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College]] as one of the institutions around the world listed as faithfully Catholic colleges.&lt;ref name="OLSWANewman"&gt;{{Cite web| title = OLSWA featured in Newman Guide | url = http://seatofwisdom.org/news/latest/olswa-once-again-featured-in-guide-to-faithful-catholic-colleges.html | accessdate = August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Profile==
===Liberal Arts Education===
“[The purpose of a liberal arts education is to] open the mind, to correct it, to refine it, to enable it to know, and to digest, master, rule, and use its knowledge, to give it power over its own faculties, application, flexibility, method, critical exactness, sagacity, resource, address, [and] eloquent expression. . . .” 
&lt;ref&gt;Bl. John Henry Newman, ''The Idea of a University''&lt;/ref&gt;

The courses at Our Lady Seat of Wisdom are centered on Catholic liberal arts, faithful to the [[Magisterium]] of the Church. With liberal arts education underlying the academics, SWC has a core curriculum that encompasses studies in Theology, Philosophy, History, Literature, Languages, Fine Arts, Sacred Music, and Natural and Social Sciences.

=== Programs and Degree-Granting Status ===
On May 1, 2017, Our Lady Seat of Wisdom received degree-granting status and the title of "College" in the province of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.seatofwisdom.ca/official-olsw-approved-to-offer-bachelors-degree/&lt;/ref&gt; OLSW was approved by the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Education]] to grant Bachelor of Catholic Studies degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boudreau|first1=Evan|title=After 10 years, Our Lady Seat of Wisdom finally approved to grant degrees|url=https://www.catholicregister.org/features/item/24449-after-10-years-our-lady-seat-of-wisdom-finally-approved-to-grant-degrees|accessdate=April 1, 2018|work=The Catholic Register|date=February 26, 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first students received this degree at the end of the 2016-2017 academic year. SWC is working toward granting a four-year bachelor's degree. The college also grants various Certificates of Christian Humanities. SWC focuses on a core liberal arts curriculum.

==Student life==
Students have opportunity to take part in hikes, sports, musical performances, field trips, community prayer, choir practices, dances, special guest lectures, campus clubs and more.&lt;ref name="Student Life"&gt;{{Cite web| title = OLSWA Student Life Overview | url = http://seatofwisdom.org/student_life/overview/ | accessdate = August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official SWC clubs include the Paul Sanders and Janine Lieu Pro-Life Club, the Frassati Outdoors Club, the John-David Filmmaking Club, the Don Bosco Drama Club, and Schola (by the Sacred Music Society).&lt;ref name="Student Life"/&gt;

SWC currently has two chaplains, Fr. Blair Bernard and Fr. Joseph Hattie O.M.I. Both offer private spiritual direction and confession to students who wish to speak with them.&lt;ref name="Spiritual Life"&gt;{{Cite web| title = OLSWA Spiritual Life Formation | url = http://seatofwisdom.org/student_life/overview/ | accessdate = August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at SWC live in single-sex residences. Each residence houses from 5 to 16 students.

The main faculty professors  include Dr. Richard Shaw, Dr. Ky Heinze, Dr. Karl Perrson, Dr. Jordan Olver, Dr. Christine Schintgen, Prof. Michael Schintgen, Prof. Scott Nicholson and Prof. John Paul Meenan

'''Patch dynamics''' is an ecological perspective that the structure, function, and dynamics of ecological systems can be understood through studying their interactive patches.  Patch dynamics, as a term, may also refer to the spatiotemporal changes within and among patches that make up a landscape.  Patch dynamics is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic systems across organizational levels and spatial scales.  From a patch dynamics perspective, populations, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes may all be studied effectively as mosaics of patches that differ in size, shape, composition, history, and boundary characteristics.  

The idea of patch dynamics dates back to the 1940s when plant ecologists studied the structure and dynamics of vegetation in terms of the interactive patches that it comprises.  A mathematical theory of patch dynamics was developed by Simon Levin and Robert Paine in the 1970s, originally to describe the pattern and dynamics of an intertidal community as a patch mosaic created and maintained by tidal disturbances.  Patch dynamics became a dominant theme in ecology between the late 1970s and the 1990s.  

'''Patch dynamics''' is a conceptual approach to [[ecosystem]] and habitat analysis that emphasizes dynamics of [[heterogeneity]] within a system (i.e. that each area of an ecosystem is made up of a mosaic of small 'sub-ecosystems').&lt;ref name=Pickett1985&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickett|first1=Steward T.A.|last2=White|first2=P.S.|title= The Ecology of Natural Disturbance and Patch Dynamics|publisher= Academic Press|year=1985|isbn=0123960215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diverse patches of habitat created by natural [[disturbance regimes]] are seen as critical to the maintenance of this [[diversity (ecology)]]. A ''habitat patch'' is any discrete area with a definite shape, spatial and configuration used by a species for breeding or obtaining other resources. ''Mosaics'' are the patterns within landscapes that are composed of smaller elements, such as individual forest stands, shrubland patches, highways, farms, or towns.

== Patches and mosaics ==

Historically, due to the short time scale of human observation, mosaic landscapes were perceived to be [[punctuated equilibrium|static]] patterns of human population mosaics.&lt;ref name=Bogin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Barry|title=Patterns of human growth|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521564380|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ScfPjwF3BngC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus centered on the idea that the status of a particular [[population]], [[community]], or [[ecosystem]] could be understood by studying a particular patch within a mosaic. However, this perception ignored the conditions that interact with, and connect patches. In 1979, Bormann and Likens coined the phrase ''shifting mosaic'' to describe the theory that landscapes change and fluctuate, and are in fact dynamic. This is related to the battle of cells that occurs in a [[Petri dish]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

''Patch dynamics'' refers to the concept that [[landscapes]] are dynamic.&lt;ref name=Pickett1985/&gt; There are three states that a patch can exist in: ''potential'', ''active'', and ''degraded''. Patches in the ''potential'' state are transformed into active patches through [[colonization]] of the patch by [[dispersal (ecology)|dispersing species]] arriving from other ''active'' or ''degrading'' patches. Patches are transformed from the ''active'' state to the ''degraded'' state when the patch is abandoned, and patches change from ''degraded'' to ''potential'' through a process of [[recovery (ecology)|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;

Logging, fire, farming, and [[afforestation|reforestation]] can all contribute to the process of colonization, and can effectively change the shape of the patch. ''Patch dynamics'' also refers to changes in the structure, function, and composition of individual patches that can, for example, effect the rate of [[nutrient cycling]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Patches are also linked, although separated from other patches, migration occurs from one patch to another{{Vague|date=January 2010}}. This migration maintains the population of some patches, and can be the mechanism by which some plant species spread. This implies that ecological systems within landscapes are open, rather than closed and isolated. (Pickett, 2006)

== Conservation efforts ==
Recognizing the patch dynamics within a system is needed for [[conservation (ecology)]] efforts to succeed. Successful conservation includes understanding how a patch changes and predicting how they will be affected by external forces{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. These externalities include natural effects, such as [[land use]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], [[ecological restoration|restoration]], and [[Ecological succession|succession]], and the effects of human activities. In a sense, conservation is the active maintenance of patch dynamics (Pickett, 2006). The analysis of patch dynamics could be used to predict changes in biodiversity of an ecosystem. When patches of species can be tracked, it has been shown that fluctuations on the biggest patch (the most dominant species) can be used as an early warning of a  [[Biodiversity]] collapse &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saravia|first=Leonardo A.|last2=Momo|first2=Fernando R.|date=2017-07-01|title=Biodiversity collapse and early warning indicators in a spatial phase transition between neutral and niche communities|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/1589/|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/oik.04256|issn=1600-0706|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That means that if external conditions, like [[climate change]] and [[habitat fragmentation]], change the internal dynamics of patches a sharp reduction in biodiversity can be detected before it is produced &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrado|first=Raffaele|date=2014|title=Early warning signals of desertification transitions in semiarid ecosystems|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.062705|journal=Physical Review E|volume=90|issue=6|doi=10.1103/physreve.90.062705}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''pericope''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|ə|p|iː}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|περικοπή}}, "a cutting-out") in [[rhetoric]] is a set of verses that forms one coherent unit or thought, suitable for public reading from a text, now usually of [[sacred scripture]]. Its importance is mainly felt in, but not limited to, narrative portions of Sacred Scripture (as well as poetic sections).

[[Manuscript]]s—often [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]]—called pericopes, are normally [[evangeliaries]], that is, abbreviated [[Gospel Book]]s only containing the sections of the [[Gospel]]s required for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es of the [[liturgical year]]. Notable examples, both [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]], are the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] and the [[Salzburg Pericopes]].

[[Lectionary|Lectionaries]] are normally made up of pericopes containing the [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings for the [[liturgical year]]. A pericope consisting of passages from different parts of a single book, or from different books of the Bible, and linked together into a single reading is called a ''[[wikt:concatenation|concatenation]]'' or ''composite reading''.

'''QVT''' ('''Query/View/Transformation''') is a standard set of languages for [[model transformation]] defined by the [[Object Management Group]].&lt;ref name="OMGQVT"/&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Model transformation]] is a key technique used in [[model-driven architecture]]. As the name QVT indicates, the OMG standard covers transformations, views and queries together. Model queries and model views can be seen as special kinds of model transformation, provided that we use a suitably broad definition of model transformation: a model transformation is a program which operates on models.

The QVT standard defines three model transformation languages. All of them operate on models which conform to [[Meta-Object Facility]] (MOF) 2.0 metamodels; the transformation states which metamodels are used. A transformation in any of the three QVT languages can itself be regarded as a model, conforming to one of the metamodels specified in the standard. The QVT standard integrates the [[Object Constraint Language|OCL]] 2.0 standard and also extends it with imperative features.

* QVT-Operational is an imperative language designed for writing unidirectional transformations.
* QVT-Relations is a declarative language designed to permit both unidirectional and bidirectional model transformations to be written. A transformation embodies a consistency relation on sets of models. Consistency can be checked by executing the transformation in checkonly mode; the transformation then returns True if the set of models is consistent according to the transformation and False otherwise. The same transformation can be used in enforce mode to attempt to modify one of the models so that the set of models will be consistent. The QVT-Relations language has both a textual and a graphical concrete syntax.
* QVT-Core is a declarative language designed to be simple and to act as the target of translation from QVT-Relations. However, QVT-Core has never had a full implementation and in fact it is not as expressive as QVT-Relations.&lt;ref name="Stevens2011"/&gt; Hence the QVT Architecture pictured above is misleading: the transformation from QVT-Relations to QVT-Core given in the QVT Standard is not semantics-preserving.

Finally, QVT-BlackBox is a mechanism to invoke transformation facilities expressed in other languages (for example [[XSLT]] or [[XQuery]]).

Although QVT has a broad scope, it does not cover everything that has been considered as a model transformation, view or query. For example, the QVT languages do not permit transformations to or from textual models, since each model must conform to some MOF 2.0 metamodel. Model-to-text transformations are being standardised separately by OMG (see [[MOFM2T]]).

== History ==
In 2002, OMG issued a Request for proposal (RFP) on [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] Query/View/Transformation to seek a standard compatible with the [[Model Driven Architecture]] (MDA) recommendation suite (UML, MOF, OCL, etc.).

Several replies were given by a number of companies and research institutions that evolved during three years to produce a common proposal, based on a draft by UK research Dr Laurence Tratt. The first version was submitted and approved in 2005.&lt;ref name="OMGQVT1"/&gt;   QVT Version 1.1 was released in January 2011.&lt;ref name="OMGQVT"/&gt;

== Implementations ==
QVT-Operational:

*[[Borland Together]] contains an implementation of QVT Operational, which has been contributed&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/m2m-dev/msg00003.html [m2m-dev&amp;#93; Borland QVT contribution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225213412/http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/m2m-dev/msg00003.html |date=February 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Eclipse Foundation]] and is now developed as the [[M2M (Eclipse)|Eclipse M2M]] Operational QVT project.
*[[M2M (Eclipse)|Eclipse M2M]] Operational QVT: official Eclipse open source implementation of QVT Operational.&lt;ref name="EclipseM2M"/&gt;
*[[MagicDraw]] has the QVT plugin which uses Operational QVT implementation that is provided by the [[M2M (Eclipse)|Eclipse M2M]] project.
*[[SmartQVT]]: an Eclipse open source implementation (Orange Labs) of the QVT-Operational language.

QVT-Core:
*[[OptimalJ]]: Early access implementation of the QVT-Core language was in [[OptimalJ]] version 3.4 from [[Compuware]]. However, OptimalJ has been discontinued.

QVT-Relations:

*ModelMorf: A proprietary tool from [[Tata Consultancy Services]] Ltd. Fully compliant with QVT-Relations language. The trial version&lt;ref name="ModelMorf"/&gt; provides a command line utility which consumes and produces models in XMI form. A full-fledged, repository integrated version is available as part of their proprietary modeling framework.&lt;ref name="TCSCodeGeneratorFramework"/&gt;
*MediniQVT:&lt;ref name="Medini"/&gt; EMF based transformation engine with EPL license for engine and non-commercial license editor/debugger. Uses QVT-Relations syntax, but deliberately departs from the semantics of the OMG standard.&lt;ref name="MediniSlides"/&gt;
*The [[M2M (Eclipse)|Eclipse M2M]] project aims to produce an implementation of QVT Core and Relations.&lt;ref name="EclipseM2M"/&gt;
* Echo,&lt;ref name="Echo"/&gt; an open-source EMF-based tool for model repair and transformation built over the [[Alloy (specification language)|Alloy]] model finder, which provides an implementation of QVT-Relations syntax, but using  semantics that deliberately depart from the OMG specification.

QVT-Like:

*jQVT:&lt;ref name="jQVT"/&gt; A compiled QVT engine for Java, using Xbase in place of OCL. A QVT-relational transformation is first compiled into Java source code, which then directly produces the target model from source ones at run-time, without interpreting the transformation rule again. It supports EMF models, as well as plain Java objects.
*[[Tefkat]] : an open source implementation of Tefkat language which is also similar to QVT. Open source.
*[[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]] : a component in the [[M2M (Eclipse)|M2M]] Eclipse project. ATL is a QVT-like transformation language and engine with a large user community and an open source library of transformations.
*Model Transformation Framework (MTF):&lt;ref name="IBMMTF"/&gt; an [[IBM]] [[alphaWorks]] project, last updated in 2007.

'''Reed–Muller codes''' are [[error-correcting code]]s that are used in wireless communications applications, particularly in deep-space communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Massey|first=James L.|date=1992|pages=1–17|publisher=Springer-Verlag|language=en|doi=10.1007/bfb0036046|isbn=978-3540558514|title=Advanced Methods for Satellite and Deep Space Communications|volume=182|series=Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences|chapter=Deep-space communications and coding: A marriage made in heaven|citeseerx=10.1.1.36.4265}}[[https://www.isiweb.ee.ethz.ch/archive/massey_pub/pdf/BI321.pdf pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, the proposed [[5G|5G standard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_ran/WG1_RL1/TSGR1_87/Report/Final_Minutes_report_RAN1%2387_v100.zip|title=3GPP RAN1 meeting #87 final report|publisher=3GPP|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the closely related [[Polar code (coding theory)|polar codes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5075875/|title=Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=55|issue=7|pages=3051–3073|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-31|doi=10.1109/TIT.2009.2021379|year=2009|last1=Arikan|first1=Erdal|hdl=11693/11695}}&lt;/ref&gt; for error correction in the control channel. Due to their favorable theoretical and mathematical properties, Reed–Muller codes have also been extensively studied in [[theoretical computer science]].

Reed–Muller codes generalize the [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon codes]] and the [[Hadamard code|Walsh–Hadamard code]]. Reed–Muller codes are [[Linear code|linear block codes]] that are [[locally testable code|locally testable]], [[locally decodable code|locally decodable]], and [[List decoding|list decodable]]. These properties make them particularly useful in the design of [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s.

Traditional Reed–Muller codes are binary codes, which means that messages and codewords are binary strings. When ''r'' and ''m'' are integers with 0 ≤ ''r'' ≤ ''m'', the Reed–Muller code with parameters  ''r'' and ''m'' is denoted as RM(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''m''). When asked to encode a message consisting of ''k'' bits, where  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k=\sum_{i=0}^r \binom{m}{i}&lt;/math&gt;to produce a holds, the RM(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') code produces a codeword consisting of 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

Reed–Muller codes are named after [[David E. Muller]], who discovered the codes in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=David E.|date=1954|title=Application of Boolean algebra to switching circuit design and to error detection|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6499441/?reload=true|journal=Transactions of the I.R.E.

Reed]], who proposed the first efficient decoding algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Irving S.|date=1954|title=A class of multiple-error-correcting codes and the decoding scheme|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1057465/?reload=true|journal=Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Information Theory|language=en-US|volume=4|issue=4|pages=38–49|doi=10.1109/tit.1954.1057465|issn=2168-2690|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description using low-degree polynomials==
Reed–Muller codes can be described in several different (but ultimately equivalent) ways. The description that is based on low-degree polynomials is quite elegant and particularly suited for their application as [[locally testable code]]s and [[locally decodable code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prahladh Harsha et al., [[arxiv:1002.3864|Limits of Approximation Algorithms: PCPs and Unique Games (DIMACS Tutorial Lecture Notes)]], Section 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encoder ===
A [[block code]] can have one or more encoding functions &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; that map messages &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x\in\{0,1\}^k &lt;/math&gt; to codewords &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C(x)\in\{0,1\}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;. The Reed&amp;ndash;Muller code {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} has [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k=\sum_{i=0}^r \binom{m}{i}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Block code#The block length n|block length]]  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n=2^m&lt;/math&gt;. One way to define an encoding for this code is based on the evaluation of [[Multilinear polynomial|multilinear polynomials]] with ''m'' variables and [[total degree]] ''r''. Every multilinear polynomial over the [[finite field]] with two elements can be written as follows:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;p_c(Z_1,\dots,Z_m) = \sum_{\underset{|S|\le r}{S\subseteq\{1,\dots,m\}}} c_S\cdot \prod_{i\in S} Z_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The &lt;math display="inline"&gt; Z_1,\dots,Z_m &lt;/math&gt; are the variables of the polynomial, and the values &lt;math display="inline"&gt; c_S\in\{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the polynomial. Since there are exactly &lt;math display="inline"&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; coefficients, the message &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x\in\{0,1\}^k &lt;/math&gt; can be used as these coefficients. In this way, each message &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a unique polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_x &lt;/math&gt; in ''m'' variables. To construct the codeword &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C(x) &lt;/math&gt;, the encoder evaluates &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_x &lt;/math&gt; at all evaluation points &lt;math display="inline"&gt; a\in\{0,1\}^m &lt;/math&gt;, where it interprets the sum as addition modulo two in order to obtain a bit &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(p_x(a)\bmod 2) \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the encoding function is defined via&lt;math display="block"&gt;C(x) = \left(p_x(a)\bmod 2\right)_{a\in\{0,1\}^m}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the codeword &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; suffices to uniquely reconstruct &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; follows from [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange interpolation]], which states that the coefficients of a polynomial are uniquely determined when sufficiently many evaluation points are given. Since &lt;math&gt;C(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(x+y)=C(x)+C(y) \bmod 2&lt;/math&gt; holds for all messages &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear map]]. Thus the Reed&amp;ndash;Muller code is a [[linear code]].

===== Example =====
For the code {{nowrap|RM(''2'', ''4'')}}, the parameters are as follows:

&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \begin{align}
r&amp;=2\\
m&amp;=4\\
k&amp;=\textstyle\binom{4}{2}+\binom{4}{1}+\binom{4}{0}= 6+4+1=11\\
n&amp;=2^m=16\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt; C:\{0,1\}^{11}\to\{0,1\}^{16} &lt;/math&gt; be the encoding function just defined. To encode the string x = 1 1010 010101 of length 11, the encoder first constructs the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_x &lt;/math&gt; in 4 variables:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
p_x(Z_1,Z_2,Z_3,Z_4)
&amp;= 1
+ (1\cdot Z_1 + 0\cdot Z_2 + 1\cdot Z_3 + 0\cdot Z_4)
+ (0\cdot Z_1 Z_2 + 1\cdot Z_1Z_3 + 0\cdot Z_1Z_4 + 1\cdot Z_2Z_3 + 0\cdot Z_2Z_4+ 1\cdot Z_3Z_4)\\
&amp;=1+Z_1+Z_3+Z_1Z_3+Z_2Z_3+Z_3Z_4
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;Then it evaluates this polynomial at all 16 evaluation points:&lt;math display="block"&gt;p_x(0000)= 1,\;
p_x(0001)= 1,\;
p_x(0010)= 1,\;
p_x(0011)= 1,\;

p_x(0100)= 1,\;
p_x(0101)= 0,\;
p_x(0110)= 1,\;
p_x(0111)= 0,\;

p_x(1000)= 0,\;
p_x(1001)= 1,\;
p_x(1010)= 0,\;
p_x(1011)= 1,\;

p_x(1100)= 0,\;
p_x(1101)= 0,\;
p_x(1110)= 0,\;
p_x(1111)= 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;As a result, C(1 1010 010101) = 1111 1010 0101 0000 holds.

=== Decoder ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
As was already mentioned, Lagrange interpolation can be used to efficiently retrieve the message from a codeword. However, a decoder needs to work even if the codeword has been corrupted in a few positions, that is, when the received word is different from any codeword. In this case, a local decoding procedure can help.

=== Generalization to larger alphabets via low-degree polynomials ===
Using low-degree polynomials over a finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to extend the definition of Reed&amp;ndash;Muller codes to alphabets of size &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; be positive integers, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; should be thought of as larger than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. To encode a message &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x\in\mathbb F^k&lt;/math&gt; of with &lt;math&gt;k=\textstyle\binom{m+d}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, the message is again interpreted an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-variate polynomial &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; of total degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and with coefficient from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt;. Such a polynomial indeed has &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\binom{m+d}{m}&lt;/math&gt; coefficients. The Reed–Muller encoding of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the list of all evaluations of &lt;math&gt;p_x(a)&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb F^m&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the block length is &lt;math&gt;n=q^m&lt;/math&gt;.

== Description using a generator matrix ==
{{Confusing section|date=March 2011|reason=this section uses dense notation that is not explained well for most readers}}

A generator matrix for a Reed&amp;ndash;Muller code {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} of length {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be constructed as follows. Let us write the set of all ''m''-dimensional binary vectors as:

:&lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{F}_2^m = \{ x_1, \ldots, x_{N} \}.  &lt;/math&gt;

We define in ''N''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; the [[indicator vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}_A \in \mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;

on subsets &lt;math&gt; A \subset X &lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \mathbb{I}_A \right)_i = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mbox{ if } x_i \in A \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{ otherwise} \\ \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

together with, also in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;, the binary operation

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge z = (w_1 \cdot z_1, \ldots , w_N \cdot z_N ), &lt;/math&gt;

referred to as the ''wedge product'' (not to be confused with the [[wedge product]] defined in exterior algebra). Here, &lt;math&gt;w=(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_N)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=(z_1,z_2,\ldots, z_N)&lt;/math&gt; are points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; (''N''-dimensional binary vectors), and the operation &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the usual multiplication in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^m&lt;/math&gt; is an ''m''-dimensional vector space over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;, so it is possible to write

&lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{F}_2)^m = \{ (y_m, \ldots , y_1) \mid y_i \in \mathbb{F}_2 \} .&lt;/math&gt;

We define in ''N''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; the following vectors with length &lt;math&gt; N: v_0 = (1,1,\ldots,1) &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; v_i = \mathbb{I}_{ H_i } ,&lt;/math&gt;

where 1 ≤ i ≤ ''m'' and the ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[hyperplane]]s in &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{F}_2)^m&lt;/math&gt; (with dimension {{nowrap|''m'' &amp;minus; 1}}):

:&lt;math&gt;H_i = \{ y \in ( \mathbb{F}_2 ) ^m \mid y_i = 0 \} .&lt;/math&gt;

====The generator matrix====
The Reed&amp;ndash;Muller {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} code of order ''r'' and length ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is the code generated by ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the wedge products of up to ''r'' of the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''m''}}  (where by convention a wedge product of fewer than one vector is the identity for the operation). In other words, we can build a generator matrix for the {{nowrap|RM(''r'', ''m'')}} code, using vectors and their wedge product permutations up to ''r'' at a time &lt;math&gt;{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n, \ldots, (v_{i_1} \wedge v_{i_2}), \ldots (v_{i_1} \wedge v_{i_2} \ldots \wedge v_{i_r})}&lt;/math&gt;, as the rows of the generator matrix, where {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''m''}}.

====Example 1====

Let ''m'' = 3. Then ''N'' = 8, and

:&lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{F}_2^3 = \{ (0,0,0), (0,0,1),  \ldots, (1,1,1) \}, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v_0 &amp; = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) \\[2pt]
v_1 &amp; = (1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0) \\[2pt]
v_2 &amp; = (1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0) \\[2pt]
v_3 &amp; = (1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The RM(1,3) code is generated by the set

:&lt;math&gt; \{ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3 \},\, &lt;/math&gt;

or more explicitly by the rows of the matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====

The RM(2,3) code is generated by the set:
:&lt;math&gt; \{ v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_1 \wedge v_2, v_1 \wedge v_3, v_2 \wedge v_3 \} &lt;/math&gt;

or more explicitly by the rows of the matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
The following properties hold:

# The set of all possible wedge products of up to ''m'' of the ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;.
# The RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m'') code has [[linear code|rank]]
#:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{s=0}^r {m \choose s}. &lt;/math&gt;
# {{math|1=RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m'') = RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m ''&amp;minus; 1) {{!}} RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'' &amp;minus; 1, ''m'' &amp;minus; 1)}} where '|' denotes the [[bar product (coding theory)|bar product]] of two codes.
# {{math|1=RM&amp;thinsp;(''r'', ''m'')}} has minimum [[Hamming weight]] 2&lt;sup&gt;''m'' &amp;minus; ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Proof====
{{Ordered list
|
There are

::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{s=0}^m { m \choose s } = 2^m = N &lt;/math&gt;

such vectors and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; have dimension ''N'' so it is sufficient to check that the ''N'' vectors span; equivalently it is sufficient to check that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(m, m) = \mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;.

Let ''x'' be a binary vector of length ''m'', an element of ''X''.  Let (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of ''x''.  Define

::&lt;math&gt;y_i = \begin{cases} v_i &amp; \text{ if } (x)_i = 0 \\ v_0+v_i &amp; \text{ if } (x)_i = 1 \\ \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
where 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤''m''.

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}_{ \{ x \} } = y_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge y_m &lt;/math&gt;

Expansion via the distributivity of the wedge product gives &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{I}_{ \{ x \} } \in \mathrm{RM}(m,m) &lt;/math&gt;. Then since the vectors &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbb{I}_{ \{ x \} } \mid x \in X \} &lt;/math&gt; span &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(m,n)=\mathbb{F}_2^N&lt;/math&gt;.

|
By '''1''', all such wedge products must be linearly independent, so the rank of RM(''r, m'') must simply be the number of such vectors.

Omitted.

By induction.

:The {{math|1=RM(0,&amp;nbsp;''m'')}} code is the repetition code of length {{math|1=''N''&amp;nbsp;=2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and weight ''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. By '''1''' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(m,n)=\mathbb{F}_2^n&lt;/math&gt; and has weight 1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The article [[bar product (coding theory)]] gives a proof that the weight of the bar product of two codes ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\min \{ 2w(C_1), w(C_2) \} &lt;/math&gt;

:If 0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; ''m'' and if {{Ordered list |list_style_type=lower-roman
|{{math|1=RM(''r'',''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}} has weight {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;1&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|{{math|1=RM(''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}} has weight {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;1&amp;minus;(''r''&amp;minus;1)&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;minus;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
}}
:then the bar product has weight

::&lt;math&gt;\min \{ 2 \times 2^{m-1-r}, 2^{m-r} \} = 2^{m-r} .&lt;/math&gt;
}}
=== Decoding RM codes ===
RM(''r'', ''m'') codes can be decoded using [[majority logic decoding]]. The basic idea of majority logic decoding is
to build several checksums for each received code word element. Since each of the different checksums must all
have the same value (i.e. the value of the message word element weight), we can use a majority logic decoding to decipher
the value of the message word element. Once each order of the polynomial is decoded, the received word is modified
accordingly by removing the corresponding codewords weighted by the decoded message contributions, up to the present stage.
So for a ''r''th order RM code, we have to decode iteratively r+1, times before we arrive at the final
received code-word. Also, the values of the message bits are calculated through this scheme; finally we can calculate
the codeword by multiplying the message word (just decoded) with the generator matrix.

One clue if the decoding succeeded, is to have an all-zero modified received word, at the end of (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-stage decoding
through the majority logic decoding. This technique was proposed by Irving S. Reed, and is more general when applied
to other finite geometry codes.

==Description using a recursive construction==

A Reed–Muller code RM(''r,m'') exists for any integers &lt;math&gt;m \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le r \le m&lt;/math&gt;. RM(''m'', ''m'') is defined as the universe (&lt;math&gt;2^m,2^m,1&lt;/math&gt;) code. RM(&amp;minus;1,m) is defined as the trivial code (&lt;math&gt;2^m,0,\infty&lt;/math&gt;). The remaining RM codes may be constructed from these elementary codes using the length-doubling construction

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM}(r,m) = \{(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v})\mid\mathbf{u} \in \mathrm{RM}(r,m-1),\mathbf{v} \in \mathrm{RM}(r-1,m-1)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this construction, RM(''r,m'') is a binary [[linear block code]] (''n'', ''k'', ''d'') with length {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, dimension &lt;math&gt;k(r,m)=k(r,m-1)+k(r-1,m-1)&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d = 2^{m-r}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;r \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. The [[dual code]] to RM(''r,m'') is RM(''m''-''r''-1,''m''). This shows that repetition and SPC codes are duals, biorthogonal and extended Hamming codes are duals and that codes with {{math|1=''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/2}} are self-dual.

==Special cases of Reed&amp;ndash;Muller codes==

=== Table of all RM(r,m) codes for m≤5 ===
All {{math|1=RM(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')}} codes with &lt;math&gt;m\le 5&lt;/math&gt;  and alphabet size 2 are displayed here, annotated with the standard [n,k,d] [[Block code#Popular notation|coding theory notation]] for [[block code]]s. The code {{math|1=RM(''r'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')}} is a &lt;math&gt;\textstyle [2^m,k,2^{m-r}]_2&lt;/math&gt;-code, that is, it is a [[linear code]] over a [[binary set|binary alphabet]], has [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 2^m&lt;/math&gt;, [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] (or dimension) {{mvar|k}}, and [[Block code#The distance d|minimum distance]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 2^{m-r}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1956, [[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] published a paper called '''"Revitalization Movements"''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/people/mira.amiras/courses/c10/s2/AFC_Wallace_RevitalizationMvt.pdf   Wallace, Anthony F.C. 1956. "Revitalization Movements," ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 58: 264-281.]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how [[culture]]s change themselves.   A revitalization movement is a "deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;265), and Wallace describes at length the processes by which a revitalization movement takes place.

Wallace' model 1956 describes the process of a '''revitalization movement'''. It is derived from studies of a Native American religious movement, The Code of [[Handsome Lake]], which may have led to the formation of the [[Longhouse Religion]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{Plainlist|
*I. ''Period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to a group's social and natural environment.
*II. ''Period of increased individual stress''. While the group as a whole is able to survive through its accustomed  cultural behavior, changes in the social or natural environment frustrate efforts of many people to obtain normal satisfactions of their needs.
*III. ''Period of cultural distortion''. Changes in the group's social or natural environment drastically reduce the capacity of accustomed cultural behavior to satisfy most persons' physical and emotional needs.
*IV. ''Period of revitalization'': (1) reformulation of the cultural pattern; (2) its communication; (3) organization of a reformulated cultural pattern; (4) adaptation of the reformulated pattern to better meet the needs and preferences of the group; (5) cultural transformation; (6) routinization, when the adapted reformulated cultural pattern becomes the standard cultural behavior for the group.
*V. ''New period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to the group's changed social and/or natural environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace derived his theory from studies of so-called primitive peoples (preliterate and homogeneous), with particular attention to the [[Iroquois]] revitalization movement led by [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] religious leader and [[prophet]] [[Handsome Lake]] (1735-1815). Wallace believed that his revitalization model applies to movements as broad and complex as the rise of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Methodism]].

Revitalizaton is a part of social movements.

Scholars such as Vittorio Lanternari (1963) and Peter Worsley (1968) have developed and adapted Wallace's insights.

'''Robert Tavernor''' (born 1954) is an [[English people|English]] Emeritus Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at the [[London School of Economics]] and Political Science (LSE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/tavernor.aspx |title=Professor Robert Tavernor - Academic staff - Who's who - Department of Sociology - Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founding director of the Tavernor Consultancy in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavernorconsultancy.co.uk/ |title=Home &amp;#124; Tavernor Consultancy Architecture + Heritage |work=Tavernorconsultancy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an [[architecture]] [[historian]] and [[urbanist]], who has published widely on architecture and urban design, including the impact of tall buildings on historic cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/482/48244.htm |title=House of Commons - Transport, Local Government and the Regions - Memoranda |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2002-01-22 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a long academic career, having been appointed to the Forbes Chair in Architecture at the University of Edinburgh at age 36.

== Biography ==

Tavernor was born in England and studied architecture in London (BA and Dip. Arch with Distinction, 1973–79), Rome ([[British Prix de Rome]] in Architecture at the [[British School at Rome]], 1979–80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/awards/architecture-awards-ii/rome-prize-in-architecture-2 |title=Rome Prize in Architecture « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and at the [[University of Cambridge]] (St John's College, 1980–83, doctorate awarded 1985), where his PhD thesis, ''Concinnitas in the Architectural Theory and Practice of Leon Battista Alberti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/239042 |title=Concinnitas in the architectural theory and practice of Leon Battista Alberti |publisher=Dspace.cam.ac.uk |date=1985-11-12 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supervised by [[Joseph Rykwert]]. He is a registered architect and a member of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (since 1985).

He has held multiple academic posts in the UK. He was formerly Forbes Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1992–95), Professor of Architecture and Head of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering at the [[University of Bath]] (1995–2005), LSE Professor of Architecture and Urban Design (2005–2011) and Director of the [[LSE Cities]] Programme (2005–08). He held various visiting academic posts internationally, including Visiting Professor at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA, 1998), European Union Visiting Scholar in planning and conservation at the [[University of Texas A&amp;M]] (2002); and Visiting Professor in Architecture and Urbanism at the University of São Paulo, Brazil (2004), and the University of Bath (since 2009).

He founded the Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA) at Bath, and with [[Vaughan Hart]], established a focus on Classical and Italian Renaissance architectural treatises; between them they have translated and written about the leading classical architectural theorists – including, [[Vitruvius]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]]. He has been a national assessor for the Architecture and the Built Environment sub-panel of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008) for the UK Higher Education Funding Council for Education (HEFCE), and a member of the Faculty of the Fine Arts of the British School at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/about/governance |title=Governance « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavernor initiated (with co-authors) a series of modern translations of the principal classical architectural treatise writers – Vitruvius, Alberti and Palladio – and is the sole author of parallel monographs on these subjects published by (Yale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |title=Smoot's Ear - Tavernor, Robert - Yale University Press |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103083921/http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/robert-tavernor |title=Robert Tavernor &amp;#124; The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book on Alberti was described as "the last and the best of the books on Alberti on this scale in the twentieth century" (Chronique).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300076158 |title=On Alberti and the Art of Building |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=1999-01-11 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the use of the computer to visualise urban forms in architectural exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1578928 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - arq: Architectural Research Quarterly - Abstract - Architectural history and computing |work=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-curating with Rykwert in 1994 the international exhibition of Alberti's work at [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] for the computer firm [[Olivetti]]. As a consultant architect and urbanist he applies his knowledge of architectural history, design and the visual representation of buildings in advising planners and architects on the form, character, scale and massing of tall buildings in the [[City of London]] and along the south bank of the [[Thames]]. His advice on several large urban masterplan projects in London (including Battersea Power Station) led to him being invited in 2007, by former Russian Senator Gordeev, to assemble and to contribute his expertise to an international masterplanning team to re-configure the city of [[Perm]] (population of 1 million) in the southern [[Urals]]. The published masterplan led by KCAP was awarded the Grand Prix at the Moscow Architecture Biennale in May 2010.

== Works ==

As an architectural historian and theorist, he is an expert in the foundations of [[Italian Renaissance architecture]] and the transmission of associated ideas and forms to England and America. He is the author of ''Palladio and Palladianism'' (1991 – subsequently translated into Italian, Chinese and Korean) and ''On Alberti and the Art of Building'' (1998). He is co-translator of two English translations of architectural treatises: Leon Battista Alberti’s 16th century ''De re aedificatoria'', as ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (1988); and Andrea Palladio’s 17th century ''I quattro libri dell’architettura'', as ''The Four Books on Architecture'' (1997), and co-edited and provided the introduction to Vitruvius' ''On Architecture'' (2009).

Tavernor's translation works have become the standard texts in art historical scholarship, used by students and scholars throughout the world. His book ''Smoot’s Ear: The Measure of Humanity'' (2007 and 2008) pulls together much of his earlier writings and sets measures and measuring in a cultural context and shows how deeply they are connected to human experience and history.

He was co-editor of ''Body and Building: Essays on the changing relation of Body to Architecture'' (2002 and 2005), a collection of essays on art and architecture dedicated to Rykwert. He founded the Alberti Group with Rykwert, which led to the 1994 international exhibition on Alberti for Olivetti. [[Photogrammetry|Photogrammetric drawings]] relating to research for the exhibition can be found on the CASA website at Bath University. Tavernor was subsequently commissioned by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] to produce computer animated urban and architectural reconstructions through CASA for exhibitions in London and internationally, for the Sir John Soane Exhibition (1999), Aztecs Exhibition (2003), and by [[Tate Britain]] for the Sir [[Stanley Spencer]] Exhibition (2001).&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7769421"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |title=Stanley Spencer - Virtual Church-House |work=tate.org.uk |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520044649/http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |archivedate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Tavernor is currently an architectural and urban design consultant in London.

'''Route reconnaissance''' is the [[intelligence assessment]] of the operational environment in reconnaissance operations of routes for military use, including methods of reconnoitering and classifying them for other troops. In a [[tactical area of responsibility]] during [[combat operations]] the primary purpose of conducting route reconnaissance is to find and report all enemy forces that can interfere with movement along a route, and to identify the limit of [[direct-fire]] range and [[dominant terrain|terrain]] that dominates the route. Route reconnaissance includes creation of reconnaissance overlays to identify land and water features, bridge reconnaissance and [[bridge classification|classification]], [[road reconnaissance]] and [[road structure and design|classification]], [[special terrain reconnaissance]] such as that used during [[cross-country movement]], at the [[landing area]]s, on the [[inland waterway]]s, or when using footpaths and [[trail]]s, [[engineer reconnaissance]], and use of [[military route sign]]s (standard signs, sign lighting, bridge signs). A significant part of route reconnaissance is the ability to identify [[choke point]]s that prohibit military traffic by using [[conversion factors and tables]] to identify non-standard surfaces or inadequate [[load bearing]] in structure. To do so, [[Military Load Classification]]s are used for standard vehicles of a given [[armed force]]. Route reconnaissance is typically conducted by a foot, horse or vehicle-mounted [[route reconnaissance patrol]], sometimes with aid of [[aerial reconnaissance aircraft]]. The patrol would include regular [[reconnaissance]] elements and a [[combat engineering]] team.

A '''satiric misspelling''' is an intentional misspelling of a word, phrase or name for a [[rhetoric]]al purpose. This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, ''[[k]]'' replacing ''[[c]]''), or symbol (for example, ''[[$]]'' replacing ''[[s]]'', ''[[@]]'' replacing ''[[a]]'', or ''[[¢]]'' replacing ''c'').  Satiric misspelling is found particularly in [[Internet slang|informal writing on the Internet]], but can also be found in some serious political writing that opposes the [[status quo]].

== ''K'' replacing ''c'' ==
Replacing the letter ''c'' with ''k'' in the first letter of a word came into use by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group.

In the 1960s and early 1970s in the [[United States]], [[left-wing politics|leftists]], particularly the [[Yippies]], sometimes used ''[[Amerika (disambiguation)|Amerika]]'' rather than ''America'' in referring to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15,69.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123223245/http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15%2C69.htm |title=CACC NEWSLETTER |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |work=schwarzreport.org |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=81|title=A Call to Arms (1969?) -  Hippy Land, Home of the Hippies|work=hippy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050726012713/http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|archivedate=July 26, 2005 |work=riseup.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/sixties/radical.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/bgriff/H207web/sixties/rubinchildofAmerika.htm|title=Jerry Rubin: Self-Portrait of a Child of "Amerika," 1970|work=american.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used as a political statement today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasonalexandercruz.com/|title=Nachrichten aus der Musik- und Entertainmentbranche -  Jasonalexandercruz.com|work=jasonalexandercruz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/guinnessgurl/sets/148438/|title=political|work=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that this was originally an allusion to the [[German language|German]] spelling of the word, and intended to be suggestive of [[Nazism]], a hypothesis that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' supports.

In broader usage, the replacement of the letter ''c'' with ''k'' denotes general political skepticism about the topic at hand and is intended to discredit or debase the term in which the replacement occurs.&lt;ref name="LeSaint's Sloth Cave"&gt;{{cite web|title=LeSaint's Sloth Cave|url=http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html|accessdate=29 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121925/http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar usage in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan Language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} is to write ''okupa'' rather than ''ocupa'' (often on a building or area occupied by [[squatter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp |title=comunidades.calle22.com - TODOS SOMOS OKUPAS |accessdate=2004-10-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611121504/http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the name adopted by ''okupación'' activist groups), which is particularly remarkable because the letter "k" is not part of the Spanish, Portuguese or Italian alphabets. It stems from a combination of English borrow words with k in them to those languages, and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] movements which used "k" to signal rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodríguez González|first=Félix|year=2006|title=Medios de comunicación y contracultura juvenil|work=Círculo|volume=25:5–30|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/rodriguez.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacing "c" with "k" was at the centre of a [[Monty Python]] joke from the Travel Agent sketch. [[Eric Idle]] has an affliction that makes him pronounce the letter C as a B, as in "bolour" instead of "colour."  [[Michael Palin]] asks him if he can say the letter K?  Idle replies that he can, and Palin suggests that he spell words with a K instead of C.  Idle replies, "what, spell bolour with a K?  Kolour.  Oh!  I never thought of that before!  What a silly [[Cunt#Comedy|bunt]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript|url=http://web.mit.edu/humor/Special/Monty.Python/travel.agency|work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Index of Humor|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game franchise [[Mortal Kombat]] is another example of this trend.

===''KKK'' replacing ''c'' or ''k''===
A common satiric usage of the letters ''KKK'' is the spelling of ''America'' as ''Amerikkka'', alluding to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], drawing to a perceived notion of an underlying or inherent [[Racism in the United States|racism]] in American society. The earliest known usage of ''Amerikkka'' recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in 1970, in a journal called ''Black World''. Presumably, this was an extrapolation from the then already widespread ''Amerika''.{{Clarify|date=December 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The spelling ''Amerikkka'' came into greater use after the 1990 release of the [[gangsta rap]] album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' by [[Ice Cube]], also used by rapper [[Spice 1]] for his album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Nightmare]]'' and by [[shock rock]] band [[Undercover Slut]] for their album ''Amerikkka Macht Frei''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The letters ''KKK'' have been inserted into several other words and names, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include:

== @ replacing A, at or O&lt;span id="@replacing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- linked from "At sign" --&gt;==
Since at least 1980, people have used the "at sign" ("[[@]]") as a representation of the [[Anarchy a|circled letter A]]. This has been extended to substituting it for the letter "A" as in the [[Crass]] [[fanzine]] ''Toxic Gr@fity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206073619/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|title=Crass Discography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish, it became informally common (but not accepted by the [[Real Academia Espanola|RAE]], due to @ being a symbol and not a letter) to use @ in place of "o/a" to denote both genders.  For example, "señorit@" can be used to mean "señorita and/or señorito" instead of using "señorita/o."

==Word-in-word==
Occasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples:
* After the controversial [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential elections]], the alleged improprieties of the election prompted the use of such titles as "pResident" and "(p)resident"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060530225708/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2006 |title=Name the President! |date=March 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013030443/http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[George W. Bush]]. The same effects were also used for [[Bill Clinton]] during and after Clinton's impeachment hearings. These devices were intended to suggest that the president was merely the ''resident'' of the [[White House]] rather than the legitimate leader.
* Similarly, the controversial [[United States]] law, the ''[[USA PATRIOT Act]]'', is sometimes called the "patRiot Act", "(pat)Riot Act", "PAT Riot Act", "PAT RIOT Act", or "You Sap At Riot Act"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/pat-riot-act.html |title=PAT RIOT Act - Richard Stallman |publisher=Stallman.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=115660&amp;cid=9794643 |title=Slashdot Comments &amp;#124; British Columbia Acts Against Patriot Act |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=July 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by its opponents.

Along the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities.

Some [[toponyms|place names]] are also spelled differently in order to emphasize some political view. For instance, ''Brasil'' (the Portuguese spelling of "Brazil"), is sometimes misconstrued as a typo for ''Brazil'' in English texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190200/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the English spelling ''Brazil'' is used in Portuguese pieces of text as a way to denote [[anti-Americanism]] or [[Anti-globalization|anti-globalization sentiment]].

Journalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections.

===Backronyms===
{{Main|Backronym}}
Plays on [[acronym]]s and [[initialism]]s are also common, when the full name is spelled out but one of the component words is replaced by another. For example, [[Richard Stallman]] and other [[Free Software Foundation]] executives often refer to [[digital rights management]]  as "digital '''restrictions''' management",&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital rights management#Opposition to DRM]]&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the tendency for DRM to stifle the end user's ability to reshare music or write CDs more than a certain number of times.

[[File:Terragen render.jpg|thumb|300px|A landscape created in [[Terragen]]]]

A '''scenery generator''' refers to [[software]] used to create [[landscape]] images, [[3D model|3D models]], and [[Animation|animations]]. These programs often use [[procedural generation]] to generate the landscapes. If not using procedural generation to create the landscapes, then normally a 3D artist would render and create the landscapes. These programs are often used in video games or movies. Basic elements of landscapes created by scenery generators include terrain, water, foliage, and clouds. The process for basic random generation uses a [[Diamond-square algorithm|diamond square algorithm]].

== Common features ==
Most scenery generators can create basic heightmaps to simulate the variation of elevation in basic terrain. Common techniques include Simplex noise, fractals, or the Diamond-Square Algorithm, which can generate 2-dimensional heightmaps. A version of scenery generator can be very simplistic. Using a Diamond-Square Algorithm with some extra steps involving fractals an algorithm for random generation of terrain can be made with only 120 lines of code. The program in example takes a grid and then divides the grid repeatedly. Each smaller grid is then split into squares and diamonds and the algorithm then makes the randomized terrain for each square and diamond. Most programs for creating the landscape can also allow for adjustment and editing of the landscape. For example World Creator allows for terrain sculpting which uses a similar “brush” system as Photoshop(Link?).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-and-the-future-of-3d-procedural-content-generation-a2132487d44a|title=Neural Networks and The Future of 3D Procedural Content Generation|last=Snider-Held|first=Sam|date=2017-07-26|website=Towards Data Science|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tools the World Creator program can use are terrain stamping which you can import height-maps and uses them as a base. The programs tend to also allow for additional placement of rocks, trees, Etc. These can be done procedurally or by hand depending on the program. Typically the models used for the placement objects are the same as to lessen the amount of work that would be done if the user was to create a multitude of different trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-creator.com/features/#AnythingElse|title=World Creator - A Procedural Terrain and Landscape Generator|website=www.world-creator.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain generated the compute does a generation of multifractals then integrates them until finally rendering them onto the screen. These techniques are typically done “on-the-fly” which typically for a 128x128 resolution terrain would mean 1.5 seconds on a CPU from the early 90’s. If the user would want to zoom in on the terrain the algorithm the process would look like.&lt;ref&gt;“Dynamic Terrain Generation Based on Multifractal Techniques” TNO Physics and Electronic Laboratory. Retrieved October 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Scenery generators are commonly used in movies, animations and video games. For example, Industrial Light &amp; Magic used E-on Vue to create the fictional environments for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-onsoftware.com/about/?page=PRIndex&amp;date=August%201,%202006 "Vue Helps Industrial Light &amp; Magic Create Environments for "Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" VFX" (Press release).]&lt;/ref&gt; In such live-action cases, a 3D model of the generated environment is rendered and blended with live-action footage. Scenery generated by the software may also be used to create completely computer-generated scenes. In the case of animated movies such as Kung-Fu Panda, the raw generation is assisted by hand-painting to accentuate subtle details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-onsoftware.com/about/?page=PRIndex&amp;date=August%2013,%202008 "Vue "Summer 2008 Blockbuster" Roundup" (Press release).]&lt;/ref&gt; Environment elements not commonly associated with landscapes, such as or ocean waves have also been handled by the software.

Scenery Generation is used in most 3D based video-games. These typically use either custom or purchased engines that contain their own scenery generators. For some games they tend to use a procedurally generated terrain.  These typically use a form of height mapping and use of Perlin noise(link?). This will create a grid that with one point in a 2D coordinate will create the same heightmap as it is pseudo-random, meaning it will result in the same output with the same input. This can then easily be translated into the product 3D image.  These can then be changed from the editor tools in most engines if the terrain will be custom built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@miguelceledon/exploring-the-game-development-world-procedural-terrain-generation-theory-849d6e54f3a1|title=Exploring the game development world: Procedural terrain generation — Theory|last=Celedon|first=Miguel|date=2017-06-30|website=Medium|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With recent developments neural networks can be built to create or texture the terrain based off previously suggested artwork or heightmap data. These would be generated using algorithms that have been able to identify images and similarities between them. With the info the machine can take other heightmaps and render a very similar looking image to the style image. This can be used to create similar images in example a Studio Ghibli or Van Gogh art-style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-and-the-future-of-3d-procedural-content-generation-a2132487d44a|title=Neural Networks and The Future of 3D Procedural Content Generation|last=Snider-Held|first=Sam|date=2017-07-26|website=Towards Data Science|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
There is a large variety and amount of software that will generate scenery and allow for editing of it. These can include:  

Game engines with terrain generation:

Most game engines whether custom or proprietary will have terrain generation built in

               See: [[List of game engines|List of Video Game Engines]]

Terrain generator programs:

*        [[Terragen]] – can create terrain, water, atmosphere, and lighting in this free windows program

*        L3DT – similar functions to the Terragen program, has a 2048x2048 limit

[[Sexuality]] in [[music video]]s has been evident since the 1980s.  The extent in which stereotypes align with gender portrayal varies each decade.  Music video content has remained culturally relevant and subliminally influential on adolescent character development.  In addition, the intersectionality between race and gender is evident throughout music video history.  By analyzing the correlation between music video material and gender representation, conclusions can be drawn pertaining to how music television impacts young adults' perception of their appropriate societal behavior.

==1980s==
On August 1, 1981, the first 24-hour music video channel aired.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidman | first1 = S. A. | year = 1992 | title = Profile: An investigation of sex‐role stereotyping in music videos | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 209–216 | doi=10.1080/08838159209364168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed towards adolescents, [[MTV]] promoted societal trends through video content and advertisements. The material displayed helped the audience identify appropriate male and female roles, behaviors, and careers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the 1980s, typical feminine stereotypes included: submissive, performed household duties, emotional.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Vincent, R. C., Davis, D. K., &amp; Boruszkowski, L. A. (1987). Sexism on MTV: The portrayal of women in rock videos. Journalism Quarterly, 64(4), 750-941.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrastingly, common male clichés were as follows: dominant, professional occupations, aggressive.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Young adults mainly watched MTV because it was different from other programs, they were intrigued by the unification of visuals and music, and used it as "leisure time entertainment".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = S. W. | last2 = Lull | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = The adolescent audience for music videos and why they watch | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 115–125 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1986.tb03043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling Stones]], [[AC/DC]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Guns N' Roses]] were leading significant figures, displayed on MTV.  Music Television had a commanding influence on its audience and heavily effected the ways adolescents viewed their societal role.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Music videos, released in the 1980s, typically depicted women as alluring objects.  Aligning with typical stereotypes, women were portrayed as attractive, yet submissive.  Although women's talents may be acknowledged, their skill never surpassed the male's—this concept is evident in AC/DC's video for "[[Sink the Pink]]".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  In the Rock n' Roll video, one of the main characters is a self-assured woman, who is a skillful pool player; the woman utilizes her talent and sexuality as an attention getter, but is not shown as more talented than the male characters.

In a study, conducted in 1987, thirty hours of MTV content was analyzed.  The research performed helped draw further conclusions, regarding sexuality in 1980s music videos.  The results suggested: 57% of music videos displayed women being objectified, 17% showed women's talents being accounted for, yet her sexual role was highlighted, 14% did not align with typical stereotypes, 12% acknowledged women's independence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In addition to these results, touching was displayed in over 50% of music videos and females were frequently seen in seductive clothing.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==1990s==
Music remained an essential part of the cultural evolution of the 1990s. The music scene transitioned into the darker and more provocative sounds of the genres of [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip-hop]], and [[R&amp;B]]. Popular music videos of the time came from artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Weezer]], and [[RadioHead]]. While the acclaimed artists and genres of the times differed form the previous decade, the visual depictions of this music and how they were delivered to the public remained the same. MTV remained socially relevant in constructing images to correlate to music, helping propel youth culture into the atmosphere of visual experiences. As music videos grew in popularity and cultural prominence, researchers became continually fascinated by the link between gender identities and mass media platforms. Several studies have been conducted regarding gender portrayals in music videos of the 1990s.

In early 1990, MTV created a Program Standards Department which aimed to reject music videos featuring extremely graphic and explicit content. The program sought to prohibit any signs of female nudity and violence directed toward female figures. For example, MTV rejected [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] "[[Justify My Love#Music video|Justify my Love]]" video due to its explicit content. After this program was implemented, a study was conducted to analyze the centrality and depiction of women in the most 100 popular videos of the decade. The study first sorted men and women in the categories of either leading or supporting figures in the videos, discovering that men outnumbered women in lead roles by an astronomical 5 to 1 margin.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Gow, J. (1996). Reconsidering gender roles on MTV: Depictions in the most popular music videos of the early 1990s. Communication reports, 9(2), 151-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the study categorized the lead roles into seven main portrayals (artist, poser, comic, actress, superhuman, dancer, or crowd pleaser). The analysis found that a majority of women in lead roles were portrayed as either posers (35%) or dancers (29%) while men in lead roles were more equally disbursed amongst the seven categories.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Portraying women predominately as dancers or posers implied that, in the 90s, women needed not to display musical talent, but instead physical talent that emphasized a sexual attitude. Meanwhile, the equal disbursement of men amongst the categories suggested that men could better exhibit skills of musical and performing prowess.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Other studies analyzed 123 music videos from varying genres that aired in the summer of 1995. 44.7% of the videos failed to feature a female in a central role, while 31.7% of the videos portrayed women as conventional, meaning that they served as either objects or sensory props to romantic male desire.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, S. (1999). The gender role paradox in youth culture: An analysis of women in music videos. Michigan Sociological Review, 46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the overt sexual nature of women in these videos was not the only thing analyzed. Gender displays in the form of nonverbal sexual cues were also considered, proving that women could also be depicted more subliminally sexual than men. For example, in the videos only 1.24% of men touched their hair compared to 38.35% of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Performing gender: A content analysis of gender display in music videos | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 64 | issue = 3–4| pages = 160–172 | doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9814-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, only .74% of males danced suggestively in their videos compared to 26.80% of females. The study examines the distinction between the prominence and depiction of male and female gender portrayals within the music videos of the 1990s.

==2000s==
[[File:Womanizer Miami.jpg|thumb|Singer [[Britney Spears]] performs in [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|The Circus tour]] in Miami, 2009]]

Music remained integral to cultural life in the 2000s, while not many new genres were created during this time other than a few indie-related and electronic genres. Teen Pop carried a heavy influence over from the 90s into the first part of the decade. Artists such as Britney spears Christina Aguilera, NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. By the mid 2000s Contemporary R&amp;B had become the most popular genre with artists such as Usher at the forefront.

A study conducted by Jacob Turner in 2008, hypothesized that African American genres of music (hip-hop, rhythm, and blues) would feature the most sexual content in their music videos while White genres (Country and Rock) would feature less. The study found that 73% of all music videos had some sort of sexual content. Further, the study found that 90.09% of mixed Hip-Hop and R&amp;B music videos contained sexual content. Followed by Hip-Hop with 79.7%, R&amp;B with 76.9%. The genres that contained the least amount of sexual content on their music videos were rock with 40.0% and Country with 37.0%. The study also looked into how African American and White wallpaper characters were dressed in music videos. It found that African American wallpaper characters were three times more likely to dress provocatively than White wallpaper characters.The study also found that while African Americans were not underrepresented in music videos. However, the study proposes that this is because videos featuring African Americans featured significantly more sexual content than videos that featured Whites.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Jacob.

==2010s==
Into the 2010s, artists have continued to garner headlines for provocative content in music videos. For example, [[Rihanna|Rihanna's]] music video for the song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]", in which she simulates sex with a life-sized doll and wears [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] gear, generated much media attention and was banned in 11 countries. [[YouTube]] required its users to verify they were 18 years of age before being able to view the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1657144/rihanna-s-m-video-banned/|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Video Restricted By YouTube, Banned In 11 Countries|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the video, [[Melina Matsoukas]], responded to the controversy by saying she felt the video was a success because the provocative imagery creating a dialogue around the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1657250/rihannas-sm-video-director-responds-to-controversy/|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Video Director Responds To Controversy|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Ariana Grande's "[[Everyday (Ariana Grande song)|Everyday]]" video depicts several couples beginning to have sex in various public places, such as on the bus, was praised for its [[sex positivity]] and inclusion of different races and sexual orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/211571_ariana_grande_super_racy_everyday_video_will_totally_make_you_blush|title=Ariana Grande's Super Racy 'Everyday' Video Will Totally Make You Blush|work=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has looked into the effects that music videos that sexually objectify women have on women's body image perceptions. A study of college students found that young women were more likely to view their body in a negative light after exposure to a sexually-objectifying music video, particularly in women with low self-esteem. The same study found that exposure to sexually objectifying music videos lessened the extremity of young women's conception of an [[ideal body weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mischner|first=Isabelle|date=January 2013|title=Thinking Big: The Effect of Sexually Objectifying Music Videos  on Bodily Self-Perception in Young Women|url=|journal=Body Image|volume=10|pages=26–34|via=|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found a relationship between sexual content in dance music videos and negative attitudes toward sex and sexuality among young adults in the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright , Rubin |first=Chrysalis , Mark |date=2017|title="Get lucky! Sexual content in music lyrics, videos, and social media and sexual cognitions and risk among emerging adults in the USA and Australia"|url=|journal=Sex Education|volume=17|pages=41–56|via=|doi=10.1080/14681811.2016.1242402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have noted that sexualized content in music videos rarely depicts non-heterosexuality. Frederik Dhaenens has pointed out that when music videos to feature gay content, it is oftentimes involves a "heteronormative shaping of gay and lesbian identities", citing [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]' "[[Same Love]]" as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhaenens|first=Frederik|date=2016|title=Reading Gay Music Videos: An Inquiry Into the Representation of Sexual Diversity in Contemporary Popular Music Videos|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03007766.2015.1068530|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=39|pages=532–546|via=|doi=10.1080/03007766.2015.1068530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of race==
Studies have shown that music videos featuring African American characters tend to feature significantly more depictions of sexual acts than videos featuring white characters.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robillard|first=Alyssa|date=2012|title=Music Videos and Sexual Risk in African American Adolescent Girls|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224|journal=American Journal of Health Education|volume=43|pages=93–103|via=|doi=10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, African American women are the most likely group of people to be depicted as engaging in sexual behaviors and wearing provocative clothing. A study in the American Journal of Health Education attributed music videos' "frank sexual messages, objectification, and overtly sexual images" to an apathy toward these behaviors in African American girls, which the journal considered dangerous in light of the heightened HIV risk for African Americans.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; It has been suggested by scholar Jacob Turner that white-run corporations like [[Viacom]] (which owns MTV) are more willingly to pay for music videos from African American artists that perpetuate racial and sexual stereotypes as an explanation for why African Americans videos are disproportionately sexualized compared to white videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jacob|date=2011|title=Sex and the Spectacle of Music Videos: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=ef2d260b-1308-4780-8e09-2b5d3a5a7abd%40sessionmgr4008|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|pages=173–191|via=|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9766-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian artists, such as [[BoA]], have been accused of presenting Western stereotypes of Asian female sexuality in their music videos as an attempt to gain popularity in the United States. [[Japan]]'s [[Koda Kumi]] and [[AKB48]] also presents sexuality in their music videos. Male [[K-pop]] star [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain's]] music video for his song "[[Rainism]]" has been credited with helping to refute [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|stereotypes of Asian men as effeminate and weak]] depicting an Asian man in various sexual situations, primarily with white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Eun-Young|date=2010|title=Playing the Race and Sexuality Cards in the Transnational Pop Game: Korean Music Videos for the USA Market|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=75ed386c-7ceb-4035-884c-0b80240c7d53%40sessionmgr4007|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=22|pages=219–236|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2010.01237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12179">'''Sound studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that to date has focused largely on the emergence of the concept of "sound" in Western modernity, with an emphasis on the development of sound reproduction technologies. The field first emerged in venues like the journal ''Social Studies of Science'' by scholars working in [[science and technology studies]] and [[communication studies]]; it has however greatly expanded and now includes a broad array of scholars working in music, anthropology, [[sound art]], [[deaf studies]], [[architecture]], and many other fields besides. Important studies have focused on the idea of a "soundscape", architectural acoustics, nature sounds, the history of aurality in [[Western philosophy]] and nineteenth-century Colombia, Islamic approaches to listening, the voice, studies of deafness, loudness, and related topics. A foundational text is Jonathan Sterne's 2003 book "The Audible Past", though the field has retroactively taken as foundational two texts from 1977, [[Jacques Attali]]'s "Noise" and [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s "The Soundscape".

Initial work in the field was criticized for focusing mainly on white male inventors in Euro-America. Consequently the field is currently in a period of expansion, with important texts coming out in recent years on sound, listening, and hearing as they relate to blackness, gender, and [[colonialism]].

==Hearing and listening==

Two significant categories to what we hear and pay attention to are natural and technological sounds. According to R. Murray Schaeffer (through a survey of quotes in the literature), the proportion of nature sounds heard and noticed among European authors has decreased over the past two centuries from 43% to 20%, but not for North America, where it has stayed around 50%. Additionally, the proportion of technological sounds mentioned in literature has stayed around 35% for Europe, but decreased in North America. While technological increases have not been sonically noticed, the decrease in silence has been noticed, from 19% to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the idea of listening, objects can be considered auditorily as compared to visually. The objects that are able to be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a [[venn diagram]], with mute and visible objects in the vision category, with aural and invisible objects in the sound category, and aural and visible objects in the overlapping category. Objects that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight. The common denominator for aural objects is movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ihde|first1=Don|title=Listening and Voice: A Phenomenology of Sound|date=1974|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=Athens|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three modes of listening have been recognized; causal listening, semantic listening, and reduced listening. Causal listening, the most common, consists of listening in order to gather ideas about its source. Sound in this case is informational and can be used to recognize voices, determine distance, or understand differences between humans and machines. Semantic listening is when a sound is not only heard but also processed. When a sound is given meaning and context, as seen in speech and fluent dialogue. Reduced listening focuses on the traits of the sound itself regardless of cause and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chion|first1=Michel|title=Audio Vision: Sound on Screen|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=48–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spaces, sites and scapes==

Sound is heard through space. But this defining of sound and space is further nuanced by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has become a source of interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer's concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe "a total appreciation of the sonic environment," and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand "the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=8, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real.

Schaffer's concept of the soundscape has become a hallmark of sound studies and is referenced, built upon, and criticized by writers from a wide breadth of disciplines and perspectives. Common themes explored through the analysis of the soundscape are the conflict between nature and industry, the impact of technology on sound production and consumption, the issue of cultural sound values and the evolution of acoustics, and the power dynamics of silence and noise.

==Transduce and record==

Our perception of a recorded sound's authenticity has been greatly impacted by the commercial influence of capitalism. Even the dead now profit from recordings they've made, making music more timeless than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanyek|first1=Jason|last2=Piekut|first2=Benjamin|title=Deadness: Technologies of the Intermundane|date=2010|pages=14–21 &amp; 27–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing the past into the present generates a sense of familiarity which compels the public to engage in new forms of listening.

In a Memorex commercial involving Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Mangione, Fitzgerald is unable to discern the difference between a live performance and a recording of Mangione playing the trumpet. This presents a scene to viewers which sells cassette tapes as ideal objects of high-fidelity, auditory preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowitt|first1=John|title=The Sound of Music in the Era of its Electronic Reproducibility|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=184–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was once an autonomic experience of memory which integrated visual and auditory stimuli (live music) has become a consumable item which popularizes and commodifies sonic memory explicitly.

Part of this shift in the dynamics of recorded sound has to do with a desire for noise reduction. This desire is representative of a mode of recording referred to by scholar James Lastra as "telephonic:" a mode in which sound is regarded as having hierarchically important qualities, with clarity and intelligibility being the most important aspects. This contrasts with phonographic recording, which generates a "point of audition" from which a sense of space can be derived, sacrificing quality for uniqueness and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lastra|first1=James|title=Sound Theory. "Fidelity Versus Intelligibility"|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=138–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is often used in movies to demonstrate how a character hears something (such as muffled voices through a closed door). Through various forms of media, recorded music affects our perceptions and consumptive practices more often than we realize.

The '''Sydney APEC Leaders' Declaration on Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development''' was adopted at [[APEC Australia 2007]] on 8 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/apec/sydney-declaration-on-climate-change-and-energy/2007/09/09/1189276526002.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 Sydney Declaration on Climate Change and Energy]'', Sydney Morning Herald, 9 September 2007. See also ''[http://www.smh.com.au/pdf/leadersstatement.pdf Leaders Statement (PDF)]'' Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement indicates the wish of signatories to work towards aspirational goals on energy efficiency per unit of [[GDP]] while encouraging [[forest cover]] in the region. The APEC wide regional aspirational goal is to reduce energy intensity by at least 25 percent by 2030 from the 2005 level, and set an APEC-wide regional goal of increasing forest cover in the region by 200,000 square kilometres by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/apec-climate-agreement-a-diplomatic-breakthrough/2007/09/09/1189276521977.html APEC climate agreement a 'diplomatic breakthrough]'', The Age, 9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Environmental and climate organisations such as [[Greenpeace]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Climate Action Network]] criticised the agreement for not setting binding targets on [[greenhouse gas emissions]] for developed countries, and that the statement was little more than a political stunt.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/09/2027701.htm Govt, green groups face off over Sydney Declaration]'' ABC News,  9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace media release, ''[http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/news-and-events/media/releases/climate-change/apec-declaration-a-sydney-dist APEC declaration a Sydney distraction from action on climate change]'', Greenpeace website, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] pointed out that Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] told an APEC lecture in Melbourne in April 2007 that aspirational targets are a "political stunt" and "not a real target at all".&lt;ref&gt;Liz Micnchin, ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/q-when-is-a-stunt-not-a-stunt-a-when-the-boss-likes-the-idea/2007/09/06/1188783413265.html Q: When is a stunt not a stunt? A: When the boss likes the idea]'', The Age, 7 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One Greenpeace spokesperson said the declaration should be named the "'''Sydney Distraction'''" on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gartrell, ''[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22384889-5005961,00.html Greenpeace slams APEC climate pact]'', Herald Sun, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] called the declaration "very weak" and said the "declaration does not advance global discussions on climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation Meadia Release, ''[http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=1408 APEC’s Sydney Declaration is weak on climate ]'' Australian Conservation Foundation website, 8 September 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8222">'''The Kildonan School''' is a private coeducational boarding and day school in [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia, New York]] offering daily one-to-one [[Orton-Gillingham]]  language remediation and a college preparatory curriculum for students in grades 2-12 and PG (post-graduate). The Kildonan School is exclusively for students with [[dyslexia]] and [[language-based learning disability|language-based learning disabilities]].

== History ==

The Kildonan School was founded in 1969 by Diana Hanbury King and Kurt Goldman. The college preparatory program, currently with a 100% college acceptance rate,{{Cn|date=November 2014}} evolved from Dunnabeck, the one-to-one Orton-Gillingham based language remediation summer camp also founded by Diana King, which still takes place on the school’s campus every summer.

Ms. King taught for years at [[Sidwell Friends School]] in Washington, D.C. and at Camp Mansfield in Vermont, the latter of which was founded by Helene Durbrow,  who studied directly under [[Samuel Orton|Dr. Samuel Orton]].    Ms. King has written numerous books on the Orton-Gillingham approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Diana|title=English Isn't Crazy!: The Elements of Our Language and How to Teach Them|year=2000|publisher=York|location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Diana|title=Writing Skills|year=1985|publisher=Educators Publisher Service |location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and she lectures across the country and trains teachers in Orton Gillingham methodology in the US, in Bermuda, and in Asia.

== The Orton-Gillingham approach ==

The Orton-Gillingham approach is a structured, flexible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Betty|title=The Structured Flexibility of Orton-Gillingham|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=1991|volume=41|issue=4|pages=41–54|doi=10.1007/bf02648077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  multisensory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oakland|first=T |author2=J.L. Black |author3=G. STanford |author4=N.L. Nussbaum |author5=R.R. Balise|title=An Evaluation of the Dyslexia Training Program: A Multisensory Method for Promoting Reading in Students with Reading Disabilities.|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|year=1998|volume=32|issue=2|pages=140–147 |doi=10.1177/002221949803100204}}&lt;/ref&gt;   way of teaching reading and writing. When implemented at integral times and in appropriate ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritchey|first=K.D.|author2=J.L. Goeke |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature|journal=The Journal of Special Education|year=2006|volume=40|issue=3|pages=171–83|doi=10.1177/00224669060400030501}}&lt;/ref&gt;   it has been shown to remediate dyslexia to the point of “normal” counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warrick|first=Nicola|author2=Hyla Rubin |author3=Sheila Rowe-Walsh |title=Phoneme Awareness in Language-delayed Children: Comparative Studies and Intervention|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=1993|volume=43|issue=1|pages=153–73|doi=10.1007/bf02928179}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It remediates dyslexia by attending to the neural language-processing system of individuals with high IQs with a seemingly inexplicable deficit in reading or spelling, and departs from older methodologies that focused on the visual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaywitz|first=Sally|title=Dyslexia|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/Dyslexia_articleintro.html|newspaper=Scientific American|date=Nov 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

The Kildonan School was accredited in 2003 by the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators  and re-accredited by [[NYSAIS]] (the New York State Association of Independent Schools)  in 2013. The Kildonan School currently has two AOGPE Fellows on staff who mentor each tutor the school employs through 70 hours of pre-tutoring training and the AOGPE associate/certification process.

== Complementary programs ==

Dyslexic students learn language differently from other students – specifically, it has been posited that dyslexics compensate for lack of activity while reading in the angular gyrus (responsible for signifiers in language and residing in the back of the brain) with lots of activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (responsible for speech and residing in the front of the brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ariniello|first=Leah|title=Dyslexia and Language Brain Areas|journal=Brain Briefings - Society for Neuroscience|year=1999|url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/selflearn/Dyslexia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows, therefore, that dyslexic students tend to also have trouble with balance and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fawcett|first=Angela|title=Automatisation Deficits In Balance For Dyslexic Children|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1992|volume=75|issue=5|pages=507–529|doi=10.2466/pms.1992.75.2.507}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In keeping with brain research that shows that language remediation relies on stimulating connections between brain networks, and specifically between the two hemispheres of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tramontana|first=Michael|author2=Stephen R. Hooper |title=Hemispheric Stimulation Techniques in Children with Dyslexia|journal=Advances in Child Neuropsychology|year=1995|volume=3|series=Springer|pages=144–77|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4178-2_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dryer|first=R. |author2=I.L. Beale |author3=A.J. Lambert|title=The Balance Model of Dyslexia and Remedial Training: An Evaluative Study|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|year=1999|volume=32|issue=2|pages=174–86|doi=10.1177/002221949903200207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kildonan School requires all lower school students to train in horseback riding and all upper school students to learn to ski. These two sports are balance sports, and so require students to make neural connections between both hemispheres of the brain.

== Mission and philosophy ==

Kildonan’s mission of empowering students with dyslexia is in keeping with research by Brock and Fernette Eide and Ben Foss, which shows that a way to open up future opportunities for dyslexics is to play on their strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Venton|first=Danielle|title=Q&amp;A: The Unappreciated Benefits of Dyslexia|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/09/dyslexic-advantage/|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakker|first=Merel|title=Dyslexia: Our Children Deserve an Honest Chance!|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/merel-bakker/dyslexia-our-children-des_b_4106886.html?ir=Parents|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belzberg|first=Lisa|title=Can Dyslexics Succeed at School or Only in Life?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-belzberg/can-dyslexics-succeed-at-_b_2718579.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To this end, Kildonan encourages its staff to include ''The Dyslexic Advantage'' and ''The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan'' in their professional development plans.

'''Yde Girl''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ɪ|d|ə|audio=Yde IPA.ogg}}) is a [[bog body]] found in the ''Stijfveen'' [[peat]] bog near the village of [[Yde]], [[Netherlands]]. She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well-preserved when discovered (especially her [[hair]]), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities a [[fortnight]] later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated.&lt;ref name=deem&gt;{{cite web|last=Deem|first=James M.|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|title=Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands: The Yde Girl|accessdate=16 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152742/http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt; The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

==Examination==
[[Image:DrentseBody.jpg|thumb|left|The Yde Girl's body]]

[[Carbon-14]] tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of [[Windeby I]], however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from [[scoliosis]]. She stood at {{convert|137|cm|ftin}}, which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

The body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as [[sprang]], wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper|title=BEST MUSEUM EXHIBIT: THE MYSTERIOUS BOG PEOPLE|date=7 December 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dan&gt;{{cite news|last=Nephin|first=Dan|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=AP Online|title=Mummy Exhibit Shows Off Interactive Side|date=6 July 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the [[Kayhausen Boy]], who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the [[tannic acid]] in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.

The Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. [[Richard Neave]], of University of Manchester, took a [[CT scan]] of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohd Isa|first=Marisa|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82747279.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=News Straits Times|title=Unveiling mummy secrets|date=6 January 2006}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from [[plastic surgery]] and criminal [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Prag | first1 = John | last2 = Neave | first2 = Richard | title = Making faces: using forensic and archaeological evidence |trans-title=Bodies from the Bog | year = 1997 | publisher = British Museum | location = London | language = | isbn = 0-7141-1743-9 | pages = 157–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]].

Yde Girl, along with [[Roter Franz]] and the [[Weerdinge Men]], were transported across the world for a museum tour in both the early and mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Sue Ellen|title=Visit the mummies before they leave for L.A.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-71012131.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Sunday Gazette-Mail|date=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt; Due to the intensity of the girl's death, protests in [[Canada]] prevented the tour from traveling through several locations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CULTURE-CANADA: 'BOG PEOPLE' MUMMIES PROVOKE PROTESTS|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Inter Press Service English News Wire|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2003/01/arts-weekly-culture-canada-bog-people-display-provokes-protest/|first=Mark|last=Bourrie|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible''''' is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] to the [[Bible]] compiled by [[Robert Young (biblical scholar)|Robert Young]] first published in 1879.

==Contents==
* ''Hints and Helps to Bible Interpretation'' (only in some later editions)
* ''Analytical Concordance'' - Each entry can contain the multiple original language words in the original language and in a phonetic vocalization into English. It also gives the extended meaning and usage of the word in the original language. This is a "[[Bible concordance]]" to the [[King James Version|King James Version (KJV)]] and not a [[lexicon]] of the [[Biblical Hebrew|OT Hebrew]] or [[Koine|NT Greek]] languages.
* ''Index lexicons to the Old and New Testaments, being a guide to parallel passages'' prepared by Wm. B. Stevenson.
* The British eighth edition also includes ''A complete list of Scripture Proper Names as in the Authorised and Revised Versions, showing their modern pronunciation and the exact form of the original Hebrew'' by the same author. This appendix also has an informative introduction.

==Editions==
British editions and American editions are numbered differently.

===British editions===
These have the title ''Analytical Concordance to the Holy Bible''.
* First published 1879, followed by editions 2&amp;ndash;6.
* Seventh edition published 1900, revised throughout by the Glasgow [[Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages]], [[William Barron Stevenson]] (1869-1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1426&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of William Barron Stevenson|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:This was reprinted 1904, 1905, 1906, 1909, 1912. 
:1913 was the first to be published by the [[Religious Tract Society]];&lt;ref&gt;Known from 1931 as the United Society for Christian Literature, [[Lutterworth Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Reprinted 1919, 1922, 1924, 1927, 1933, 1935.
* Eighth edition published 1938, revised further by J. H. Young with advice from Stevenson.
:This was reprinted 1939, 1943, 1946, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961, ..., 1971, 1973, 1977, ...

===American editions===
:''This section is incomplete''.
These have the title ''Analytical Concordance to the Bible''.

The 20th American edition, first published in 1910, corresponds largely to the British 7th edition revised by W. B. Stevenson, but to which was added a further supplement, entitled ''A sketch of recent exploration in Bible lands'' by Thomas Nicol. This was originally published separately some time before its second edition which appeared in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Recent-Explorations-Bible-Lands-Thomas/dp/B002IBADT2/|title=Recent Explorations in Bible Lands / by Thomas Nicol|last=Nicol|first=Thomas|date=1893|publisher=Edinburgh : George Adam Young|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later editions include a supplement entitled ''The Canon of Scripture'' by [[R. K. Harrison]] and Everett F. Harrison.
