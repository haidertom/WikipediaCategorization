The traditional '''Albanian poetry''' includes folk [[Albanians|Albanian]] poetry and songs that are part of [[Albanian culture]].

== History ==
In 1830 [[Vuk Karadžić]] recorded from Dovica Obadović from Đurakovac near [[Peć]] 12 Albanian songs and one [[riddle]].&lt;ref name="Hercegovine1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Akademija nauka i umjetnosti Bosne i Hercegovine|title=Posebna izdanja|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRMXAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 February 2013|year=1987|page=174|quote=filolosku studiju o jeziku albanskih narodnih piisama iz okoline Peci koje je Vuk Karadzic zapisao 1830. godine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vuković1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vladeta Vuković|title=Život i delo Vuka Karadžića|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_EGAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 February 2013|year=1988|publisher=Akademija nauka i umetnosti Kosova, Odeljenje jezičkih i književnih nauka i umetnosti|page=103|quote=Вук ]е, у два маха, 1830. године, сакупио 12 албанских на- родних песама (или фрагмената песама)'и 1 загонетку}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dobrašinović |first=Golub |script-title=sr:Сабрана дела Вука Караџића. 18, О Црној Гори.

During the [[Albanian Renaissance]] (''Rilindja'') the oral literature, a rich cultural asset, was used in forming the country's identity.{{sfn|Cornis-Pope|Neubauer|2007|p=336}} The first collection of Albanian oral literature was that of Austrian consul, and "father of Albanian studies" [[John Hahn]]'s ''Albanische Studien''.{{sfn|Cornis-Pope|Neubauer|2007|p=336}} One of the most notable Albanian epic poem is [[Lahuta e Malcís|The Highland Lute]] written by Albanian Catholic friar [[Gjergj Fishta]].

In the 1905–08 period [[Nikolla Ivanaj]] published the ''Shpnesa e Shqypnisë'', being one of the first publishers of the Albanian heroic folk songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiokosovaelire.com/archive.php?nav=4,1&amp;id=273|title=RAPSODËT E RUGOVËS DHE TEORIA E EPOSIT|last1=Neziri|first1=Zeqirja|last2=|first2=|publisher=Radio Kosova e lire|accessdate=4 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715144824/http://www.radiokosovaelire.com/archive.php?nav=4,1&amp;id=273|archive-date=15 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
[[Serbian language|Serbian words]] are common in the folk songs of northern Albania ([[Gheg Albanian]]), and are lacking in the south ([[Tosk Albanian]]), where Slavic words have taken an Albanianized form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Memoirs of the American Folk-lore Society|volume=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8m07AAAAIAAJ|year=1954|publisher=American Folk-lore Society|pages=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2017}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}

'''Ancient Greek funerary vases''' are decorative grave markers made in [[ancient Greece]] that were designed to resemble liquid-holding vessels. These decorated vases were placed on grave sites as a mark of elite status. There are many types of funerary vases, such as [[amphorae]], [[krater]]s, [[oinochoe]], and [[kylix]] cups, among others. One famous example is the [[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]]. Every-day vases were often not painted, but wealthy Greeks could afford luxuriously painted ones. Funerary vases on male graves might have themes of military prowess, or athletics. However, allusions to death in [[Greek tragedies]] was a popular motif. Famous centers of vase styles include [[Corinth]], [[Lakonia]], [[Ionia]], South Italy, and [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/classroom_resources/curricula/mythology/lesson01.html|title=A Story on a Vase (Education at the Getty)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major type of funerary vase was the krater, a mixing bowl for wine and water used by elite Greek males at [[symposium]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Symposiums were an eastern influence&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/greek-art-and-archaeology-a-new-history-c-2500-c-150-bce/oclc/1003354922&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Greek art and archaeology: a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=Neer|first=Richard T|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the aristocracy would lie down and drink; many Greek painters referenced this lifestyle in their art. The krater was so symbolic of elite status that large, richly decorated kraters would be placed upon grave sites. Although in the shape of drinking vessels, some funerary kraters were made just to be a grave marker, as indicated by a hole in the bottom of the vessel. This hole would allow libations to drain through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/Classics/exhibits/GreekVases/essays/200636tburial.htm|title=CU Classics {{!}} Greek Vase Exhibit {{!}} Essays {{!}} Burial Customs|website=www.colorado.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The display of highly decorated funeral vase markers, along with costly grave goods, and elaborate processions, helped to display the status of wealthy families. This act is called conspicuous consumption, and would let the whole community know who held power in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/greek-art-and-archaeology/oclc/795491925&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Greek art and archaeology|last=Pedley|first=John Griffiths|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780205001330|location=New York (N.Y.)|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types ==
The [[amphora]] was a tall, slender pot that often held oil, wine, milk, or grain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These could be as tall as an adult, and were both practical for transporting goods, and artistic in their funerary usage. Amphorae filled with oil were awarded to victorious athletes during [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic games]], with the winner painted on it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These might be placed on the grave of the athlete.  

The [[Lekythos]] was another style of funerary vase that usually held ritual oil. It had a slender body with a single handle. One famous artist of lekythoi was the [[Achilles Painter|Achiles painter]]. Funeral lekythoi were often painted in the [[white ground technique]].   

The [[kylix]] (kylikes, plural), popular at symposiums, was a stout drinking cup with a very wide bowl. A well known potter of kylikes was [[Exekias]]. After being formed separately on the potter's wheel, the bowl and stem would be left to dry. The cup would then be placed upside down to attach the handles. The handles would dry in this upside down position, giving the handles a unique upturned curve when the kylix was upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/techniques-of-painted-attic-pottery/oclc/1000752404&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The techniques of painted Attic pottery.|last=Noble|first=Joseph Veach|last2=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|first2=N.Y)|date=1965|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An oinochoe was a stout wine jug with a distinct pouring lip, and a large handle. The name comes from oinos (wine), and cheo (to pour).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0004:id=oinochoe|title=Perseus Encyclopedia, Oak, Oinochoe|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have relief sculpture under the bowl. There are two other variations of oinochoe that differ in size and style, called olpe and chous.[http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/oinochoe.htm]

The [[hydria]] was a water-containing vessel with three handles; two for carrying, and another for pouring. These could also be made out of bronze. A well preserved example is the [[Regina Vasorum]] from Southern Italy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/25.+Archaeological+Artifacts/289706/?lng=|title=Art works|website=www.hermitagemuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regina Vasorum has black lacquer with gilding. Demeter, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, and Dionysus can all be seen on this hydria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Geometric patterns adorn many vases between 900-700 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/archaeology-of-greece-an-introduction/oclc/33818589&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The archaeology of Greece: an introduction|last=Biers|first=William R|date=1996|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801431735|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns include meanders, right-angles, and [[swastikas]]. Most vases from this period were found in cemeteries, thus becoming our primary source of knowledge during the Geometric period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/looking-at-greek-vases/oclc/488747277&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Looking at Greek vases|last=Rasmussen|first=Tom|last2=Spivey|first2=Nigel Jonathan|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521376792|location=Cambridge [England]; New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 600's B.C., Athens moved away from abstract geometric patterns, and toward more natural art, influenced by the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/248578|title=Attributed to the New York Nessos Painter {{!}} Terracotta neck-amphora (storage jar) {{!}} Greek, Attic {{!}} Proto-Attic {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Images from vases can provide information about religion, beliefs, and how people lived, including burial rites. Burial customs included washing and dressing the body in ointments before wrapping the body in a [[shroud]] and outer cloth. The body would then be laid upon a [[bier]], or funeral bed, which gives form to the Greeks' association between sleep and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/Classics/exhibits/GreekVases/essays/200636tburial.htm|title=CU Classics {{!}} Greek Vase Exhibit {{!}} Essays {{!}} Burial Customs|website=www.colorado.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Thanatos]], the god of gentle death, can be seen on Greek funerary vases taking away the body of the deceased to the underworld. The act of laying out the body for mourners to see, called prothesis, is painted on the [[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]]. The next step was the ekphora; the moving of the body to a cemetery in a procession. If cremation was practiced, the ashes of the deceased would be placed inside the funeral vase, and buried.     [[File:Dipylon amphora close front (Prothesis).jpg|thumb|
[[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]], mid-700's B.C. detail of laying out the body (prothesis).
]]

== Social connections ==
Kylikes, used at symposiums, would often be painted with large eyes on them. When drinking from these [[Eye-cup|eye-cups]], they would act as a mask, like actors would wear in a play. These eyes would stare at the other guests, with the handles resembling ears. The Greek word for handle is "ous", meaning ear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The altered state of mind that comes from drinking alcohol is analogous to putting on the mask of someone else. This connection between wine, masks, and stories told at symposiums were all embodied in the god [[Dionysus]], the god of wine and theater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;     

== Tragedy on vases ==
[[File:Exekias Suicide d Ajax 01 glare reduced white bg.png|thumb|
Exekias's vase depicting the suicide of Ajax
]]
Greek tragedies were a popular motif on funeral vases which often contained the death of someone close to the main character within the play. An example of this is the [[suicide of Ajax vase]]. Greeks would see these pictures of Greek tragedies on vases, which would remind them of the suffering that heroes of old had to endure. They believed that If great heroes were able to survive life's sufferings, then so could they.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this way, they could view tragedy as something comforting, thus giving people the strength to persevere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/0892368071.html|title=Pots &amp; plays: interactions between tragedy and Greek vase-painting of the fourth century B.C.|last=Taplin|first=Oliver|date=2007|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through visual depictions of tragedies, the Greeks could relate to the deceased. Pots that depict funerary scenes were usually designed for tombs. However, vases with comical motifs have also been found in graves.

'''''Around the Piano''''' (French: ''Autour du piano'') is an 1885 painting by French artist [[Henri Fantin-Latour]]. It was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] the same year, then was bought by Adolphe Jullien. In 1915, it was given to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]], then was at the [[Musée du Louvre]] until 1986. It is currently kept at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Henri Fantin-Latour, ''Autour du piano'', en 1885 — Notice de l'œuvre |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/de/kollektionen/werkkatalog/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=000214&amp;cHash=34e19f6012 |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and reception ==
The painting was the last of the four portraits of groups that Fantin-Latour devoted to his friends and celebrities in the arts world. He referred here to the concerts given by the group known as "Le Petit Bayreuth" initiated by Antoine Lascoux. Despite three previous paintings and numerous [[still life]]s, the painter had not received the critical acclaim which he expected. He finally reached it through ''Around the Piano''. The painting, however, remains the least known of series of four ones, perhaps because the people depicted are less famous.

Exhibited at the Salon of 1885, the painting was called ''The Wagnerists'' by visitors, as the person seated at the piano was thought to be [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], a composer who was an early supporter of [[Wagner]]. Adolphe Jullien, a close friend of Latour, rejected this name, saying that Fantin did not want to paint an artistic manifesto, but simply a gathering of friends, and that the score on the piano, although indistinct, was a piece by Brahms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wagner et la France |url=http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=432 |first=Georges |last=Liébert |publisher=L'Histoire par image |language=French |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=March 2011}}

'''Burnishing''' is a form of [[pottery]] treatment in which the surface of the pot is [[Polishing|polished]], using a hard smooth surface such as a wooden or bone spatula, smooth stones, plastic, or even glass bulbs, while it still is in a leathery 'green' state, i.e., before [[Pottery#Firing|firing]]. After firing, the surface is extremely shiny. Often the whole outer surface of the pot is thus decorated, but in certain [[ceramic]] traditions there is 'pattern burnishing' where the outside and, in the case of open bowls, the inside, are decorated with burnished patterns in which some areas are left [[Gloss (paint)|matte]].

This technique can be applied to [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete masonry]], creating a polished [[Surface finishing|finish]]. 

Burnishing can also be applied to wood, by rubbing two pieces together along the [[Wood grain|grain]]. Hard woods take the treatment best.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Burnishing does not protect the wood like a [[varnish]] does, but does impart a glossy sheen.

If one wood has a [[dye]] in it or is colored in some way, it may rub off onto the other wood. Burnishing can also apply to [[relief printing]].

The '''Caves in the district of Maros''' are located in [[Bantimurung - Bulusaraung National Park|Bantimurung district]] (''kecamatan''), [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. They contain paintings from the paleolithic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wt1VbkTeFRMC|title=1993 Indonesia, Malaysia &amp; Singapore Handbook|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1993|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Caves in the district of Maros are a cave complex, where prehistoric finds were made.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Marchant, Justin Mott, '[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/journey-oldest-cave-paintings-world-180957685/ A Journey to the Oldest Cave Paintings in the World'], ''Smithsonian.com'', January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole complex is also called "Prehistoric place Leang-Leang" – the name stems from the [[Makassarese language]].&lt;ref name=Brunei&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Liz|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/travel/2008/01/20/sulawesi_cave_of_hands|title=Sulawesi cave of hands|work=[[The Brunei Times]]|date=20 January 2008|accessdate=16 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040705/http://www.bt.com.bn/travel/2008/01/20/sulawesi_cave_of_hands|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various caves - named Pettae, Jane, Saripa, Jarie, Karrasa, and so on - consist of limestone. They are located {{convert|12|km}} from the town of [[Maros]] and {{convert|30|km}} from the city of [[Makassar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNdwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pettakere+cave|title=Sulawesi: Island crossroads of Indonesia|first=Toby Alice|last=Volkman|year=1990|publisher=Passport Books|accessdate=22 November 2014|isbn=9780844299068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to the caves is located {{convert|30|m}} above a rice field, accessible by ladder.&lt;ref name=thejakartaglobe&gt;{{cite news |last=Pitaloka|first=Dyah Ayu|url=http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/features/exploring-leang-leang-caves-maros/ |title=Exploring the Leang-Leang Caves of Maros |newspaper=[[Jakarta Globe]]|date=6 July 2014|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW.de"&gt;{{cite news|last=Domínguez|first=Gabriel|url=http://www.dw.de/indonesian-cave-paintings-rewriting-art-history/g-17984540|title=Indonesian cave paintings – Rewriting art history|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hand stencil]] in the Leang Tempuseng cave was dated to at least 39,900 years old in a 2014 study.&lt;ref&gt;M. Aubert et al., "Pleistocene cave art from Sulawesi, Indonesia", ''Nature'' volume 514, pages 223–227 (9 October 2014) "using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world."
The hand stencil mentioned is labelled Leang Timpuseng 2.3, corrected age {{val|40.70|0.87|0.84|u=kyr}} ([[68–95–99.7 rule|2σ]]) (p.226, Table 1),  significantly older than the [[Cave of El Castillo|El Castillo]] hand stencil (sample O-32), corrected age {{val|37.64|0.34|u=kyr}} according to García-Diez, M. et al., "The chronology of hand stencils in European Palaeolithic rock art: implications of new U-series results from  El Castillo Cave (Cantabria, Spain)", ''[[Journal of Anthropological Sciences]]'' Vol. 93 (2015), pp. 135-152, {{doi|10.4436/JASS.93004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of a [[babirusa]] is also located in this cave. It is estimated to be 35,400 years old. The art works were examined with the help of the Uranium-Thorium method of the [[sintering]] on the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Aubert et al., 2014: Pleistocene cave art from Sulawesi, Indonesia, Nature, 514, 223–227&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the entrance of the Pettakare cave, on the roof, are 26 red and white hand prints, they are not dated, yet.&lt;ref name=thejakartaglobe/&gt; Primitive [[stencil]]s of human hands, the white prints were executed by "placing the hand up against the wall and then blowing a mixture of red ochre and water around them, leaving a negative image on the rock".&lt;ref name=Brunei/&gt; The red hand prints could have been produced by immersing the hand in a solution tinted red from "chewed-up foliage".&lt;ref name=thejakartaglobe/&gt; The hand prints face both left and right.&lt;ref name=Brunei/&gt; Some are missing a thumb; it was common practice to cut off a finger when an elder died.&lt;ref name=thejakartaglobe/&gt; According to an official with the Makassar Center for Cultural and Heritage Preservation, the palm of the hand was believed to have power to ward off "evil forces and wild animals", thus protecting the people who lived inside the cave.&lt;ref name=thejakartaglobe/&gt; In addition to the hand prints, a roughly half-meter (two-foot) long painting of a red [[hog deer]] is in the middle.&lt;ref name=thejakartaglobe/&gt;

Pettakare cave's large room has several small niches, presumed to have been sleeping places for the people who lived there.&lt;ref name="thejakartaglobe"/&gt; The cave has a temperature of {{convert|27|C}} during the daytime.&lt;ref name="thejakartaglobe"/&gt;

== History ==
The caves have been known and used by the local people for a long time. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] archaeologists began digging at nearby caves during the 1950s, but Pettakare cave was first examined by British archaeologist Ian Glover in 1973.&lt;ref name=Brunei/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw17984021"/&gt;

Scientific examinations conducted in 2011 estimated that the hand stencils and animal painting on the walls were between 35,000 and 40,000 years old.&lt;ref name="dw17984021"&gt;{{cite web|last=Domínguez|first=Gabriel|url=http://www.dw.de/indonesian-cave-paintings-revolutionized-our-idea-of-human-art/a-17984021|title=Indonesian cave paintings 'revolutionized our idea of human art'|date=9 October 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of the paintings was estimated through analysis of small radioactive traces of [[Isotopes of uranium|uraniam isotopes]] present in the crust that had accumulated on top of the paintings.&lt;ref name="dw17984021"/&gt; The hand paintings are at least as old as cave paintings in Europe, such as those at the [[Cave of El Castillo]] (Spain) and [[Gorham's Cave]] (Gibraltar).&lt;ref name="DW.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Le Roux|first=Mariette|url=http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/society-culture/71464-indonesia-sulawesi-cave-paintings-ancient-art|title=Southeast Asian cave paintings challenge Europe as cradle of art|publisher=[[Rappler]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 the Indonesian government promised to "step up" the protection of ancient cave paintings, and announced plans to place all the caves in Sulawesi on the nation's official "cultural heritage" list, as well as apply for inclusion on [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/71525-indonesia-pledges-to-protect-ancient-cave-paintings|title=Indonesia pledges to protect ancient cave paintings|publisher=Rappler|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Chapter Arts in Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|Image taken in 2006, prior to the redevelopment]] 

Chapter was founded by Welsh artists, [[Christine Kinsey]] and Bryan Jones with journalist Mike Flood and opened in 1971.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.chapter.org/history.html A Brief History of Chapter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003184935/http://www.chapter.org/history.html |date=3 October 2011 }}, Chapter Arts Centre website. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was previously a school, Canton High School, and was built in 1905.&lt;ref name="AJ2010"&gt;Rory Olcayto [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/culture/chapter-arts-centre-cardiff-by-ash-sakula-architects/5215220.article ''Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff, by Ash Sakula Architects''], The Architects' Journal, 11 March 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Chapter underwent a £3.8 million redevelopment, designed by architects [[Ash Sakula Architects]], who were appointed in 2006. The practice prioritised remodelling of the public areas on the ground floor, while adding a storey-high 'light box' above the main entrance as an 'artistic billboard'.&lt;ref name="AJ2010" /&gt; The centre remained open through the redevelopment and the new Chapter opened in November 2009. The building won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|R.I.B.A.]] Wales Award in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/Awards/RIBA%20Awards.aspx RIBA Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310122544/http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/Awards/RIBA%20Awards.aspx |date=10 March 2012 }}, R.I.B.A. website. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The new open-plan design was described as user friendly with many great details.&lt;ref name="AJ2010" /&gt; 

Following the Centre's refurbishment in 2009, the number of visitors doubled to 800,000 per year, making it the second most popular attraction in Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Unveils plans"&gt;Cathy Owen (11 April 2014) [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/chapter-arts-centre-unveils-plans-6949419 "Chapter Arts Centre unveils plans for £6m expansion"], ''WalesOnline''. Retrieved 2014-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of March 2014 Chapter installed 60 photovoltaic [[Solar cells|solar panels]] to their roof providing up to 15KW of electricity. {{cn|date=April 2014}}

In the autumn of 2014 Chapter became a venue for the international [[Artes Mundi]] exhibition and art prize, which expanded for the first time beyond the [[National Museum Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Emma Crichton-Miller |title=Artes Mundi: international art in Cardiff |work=Apollo Magazine |date=13 November 2014 |url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/artes-mundi-international-art-cardiff/ |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 Chapter announced that the main Theatre and Stiwdio spaces would be renamed to celebrate a significant donation from [http://www.aandbcymru.org.uk/david-and-philippa-seligman/ David Seligman]. The spaces will be known as Theatr Seligman Theatre and Stiwdio Seligman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter celebrates significant donation from David Seligman|url = http://www.chapter.org/news-noise/news/chapter-celebrates-significant-donation-david-seligman|website = Chapter|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheekwood''' is a privately funded {{convert|55|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate on the western edge of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] that houses the '''Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art'''.  Formerly the residence of Nashville's Cheek family, the {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style mansion was opened as a museum in 1960.

== History ==
Christopher Cheek founded a wholesale [[grocery]] business in Nashville in the 1880s. His son, Leslie Cheek, joined him as a partner, and by 1915 was president of the family-owned company.  Leslie's wife, Mabel Wood, was a member of a prominent [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], family.  Meanwhile, [[Joel Owsley Cheek]], Leslie's cousin, had developed an acclaimed blend of [[coffee]] that was marketed through Nashville's finest hotel, the [[Maxwell House Hotel]].  Cheek's extended family, including Leslie and Mabel Cheek, were investors. In 1928, the [[Postum]] Cereals Company (now [[General Foods]]) purchased [[Maxwell House]]'s parent company, Cheek-Neal Coffee, for more than $40 million.&lt;ref name=AboutCheekwoodHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheekwood.org/About.aspx |title=History of Cheekwood |publisher=Cheekwood Botanical Gardens and Museum of Art |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208011001/http://www.cheekwood.org/About.aspx# |archive-date=2013-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sale of the family business, Leslie Cheek bought {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of woodland in West Nashville for a country estate.  He hired [[New York City|New York]] residential and landscape architect [[Bryant Fleming]] to design the house and gardens, and gave him full control over every detail of the project, including interior furnishings.  The resulting [[limestone]] mansion and extensive formal gardens were completed in 1932. The estate design was inspired by the grand [[England|English]] manors of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=AboutCheekwoodHistory/&gt;

Leslie Cheek died just two years after moving into the mansion. Mabel Cheek and their daughter, Huldah Cheek Sharp, lived at Cheekwood until the 1950s, when Huldah Sharp and her husband offered the property as a site for a botanical garden and art museum. The Exchange Club of Nashville, the Horticultural Society of Middle Tennessee and other civic groups led the redevelopment of the property aided by funds raised from the sale of the former building of the defunct Nashville Museum of Art.  The new Cheekwood museum opened in 1960.&lt;ref name=AboutCheekwoodHistory/&gt;

== Art museum ==
Cheekwood's art collection was founded in 1959 upon the holdings of the former [[Nashville Museum of Art]] and is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]]. The core holdings include broad collections of American art; American and British decorative arts; contemporary art, especially outdoor sculpture acquired for the Woodland Sculpture Trail.

Cheekwood's American art collection includes 600 paintings and 5,000 prints, drawings and photographs. The collection, assembled in the 1980s and early 1990s through a multimillion-dollar bequest, spans the history of American art. Its strength centers on [[The Eight (Nyolcak)|The Eight]]. Other strengths include the world's largest collection of sculptures of [[William Edmondson]], photographs by [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]], and a vast variety of post-[[Second World War]] prints. Recently, the Museum has pursued a consciously focused acquisition process, having added paintings by James Hamilton, [[William Bradford (painter)|William Bradford]], and new contemporary sculpture for the Trail.

The core holdings of the decorative arts collection include the third-largest [[Worcester]] porcelain in the [[United States]], and a 650-piece silver collection, spanning the 18th-20th centuries.

The Cheek Mansion is itself considered part of the collection. A year-long renovation, completed in June 2017, restored much of the original building, which revealed authentic features (wood and marble floors that had been carpeted), and conserved historical architectural motifs, such as the illusionist murals that line the main corridor.

The Contemporary Art collection, housed in the galleries created out of the estate's original garage and stables, is small but of high quality, including paintings by [[Larry Rivers]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Marylyn Dintenfass]]. Additionally, seven small galleries were created in the old horse stable stalls to enable Cheekwood to display installation art.

The Carrell Woodland Sculpture Trail, a collection of fifteen sculptures by international artists, extends the contemporary art collection into nature, focusing on a kind of intimate, outdoor art not commonly found in American museums.

== Botanical garden ==
[[File:Polemonium reptans 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Creeping Jacob's Ladder]] (''Polemonium reptans'') at Cheekwood Botanical Garden]] 
Extending across the grounds from the Museum of Art, the Botanical Garden encompasses the entire {{convert|55|acre|ha|adj=on}} site with an emphasis on display, education, and study.  The plant collections include [[Buxus|boxwood]], [[conifer]], [[crape myrtle]], [[daffodil]], [[daylily]], [[dogwood]], [[fern]], [[herb]], [[holly]], [[hosta]], [[hydrangea]], [[Japanese maple]], [[magnolia]], Southeastern US natives, [[redbud]], and [[trillium]].

== Other attractions ==
In addition to the Museum and the Botanical Garden, Cheekwood operates a nick-nack  shop, and a restaurant called the Pineapple Room which overlooks the west lawn.

'''Emil Thoroddsen''' (June 16, 1898 &amp;ndash; July 7, 1944) was an Icelandic composer, pianist, playwright, critic and translator. He was the chief art critic of "Morgunblaðið" newspaper from 1926–1933 and worked for the [[RÚV|Icelandic National Broadcasting Service]] since its establishment in 1930. Among his most widely known songs are „Íslands Hrafnistumenn“ and „Hver á sér fegra föðurland“ which was premiered at the Festival of the Republic in 1944, shortly before he far too prematurely died from pneumonia.

In his youth, Emil practiced sports among young men from his neighborhood and was involved in the creation of the football club [[Knattspyrnufélagið Víkingur|Víkingur Reykjavik]] at the age of twelve, hosting the club's inaugural meeting and initially taking the role of club secretary. He later produced coverage about the club's operations and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Mbl.is Archives.

{{mergeto|Shared universe|date=May 2018}}
The term '''expanded universe''', sometimes called an '''extended universe''', is generally used to denote the "extension" of a [[media franchise]] (like a television program or a series of feature films) with other media, generally comics and original novels. This typically involves new stories for existing characters already developed within the franchise, but in some cases entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed. This is not necessarily the same as an adaptation, which is a retelling of the same story that may or may not adhere to accepted [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe.

==Examples==
Two prominent examples of media franchises with an expanded universe are ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref name="Knight2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladys L. Knight|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PKSFHwhTGYC&amp;pg=PA240|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Star Trek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expanded Universe: ''Star Trek''|publisher=Empire|accessdate=23 November 2013|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/star-trek-expanded-universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; which both have a wide range of original novels, comics, video games, and other media that add to the mythology of their fictional universe in different ways. In both cases, entirely new characters and situations have been developed that exist only within the expanded universe media.&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THR Legends"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonicity==
Although there are some exceptions, expanded universe works are generally accepted as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], or part of the "official" storyline continuity. Otherwise, they are considered [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocrypha]]. In some cases, characters created for an expanded universe are later featured in the primary works associated with that franchise, as in the cases of [[Aayla Secura]] and [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] in the ''Star Wars'' franchise.&lt;ref name="Filoni CB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/02/20/star-wars-lucasfilm-legends-expanded-universe-george-lucas/|title=''Star Wars'': Dave Filoni Explains George Lucas and Lucasfilm's Relationship with ''Legends''|publisher=Comicbook.com|first=Lucas|last=Siegel|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UT Rebels"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/07/16/thrawn-star-wars-rebels-celebration/87180842/ |title=Thrawn to make grand appearance in ''Star Wars Rebels'' |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=July 16, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When all expanded universe works (films, novels, comic books, video games, role-playing games, etc.) are considered canonical, then the expanded universe is an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel. [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fantasy-role-playing-game-a-new-performing-art/oclc/45575501 ''The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art''] (Jefferson, NC: McFarland. 2001) pp. 26-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fearless Girl''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Kristen Visbal]], commissioned by [[State Street Global Advisors]] (SSgA) via McCann New York. It depicts a girl who, as originally installed, faced the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' (or ''[[Wall Street]] Bull'') statue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/things-fearless-girl/308863/ |title=Eight Things You Don't Know About 'Fearless Girl' |publisher=[[Advertising Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed in November 2018 in preparation for relocation to in front of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. A plaque with footprints was placed on the original site of ''Fearless Girl''.&lt;ref name="Moyer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moyer |first=Liz |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/fearless-girl-on-the-move-but-leaves-footprints-for-visitors.html |title='Fearless Girl' on the move, but leaves footprints for visitors to stand in her place |work=[[CNBC]] |date=2018-11-28 |accessdate=2018-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Fearless Girl'' was commissioned to advertise for an [[index fund]] that comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership. The plaque below the statue states: "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference," with "SHE" being both a descriptive pronoun and the fund's [[NASDAQ]] [[ticker symbol]]. The statue was originally installed on March 7, 2017, at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

''Fearless Girl'' is meant to "send a message" about workplace [[gender diversity]] and encourage [[Gender representation on corporate boards of directors|companies to recruit women to their boards]].&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite news |title=A $2.5 trillion asset manager just put a statue of a defiant girl in front of the Wall Street bull |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/statue-defiant-girl-faces-wall-street-charging-bull-state-street-global-national-womens-day-2017-3 |accessdate=March 7, 2017 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=March 7, 2017 |first1=Emma |last1=Fierberg |first2=Rachael |last2=Levy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque below the statue states: "Know the power of women in leadership.

The commission by State Street Global Advisors specified that the statue should depict a girl with hands on her hips and chin up, with a height of 36 inches, which Kristen Visbal and her collaborators then increased to 50 inches, to better match the size of ''Charging Bull''.&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt; Still, Visbal commented that "I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent".&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt; She modeled the sculpture on two children, but many of the distinguishing features were removed so that it would be universally appealing. A child who would represent all children "so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl."&lt;ref name="Dobnik" /&gt;

== History ==
The statue was installed on March 7, 2017—the day before [[International Women's Day]]—by [[State Street Global Advisors]], in a campaign developed by advertising agency [[McCann Erickson|McCann New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nycs-fearless-girl-statue-corporate-giants-46026204 |title=Behind NYC's 'Fearless Girl' statue are 2 corporate giants |last=Dobnik |first=Verena |date=March 9, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312022256/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nycs-fearless-girl-statue-corporate-giants-46026204 |archivedate=March 12, 2017 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSgA was celebrating the first anniversary of its "Gender Diversity Index" fund that "invests in U.S. large-capitalization companies that rank among the highest in their sector in achieving gender diversity across senior leadership".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.spdrs.com/post/driving-gender-diversity-with-a-bold-new-statement |title=Driving Gender Diversity with a Bold New Statement |last=Mavro |first=Jill |date=March 7, 2017 |website=SPDR Blog|access-date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the statue was developed by Senior Art Director Lizzie Wilson and Senior Copywriter Tali Gumbiner.

==Controversies==

=== Juxtaposition with ''Charging Bull'' ===
[[File:Fearless Girl (cropped).jpg|thumb|The juxtaposition of ''Fearless Girl'' and ''Charging Bull'' upset some observers, including sculptor Arturo Di Modica, who installed ''Charging Bull'' in 1989.]]
[[Arturo Di Modica]], who installed ''Charging Bull'' in 1989, asked that the statue of the girl be removed, arguing that the piece exploited his work for commercial purposes and altered the perception of the bull.&lt;ref name="Mettler"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mettler |first1=Katie |title=Charging Bull sculptor says Fearless Girl distorts his art, so he's fighting back |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-charging-bull-sculptor-fearless-girl-20170412-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called ''Fearless Girl'' "an advertising trick" that he wants relocated, citing its political messaging.&lt;ref name="Stack2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-de-blasio.html?_r=0 |title=‘Fearless Girl’ Statue to Stay in Financial District (for Now) |date=March 27, 2017 |work=The New York Times |last1=Stack |first1=Liam |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobnik"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/03/26/new-york-invite-fearless-girl-statue-stay-wall-street/99677644/ |title=Will New York invite the 'Fearless Girl' statue to stay on Wall Street? |date=March 26, 2017 |work=USA Today |language=en |last1=Dobnik |first1=Verena |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other controversies ===

{{Chinese name|[[Fei (surname)|Fei]]}}

'''Fei Dawei''' ({{zh|s=费大为}}) is a Paris-based art critic and curator. Born in 1954, Shanghai, he attended the [[Central Academy of Fine Arts]] in Beijing in 1985 and belonged to the first generation of art critics and curators in China after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Being largely involved in the 1985-1989 New Wave Movement, often known as the '85 New Wave, Fei is a pioneer of the field who participated in the organization of many influential events in the history of contemporary Chinese art. He is best known for his curatorial works overseas in both Europe and Asia. He emphasizes cross-border cultural communication and denies the idea of "cultural exiles" come up with other domestic critics.

==Life and career path==
After graduating from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing with a bachelor's degree in History of Art in 1985, Fei took a major part in organizing the [[1989 China Avant-Garde exhibition|China/Avant-Garde exhibition]] at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing, along with [[Li Xianting]] and [[Gao Minglu]]. Meanwhile, he also advised the curators of the Magiciens de la Terre exhibit at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Paris, France, also known as the Centre [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou]]. After moving permanently to France after being awarded a Chercheur Libre research grant by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1989, Fei was appointed as the chief curator of the Chine Demain pour Hier exhibition in Pourrieres, France in 1990, which is the first exhibition on Chinese contemporary art. It reveals to the world the six emblematic figures of [[Cai Guoqiang]], [[Huang Yong Ping]], Chen Zhen, Yan Pei Ming, [[Gu Wenda]], Yang Jie Chang. Exceptional installations covered more than 20 hectares of land, making a major impact on the history of Chinese contemporary art. In 1991, he was the chief curator of the Exceptional Passage exhibition, in Fukuoka, Japan (11 hectares)which is the first exhibition on Chinese contemporary art in Japan. Three years later, he was appointed the chief curator of the first Promenade in Asia exhibition in Tokyo, Japan, in collaboration with the cultural branch of [[Shiseido]]. (and of the second edition in 1997). In the 1994 CIMAM (International Committee of Museums of Modern Art) conference in Tokyo, Fei was invited as a guest speaker representing China. A year later, he curated the Asiana exhibition during the [[Venice Biennale]], Italy. During 1995 and 2003, he is one of the juries for The [http://www.unesco.org/culture/aschberg/ UNESCO-Aschberg Bursaries for Artists]. Meanwhile, in 1996, he curated the Between Limits exhibition at Sonje Museum, the first exhibition on Chinese contemporary art in South Korea. In 1999, Fei was awarded the title of "Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres" (Knight of Art and Culture) by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2004, he was the chief curator of the All under Heaven exhibition with the MUHKA (Museum of Contemporary Art) and the KMSKA (Royal Museum of Fine Arts) in Antwerp, Belgium and The Monk and The Demon exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lyon, France one of the main events of the Year of China in France.

Since 2002, Fei became the director of the Guy &amp; Myriam Ullens Foundation. During those years, he set up and managed the pronounced collection of Chinese contemporary art, and established the Ullence Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA) in Beijing [[798 Art Zone|798 Art District]]. During 2005 and 2008, Fei was director of the [http://ucca.org.cn/en/ Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA)] in Beijing, China, one of the main museums of the Beijing 798 Art Zone. It is also the first and largest contemporary museum to be set up in China. In 2007, he curated the '85 New Wave Inaugural Exhibition at the Ullence Center for Contemporary Art, of which the success and high artistic quality attracted both national and international acclaim.

==Ideas and thoughts ==

=== Cultural communication instead of nationalism ===
In 1991, [[Li Xianting]] wrote a letter to Fei Dawei in which Li used the term "cultural exiles" for artists' activities oversea. Fei Dawei, deeply influenced by [[Henri Bergson]], disputed Li's opinion and insisted that oversea activities and cultural communication could be an internal impetus which would create a new hotbed for new arts to jump outside the framework of nationalism. Below are quotes from Fei's letter to Li.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fei|first=Dawei|title=1991年，给栗宪庭的一封信|url=http://www.artlinkart.com/cn/artist/txt_ab/425auxn/927cAzrm|publisher=ARTLINKART|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fei|first=Dawei|title=A Letter to Li Xianting|url=http://test.art-ba-ba.com/main/main.art?threadId=21740&amp;forumId=8|publisher=中国当代艺术论坛 Chinese Contemporary Art BBS|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*	Indeed, quite many well-established artists stopped making any progress after migrating to another country. However, can we then vaguely derive a general conclusion from this phenomenon and therefore deny the possibilities that Chinese artists can make art in the foreign context? I think, the reason why most Chinese artists have lost their talents since they went abroad is not only because of the problems in language and real life, but also the constrained thoughts and thinking process grown from their “cultural originality” which keeps them from entering the contemporary culture in a new environment. Such exhaustion of creativity is due to the artists’ incapability to turn what they’ve learned domestically into something free of cultural borders and enduringly effective. Such incapability is derived from the sealed off and conservative culture that is unique to China. Thus, I prefer to reverse your words by saying that “art will exhaust if it does not leave its cultural motherland”. Of course, when I say to “leave”, what I mean is that the art can only develop if it can exceed at least one aspect of its domestic culture. Today’s world is featured by a globalized cultural communication so we can only realize our uniqueness and vitalize our domestic culture by acknowledging and being involved with cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary studies.
*	Only when “domestic culture” steps out of the “domain”, it can become an authentic “domestic culture”.
*	From my very personal perspective, the so-called “cultural exiles” is actually “ideological exiles” which is nothing more than homesick of those who are driven out and can’t return home. If one can make wherever a home, and be free of homesick and geographical boundaries, “cultural exiles” won’t exist.
*       “Cultural exiles” has another layer of meaning: these artists are forced to leave their fixed resources and audiences which both are determined by their working methods; therefore, when being abroad, they are isolated like a fish out of water.
*	An exclusive culture sometimes split one’s body and spirit like a wall. In such culture, one’s psyche is constantly wandering in a rootless manner. One’s body being home causes no home for spirit. Therefore, in this sense, such “cultural exiles” can be a kind of internal impetus of a culture.
*	National identity is never acquired through pursuits. It is the part revealed spontaneously from every artist’s creative works. It is a result instead of a goal. Every conscious pursuit of the so-called national identity will result in crafty and superficial decorative art. It will eliminate artistic creativity and vilify national culture. Nationalism is the last thing ever wanted but national identity is an inevitable fact regardless of your need – you can only decide how to face it.

[[File:Gmaciunas-manifesto.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fluxus Manifesto'', 1963, by [[George Maciunas]]]]
'''Fluxus''' was an international, interdisciplinary community of artists, composers, designers and poets during the 1960s and 1970s who engaged in experimental art performances which emphasized the artistic process over the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;''Nationalencyclopedin'' (''Swedish National Encyclopedia''). 2016. "Fluxus." Accessible at: http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyclopedi/lång/fluxus Accessed September 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Lisa S. 2016. "Fluxus." ''Britannica Academic'' (Encyclopedia Britannica Online).&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines and for generating new art forms. These art forms include [[intermedia]], a term coined by Fluxus artist [[Dick Higgins]];&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1966. "Intermedia." ''Something Else Newsletter''. Vol. 1, No. 1, February, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 2001. "Intermedia" ''Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality''. Randall Packer and Ken Jordan, eds. New York: W.W. Norton and Co., pp. 27–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1984. ''Horizons: The Poetics and Theory of the Intermedia''.

"Concept Art: Innperseqs." Reprinted in 1963: ''An Anthology''. La Monte Young, ed. New York: Jackson Mac Low and La Monte Young, np.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynt, Henry. 1963. "Essay: Concept Art: Provisional Version." ''An Anthology''. La Monte Young, ed. New York: Jackson Mac Low and La Monte Young, np.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[video art]], first pioneered by [[Nam June Paik]] and [[Wolf Vostell]].&lt;ref&gt;Paik, Nam June. 1993. ''Nam June Paik: eine Data Base. La Biennale di Venezia. XLV Esposizione lnternazionale D’Arte, June 13 – October 10, 1993''. Klaus Bussmann and Florian Matzner, eds.

Giles, Ltd., in association with the Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fundacio Joan Miro. 1979. ''Vostell. Environments Pintura Happenings Dibuixos Video de 1958 a 1978''. Barcelona: Fundacio Joan Miro.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as "the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties."&lt;ref name="Ruhé, Harry 1979"&gt;Ruhé, Harry. 1979. ''Fluxus, the Most Radical and Experimental Art Movement of the Sixties'' Amsterdam: Editions Galerie A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhé, Harry. 1999. "Introduction." ''25 Fluxus Stories'' Amsterdam: Tuja Books, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluxus participants included "artists, composers, designers, and architects, as well as economists, mathematicians, ballet dancers, chefs, and even a would-be theologian.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Ken 2011. p.35"&gt;Friedman, Ken. 2011. "Fluxus: A Laboratory of Ideas." ''Fluxus and the Essential Qualities of Life''. Jacquelynne Baas, editor. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally significant, they represented nations across many continents, predominantly Asia, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Ken 2011. p.35"/&gt;

They produced performance "events," which included enactments of scores, "[[Neo-Dada]]" [[noise music]], and time-based works, as well as [[concrete poetry]], [[visual art]], [[urban planning]], architecture, design, literature, and publishing. Many Fluxus artists share anti-commercial and [[anti-art]] sensibilities. Fluxus is sometimes described as "intermedia". The ideas and practices of composer [[John Cage]] heavily influenced Fluxus. Especially, his notions that one should embark on an artwork without a conception of its end, and his understanding of the work as a site of interaction between artist and audience. The process of creating was privileged over the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fluxus Movement, Artists and Major Works|url = http://www.theartstory.org/movement-fluxus.htm|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable influence were [[Marcel Duchamp|the readymades of Marcel Duchamp]], a French artist who was active in [[Dada]] (1916 – c. 1922). [[George Maciunas]], largely considered to be the founder of this fluid movement, coined the name Fluxus in 1961 to title a proposed magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In the Spirit of Fluxus|last = Armstrong|first = Elizabeth|publisher = The Occasion of the Exhibition|year = 1993|isbn =9780935640403|location = Minneapolis|pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many artists of the 1960s took part in Fluxus activities, including [[Joseph Beuys]], [[George Brecht]], [[Robert Filliou]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Bengt af Klintberg]], [[Alison Knowles]], Addi Køpcke, [[Yoko Ono]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]. Not only were they a diverse community of collaborators who influenced each other, they were also, largely, friends. They collectively had what were, at the time, radical ideas about art and the role of art in society.&lt;ref&gt;Zurbrugg, Nicholas. 1990. “A Spirit of Large Goals.” – Dada and Fluxus at Two Speeds. ''Fluxus!'' Nicholas Zurbrugg, Francesco Conz, and Nicholas Tsoutas, eds. Brisbane, Australia: Institute of Modern Art, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The intersecting communities within Fluxus and the way that Fluxus developed in overlapping stages meant that participants each had very different ideas about what Fluxus was.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Owen F. 1998. ''Fluxus: The History of an Attitude''. San Diego: San Diego State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus founder George Maciunas proposed a well known manifesto, but few considered Fluxus to be a true movement,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1992. "Fluxus: Theory and Reception." ''Lund Art Press'', Vol II, No 2, pp. 25–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1998. "Fluxus: Theory and Reception." ''The Fluxus Reader'', Ken Friedman, ed. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley Academy Editions, pp. 218–236.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the manifesto was not largely adopted. Instead, a series of festivals in Wiesbaden, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam, London, and New York, gave rise to a loose but robust community with many similar beliefs. In keeping with the reputation Fluxus earned as a forum of experimentation,&lt;ref name="Ruhé, Harry 1979"/&gt; some Fluxus artists came to describe Fluxus as a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ken. 2011. “Fluxus: A Laboratory of Ideas.” ''Fluxus and the Essential Qualities of Life''. Jacquelynne Baas, editor. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ken. 2012. “Freedom? Nothingness? Time?

DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276412465440&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus played an important role in the broadening of what is considered art.&lt;ref&gt;Tate Gallery. "Nam June Paik.

==History to 1965==

===Origins===
[[File:FluxYearBox2.jpg|280px|thumb|''Flux Year Box 2'', c.1967, a Flux box edited and produced by George Maciunas, containing works by many early Fluxus artists]] 
The origins of Fluxus lie in many of the concepts explored by composer [[John Cage]] in his [[experimental music]] of the 1930s through the 1960s. After attending courses on Zen Buddhism taught by D. T. Suzuki, Cage taught a series of classes in experimental composition from 1957 to 1959 at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. These classes explored the notions of chance and [[Indeterminacy in music|indeterminacy]] in art, using music scores as a basis for compositions that could be performed in potentially infinite ways. Some of the artists and musicians who became involved in Fluxus, including [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[La Monte Young]], [[George Brecht]], [[Al Hansen]], and [[Dick Higgins]] attended Cage's classes.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas himself joined the class in 1959–60, and was taught by Maxfield&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht; A Heterospective, Walther König, p28.{{Full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--What the heck is this, a book, an exhibition catalog, a journal or newspaper article?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A major influence is found in the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref name="MOMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10457 Michael Corris, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Also of importance was ''Dada Poets and Painters'', edited by Robert Motherwell, a book of translations of Dada texts that was widely read by members of Fluxus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dada Painters And Poets: An Anthology|last=Motherwell|first=Robert and Jean Arp|publisher=Belknap Press Of Harvard University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[anti-art]], a precursor to [[Dada]], was coined by Duchamp around 1913, when he created his first readymades from [[found object]]s (ordinary objects found or purchased and declared art).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art Anti-art, Art that challenges the existing accepted definitions of art, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; Indifferently chosen, [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] and altered readymades challenged the notion of art as an inherently optical experience, dependent on academic art skills. The most famous example is Duchamp's infamous altered readymade ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a work which he signed "R. Mutt." While taking refuge from WWI in New York, in 1915 Duchamp formed a Dada group with [[Francis Picabia]] and American artist [[Man Ray]]. Other key members included [[Arthur Cravan|Arthur Craven]], [[Florine Stettheimer]], and the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, credited by some with proposing the idea for [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] to Duchamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/arts/design/06dada.html?_r=1|title=New York Times|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 these artists, especially Duchamp, Man Ray, and Picabia, became the center for radical anti-art activities in New York City. Their artworks would inform Fluxus and [[conceptual art]] in general.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt; In the late 1950s and very early 1960s, Fluxus and contemporaneous groups or movements, including [[Happenings]], [[Nouveau réalisme]], [[mail art]], and [[performance art|action art]] in Japan, Austria, and other international locations were, often placed under the rubric of [[Neo-Dada]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood, Susan and Rittner, Jennifer. "Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–1962" Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Jan., 1995), pp. 63–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other contemporary events are credited as either anticipating Fluxus or as constituting proto-Fluxus events.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt; The most commonly cited include the series of Chambers Street loft concerts, in New York, curated by Yoko Ono and La Monte Young in 1961, featuring pieces by Yoko Ono, J[[Jackson Mac Low|ackson MacLow]], [[Joseph Byrd]], and [[Henry Flynt]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/loftono.html Performances at Yoko Ono's Chambers Street Loft]&lt;/ref&gt; the month-long ''Yam'' festival held in upstate New York by George Brecht and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] in May 1963 with [[Ray Johnson]] and [[Allan Kaprow]] (the culmination of a year's worth of [[Mail Art]] pieces);&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt; and a series of concerts held in [[Mary Bauermeister]]'s studio, Cologne, 1960–61, featuring [[Nam June Paik]] and John Cage among many others. It was at one of these events in 1960, during his Etude pour Piano, that Paik leapt into the audience and cut John Cage's tie off, ran out of the concert hall, and then phoned the hall's organisers to announce the piece had ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/exhibition/nam-june-paik/nam-june-paik-room-guide/nam-june-paik-section-2 Tate, Nam June Paik, Fluxus, Performance, Participation]&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the movement's founders, Dick Higgins, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fluxus started with the work, and then came together, applying the name Fluxus to work which already existed. It was as if it started in the middle of the situation, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9feLztCuQ18 Dick Higgins on Fluxus], interviewed 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amongst the earliest pieces that would later be published by Fluxus were Brecht's event scores, the earliest of which dated from around 1958/9, and works such as Valoche, which had originally been exhibited in Brecht's solo show 'Toward's Events' at 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The American musician and artist La Monte Young had been enlisted to guest-edit an issue of a literary journal, ''Beatitude East'', and asked George Maciunas, a trained graphic designer, for help with the layout. Maciunas supplied the paper, design, and some money for publishing the anthology which contained the work of a more or less arbitrary group of New York [[avant-garde]] artists from that time. By the end of 1961 before ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''&lt;ref&gt;full title, 'An Anthology of chance operations concept art anti-art indeterminacy improvisation meaningless work natural disasters plans of action stories diagrams Music poetry essays dance constructions mathematics compositions'&lt;/ref&gt; was completed (it was finally published in 1963 by Mac Low and Young), Maciunas had moved to Germany to escape his creditors and work for the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/magazine/design-in-flux/. Chamberlain, Colby. "Design in Flux" Art In America. 1 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; From there, he continued his contact with the New York artists and with artists like Benjamin Patterson, whom he met in Europe, by September 1962 was joined by Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles, who traveled to Europe to help him promote a second planned publication to be called "Fluxus", the first of a series of "yearbooks" of artists' works.

===Early Fluxus and Neo-Dada===
Lithuanian-born [[George Maciunas]] coined the name Fluxus for art produced by a range of artists with a shared sensibility as an attempt to 'fuse... cultural, social, &amp; political revolutionaries into [a] united front and action'.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Manifesto, 1963, by George Maciunas&lt;/ref&gt; After fleeing Lithuania at the end of [[World War II]], his family settled in New York, where he first met a group of avant-garde artists and musicians centered around John Cage and La Monte Young. After opening a short-lived art gallery on [[Madison Avenue]], which showed work by Higgins, Yoko Ono, [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Ray Johnson]], Flynt and Young, Maciunas moved to [[Wiesbaden]], West Germany, having taken a job as a graphic designer with the [[US Air Force]] in late 1961&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p22&lt;/ref&gt; after the gallery had gone bust. Maciunas first publicly coined the term ''Fluxus'' (meaning 'to flow') in a 'brochure prospectus' that he distributed to the audience at a festival he had organized, called ''Aprés Cage; Kleinen Sommerfest'' (After Cage; a Small Summer Festival), in [[Wuppertal]], West Germany, 9 June 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p91&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciunas was an avid art historian, and initially referred to fluxus as 'neo-dadaism' or 'renewed dadaism'.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, ''Fluxus Prospectus'', quoted in ''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p23&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a number of letters to [[Raoul Hausmann]], an original [[dada]]ist, outlining his ideas. Hausmann discouraged the use of the term;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I note with much pleasure what you said about German neodadaists—but I think even the Americans should not use the term "neodadaism" because neo means nothing and -ism is old-fashioned. Why not simply "Fluxus"? It seems to me much better, because it's new, and dada is historic.&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Hausmann, quoted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams andNoel, p40. Letter dated 4 November 1962, according to The Dream of Fluxus, n.47, p65&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As part of the festival, Maciunas wrote a lecture, entitled 'Neo-Dada in the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;The lecture was actually given, in German, by Artus C Caspari&lt;/ref&gt; After an attempt to define 'Concretist Neo-Dada' art, he explained that Fluxus was opposed to the exclusion of the everyday from art. Using 'anti-art and artistic banalities', Fluxus would fight the 'traditional artificialities of art'.&lt;ref name=fluxus62&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, Kellein, p62&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture ended with the declaration;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anti-art is life, is nature, is true reality—it is one and all.&lt;ref name=fluxus62/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===European festivals and the Fluxkits===
[[File:PianoActivities.jpg|280px|left|thumb|''Piano Activities'', by Philip Corner, as performed in Wiesbaden, 1962, by (l-r) Emmett Williams, Wolf Vostell, Nam June Paik, Dick Higgins, Benjamin Patterson and George Maciunas]]
In 1962, Maciunas, Higgins and Knowles, traveled to Europe to promote the planned Fluxus publication with concerts of 
antique musical instruments.  With the help of a group of artists including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Wolf Vostell]], Maciunas eventually organised a series of ''Fluxfests'' across Western Europe. Starting with 14 concerts between 1 and 23 September 1962, at [[Wiesbaden]], these ''Fluxfests'' presented work by musicians such as John Cage, [[Ligeti]], [[Penderecki]], [[Terry Riley]] and [[Brion Gysin]] alongside [[Performance art|performance]] pieces written by Higgins, Knowles, George Brecht and [[Nam June Paik]], Benjamin Patterson, [[Robert Filliou]], and [[Emmett Williams]], amongst many others. One performance in particular, ''Piano Activities'' by [[Philip Corner]], became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes.

The score—which asks for any number of performers to, among other things, "play", "pluck or tap", "scratch or rub", "drop objects" on, "act on strings with", "strike soundboard, pins, lid or drag various kinds of objects across them" and "act in any way on underside of piano"&lt;ref&gt;[http://marcusboon.com/node/23 Marcus Boon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102022741/http://marcusboon.com/node/23 |date=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—resulted in the total destruction of a piano when performed by Maciunas, Higgins and others at Wiesbaden. The performance was considered scandalous enough to be shown on German television four times, with the introduction "The lunatics have escaped!"&lt;ref&gt;"Die Irren Sind Los" quoted in The Dream Of Fluxus, Kellein, p65.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end we did Corner's ''Piano Activities'' not according to his instructions since we systematically destroyed a piano which I bought for $5 and had to have it all cut up to throw it away, otherwise we would have had to pay movers, a very practical composition, but German sentiments about this "instrument of Chopin" were hurt and they made a row about it...&lt;ref&gt;George Maciunas, letter to La Monte Young, 1962, quoted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams and Noël, p53&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the same time, Maciunas used his connections at work to start printing cheap mass-produced books and multiples by some of the artists that were involved in the performances. The first three to be printed were ''Composition 1961'' by La Monte Young [http://archives.carre.pagesperso-orange.fr/Young%20La%20Monte.html see], ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' edited by Young and Mac Low and ''[[Water Yam (artist's book)|Water Yam]]'', by George Brecht. ''Water Yam'', a series of event scores printed on small sheets of card and collected together in a cardboard box, was the first in a series of artworks that Maciunas printed that became known as ''Fluxkits''. Cheap, mass-produced and easily distributed, ''Fluxkits'' were originally intended to form an ever-expanding library of modern [[performance art]]. ''Water Yam'' was published in an edition of 1000 and originally cost $4.&lt;ref&gt;Price listed in the Fluxus Preview Review, July 1963, quoted in the ''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1964, almost a year later, Maciunas still had 996 copies unsold.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, letter to Emmett Williams, quoted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams and Noel, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciunas' original plan had been to design, edit and pay for each edition himself, in exchange for the copyright to be held by the collective.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, Kellein, p69&lt;/ref&gt; Profits were to be split 80/20 at first, in favor of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;This was to go down to 50/50 within a year; Dream of Fluxus, Kellein, p88&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the composers already had publishing deals, Fluxus quickly moved away from music toward performance and visual art. John Cage, for instance, never published work under the Fluxus moniker due to his contract with the music publishers [[Edition Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas sent out letters to 20 international artists between late 62 and early 63, demanding each artist relinquish any publishing rights and have Fluxus as sole and exclusive publisher. Maciunas likened his agreement to Cage's arrangement with Peters Editions. Only two artists—Henry Flynt and Thomas Schmitt signed up. Cage was not asked, due at least on Maciunas' side, to the aforesaid contract with editions peters. Dream of Fluxus, Thomas Kellein, Thames And Hudson, p69-71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maciunas seemed to have a fantastic ability to get things done.... if you had things to be printed he could get them printed. It's pretty hard in East Brunswick to get good offset printing. It's not impossible, but it's not so easy, and since I'm very lazy it was a relief to find somebody who could take the burden off my hands. So there was this guy Maciunas, a Lithuanian or Bulgarian, or somehow a refugee or whatever—beautifully dressed—"astonishing looking" would be a better adjective. He was somehow able to carry the whole thing off, without my having to go 57 miles to find a printer.&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht, "An Interview with Robin Page for [[Carla Liss]]", In ''Art And Artists'', London October 1972, p30-31 reprinted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams and Noel, Thames And Hudson, p109-10 {{ISBN|0-500-97461-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since Maciunas was [[colorblind]], Fluxus multiples were almost always black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/24/arts/art-in-review-069620.html Art in Review, NY TImes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York and the FluxShops===
[[File:DeRidder'sFluxMailOrder.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Willem de Ridder's Mail Order FluxShop, Amsterdam, with Dorothea Meijer, winter 1964–65. Photo by Willem de Ridder]]
After his contract with the US Air Force was terminated due to ill health, Maciunas was forced to return to the US on 3 September 1963.&lt;ref&gt;''Mr. Fluxus'', Willims and Noel, p340&lt;/ref&gt; Once back in New York, he set about organizing a series of street concerts and opened a new shop, the 'Fluxhall', on [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].
12 concerts, 'away from the beaten track of the New York art scene&lt;ref name=fluxus93&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p93&lt;/ref&gt;' took place on Canal Street, 11 April to 23 May 1964. With photographs taken by Maciunas himself, pieces by [[Ben Vautier]], [[Alison Knowles]] and Takehisha Kosugi were performed in the street for free, although in practice there was 'no audience to speak of'&lt;ref name=fluxus93/&gt; anyway. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The people in Fluxus had understood, as Brecht explained, that "concert halls, theaters, and art galleries" were "mummifying." Instead, these artists found themselves "preferring streets, homes, and railway stations...." Maciunas recognized a radical political potential in all this forthrightly anti-institutional production, which was an important source for his own deep commitment to it. Deploying his expertise as a professional graphic designer, Maciunas played an important role in projecting upon Fluxus whatever coherence it would later seem to have had.'&lt;ref&gt;Julia Robinson quoting George Brecht in George Brecht, Events; A Heterospective, Walther Konig, p118.&lt;!--What the heck is this, a book, an exhibition catalog, a journal or newspaper article?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Along with the New York shop, Maciunas built up a distribution network for the new art across Europe and later outlets in California and Japan. Gallery and mail order outlets were established in Amsterdam, Villefranche-Sur-Mer, Milan and London, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p109&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965, the first anthology ''[[Fluxus 1]]'' was available, consisting of manila envelopes bolted together containing work by numerous artists who would later become famous including LaMonte Young, [[Christo]] and Yoko Ono. Other pieces available included packs of altered playing cards by George Brecht, sensory boxes by [[Ay-O]], a regular newsletter with contributions by artists and musicians such as [[Ray Johnson]] and John Cale, and tin cans filled with poems, songs and recipes about beans by [[Alison Knowles]] ([http://www.aknowles.com/beanrolls.html see]). A videotape of George and Billy Maciunas' wedding was produced by [[Dimitri Devyatkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVDB1oy1O8s Marriage of George and Billy Maciunas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockhausen's ''Originale''===
[[File:FluxusTraitor.jpg|280px|thumb|''Traitor, you left Fluxus!'', a postcard sent by George Maciunas to Nam June Paik, c late 1964, after the latter's involvement with Stockhausen's ''Originale'']]
After returning to New York, Maciunas became reacquainted with Henry Flynt,&lt;ref&gt;At the time, a member of the leftist set WWP, Mr Fluxus, p108&lt;/ref&gt; who encouraged members of Fluxus to take a more overtly political stance. One of the results of these discussions was to set up a picket line at the American premiere of ''[[Originale]]'', a recent work by the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], 8 September 1964.&lt;ref name=":Bloch"&gt;[http://www.panmodern.com/OnStockhausen-sOriginale.pdf Bloch, Mark. "On Originale.", from Bloch, Mark, editor]. "Robert Delford Brown: Meat, Maps and Militant Metaphysics," Cameron Museum of Art, Wilmington, N.C., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Stockhausen was deemed a 'Cultural Imperialist' by Maciunas and Flynt, while other members vehemently disagreed. The result was members of Fluxus, such as Nam June Paik and Jackson Mac Low, crossing a picket line made up of other members, including Ben Vautier and [[Takako Saito]]&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p98&lt;/ref&gt; who handed out leaflets denouncing Stockhausen as "a characteristic European-North American ruling-class Artist".&lt;ref&gt;Picket Stockhausen Concert! Flynt and Maciunas flyer, 1964. Reproduced{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--something got chopped off here.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Higgins participated in the picket, and then coolly joined the other performers inside;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/film/stockhausen_originale.html A film of the event, UbuWeb]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maciunas and his friend Henry Flynt tried to get the Fluxus people to march around outside the circus with white cards that said Originale was bad. And they tried to say that the Fluxus people who were in the circus weren't Fluxus any more. That was silly, because it made a split. I thought it was funny, and so first I walked around with Maciunas and with Henry with a card, then I went inside and joined the circus; so both groups got angry with me. Oh well. Some people say that Fluxus died that day—I once thought so myself—but it turned out I was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Higgins, "[http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/dhiggins-childshistory.html A Child's History of Fluxus]", 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The event, arranged by [[Charlotte Moorman]] as part of her ''2nd Annual New York Avant Garde Festival'', would cement animosities between Maciunas and her,&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of fluxus, note 104, p98&lt;/ref&gt; with Maciunas frequently demanding that artists associated with Fluxus have nothing to do with the annual festival, and would often expel artists who ignored his demands. This hostility continued throughout Maciunas' life—much to Moorman's bemusement—despite her continued championing of Fluxus art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiEJdOlgcDE Charlotte Moorman and Nam June Paik "The Originale"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History, 1965–78==

===Perceived insurgencies and the Asiatic influence===
[[File:CutPieceOno.jpeg|thumb|''Cut Piece'', a performance piece by Yoko Ono in which the audience is invited to cut off her clothing. This version was staged at Carnegie Recital Hall, New York, 21 March 1965. Still taken from a film by [[Albert and David Maysles]]]]
The picketing of ''Originale'' marked the high point of Maciunas' [[agitprop]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/fluxone.htm Stewart Home, The Assault on Culture, The origins of Fluxus and the movement in its 'heroic' period, Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; an approach that estranged many of Fluxus' early proponents; Jackson Mac Low had resigned immediately after hearing 'antisocial' plans laid in April 1963, such as breaking down trucks under the Hudson River.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Mac Low quoted in Mr Fluxus, p94-95&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht threatened to quit on the same issue, and then left New York in the spring of 1965. Despite his continued allegiance to Fluxus ideals, Dick Higgins fell out with Maciunas around the same time, ostensibly over his setting up the [[Something Else Press]] which printed many texts by key Fluxus-related personalities and other members of the avant garde. Charlotte Moorman continued to present her annual Avant Garde Festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such perceived insurrections in the coherence of Maciunas' leadership of Fluxus provided an opening for Fluxus to become increasingly influenced by Japanese members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p101&lt;/ref&gt; Since returning to Japan in 1961, Yoko Ono had been recommending colleagues look Maciunas up if they moved to New York; by the time she had returned, in early 1965, [[Genpei Akasegawa|Hi Red Center]], [[Shigeko Kubota]], Takako Saito, [[Mieko Shiomi (composer)|Mieko Shiomi]] and [[Ay-O]] had all started to make work for Fluxus, often of a contemplative nature.&lt;ref&gt;Dream of Fluxus, p102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blurring boundaries===
As Fluxus gradually became more famous, Maciunas' ambitions for the sale of cheap multiples grew. The second flux-anthology, the ''Fluxkit'' (late 1964),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/fluxus_editions/works/fluxkit/ Fluxkit, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; collected together early 3D work made by the collective in a businessman's case, an idea borrowed directly from Duchamp's ''Boite en Valise''&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoMA, Interactive"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1999/muse/artist_pages/duchamp_boite.html MoMA, Interactive exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, plans for a new anthology, ''Fluxus 2'', were in full swing to contain Flux films by [[John Cale]] and Yoko Ono (with hand held projectors provided), disrupted matchboxes and postcards by Ben Vautier, plastic food by [[Claes Oldenburg]], FluxMedicine by [[Shigeko Kubota]],&lt;ref&gt;containing empty pill packages&lt;/ref&gt; and artworks made of rocks, ink stamps, outdated travel tickets, undoable puzzles and a machine to facilitate humming.&lt;ref&gt;fluxus codex, Hendricks, p124&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciunas' belief in the collective extended to authorship; a number of pieces from this period were anonymous, mis-attributed, or have had their authorship since questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Yoko Ono, for instance, has claimed authorship of Mieko Shiomi's Disappearing Music For Face (aka Smile) for instance.&lt;/ref&gt; As a further complication, Maciunas was in the habit of dramatically changing ideas submitted by various artists before he put the works into production.
''Solid Plastic in Plastic Box'', credited to [[Per Kirkeby]] 1967, for instance, had originally been realised by Kirkeby as a metal box, inscribed 'This Box Contains Wood'. When opened, the box would be found to contain sawdust. By the time the multiple had been manufactured by Maciunas, it was a block of solid plastic contained in a plastic box of the same color.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Interactive" /&gt; Conversely, Maciunas assigned ''Degree Face Clock'', in which a clock face is measured out in 360°, to Kirkeby despite being an idea by [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]];&lt;ref&gt;fluxus codex p290&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some years ago, when I spoke with Robert Watts about ''Degree Face Clock'' and ''Compass Face Clock'', he had recalled thinking up the idea himself and was surprised that George Maciunas advertised them as Per Kirkeby's. Watts shrugged and said that was the way George worked. There would be ideas in the air and Maciunas would assign the piece to one artist or another.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Hendricks, quoted in fluxus codex, p291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other tactics from this time included Maciunas buying large amounts of plastic boxes wholesale, and handing them out to artists with the simple request to turn them into Fluxkits, and the use of the rapidly growing international network of artists to contribute items needed to complete works. Robert Watts' ''Fluxatlas'', 1973, for instance, contains small rocks sent by members of the group from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;'All contributors will receive a box in return...' Codex, p542&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his numerous original compositions which have joined the collective's catalog of works, [[Larry Miller (artist)|Larry Miller]], associated with the group since 1969, has also been active as an interpreter of the "classic" scores and responsible for bringing the group's works to a wider public, blurring the lines between artist, producer and researcher. Besides Miller’s own artistic work, he has also organized, reconstructed and performed at numerous Fluxus events and assembled an extensive collection of material on the history of Fluxus.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus East: Fluxus Networks in Central Eastern Europe. http://www.fluxus-east.eu/?item=exhib&amp;lang=en&amp;sub=miller&lt;/ref&gt; Through Miller, Fluxus attracted media coverage such as the worldwide CNN coverage of ''Off Limits'' exhibit at Newark Museum, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Marter, Joan M. and Anderson, Simon. Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-garde, 1957–1963. Newark Museum. Newark, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Other Miller activities as organizer, performer and presenter within the Fluxus milieu include ''Performance in Fluxus Continue 1963–2003'' at Musee d'Art et d'Art Contemporain in Nice; ''Fluxus a la Carte'' in Amsterdam; and ''Centraal Fluxus Festival'' at Centraal Museum, Utrecht, Netherlands. In 2004, for Geoff Hendricks' ''Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University 1958–1972'', Miller reprised and updated the track and field events of the Flux Olympics, first presented in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Geoffrey, editor. Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia, and Rutgers. Mead Art Museum, Amherst, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Do-it Yourself Fluxus'' at AI – Art Interactive – in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Miller worked as the curatorial consultant for an exhibit of works that allowed viewers hands-on experience including the reconstruction of several sections of the historic ''Flux Labyrinth'', a massive and intricate maze that Miller originally constructed with George Maciunas at Akademie Der Kunst, Berlin in 1976 and which included sections by several of the Fluxus artists. Miller created a new version of the ''Flux Labyrinth'' at the ''In the Spirit of Fluxus'' exhibit at the Walker Art Center in 1994, where Griel Marcus said, "Miller was... fine tuning the monster."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Griel. Real Life Rock: The Complete Top Ten Columns, 1986–2014. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism ===
Fluxus women artists were founding members and contributed works in varying media and with differing content. Some made experimental and performative work having to do with the female body that created a powerful female presence, which existed within Fluxus from the group's beginning. This is illustrated by works such as [[Carolee Schneemann|Carolee Schneemann's]] "Interior Scroll", Yoko Ono's "Cut Piece", and [[Shigeko Kubota]]'s "Vagina Painting".  Women working within Fluxus were often simultaneously critiquing their position within a male dominated society while also exposing the inequalities within an art collective that claimed to be open and diverse.  George Maciunas, in his rejection of Schneeman as a member of Fluxus, called her "guilty of Baroque tendencies, overt sexuality, and theatrical excess".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1146571 |title = Fluxus Feminus|last = O'Dell|first = Kathy|authorlink=Kathy O'Dell|date = Spring 1997|journal = TDR|doi = 10.2307/1146571|pmid =|volume=41|pages=43–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Interior Scroll" was a response to Schneemann's experience as a filmmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, when male filmmakers claimed that women should restrict themselves to dance.

===Utopian communities===
A number of artists in the group were interested in setting up Flux communes, intending to 'bridge the gap between the artist community and the surrounding society'&lt;ref name="Danielle"&gt;[http://www.wordsinspace.net/urban-media-archaeology/2011-fall/2011/10/11/project-proposal-2/ The History of Artists and Art Production in SoHo, Danielle]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, La Cédille qui Sourit or ''The [[Cedilla]] That Smiles'',&lt;ref&gt;Harren, Natilee. "La cédille qui ne finit pas: Robert Filliou, George Brecht, and Fluxus in Villefranche." Getty Research Journal, No. 4 (2012), pp. 127–143.&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]], France, by [[Robert Filliou]] and George Brecht, 1965–1968. Intended as an 'International Centre of Permanent Creation', the shop sold Fluxkits and other small wares as well as housing a 'non-school', boasting the motto "A carefree exchange of information and experience. No students, no teachers. Perfect licence, at times to listen at times to talk."&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/lot-ventes-aux-encheres-drouot.jsp?id=1150365 Fluxkit documenting the project]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Maciunas, Watts and others took advantage of new legislation drafted to regenerate the area of Manhattan known as 'Hell's Hundred Acres', soon to become rebranded as [[SoHo]], allowing artists to buy live/work spaces in an area that had been blighted due to a proposed 18-lane expressway along [[Broome Street]].&lt;ref name="Danielle" /&gt; Led by Maciunas, plans were laid to start a series of real-estate developments in the area, designed to create an artists' community within a few streets of the FluxShop on Canal Street. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Maciunas wanted to establish collective workshops, food-buying cooperatives and theaters to link the strengths of various media together and bridge the gap between the artist community and the surrounding society'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first warehouse, intended to house Maciunas, Watts, Christo &amp; Jeanne-Claude, Jonas Mekas, LaMonte Young &amp; others, was located on Greene Street. Likening these communities to the soviet [[Kolkhoz]]s, Maciunas didn't hesitate to adopt the title 'Chairman of Bldg. Co-Op'&lt;ref&gt;Dream of Fluxus, p131&lt;/ref&gt; without first registering an office or becoming a member of the New York State Association of Realtors.&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p132&lt;/ref&gt; FluxHousing Co-Operatives continued to redevelop the area over the next decade, and were widened to include plans to set up a ''FluxIsland''- a suitable island was located near Antigua, but the money to buy and develop it remained unforthcoming- and finally a performance arts centre called the ''FluxFarm'' established in [[New Marlborough]], Massachusetts. The plans were continually dogged by financial problems, constant run-ins with the New York authorities, and eventually resulted, on 8 November 1975, in Maciunas being severely beaten by thugs sent by an unpaid electrical contractor.&lt;ref&gt;Dream of Fluxus, p147&lt;/ref&gt;

=== End ===
It is arguably said that Fluxus came to an end when its founder and leader George Maciunas died in 1978 from complications due to pancreatic cancer. Maciunas' funeral was held in typical Fluxus style where they dubbed the funeral "Fluxfeast and Wake", ate foods that were only black, white, or purple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theartstory.org/movement-fluxus.htm|title = Fluxus Movement, Artists and Major Works|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = The Art Story|publisher = |last = DiTolla|first = Racy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas left behind his thoughts on Fluxus in a series of important video conversations called ''Interview With George Maciunas'' with Fluxus artist [[Larry Miller (artist)|Larry Miller]], which has been screened internationally and translated into numerous languages.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Larry Miller, 1978, referenced in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p114&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 30 years, Miller has shot and collected Fluxus related materials including tapes on Joe Jones, Carolee Schneemann, Ben Vautier, Dick Higgins, and Alison Knowles, in addition to the 1978 Maciunas interview.

==Since 1978==
Maciunas moved to the Berkshire Mountains in Western Massachusetts in the late 1970s. Two decades earlier, after collecting paintings, the Boston art collector Jean Brown, and her late husband Leonard Brown, began to shift their focus to Dadaist and Surrealist art, manifestoes and periodicals.  In 1971, after Mr. Brown's death, Mrs. Brown moved to [[Tyringham, Massachusetts|Tyringham]], and expanded into areas adjacent to Fluxus, including artists' books, concrete poetry, happenings, mail art and performance art. Maciunas helped turn her home, originally a Shaker seed house, into an important center for both Fluxus artists and scholars, with Mrs. Brown alternately cooking meals and showing guests her collection. Activities centered on a large archive room on the second floor built by Maciunas, who settled in nearby [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts|Great Barrington]], where it was discovered that Maciunas developed cancer of the pancreas and liver in 1977.

Three months before his death, he married his friend and companion, the poet Billie Hutching. After a legal wedding in Lee, Massachusetts, the couple performed a "Fluxwedding" in a friend's loft in SoHo, 25 February 1978. The bride and groom traded clothing.&lt;ref&gt;According to Hutching, quoted in Mr. Fluxus, p280. Maciunas was a transvestite and masochist.&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas died on 9 May 1978 in a hospital in Boston.

After the death of George Maciunas a rift opened in Fluxus between a few collectors and curators who placed Fluxus as an art movement in a specific time frame (1962 to 1978), and the artists themselves, many of whom continued to see Fluxus as a living entity held together by its core values and world view. Different theorists and historians adopted each of these views. Fluxus is therefore referred to variously in the past or the present tense. While the definition of Fluxus was always a subject of controversy, the question is now significantly more complex due to the fact that many of the original artists who were still living when Maciunas died are now dead themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/arts/design/fluxus-and-the-essential-questions-of-life-review.html Ken Johnson, ''Liberating Viewers, and the World, With Silliness'', NY Times, exhibition Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/exhibits/fluxus/FluxNYU.html ''Fluxus at NYU'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the unique control that curator Jon Hendricks holds over a major historical Fluxus collection (the Gilbert and Lila Silverman collection) has enabled him to influence, through the numerous books and catalogues subsidized by the collection, the view that Fluxus died with Maciunas. Hendricks argues that Fluxus was a historical movement that occurred at a particular time, asserting that such central Fluxus artists as Dick Higgins and Nam June Paik could no longer label themselves as active Fluxus artists after 1978, and that contemporary artists influenced by Fluxus cannot lay claim to be Fluxus artists.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon. 1988. Fluxus codex. Detroit, Mich: Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection in association with H.N. Abrams, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/atca/subjugated/one_2.htm Robert Pincus-Witten on Fluxus, and Jon Hendricks's Codex]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of Modern Art]] makes the same claim dating the movement to the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1033 MoMA exhibitions, October 2009 – August 2010] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the influence of Fluxus continues today in [[multi-media]] [[digital art]] performances.
In September, 2011 [[Other Minds (organization)|Other Minds]] presented a performance at the SOMArts building in San Francisco to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fluxus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/other-minds/always-in-flux-mostly-in-fun] Retrieved 1 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance was curated by [[Adam Fong]] who was also one of the performers along with [[Yoshi Wada]], [[Alison Knowles]], [[Hannah Higgins]], [[Luciano Chessa]] and Adam Overton.

Others, including [[Hannah Higgins]], daughter of fluxus artists [[Alison Knowles]] and [[Dick Higgins]], assert that although Maciunas was a key participant, there were many more, including Fluxus co-founder Higgins, who continued to work within Fluxus after the death of Maciunas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mouthtomouthmag.com/higgins.html Interview with Hannah Higgins]&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the Internet in the 1990s enabled a vibrant post-Fluxus community to emerge online. After some of the original Fluxus artists from the 1960s and 1970s including Higgins, created online communities such as the Fluxlist, following their departure, younger artists, writers, musicians, and performers have attempted to continue their work in [[cyberspace]]. Many of the original Fluxus artists still working enjoy homages by younger Fluxus-influenced artists who stage events to commemorate Fluxus, but discourage the use of the "Fluxus" label by younger artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/boat-book-alison-knowles/3113 Bloch, Mark.

In 2018 the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] in its ''Fluxus Festival'' presented a fluxus performance incorporating [[John Cage|John Cage's]] "Europeras 1 and 2" directed by [[Yuval Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Happens When Fluxus Enters the Concert Hall? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/arts/music/la-philharmonic-fluxus-festival.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=17 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
An immediate predecessor of Fluxus, according to Maciunas, was the Gutai group which promoted art as an anti-academic, psychophysical experience, an "art of matter as it is" as explained by Shiraga Kazuo in 1956. Gutai became connected with a sort of artistic mass-production, anticipating Fluxus's trademark, i.e., ambiguity between the cultivated and the trivial, between high and low. Indeed, avant-garde art in Japan tended toward informal rather than conceptual elements, radically opposing the extreme formality and symbolism found in Japanese art.

In the 1950s New York music scene there could be discerned many issues related to the post-war disenchantment experienced by many throughout the developed world. Such disillusionment in itself presented a case for commitment to Buddhism and Zen in everyday matters such as mental attitude, meditation, and approach to food and body care. It was also felt, however, that there was a general need for a more radical artistic sensibility. The themes of decay and of the inadequacy of the idea of modernity in artistic fields were adopted, partly from Duchamp and Dada and partly from consciousness of the uneasiness of living in contemporary society.

It is said that Fluxus challenged notions of representation, offering instead simple presentation. This, in fact, corresponds to a major difference between Western and Japanese art. Another important Fluxus characteristic was the elimination of perceived boundaries between art and life, a very prominent trend in post war art. This was exemplified by the work and writings of Josheph Bueys who stated, "every man is an artist." Fluxus's approach was an everyday, "economic" one as seen in the production of small objects made of paper and plastic. Again, this strongly corresponds with some of the fundamental characteristics of Japanese culture, i.e., the high artistic value of everyday acts and objects and the aesthetic appreciation of frugality. This also links with Japanese art, and the concept of shibumi, which may involve incompleteness, and supports the appreciation of bare objects, emphasizing subtlety rather than overtness. The renowned Japanese aesthetics scholar Onishi Yoshinori called the essence of Japanese art pantonomic because of the consciousness of no distinction between nature, art and life. Art is the way to approach life and nature/reality corresponding to actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25164637|title = Toshi Ichiyanagi, Japanese Composer and "Fluxus"|last = Galliano|first = Luciana|date = Summer 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid =|volume=44|pages=250–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluxus art==
Fluxus encouraged a "[[do-it-yourself]]" aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. As Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]] wrote, however, Fluxus differed from Dada in its richer set of aspirations, and the positive social and communitarian aspirations of Fluxus far outweighed the anti-art tendency that also marked the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbirthday.blogspot.com/2007/12/who-was-robert-filliou.html Robert Filliou on Fluxus and art] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its early associates were [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Davi Det Hompson]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Joseph Byrd]], [[Al Hansen]] and Yoko Ono who explored media ranging from performance art to poetry to experimental music to film. Taking the stance of opposition to the ideas of tradition and professionalism in the arts of their time, the Fluxus group shifted the emphasis from what an artist makes to the artist's personality, actions, and opinions. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s (their most active period) they staged "action" events, engaged in politics and public speaking, and produced sculptural works featuring unconventional materials. Their radically untraditional works included, for example, the [[video art]] of Nam June Paik and [[Charlotte Moorman]] and the performance art of Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell. During the early years of Fluxus, the often playful style of the Fluxus artists resulted in them being considered by some to be little more than a group of [[prank]]sters. Fluxus has also been compared to [[Dada]] and aspects of [[Pop Art]] and is seen as the starting point of [[mail art]] and [[no wave]] artists. Artists from succeeding generations such as [[Mark Bloch]] do not try to characterize themselves as Fluxus but create spinoffs such as Fluxpan or Jung Fluxus as a way of continuing some of the Fluxus ideas in a 21st-century, post-[[mail art]] context.

In terms of an artistic approach, Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues. Outsourcing part of the creative process to commercial fabricators was not usually part of Fluxus practice. Maciunas personally hand-assembled many of the Fluxus multiples and editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/kfriedman-fourtyyears.html Ken Friedman, ''40 Years of Fluxus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211142656/http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/kfriedman-fourtyyears.html |date=11 February 2010 }} Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While Maciunas assembled many objects by hand, he designed and intended them for mass production.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maciunas on Fluxus"&gt;[http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas--.html Maciunas on Fluxus] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Where multiple publishers produced signed, numbered objects in limited editions intended for sale at high prices, Maciunas produced open editions at low prices.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maciunas on Fluxus"/&gt; Several other Fluxus publishers produced different kinds of Fluxus editions. The best known of these was the [[Something Else Press]], established by Dick Higgins, probably the largest and most extensive Fluxus publisher, producing books in editions that ran from 1,500 copies to as many as 5,000 copies, all available at standard bookstore prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/something-else-press.html Fluxus and Happening, the Something Else Press] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/historical/gb/ UBUWeb] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins created the term "[[intermedia]]" in a 1966 essay.

The art forms most closely associated with Fluxus are event scores and Fluxus boxes. Fluxus boxes (sometimes called Fluxkits or Fluxboxes) originated with George Maciunas who would gather collections of printed cards, games, and ideas, organizing them in small plastic or wooden boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Kellein, Hendriks, and Hendricks 1995{{Page needed|date=January 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event score===
An event score, such as [[George Brecht]]'s "Drip Music", is essentially a [[performance art]] script that is usually only a few lines long and consists of descriptions of actions to be performed rather than dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotz |first=Liz |date=Spring 2001 |title=Post-Cagean aesthetics and the 'event' score |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=95 |pages=55–89 |jstor=779200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dezeuze |first=Anna |date=January 2002 |title=Origins of the Fluxus score: from indeterminacy to the 'do-it-yourself' artwork |journal=[[Performance Research]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=78–94 |doi=10.1080/13528165.2002.10871876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Julia |date=Winter 2009 |title=Abstraction to model: George Brecht's events and the conceptual turn in art of the 1960s |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |volume=127 |pages=77–108 |doi=10.1162/octo.2009.127.1.77 |jstor=40368554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus artists differentiate event scores from "[[happening]]s". Whereas happenings were sometimes complicated, lengthy performances meant to blur the lines between performer and audience, performance and reality, event performances were usually brief and simple. The event performances sought to elevate the banal, to be mindful of the mundane, and to frustrate the [[high culture]] of academic and market-driven music and art.

The idea of the event began in [[Henry Cowell]]'s philosophy of music.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Cowell, a teacher to John Cage and later to Dick Higgins, coined the term that Higgins and others later applied to short, terse descriptions of performable work. The term "score" is used in exactly the sense that one uses the term to describe a music score: a series of notes that allow anyone to perform the work, an idea linked both to what [[Nam June Paik]] labeled the "do it yourself" approach and to what [[Ken Friedman]] termed "musicality." While much is made of the do it yourself approach to art, it is vital to recognize that this idea emerges in music, and such important Fluxus artists as Paik, Higgins, or Corner began as composers, bringing to art the idea that each person can create the work by "doing it." This is what Friedman meant by musicality, extending the idea more radically to conclude that anyone can create work of any kind from a score, acknowledging the composer as the originator of the work while realizing the work freely and even interpreting it in far different ways from those the original composer might have done.

Other creative forms that have been adopted by Fluxus practitioners include [[collage]], [[sound art]], music, video, and poetry—especially [[visual poetry]] and [[concrete poetry]].

===Use of shock===
[[Nam June Paik]] and his peers in the Fluxus art movement thoroughly understood the impact and importance of shock on the viewer. Fluxus artists believed that shock not only makes the viewer question their own reasoning, but is a means to awaken the viewer, "...from a perceptive lethargy furthered by habit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64_MywUrftoC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;ots=zG1AOZCdU4&amp;dq=.from%20a%20perceptive%20lethargy%20furthered%20by%20habit%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=.from%20a%20perceptive%20lethargy%20furthered%20by%20habit%22&amp;f=false|title=Shock and the Senseless in Dada and Fluxus|last=Brill|first=Dorothée|date=2010|publisher=UPNE|year=|isbn=9781584659174|location=|pages=131|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik himself described the shock factor in his Fluxus work: "People who come to my concerts or see my objects need to be transferred into another state of consciousness. They have to be high. And in order to put them into this state of highness, a little shock is required... Anyone who came to my exhibition saw the head and was high."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xv7XCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=People%20who%20come%20to%20my%20concerts%20or%20see%20my%20objects%20paik&amp;pg=PA294#v=onepage&amp;q=People%20who%20come%20to%20my%20concerts%20or%20see%20my%20objects%20paik&amp;f=false|title=Into the Maelstrom: Music, Improvisation and the Dream of Freedom: Before 1970|last=Toop|first=David|date=2016-05-05|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9781441102775|location=|pages=294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik's "head" was that of a real cow displayed at the entrance to his exhibition, Exposition of Music—Electronic Television, located in the Galerie Parnass, Wuppertal, Germany in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Shock and the Senseless in Dada and Fluxus|last = Brill|first = Dorothee|publisher = University Press of New England Hanover and London|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58465-917-4|location = |pages = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic philosophies==
Fluxus is similar in spirit to the earlier art movement of [[Dada]], emphasizing the concept of [[anti-art]] and taking jabs at the seriousness of modern art.&lt;ref name="rush24"&gt;Rush 2005, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to highlight their perceived connections between everyday objects and art, similarly to Duchamp in pieces such as ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]''.&lt;ref name="rush24"/&gt; Fluxus art was often presented in "events", which Fluxus member [[George Brecht]] defined as "the smallest unit of a situation."&lt;ref name="rush24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html On George Brecht, Robert Filliou and others] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The events consisted of a minimal instruction, opening the events to accidents and other unintended effects.&lt;ref name="rush25"&gt;Rush 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Also contributing to the randomness of events was the integration of audience members into the performances, realizing Duchamp's notion of the viewer completing the art work.&lt;ref name="rush25"/&gt;

The Fluxus artistic philosophy has been defined as a synthesis of four key factors that define the majority of Fluxus work:
# Fluxus is an attitude. It is not a movement or a style.&lt;ref name="smith1"&gt;Smith 1998,{{Page needed|date=January 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Fluxus is intermedia.&lt;ref name="higgins1"&gt;Higgins 1966,{{Page needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus creators like to see what happens when different media intersect. They use found and everyday objects, sounds, images, and texts to create new combinations of objects, sounds, images, and texts.
# Fluxus works are simple. The art is small, the texts are short, and the performances are brief.
# Fluxus is fun. Humor has always been an important element in Fluxus.

==Late criticism==
There is a complexity in adequately charting a unified history of Fluxus. In ''Fluxus: A brief History and Other Fictions'', Owen Smith concedes that, with the emergence of new material published about Fluxus and its expansion into the present, its history must remain open.&lt;ref name="O'neill"&gt;O'neill, Rosemary. ''In the Spirit of Fluxus''. Art Journal 53.1 (1994): 90–93. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance to being pigeonholed, and with the absence of a stable identity, Fluxus opened up to wide participation but also, from what would appear in history, closed off that possibility. Maciunas made frequent acts of excommunication between 1962 and 1978 which destabilized the collective.&lt;ref&gt;O'dell, Kathy. ''Fluxus Feminus''. Tdr (1988–) 41.1 (1997): 43–60. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristine Stiles argues in one of her essays that the essence of Fluxus is "performative", while recently she feels that essence has been "eroded or threatened". Fluxus instead moved towards favoring the objects of publication, Stiles asserts: "Care must be taken that Fluxus is not transformed historically from a radical process and presentational art into a tradition static and representational art."&lt;ref name="O'neill" /&gt; With no leadership, no identifiable guidelines, no real collective strategy, no homogeneity in terms of practices, Fluxus cannot be handled through traditional critical tools. Fluxus is an indicator of this confusion. Fluxus therefore is nearly always a discourse on the failure of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus, More Flux Than History''. Art-Press 391 (2012): 65–69. Art Source. Web. 6 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluxus artists==
Fluxus artists shared several characteristics including wit and "childlikeness", though they lacked a consistent identity as an artistic community.&lt;ref name="odell43"&gt;O'Dell, 1997, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; This vague self-identification allowed the group to include a variety of artists, including a large number of women. The possibility that Fluxus had more female members than any Western art group up to that point in history is particularly significant because Fluxus came on the heels of the white male-dominated [[abstract expressionism]] movement.&lt;ref name="odell43"/&gt; However, despite the designed open-endedness of Fluxus, Maciunas insisted on maintaining unity in the collective. Because of this, Maciunas was accused of expelling certain members for deviating from what he perceived as the goals of Fluxus.&lt;ref name="oren8"&gt;Oren 1993, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many artists, writers, and composers have been associated with Fluxus over the years, including:

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Freedom from Fear'' (painting)}}
[[File:"Freedom from Fear" - NARA - 513538.jpg|thumb|right|Norman Rockwell's ''Freedom from Fear'' was made into a poster during [[World War II]] to help motivate the civilian workforce.]]
'''''Freedom from Fear''''' is the last of the well-known ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' [[oil painting]]s produced by the [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]ist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The series was based on the four goals known as the [[Four Freedoms]], which were enunciated by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in his [[State of the Union Address]] on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' alongside an [[essay]] by a prominent thinker of the day, [[Stephen Vincent Benét]]. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while [[the Blitz]] rages across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in [[Great Britain]].

==Background==
''Freedom from Fear'' is the last of a series of four oil paintings entitled ''Four Freedoms'', painted by [[Norman Rockwell]]. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941; the speech itself is often called the Four Freedoms.&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=2008-04-11|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P.|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=2008-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the [[Atlantic Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Four+Freedoms%22+Atlantic+Charter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cHDXUsvlL8TisAT29YDABQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Four%20Freedoms%22%20Atlantic%20Charter&amp;f=false|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=ReadHowYouWant|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22Four+Freedoms%22+Atlantic+Charter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cHDXUsvlL8TisAT29YDABQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Four%20Freedoms%22%20Atlantic%20Charter&amp;f=false|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=[[Enigma Books]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"/&gt; The series of paintings was printed in ''The Saturday Evening Post'', accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''[[Freedom of Worship (painting)|Freedom of Worship]]'' (February 27), ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' (March 6) and ''Freedom from Fear'' (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.

The Blitz was a period of sustained [[strategic bombing]] of the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] for 57 consecutive nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/ff3_blitz.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Blitz |author=Bruce Robinson |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, more than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000&amp;nbsp; civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.&lt;ref name="Richards 1954, p. 217."&gt;Richards 1954, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting shows children resting safely in their beds, oblivious to the perils of this world, as their parents look on. Their mother tucks them in while their father holds a newspaper describing the horrors of the ongoing conflict. However, his attention is fully on his children and not on the alarming headlines. According to another view, the children are already asleep, and their parents are checking on them in their shared narrow bed before they themselves turn in for the night. The father appears as the "classic Rockwell onlooker" who serves as a viewer within the painting. Since he is holding his glasses, we assume that he has finished reading the ''[[Bennington Banner]]'' in his hand. The newspaper's headline reads "Bombings Ki&amp;nbsp;... Horror Hit", referencing the Blitz.&lt;ref name=S210&gt;Solomon, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; In the background is a lit hallway and a stairway leading to the first floor.&lt;ref name=S210/&gt;

According to Rockwell, who did not really care much for the work, the theme "was based on a rather smug idea. Painted during the bombing of London, it was supposed to say, 'Thank God we can put our children to bed with a feeling of security, knowing they will not be killed in the night.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwF-AWzsLIYC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=was+based+on+a+rather+smug+idea+rockwell+fear&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P70kHH_OVx&amp;sig=NuHu-Aw20dpRH03JewmpUYGYw8k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fgDDUp6fDpLesATps4DwDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=was%20based%20on%20a%20rather%20smug%20idea%20rockwell%20fear&amp;f=false|title=Norman Rockwell: The Underside of Innocence|author=Halpern, Richard|isbn=0-226-31440-5|pages=35-36|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The models for the work were Jim Martin, Mrs. Edgar Lawrence (Dorothy),&lt;ref name=MaM51&gt;Murray and McCabe&lt;/ref&gt; and two children of Rockwell's carpenter Walt Squires, all neighbors of Rockwell in [[Arlington, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; At Rockwell's request, the ''Bennington Banner'' produced a dummy edition to use for this work.&lt;ref name=MaM51/&gt; ''Freedom from Fear'' was published in the March 13, 1943 Issue of ''[[Saturday Evening Post|The Saturday Evening Post]]'' with a matching [[essay]] by [[Stephen Vincent Benét]] as part of the ''Four Freedoms'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Norman-Rockwells-Four-Freedoms-Inspire/dp/0936399422|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms: Images That Inspire a Nation|accessdate=2008-12-19|publisher=[[Amazon.com, Inc.]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the day it was published,  poet, novelist, and short-story writer Benét died.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{quote box|width=27em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote="The fourth is freedom from fear—which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor—anywhere in the world."|source=—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]]}}
This painting is the only one of the ''Four Freedoms'' which had been newly created prior to the commissioning of the series.  It had originally been created to depict the [[Battle of Britain]], but went unpublished by ''The Saturday Evening Post''.&lt;ref name=HaK102&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of the Treasury]] toured Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms'' paintings around the country after their publication in 1943. The ''Four Freedoms'' Tour raised over $130,000,000 in [[war bond]] sales.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms'' paintings were also reproduced as commemorative covers for [[postage stamp]]s sold during the War Bond shows.&lt;ref name=C313&gt;Claridge, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical review==
The scene has been described as overly intimate.  Both the arrangement of the furniture and the lighting contribute to this intimacy.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt;  [[Deborah Solomon]] describes the scene as having "some of the feeling of a French interior, with lovely haut-art touches.&lt;ref name=S210/&gt; Bruce Cole of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' stated "This reference to the war is so specific that it conveys little about fear or Roosevelt's plan for universal disarmament. Rockwell just could not get his hands around these airy abstractions."&lt;ref name=FSP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574406903628933162|title=Free Speech Personified: Norman Rockwell's inspiring and enduring painting|accessdate=2013-12-31|date=2009-10-10|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cole, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Idle Woman''''' (Spanish: '''''La Perezosa''''') is a [[genre painting]] completed in [[oil on canvas]] by Peruvian painter [[Daniel Hernández Morillo]] in 1 [[Lima]], Peru.

==Background and creation==
[[Daniel Hernández Morillo]], a Peruvian student of itinerant Italian painter [[Leonardo Barbieri]], left his homeland for [[Europe]] in 1874. Although Europe was in the midst of an artistic renewal, Morillo remained influenced by the [[academic art]] movement and French [[rococo painting]]. This is reflected in the pastel tones and the lightness of ''Idle Woman'', which was completed in 1906.&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perezosa (Idle Woman) |publisher=Google Cultural Institute |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/perezosa-idle-woman/jAEkd6RCpUcwuQ |accessdate=20 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oy9o5Cw1?url=http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/perezosa-idle-woman/jAEkd6RCpUcwuQ |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Folklore Commission''' (''Coimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) was set up in 1935 by the [[Irish Government]] to study and collect information on the [[folklore]] and [[tradition]]s of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Briody Mícheál. The Irish Folklore Commission: 1935-1970: History, Ideology, Methodology. Finnish Literature Society, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Irish Folklore Commission was founded and directed by [[Séamus Ó Duilearga|James Hamilton Delargy]], and concluded in 1971. Its roles were superseded by the Department of Irish Folklore in [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|University College, Dublin]] which has since served as a repository of the data collected, including the [[Irish Folklore Collection]].

During its time, the extensive collecting by the Commission caught the attention of many foreign scholars. With greater recognition, Delargy's vision for the Commission grew and around the 1950s many scholars were participating by contributing to collections and research. 

The Commission was also closely involved with locals, especially Irish-speaking districts. They distributed questionnaires and used media outlets to inform the general public of the Commission. The commission also helped make recordings of the last original native speakers of [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]] on the [[Isle of Man]] which was declining in the 1960s but is becoming more popular again.

== Collectors &amp; Collections of the Commission ==
With funding at a limit, the Commission was often limited to six to nine collectors. While graduate and university students could be of great help, the Commission was focused on Ireland's diverse populations. They went to fisherman, primary teachers, as well as professional collectors with the idea that "anyone who does go among the people must go among them as one of themselves and have no high-faluting nonsense about them". &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Irish Folklore Commission 1935-1970|last=Briody|first=Michael|publisher=Finnish Literature Society|year=2007|isbn=|location=Helsinski|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Irish Folklore Commission's collections are written interviews recorded between 1937 and 1939. Known collectively as ''The School's Collection'', these interviews were conducted by more than 50,000 school children from all primary schools in the South of Ireland. The 1,128 volumes include written accounts are sorted of daily life as well as regional folklore and stories as told by the interviewees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duchas.ie/en/info/cbe|title=National Folklore Collection (NFC) and its collections|last=|first=|date=|website=The Dúchas Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was instigated by Seán Ó Súilleabháin and Séamus Ó Duilearga, who publicized the scheme and explained to teachers what folklore was and how to properly collect it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They met with principal teachers, who then explained to the children how to collect the folklore for the collection. From September to June, each week the teacher would choose a heading and read out the questions, and the children would copy it down and question their family members and neighbors. In June 1939, Ó Duilearga stated in his annual report that there were collectively 375,660 pages of books from the schools.

The Irish Folklore Commission also made an effort to collect folk music and song. A gramophone was presented to Duilearga although they found that it was not adapted to their work of collecting dialects and music due to difficulties receiving parts from America or England. After this discovery, collectors had to get used to working with pen and paper to collect the music. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Dúchas Project ==

The Dúchas Project was founded by Falls Community Council in 1999, in order to collect experiences and stories of conflict. They imagined it as a tool for learning and conflict resolution in the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duchasarchive.com/history/|title=HISTORY|date=2014-10-16|work=Dúchas Oral History Archive|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dúchas Project is an online crowdsourcing effort to digitize and transcribe the National Folklore Collection in order to make it accessible and searchable worldwide. Based online, the project includes (1) both digitized and transcribed volumes of the collection; (2) a search feature to find people, topics, and places mentioned in the collections; (4) an index of Irish surnames, and (5) numerous historical photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duchas.ie/pdf/16.11.23-bileog-eolais-duchas-2016.pdf|title=Digitization of the National Folklore Collection Brochure|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2018|website=www.duchas.ie/en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcriptions of the collection are crowdsourced from around the world, and volunteers transcribe pages from the journal, allowing each page transcribed to become searchable from within the page itself and via internet search databases.

'''Kaimur Range''' (also spelt Kymore) is the eastern portion of the [[Vindhya Range]], about {{convert|483|km}} long, extending from around Katangi in [[Jabalpur district]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] to around [[Sasaram]] in [[Rohtas district]] of [[Bihar]]. It passes through the [[Rewa division|Rewa]] and [[Mirzapur division|Mirzapur]] divisions. The range never rises more than a few hundred metres above the surrounding plains and has a maximum width of around 80&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Vindhya+Range | title = Vindhya Range|work = |publisher = |accessdate = 2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kEj-2a7pmVMC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Kaimur+ranges&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oraFfPch5v&amp;sig=9lIY0_IIGmq45ANXDE5fvCMO8b0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=R4ziS4vlC4bGrAfCmMD2Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=Kaimur%20ranges&amp;f=false | title = Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1-5 By Britannica, Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani |work = p. 161  |publisher = Google books  |accessdate = 2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The range==
The southern part of the Vindhyan Range up to Katangi is called Bhander Range. Beyond this point the escarpment enclosing the land-locked valley of Sirampur and the hill range in continuation is called the Kaimur Range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ahO2LIyTBnUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Panna+Plateau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3vclpuHn3f&amp;sig=qQOjrIyjgcpkAEOAlyflKA9paRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6048TN_DCYeuvgOY592JDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Panna%20Plateau&amp;f=false | title =Resources and planning for economic development | work= p. 19 | first=Archana | last=  Bhargava|publisher =Google books | accessdate = 2010-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important physioraphic feature in eastern Madhya Pradesh is the great Kaimur escarpment. This forms the watershed or divide for two of the major rivers of peninsular India, the [[Son River|Son]] on the south and [[Tamsa River|Tons]] on the north. Throughout its length of 300 miles and throughout its continuation into Narmada valley, it is not breached at any point by any stream flowing northwards, with a few minor exceptions. Everywhere the scarp rises to a height of 500 to 1000 feet above the low ground at its feet. The unique feature of the absence of any gorge or wind gap across the Kaimur scarp indicates that no stream of considerable size ever flowed due north across the scarp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_2/20005ad2_21.pdf| title =Evolution of the Son drainage | work= | first= | last=S. Lakhsman |publisher =Centre of Advanced Study in Geology, University of Saugor | accessdate = 2010-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaimur Range runs through the entire length of [[Maihar]] and [[Amarpatan]] tahsils of [[Satna district]] in an easterly direction slightly inclined to the north. At Jhukehi, the strike of the Kaimurs is displaced, producing the only gap in the whole length of the Vindhyas. Advantage of the gap is taken in the construction of the Mirzapur road and the Jabalpur-Allahabad railway line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://satna.nic.in/ | title =Satna | work=Mountains and hills | first= | last= |publisher =Satna district administration | accessdate = 2010-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plateaux and waterfalls==
A series of plateaux runs along the Kaimur Range. These [[fluvial]] plateaux, consists of a series of descending plateaux, starting with the [[Bijawar-Panna Plateau|Panna Plateau]] in the west, followed by [[Bhander Plateau]] and [[Rewa Plateau]] and ending with [[Rohtas Plateau]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=dC7qhGQpBYkC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Rohtas+plateau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5Ac2ZWezIE&amp;sig=TG9r1zgyWerRZe_b6MZXygOIwXU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5agoTLCcL4e3rAfqxq2NBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Rohtas%20plateau&amp;f=false | title =Physical Geography: Introduction To Earth| work= p. 158 | first= | last=K. Bharatdwaj |publisher = google books | accessdate = 2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a well-marked fall line along these plateaux, extending from Purwa or Tons Falls on the Tons River in the north-western part of the Rewa district of Madhya Pradesh in the west to Sasaram in the east. Hundreds of waterfalls ranging in height between 15m and 180m are found along this fault line as all the major rivers emerging from the Kaimur Range and draining due northwards make tremendous waterfalls while descending through the northern foreland of the Indian peninsula. Significant waterfalls along this fault line are: [[Purwa Falls|Purwa or Tons Falls]] (70m) on the [[Tamsa River|Tons River]] (in Rewa district, MP), [[Chachai Falls]] (127m) on the Bihad River, a tributary of Tons River, the [[Keoti Falls]] (98m) on the Mahana River, a tributary of Tons River, [[Bahuti Falls|Odda Falls]] (145m) on the Odda River, a tributary of Belah River, which is itself a tributary of Tones River, Devdari Falls (58m) on the [[Karmanasa River]] (Rohtas plateau, Bihar), Telharkund Falls (80m) on the Suara West River (Rohtas plateau), Suara Falls (120m) on the Suara East River, Durgawaati Falls (80m) on the Durgawati River (Rohtas plateau), Okharean Kund Falls (90m) on Gopath River (Rohtas plateau), Dhuan Kund Falls (30m) (Rohtas plateau near Sasaram) on the Dhoba River, Kuaridah Falls (180m) on the Ausane River, a tributary of Son River, Rohtas plateau, Rakim Kund Falls (168m), on the Gayghat River, a tributary of Ausane River (Rohtas plateau) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T1Y_Ytx9wp4C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=Physical+Geography:+Hydrosphere+Devdari+Falls&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9rd_6nnP9e&amp;sig=rbXlMqIEfnG2YBSZgpY6avtBk0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6GjtS5WeB5C7rAfR5_iXBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Physical Geography: Hydrosphere | work= p. 154 | first=  | last= K.

[[Prehistoric]] [[rock painting]]s have been discovered in the Kaimur hills, [[Nawada]] and [[Jamui]]. A [[Neolithic]] settlement was also discovered in the thick of the [[alluvium]], over the bank of the [[Ganges]] at [[Chirand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://yac.bih.nic.in/Da-01.htm [[Prehistoric]] era in Bihar&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rock painting]]s depict prehistoric lifestyle and natural environment. The paintings display the sun, moon, stars, animals, plants, trees, rivers and are believed to represent love towards nature. The paintings also highlight daily life of the early humans in Bihar, displaying hunting, running, dancing, and walking.&lt;ref&gt;http://discoverbihar.bih.nic.in/pages/art_craft.htm#Rock%20Paintings {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205000953/http://discoverbihar.bih.nic.in/pages/art_craft.htm |date=2009-02-05 }} Rock painting at Kaimur&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rock painting]]s in [[Bihar]] are not only identical to those in central and southern India, but also are similar to those in Europe and Africa. The rock paintings of Spain's [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] and France's [[Lascaux]] are almost identical to those found in Bihar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaimur.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202172246/http://kaimur.com/ |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }} discovery of rock paintings&lt;/ref&gt; Adi Satguru Ashram situated near Maa Mundeshwari Temple near Bhabhua (Kaimur) is a must see.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11163">Since its mass rollout, some of 2004 and 2005's most popular albums have been released on [[DualDisc]] in the hopes that the extra exposure will help the new technology gain acceptance in the marketplace.

Note: A typical [[DualDisc]] will have a DVD side that is [[DVD-Audio]] formatted. However, this is not the case with several titles. Instead, a standard DVD-Video format DVD side will be present, and will not actually meet the high-fidelity sound that [[DVD-Audio]] provides. In other words, not all DualDisc titles are also DVD-Audio titles.

==High profile DualDisc releases==

The music articles in the [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey Sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey Jr]] (1791–1851).The ''Cyclopædia'' was illustrated using 53 plates as well as a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

The general musical articles list all those that are not biographical, which form a separate list. They were written mostly by Charles Burney. Others on the scientific basis of music were by John Farey Sr, and technical descriptions of some musical instruments were given by his son.

It had been Burney's intention to write a ''Dictionary of Music'', but for various reasons he never did so.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, "Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music" ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–171, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 when he was aged 75 he was offered the chance of writing music articles in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', and this occupied him to around 1805 or '06. His fee was £1000. Burney's brief was to 'include definitions in all the languages of Europe where Music has been much cultivated, with its history, biography, Criticism and discussions'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lonsdale, Roger, ''Dr Charles Burney: a Literary Biography'', OUP 1965, pp 412&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles contain an enormous amount of musical information, much of which being augmented versions of what he had already published in his earlier writings &lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer, Frank]], ed. Charles Burney, ''A General History of Music'', 2 vol. 1935, rep 1957 [Originally published in 4 volumes, 1776–1789]; and Scholes, P. A., ''Dr Burney's Musical Tours in Europe'', 2 vol, OUP 1959, [France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773]; as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he took the opportunity to add new topics covering the years of the last quarter of the eighteenth century and much of the first decade of the nineteenth, in particular the London musical scene. In all he wrote 996 general articles. While the majority of the articles have some length, a good proportion are brief (3 or 4 lines or fewer), dictionary definitions, or cross references. Many of the former are terms derived from French and Italian. The encyclopaedic-length articles (as distinct from the dictionary-length articles) are usually longer than Burney's earlier published writings on the same topic.

Dr [[Percy Scholes]] cites a statement by Dr Rees from Preface to the ''Cyclopaedia'' that he had 'constantly interpolated his own additions to the articles of his specialists'. and quotes a passage from the article about Dance (Vol 11) describing 'in our own memory', Welsh church-goers being played out of church by a fiddle.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, P. A.,''The Puritans and Early Music in England and New England'', OUP, 1934, p77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, sr]] was by profession a geologist, but was greatly interested music.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Croy Kassler, ''The Science of Music in Britain, 1714–1830'', Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London, 1979, vol 1, pp 329–343&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with the Choral Fund,&lt;ref&gt;Established in 1791 by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] to assist poor musicians. Farey was the first Secretary and Librarian.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cecilian Society&lt;ref&gt;A group founded in 1785 which sang mainly oratorios. The newspapers of the period carried frequent advertisements of their performances.&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[Surrey Chapel|Surrey Chapel Society]], and also sang in oratorios in Drury Lane Theatre. He was particularly interested in the [[mathematics of music]] and [[musical temperament|temperament]], and wrote all the 215 scientific articles on these topics for Rees. Farey's investigations of [[musical temperament|temperament]] involved discussing (and criticising) the various schemes in use then. He described them in a series of letters to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and the ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' as well as the ''[[American Journal of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Kassler, above for details of these.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed 25 articles to the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'' on this topic .&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the latter see the bibliography appended to Trever D. Ford and [[Hugh S. Torrens]] introduction ('John Farey (1766–1826) an unrecognised polymath') to the 1989 reprinting of the first volume of John Farey's ''General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, jr]] was a prolific contributor to Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', not only as a writer but also as an artist of many of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;Woolrich, A. P., "John Farey, Jr., technical author and draughtsman: his contribution to Rees's ''Cyclopædia''". ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', 20, (1998), 49–68 [http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm AIA Abstracts 1998. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207111214/http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm |date=7 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the four articles he wrote, he drew plates for two illustrating [[John Isaac Hawkins]]'s ''Finger-keyed Viol'', and two different patterns of pipe organ. The plates were keyed to the texts of the articles, and for this reason it was necessary for Farey to have produced both, since writing the texts describing the plates would have required technical knowledge which Burney would not have possessed.

'''Alphabetisation of articles:'''&lt;br&gt;
The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''Annotations:'''&lt;br&gt;
The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's travels, ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''.

*[[Bereavement in Judaism#Preparing the body — Taharah|Taharah]] building in [[Allenstein]] (1913), today known as the [[Mendelsohn house]].
*Workers' colony for the Builders' Union in [[Luckenwalde]] (1919–1920)
*Garden pavilion of the Herrmann family, Luckenwalde (1920)
*Work hall of the Herrmann hat factory, Luckenwalde (1919–1920)
*Conversion of the administration building of the ''Hausleben'' insurance company, Berlin (1920)
*[[Einsteinturm]] (Observatory on the [[Telegraphenberg]]) in [[Potsdam]], 1917 or 1920–1921 ''(building), 1921–1924 (technical equipment).'' The building, its expressionistic form giving the impression of [[concrete]] as a building material, was mostly built in brick and then covered with plaster. Mendelsohn explained this was because of delivery problems; however, it is presumed that the real reason for the choice of building materials was problems with constructing the casing.
*Double villa on Karolingerplatz, Berlin (1921–1922)
*Steinberg hat factory, Herrmann &amp; Co, Luckenwalde (1921–1923) with a strict, angular form
*[[Mossehaus]], conversion of the offices and press of Rudolf Mosse, Berlin (1921–1923)

*Cottage of Dr. Bejach, [[Berlin-Steinstücken]] (1926–1927)
*[[Schocken Department Store Stuttgart|Schocken department store]], [[Stuttgart]] (1926–1928). The department store, together with the [[Tagblatt-Turm]] (1924–1928) of [[Ernst-Otto Oßwald]]  across the way, constituted an impressive ensemble of modern architecture, and was damaged only lightly in World War II. In 1960, the city Stuttgart demolished both, despite international protest.  In its place today stands [[Egon Eiermann]]'s unremarkable department store building (Galeria Kaufhof, previously Horten).

*[[Cohen House, London|Cohen House]], [[Chelsea, London]] (1934–1936). In collaboration with [[Serge Chermayeff]].
*Gilbey Firm, [[Camden Town|Camden]], London (1935–1936). In collaboration with [[Serge Chermayeff]].
*[[Weizmann House]], [[Weizmann Institute]] campus, [[Rehovot]] near [[Tel Aviv]] (1935–1936)

==History==

=== 2007-2010 ===
Initially started by Nafis Ahmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NAFIS AHMED At the Root of Live Square|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/nafis-ahmed-at-the-root-of-live-square/|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was a student in his sophomore year at [[Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka|IBA-DU]], LiveSquare became known with a series of lounge concerts under the banner of [[The Wireless Sessions]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Livesquare Experiences|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/livesquare-experiences/|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring bands such as [[Arbovirus (band)|Arbovirus]], [[Shunno]], [[Artcell]], [[Cryptic Fate]] and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]], in a time when the lounge music scene in [[Dhaka]] was in its infancy.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news |title=Return of The Wireless Sessions |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/01/wireless.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveSquare also organized and executed several one-off concerts during this time, including a fundraising concert for the victims of the hurricane [[Cyclone Sidr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amader Gaan &amp; ADTL Unplugged Concert 08'|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2008/01/03/feature_concert.htm|website = archive.thedailystar.net|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveSquare went on a year-long hiatus in 2010 following Ahmed's graduation and subsequent employment at a reputed marketing agency.

=== 2011-2012 ===
LiveSquare organized several new events in 2011, such as the tribute concert Titans: [[Iron Maiden]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = TITANS: IRON MAIDEN  A Live-Square Concert|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2011/06/01/special.htm|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ABC Generation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = THE ABC GENERATION RELOADED|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2012/04/02/special.htm|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New generation popular bands rock huge crowd : Dhaka Mirror|url = http://www.dhakamirror.com/uncategorized/new-generation-popular-bands-rock-huge-crowd/|website = www.dhakamirror.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; series.

[[File:Basilios II.jpg|thumb|The Psalter of Basil II: Famous image of Basil II, Constantinople, 11th century]]
The '''''Menologion of Basil II''''' (also called '''''Menologium of Basil II''''', '''''Menology of Basil II''''') is an [[illuminated manuscript]] designed as a [[church calendar]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] service book (''[[menologion]]'') that was compiled c. 1000 AD, for the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil II]] (r. 976–1025). It contains a ''[[synaxarion]]'', a short collection of [[hagiography|saints' lives]], compiled at Constantinople for liturgical use, and around 430 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] by eight different artists. It was unusual for a ''menologion'' from that era to be so richly painted. It currently resides in the [[Vatican Library]] (Ms. Vat. gr. 1613).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siger|first=L. P.|title="Manuscript Illumination" from New Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale|date=2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HaldonCormack2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Haldon|author2=Robin Cormack|title=The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liFKua_cWL8C&amp;pg=PA736|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=15 January 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925246-6|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A full facsimile was produced in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;''Codices e Vaticanis selecti phototypice expressi ivssv Pii. PP. X consilio et opera cvratorvm Bibliothecae vaticanae.'' [Series maior]  no. 8, Fratelli Bocca, Turin, Italy, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The manuscript is not technically a ''[[menologion]]'', but a ''[[synaxarion]]'': a liturgical book containing a list of the saints and their feast days with a short description of sixteen lines of text and a painting of a saint or grouping of saints. The more than 430 images are important examples of [[hagiography]], the veneration of saints, in Byzantine illumination. Text and images cover only half of the religious calendar of the Byzantine [[liturgical year]] (September to February), so it is assumed that there was a second volume to the work, but this was probably never produced, since some pages within the manuscript were left unfinished. The miniatures themselves have no liturgical role—it's possible that their purpose was to act as protectors of the Emperor. The manuscript inspired the illustration of a number of subsequent ''menologia''.&lt;ref name="GB101"&gt;''The glory of Byzantium'', {{p.|101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work glorifies Emperor Basil II showing him as a warrior defending Orthodox Christendom against the attacks of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], whose attacks on Christians are graphically illustrated. Even figures like the archangels were depicted in military guise by the painters.

== History ==
The manuscript was copied and painted at [[Constantinople]] at the command of, or as a gift, for the Emperor Basil II. It was completed between 979 and the early years of the 11th century. In the course of the 14th century it came into the possession of a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] doctor who resided in Constantinople. In the 15th century it was acquired by [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan. At the beginning of the 17th century the cardinal [[Paolo Emilio Sfondrati]] gave it to [[Pope Paul V]] and the manuscript now resides in the [[Vatican library]].&lt;ref name="GB100"&gt;''The glory of Byzantium'', p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artists ==
[[File:Bulgars.jpg|thumb|200px|Bulgar soldiers slaughter Christians, from the [[Menologion of Basil II]], 10th century.]]
The artists who produced the images for the ''Menologion'' employed [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and moved away from the flat depictions common up to that time. The figures' gestures and drapery are depicted in a lifelike manner, with architecture and backgrounds well-rendered. Facial expressions are painted in a naturalistic style. The work thus demonstrates the painting style of the period which is often referred to as the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] in which painters returned to ancient models with gusto.

Unusual for a Byzantine manuscript, the name of the painter of each illustration is recorded by a scribe at the edge of each image. A total of eight names can be recognised. One painter, by the name of Pantoleon, who may be referred to in other documents of the time, seems to have been in charge of the group. They likely worked together in a workshop connected to the Imperial court. The other painters are Georgios, Michael the Younger, Michael of [[Blachernae|Blachernai]], Simeon, Simeon of Blachernai, Manas, and Nestor.

The names are not the signatures of the artists themselves, since they are all recorded in the same handwriting. It is very rare for artistic works from the Middle Ages to record the name of the artist, since it was not the individual artist so much as the meaning of the image which was most important. The reason for the recording of the names of the painters below their works in the ''Menologion of Basil II'' is not clear.

The '''Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers Society of Washington, D.C.''' (MPSGS) is an invitation-only organization dedicated to the promotion and encouragement of the practice of producing fine art in miniature. This [[miniature art]] society is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]] but includes members from around the world.  Founded in 1931 by [[Alyn Williams]], the Society is the second-oldest organization of its kind in the world next to the [[Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers]] in London, England also founded by Mr. Williams. It is the oldest active organization of miniaturists in the United States. 

Miniaturists are considered for membership in the Society after their works have been accepted in the Annual MPSGS International Exhibition in three shows or when they have been awarded a first, second, or third prize in the exhibition. As of 2000, the Society consisted of 48 Resident Members and 142 Associate Members from all over the world. There are ten Emeritus Members and five Auxiliary Members (non-artists). Society members offer exhibitions, lectures, videos, demonstrations and workshops.

The MPSGS also provides stipends for talented and deserving art students in visual arts graduating from the [[Duke Ellington School of  the Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The origin of these scholarship funds was the proceeds from sales of the first miniature book on miniaturizing, ''Art in Miniature'', written and published by MPSGS member and past President, [[Margaret Hicks| Margaret T. Hicks]].

The Society holds an ''International Exhibition of Fine Art Miniatures'' for six weeks in November and December at the [[Strathmore Hall Arts Center]] in [[North Bethesda, Maryland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15234">A '''music supervisor''' is a person who combines [[music]] and visual media. According to The Guild of Music Supervisors, a music supervisor is “a qualified professional who oversees all music related aspects of film, television, advertising, video games and other existing or emerging visual media platforms as required.”&lt;ref name="Guild of Music Supervisors"&gt;Guild of Music Supervisors. {{cite web |url=http://www.guildofmusicsupervisors.com/the-role/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020208/http://www.guildofmusicsupervisors.com/the-role/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[musical theatre]] industry, a music supervisor is often responsible for managing a team of music directors working on any number of musical productions.

==Description==

A music supervisor is somebody with a broad and encyclopedic music expertise and a sophisticated knowledge of music licensing and negotiation. Typically, a music supervisor proposes previously recorded songs to the director or producer of a film, advertisement, television show, trailer, promo, video game, or any other form of visual media.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"&gt;Sobel, Ron, and Dick Weissman. Music Publishing: The Roadmap to Royalties. New York: Routledge, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A music supervisor will usually act as a liaison between the creative and business ends of the process.&lt;ref name="Baskerville, David 2006"&gt;Baskerville, David, PHD. Music Business and Career Guide.  2006. Sage Publications, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a song is approved, they approach the rights holders of that song to seek permission to license (usually creating master recording licenses and [[Synchronization rights|synchronization licenses]]) and to work out the financial details of the song’s use. In many instances, the artist or songwriter of the recorded song is given the opportunity to accept or decline the synchronization of their song.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; This position is most active within media-based industries, including live events, television, film, advertising, theatre, and video gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Wentz, Brook. Hey, that’s my music!: Music supervision, licensing, and content acquisition. 2007. Hal Leonard Books, NY NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  Music supervisors may work within production companies, film studios, networks, music supervision companies, or do freelance work.

==Job responsibilities==

A supervisor’s responsibilities are to locate, secure and oversee music related talent. They liaise between the rights holders of the recorded music involved and the director of the project they have been hired to work on. In addition, they advise, generate and work within financial parameters of the project they are hired to work on. They must deliver musical elements within a timely manner and secure legal rights of the song before it is used. The music supervisor will gather the appropriate information to list credits and, in certain cases, will manage royalty collection.

The overarching responsibility of a music supervisor is to meet the needs of a project’s director and producer. This means catering to the creative goals of a project under a strict budget: often less than 5% of a project’s total budget.

The director/producer will discuss their vision for the project with the music supervisor, and how they expect the music to enhance this vision. The visual media will then be spotted by the supervisor – a process of choosing where selected music will be inserted. Traditional spots include the main title, opening credits, and closing credits, while additional spots are incorporated to trigger emotional responses from viewers. Scores, or background music, are also an important consideration for enhancing visual media. Scores can range from the background to a dramatic scene to television bumpers – the music signifying leading into or coming back from a commercial break.

After being given or creating a budget, the supervisor must select appropriate music for the project – either by licensing existing songs/scores, or creating new songs/scores. In the selection process, a music supervisor may choose to seek the help of a third party licensing company or a music publisher, which will pitch songs to the supervisor from within their library of music. If creating new music, the supervisor may become responsible for additional roles, including securing artists or composers, facilitating the production and recording process, overseeing finances, and finalizing post-theatrical uses of the soundtrack.When using pre-existing music, the supervisor’s duties focus on the legal and financial aspects of licensing and negotiating. A large percentage of a music supervisor’s job revolves around music clearance alone.

When it comes to royalty collections, a music supervisor will sometimes be in charge of arranging this source of the selected artist's revenue. Royalties for music placements are paid out by Performance Rights Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC in the United States). In order to detect the placements an artist has made with visual media, these companies need to be aware of their placement. Depending on the type of project (ad placement, television show, etc.). the music supervisor will have to either make sure the artist is credited properly, send video clips of the placement to the publisher (which will then be sent to the proper Performance Rights Organization),or create a cue sheet of all of the songs used in the project

Many directors and producers will choose to work with a single supervisor for a project, however it varies from project to project. For example, music supervisors can be hired at an entertainment company as an “in house” staff member to manage the supervision for several projects (such as at an advertising agency). A production company may also hire a supervisor on a project-by-project basis (such as hiring one supervisor for an entire television series as seen with Gossip Girl or The O.C.). Music supervisors may also be hired on a show-by-show basis (ex. AMC’s Mad Men, which has used multiple music supervisors).

==Qualifications/background==

A music supervisor must have a wide knowledge of music and a passion for musical research.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; There is no set educational or career path to become a music supervisor.  Educational backgrounds range from Bachelor of Fine Arts in music to business degrees to no higher education at all (Baskerville).  Because the majority of the position involves music negotiations, clearances, publishing/performing deals, etc., a legal background is an excellent qualification. Some supervisors are musicians, producers, agents, or managers – experience with the music or film/television industries is a strong background upon which to build. Despite common misconceptions, musical knowledge (writing, reading, performing, composing) is not nearly as important as a familiarity with a broad range of music, including popular styles and artists, as well as the production/negotiating process itself (Baskerville). Author of ''Music Business Handbook and Career Guide'' David Baskerville notes "This is one of the few production specialties that has almost unlimited growth potential, because there [is] no universally accepted job description. The field remains wide open to people with connections and the ability to get the job done."

The proliferation of video technology has resulted in an increased demand for production companies needing to license music, and the field now accommodates many career professionals. Because of the massive expansion in the field, many colleges and universities offer courses in music supervision. For example, NYU Steinhardt’s Music Business program offers a course titled “Strategic Music and Branding”.&lt;ref name="NYU Curriculum"&gt;"Music Business Curriculum." NYU Steinhardt. New York University, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary==

Music supervisor salaries vary depending upon the project and the hiring process.  Salaries can range from $35,000 annually at a music supervision firm, to upwards of $250,000 for a freelance supervisor per feature film (Austin). Music supervisors also have the opportunity to continue receiving funds through soundtrack royalties.  It is generally more profitable (assuming one will be regularly hired) to work freelance jobs than to work for a larger corporation. However some supervisors may choose to work within a music supervision company (such as Chop Shop Music Supervision). In addition, music supervisors who work "in house" within an entertainment, such as an advertising agency or within the music department of a production company, will earn a salary based upon their ranking and company earnings. While staff jobs with a network, studio, or production company offer more security, the recognition and pay are significantly lower.  Despite the environment, a music supervisor should always work out a contract including expectations, responsibilities, and payment before beginning a project.

==History==
Originally, music was used in silent films to hide mechanical noises within a theatre, like the projector.  Often a musician would be present to play improvised or pre-selected pieces along with the visual images on screen.&lt;ref name="Schulenberg, Richard 1999"&gt;Schulenberg, Richard.  Legal Aspects of the Music Industry: An Insider’s View. 1999. Billboard Books, New York New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the establishment of the soundtrack, and an emphasis on accompanying silent visual media with music.&lt;ref name="Schulenberg, Richard 1999"/&gt; Over time, films began hiring composers to create instrumental soundtracks to accompany films. It became apparent to studios that when a movie included a hit song, more people were likely to see it, and as a result of that, more people were likely to purchase the song recording.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; The demand for music supervisors in the production process solidified in the 1980s, and has continued to grow with the popularity of media soundtracks.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, D., Austin, C., Peterik, Jim. Songwriting for Dummies, 2nd Edition. 2010. Wiley Publishing, Inc., Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; While the use of songs not originally composed for the film did not save money, licensing a song made for a more stable understanding for the director and producer of the film what music was going to be  used in the scene. Instead of having to wait for new instrumental music to be commissioned, they could have an understanding of what recording would be used before the film was finalized. This led to an emerging need for selecting and licensing songs, which is how the position of music supervisor developed.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; Taking advantage of this musical component has become an increasingly feasible marketing strategy for these media outlets, placing a growing responsibility on the music supervisor.&lt;ref name="Baskerville, David 2006"/&gt;

Over the past decade, synchronization licensing has become one of the most significant ways for an artist to gain exposure and to earn money. Finding a way to a music supervisor can give an artist the opportunity to spread their music on a platform that would expose them to a much larger audience than they may have been able to find on their own. One of the most notable synchronization collaborations was with Moby’s 1999 album Play, which was the first ever to have all of its tracks linked to a synchronization license.&lt;ref name="Organization Moby"&gt;Smith, Ethan. "Organization Moby." Wired May 2002.https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.05/moby.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The job of a music supervisor has only recently become increasingly significant and the importance of this position continues to grow. Institutions such as the Guild of Music Supervisors are promoting the understanding of music supervision. In 2007 several supervisors, in order to promote, pursue and recognize the craft of music supervision. Since 2011 guild has granted awards for excellence in the position. They encourage other institutions, such as the Hollywood Music and Media Awards, to acknowledge accomplishments in the field.&lt;ref name="Guild of Music Supervisors"/&gt;

[[File:Treaty of Penn with Indians by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Treaty of Penn with the Indians'']]
 
'''''The Treaty of Penn with the Indians''''', sometimes known as '''''Penn's Treaty with the Indians at Shackamaxon''''' or more simply '''''Penn's Treaty with the Indians''''', is an [[oil painting]] by [[Benjamin West]], completed in 1771-2.  The painting depicts [[William Penn]] entering into [[peace treaty]] in 1683 with [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape]] ("Delaware Indians") Turtle Clan, under the shade of an [[elm tree]] near the village of [[Shackamaxon]] (now Kensington) in [[Pennsylvania]].

Although the Delaware tribe challenged the [[Walking Purchase]] of 1737, which some historians have speculated was fraudulently created by William Penn's son, [[Thomas Penn]], the peace between the Lenape Turtle Clan and Penn's successors would endure almost a century, until the [[Penn's Creek Massacre]] of 1755.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penntreatymuseum.org/treaty.php Penn Treaty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty William Penn entered into was remarked upon by [[Voltaire]], who called it "... the only treaty never sworn to and never broken." ''{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Painting==
The painting was commissioned by [[Thomas Penn]] - [[William Penn]]'s son - in 1770 or 1771 and completed in 1771-2.  West was a local artist who was born in [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield, Pennsylvania]] and grew up in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]].  Like Thomas Penn, West was born into a [[Quaker]] family.  Also like Thomas Penn, he later turned to the [[Church of England]], however.  He studied in [[Philadelphia]] but developed as a painter of historic subjects in London, where he was the second president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]].  His reputation for [[history painting]] was established in the early 1770s with his painting of ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]''.

For the image of William Penn, West copied a relief portrait made from memory by [[Silvanius Bevan]] several years after Penn's death.  West had no models for the Indian subjects, so used sketches of sculptures, adding Indian artefacts, such as beaded moccasins, arm bands, and bags, and clay pipes.

The crowd is gathered around a white cloth which draws the eye at the centre of the composition, like a campfire or the [[Christ child]] at the centre of a [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] scene.  The painting presents an idealised picture of interaction between the Indians and the Europeans, glossing over recent difficulties such as the [[Walking Purchase]] in 1737 and the [[Treaty of Lancaster|treaty with the Six Nations]] in 1744, but harking back instead to Penn's wish for peace.

The milk Indians are dressed and decorated in green, red and white, with feather headdresses, partly shaved heads, beaded armbands and headbands, and large earrings.  They lean forward, keen to see what they are being offered. Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying Native Americans in the painting can be found in the [[British Museum]]'s collection (as well as additional indigenous artefacts used in other paintings by West).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=37698&amp;peoA=37698-3-17 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Europeans are shown in more sombre clothing typical of 1771, in shades of browns and greys, rather than the more decorated styles of 1682; Penn is picked out by his white neckcloth.  The Europeans stand back, reversing their contemporary keenness to acquire land from the Indians.  The crowd includes West's own father (the elderly gentleman with white hair, third to left of Penn) and his half brother Thomas West (behind Penn).  West also added brick-built buildings from his own memories of Pennsylvania, even though they had not been built by 1682.

The canvas measures {{convert|190|cm|in}} high by {{convert|274|cm|in}} wide.

The painting was purchased at auction by [[Joseph Harrison, Jr.|Joseph Harrison]] and brought to Philadelphia.  On Harrison's death, it was given to the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] and the [[United States National Museum of Independence]].  It has been exhibited at the [[Pennsylvania State Museum]].

[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg|thumb]]

A [[wikt:copperplate|copperplate]] print of the painting was engraved in London by [[John Hall (artist)|John Hall]] and published by [[John Boydell]] in June 1775, with the image reversed, under the longer title ''William Penn's treaty with the Indians, when he founded the province of Pennsylvania in North America, 1681''.  The print was copied in a smaller size by [[Robert Delaunay]] and published as ''Guillaume Penn Traite avec les Indiens''.  This French print was copied by other artists.

The tree itself also became a subject for later paintings and prints, although it fell during a storm on 3 March 1810. The land is now [[Penn Treaty Park]].  The painting influenced folk artist [[Edward Hicks]], who made his own image of the events.

      <comment>implicitly talking about Poincare dodecahedral space, is obtained by gluing opposite faces of a regular dodecahedron together; the result is clearly not a polytope. No citation to any other plausible hypothesis. Uses informal language and brings up string theory for no apparent reason.

In [[mathematics]], a '''regular polytope''' is a [[polytope]] whose [[symmetry group]] acts [[transitive group action|transitively]] on its [[flag (geometry)|flags]], thus giving it the highest degree of symmetry. All its elements or ''j''-faces (for all 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', where ''n'' is the dimension of the polytope) &amp;mdash; cells, faces and so on &amp;mdash; are also transitive on the symmetries of the polytope, and are regular polytopes of dimension ≤&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Regular polytopes are the generalized analog in any number of dimensions of [[regular polygon]]s (for example, the [[square (geometry)|square]] or the regular pentagon) and [[regular polyhedra]] (for example, the [[cube]]). The strong symmetry of the regular polytopes gives them an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] quality that interests both non-mathematicians and mathematicians.

Classically, a regular polytope in ''n'' dimensions may be defined as having regular [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] [(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-faces] and regular [[vertex figure]]s. These two conditions are sufficient to ensure that all faces are alike and all vertices are alike. Note, however, that this definition does not work for [[abstract polytope]]s.

A regular polytope can be represented by a [[Schläfli symbol]] of the form {a,&amp;nbsp;b,&amp;nbsp;c,&amp;nbsp;....,&amp;nbsp;y,&amp;nbsp;z}, with regular facets as {a,&amp;nbsp;b,&amp;nbsp;c,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;y}, and regular vertex figures as {b,&amp;nbsp;c,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;y,&amp;nbsp;z}.

==Classification and description==
Regular polytopes are classified primarily according to their dimensionality.

They can be further classified according to [[symmetry]]. For example, the [[cube]] and the regular [[octahedron]] share the same symmetry, as do the regular [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]]. Indeed, symmetry groups are sometimes named after regular polytopes, for example the tetrahedral and icosahedral symmetries.

Three special classes of regular polytope exist in every dimensionality:
*[[Simplex|Regular simplex]]
*[[Measure polytope]] (Hypercube)
*[[Cross polytope]] (Orthoplex)

In two dimensions there are infinitely many [[regular polygon]]s. In three and four dimensions there are several more [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and [[4-polytope]]s besides these three. In five dimensions and above, these are the only ones. See also the [[list of regular polytopes]].

The idea of a polytope is sometimes generalised to include related kinds of geometrical object. Some of these have regular examples, as discussed in the section on historical discovery below.

===Schläfli symbols===
{{main article|Schläfli symbol}}

A concise symbolic representation for regular polytopes was developed by Ludwig [[Schläfli]] in the 19th Century, and a slightly modified form has become standard. The notation is best explained by adding one dimension at a time.

*A [[convex polygon|convex]] [[regular polygon]] having ''n'' sides is denoted by {''n''}. So an equilateral triangle is {3}, a square {4}, and so on indefinitely. A regular [[star polygon]] which winds ''m'' times around its centre is denoted by the fractional value {''n''/''m''}, where ''n'' and ''m'' are [[co-prime]], so a regular [[pentagram]] is {5/2}.
*A [[regular polyhedron]] having faces {''n''} with ''p'' faces joining around a vertex is denoted by {''n'', ''p''}. The nine [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] are {3, 3} {3, 4} {4, 3} {3, 5} {5, 3} {3, 5/2} {5/2, 3} {5, 5/2} and {5/2, 5}. {''p''} is the ''[[vertex figure]]'' of the polyhedron.
*A regular 4-polytope having cells {''n'', ''p''} with ''q'' cells joining around an edge is denoted by {''n'', ''p'', ''q''}. The vertex figure of the 4-polytope is a {''p'', ''q''}.
*A regular 5-polytope is an {''n'', ''p'', ''q'', ''r''}. And so on.

===Duality of the regular polytopes===

The [[Dual polytope|dual]] of a regular polytope is also a regular polytope. The Schläfli symbol for the dual polytope is just the original symbol written backwards: {3, 3} is self-dual, {3, 4} is dual to {4, 3}, {4, 3, 3} to {3, 3, 4} and so on.

The [[vertex figure]] of a regular polytope is the dual of the dual polytope's facet. For example, the vertex figure of {3, 3, 4} is {3, 4}, the dual of which is {4, 3} &amp;mdash; a [[Cell (geometry)|cell]] of {4, 3, 3}.

The [[hypercube|measure]] and [[cross polytope]]s in any dimension are dual to each other.

If the Schläfli symbol is [[palindrome|palindromic]], i.e. reads the same forwards and backwards, then the polyhedron is self-dual. The self-dual regular polytopes are:
* All [[regular polygon]]s, {a}.
* All regular ''n''-[[simplex]]es, {3,3,...,3}
* The regular [[24-cell]] in 4&amp;nbsp;dimensions, {3,4,3}.
* The [[great 120-cell]] ({5,5/2,5}) and [[grand stellated 120-cell]] ({5/2,5,5/2}) in 4&amp;nbsp;dimensions.
* All regular ''n''-dimensional cubic [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]], {4,3,...,3,4}. These may be treated as [[#Apeirotopes — infinite polytopes|infinite polytope]]s.
* Hyperbolic tilings and honeycombs (tilings {p,p} with p&gt;4 in 2 dimensions, [[Order-4 square tiling honeycomb|{4,4,4}]], [[order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb|{5,3,5}]]. [[Icosahedral honeycomb|{3,5,3}]], [[order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb|{6,3,6}]], and [[Hexagonal tiling honeycomb|{3,6,3}]] in 3 dimensions, [[order-5 120-cell honeycomb|{5,3,3,5}]] in 4 dimensions, and [[16-cell honeycomb honeycomb|{3,3,4,3,3}]] in 5 dimensions).

==History of discovery==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Polyhedron]] --&gt;

===Convex polygons and polyhedra===

The earliest surviving mathematical treatment of regular polygons and polyhedra comes to us from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mathematicians. The five [[Platonic solid]]s were known to them. [[Pythagoras]] knew of at least three of them and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (c. 417 BC – 369 BC) described all five. Later, [[Euclid]] wrote a systematic study of mathematics, publishing it under the title ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', which built up a logical theory of geometry and [[number theory]]. His work concluded with mathematical descriptions of the five [[Platonic solid]]s.

===Star polygons and polyhedra===

Our understanding remained static for many centuries after Euclid. The subsequent history of the regular polytopes can be characterised by a gradual broadening of the basic concept, allowing more and more objects to be considered among their number. [[Thomas Bradwardine]] (Bradwardinus) was the first to record a serious study of star polygons. Various star polyhedra appear in Renaissance art, but it was not until [[Johannes Kepler]] studied the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and the [[great stellated dodecahedron]] in 1619 that he realised these two were regular. [[Louis Poinsot]] discovered the [[great dodecahedron]] and [[great icosahedron]] in 1809, and [[Augustin Cauchy]] proved the list complete in 1812. These polyhedra are known as collectively as  the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].

===Higher-dimensional polytopes===

[[Image:8-cell-simple.gif|right|thumb|A 3D projection of a rotating tesseract. This tesseract is initially oriented so that all edges are parallel to one of the four coordinate space axes. The rotation takes place in the xw plane.]]
It was not until the 19th century that a Swiss mathematician, [[Ludwig Schläfli]], examined and characterised the regular polytopes in higher dimensions. His efforts were first published in full in (Schläfli, 1901), six years posthumously, although parts of it were published in (Schläfli, 1855), (Schläfli, 1858). Between 1880 and 1900,
Schläfli's results were rediscovered independently by at least nine
other mathematicians &amp;mdash; see (Coxeter, 1948, pp143&amp;ndash;144) for more details.  Schläfli called such a figure a "polyschem" (in English, "polyscheme" or "polyschema"). The term "polytope" was introduced by [[Reinhold Hoppe]], one of Schläfli's rediscoverers, in 1882, and first used in English by [[Alicia Boole Stott]] some twenty years later. The term "polyhedroids" was also used in earlier literature (Hilbert, 1952).

Coxeter (1948) is probably the most comprehensive printed treatment of Schläfli's and similar results to date. Schläfli showed that there are six [[convex regular 4-polytope|regular convex polytopes in 4 dimensions]].  Five of them can be seen as analogous to the Platonic solids: the [[4-simplex]] (or pentachoron) to the [[tetrahedron]], the [[hypercube]] (or [[tesseract]]) to the [[cube]], the [[4-orthoplex]] (or hexadecachoron or [[16-cell]]) to the [[octahedron]], the [[120-cell]] to the [[dodecahedron]], and the [[600-cell]] to the [[icosahedron]].  The sixth, the [[24-cell]], can be seen as a transitional form between the hypercube and 16-cell, analogous to the way that the [[cuboctahedron]] and the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] are transitional forms between the cube and the octahedron.

In five and more dimensions, there are exactly three regular polytopes, which correspond to the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron: these are the [[Regular polytope#Regular simplices|regular simplices]], [[Regular polytope#Measure polytopes|measure polytopes]] and [[Regular polytope#Cross polytopes|cross polytopes]]. Descriptions of these may be found in the [[List of regular polytopes]]. Also of interest are the star [[regular 4-polytope]]s, partially discovered by Schläfli.

By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians such as [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Ludwig Schläfli]] had developed the theory of regular polytopes in four and higher dimensions, such as the [[tesseract]] and the [[24-cell]].

The latter are difficult (though not impossible) to visualise, but still retain the aesthetically pleasing symmetry of their lower-dimensional cousins. The [[tesseract]] contains 8 cubical cells. It consists of two cubes in parallel hyperplanes with corresponding vertices cross-connected in such a way that the 8 cross-edges are equal in length and orthogonal to the 12+12 edges situated on each cube. The corresponding faces of the two cubes are connected to form the remaining 6 cubical faces of the [[tesseract]]. The [[24-cell]] can be derived from the [[tesseract]] by joining the 8 vertices of each of its cubical faces to an additional vertex to form the four-dimensional analogue of a pyramid. Both figures, as well as other 4-dimensional figures, can be directly visualised and depicted using 4-dimensional stereographs.&lt;ref name="Brisson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brisson | first = David W. | contribution = Visual Comprehension in n-Dimensions | editor-last = Brisson | editor-first = David W.  | title = Hypergraphics: Visualizing Complex Relationships in Art, Science and Technology | series = AAAS Selected Symposium | volume = 24 | pages = 109–145 | publisher = AAAS | place = Washington, D.C.  | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harder still to imagine are the more modern [[abstract polytope|abstract regular polytopes]] such as the [[57-cell]] or the [[11-cell]]. From the mathematical point of view, however, these objects have the same aesthetic qualities as their more familiar two and three-dimensional relatives.

At the start of the 20th century, the definition of a regular polytope was as follows.
*A regular polygon is a polygon whose edges are all equal and whose angles are all equal.
*A regular polyhedron is a polyhedron whose faces are all congruent regular polygons, and whose [[vertex figure]]s are all congruent and regular.
*And so on, a regular ''n''-polytope is an ''n''-dimensional polytope whose (''n'' &amp;minus; 1)-dimensional faces are all regular and congruent, and whose vertex figures are all regular and congruent.

This is a "recursive" definition. It defines regularity of higher dimensional figures in terms of regular figures of a lower dimension. There is an equivalent (non-recursive) definition, which states that a polytope is regular if it has a sufficient degree of symmetry.

* An ''n''-polytope is regular if any set consisting of a vertex, an edge containing it, a 2-dimensional face containing the edge, and so on up to ''n''&amp;minus;1 dimensions, can be mapped to any other such set by a symmetry of the polytope.

So for example, the cube is regular because if we choose a vertex of the cube, and one of the three edges it is on, and one of the two faces containing the edge, then this triplet, or '''[[Flag (geometry)|flag]]''', (vertex, edge, face) can be mapped to any other such flag by a suitable symmetry of the cube. Thus we can define a regular polytope very succinctly:
*A regular polytope is one whose symmetry group is transitive on its flags.

In the 20th century, some important developments were made. The [[symmetry]] [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of the classical regular polytopes were generalised into what are now called [[Coxeter group]]s. Coxeter groups also include the symmetry groups of regular [[tessellation]]s of space or of the plane. For example, the symmetry group of an infinite [[chessboard]] would be the Coxeter group [4,4].

===Apeirotopes &amp;mdash; infinite polytopes===

{{main article|Regular skew polyhedron}}

In the first part of the 20th century, Coxeter and Petrie discovered three infinite structures {4, 6}, {6, 4} and {6, 6}. They called them regular skew polyhedra, because they seemed to satisfy the definition of a regular polyhedron &amp;mdash; all the vertices, edges and faces are alike, all the angles are the same, and the figure has no free edges. Nowadays, they are called infinite polyhedra or apeirohedra. The regular tilings of the plane {4, 4}, {3, 6} and {6, 3} can also be regarded as infinite polyhedra.

In the 1960s [[Branko Grünbaum]] issued a call to the geometric community to consider more abstract types of regular polytopes that he called ''polystromata''. He developed the theory of polystromata, showing examples of new objects he called [[apeirotope|regular apeirotopes]], that is, regular polytopes with [[infinity|infinitely]] many faces. A simple example of an [[skew apeirogon]] would be a zig-zag. It seems to satisfy the definition of a regular polygon &amp;mdash; all the edges are the same length, all the angles are the same, and the figure has no loose ends (because they can never be reached). More importantly, perhaps, there are symmetries of the zig-zag that can map any pair of a vertex and attached edge to any other. Since then, other regular apeirogons and higher apeirotopes have continued to be discovered.

===Regular complex polytopes===

{{main article|Complex polytope}}

A [[complex number]] has a real part, which is the bit we are all familiar with, and an imaginary part, which is a multiple of the square root of minus one. A complex [[Hilbert space]] has its x, y, z, etc. coordinates as complex numbers. This effectively doubles the number of dimensions. A polytope constructed in such a unitary space is called a '''[[complex polytope]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract polytopes===

{{main article|Abstract polytope}}

[[Image:Hemicube.svg|right|frame|The [[Hemi-cube (geometry)|Hemicube]] is derived from a cube by equating opposite vertices, edges, and faces. It has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 3 faces.]]

Grünbaum also discovered the [[11-cell]], a four-dimensional [[Dual polyhedron|self-dual]] object whose facets are not icosahedra, but are "hemi-icosahedra" &amp;mdash; that is, they are the shape one gets if one considers opposite faces of the icosahedra to be actually the ''same'' face (Grünbaum, 1977). The hemi-icosahedron has only 10 triangular faces, and 6 vertices, unlike the icosahedron, which has 20 and 12.

This concept may be easier for the reader to grasp if one considers the relationship of the cube and the hemicube. An ordinary cube has 8 corners, they could be labeled A to H, with A opposite H, B opposite G, and so on. In a hemicube, A and H would be treated as the same corner. So would B and G, and so on. The edge AB would become the same edge as GH, and the face ABEF would become the same face as CDGH. The new shape has only three faces, 6 edges and 4 corners.

The 11-cell cannot be formed with regular geometry in flat (Euclidean) hyperspace, but only in positively curved (elliptic) hyperspace.

A few years after Grünbaum's discovery of the [[11-cell]], [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] independently discovered the same shape. He had earlier discovered a similar polytope, the [[57-cell]] (Coxeter 1982, 1984).

By 1994 Grünbaum was considering polytopes abstractly as combinatorial sets of points or vertices, and was unconcerned whether faces were planar. As he and others refined these ideas, such sets came to be called '''[[abstract polytope]]s'''. An abstract polytope is defined as a partially ordered set (poset), whose elements are the polytope's faces (vertices, edges, faces etc.) ordered by ''containment''. Certain restrictions are imposed on the set that are similar to properties satisfied by the classical regular polytopes (including the Platonic solids). The restrictions, however, are loose enough that regular tessellations, hemicubes, and even objects as strange as the 11-cell or stranger, are all examples of regular polytopes.

A geometric polytope is understood to be a ''realization'' of the abstract polytope, such that there is a one-to-one mapping from the abstract elements to the geometric. Thus, any geometric polytope may be described by the appropriate abstract poset, though not all abstract polytopes have proper geometric realizations.

The theory has since been further developed, largely by Egon Schulte and [[Peter McMullen]] (McMullen, 2002), but other researchers have also made contributions.

====Regularity of abstract polytopes====
Regularity has a related, though different meaning for [[abstract polytope]]s, since angles and lengths of edges have no meaning.

The definition of regularity in terms of the transitivity of flags as given in the introduction applies to abstract polytopes.

Any classical regular polytope has an abstract equivalent which is regular, obtained by taking the set of faces. But non-regular classical polytopes can have regular abstract equivalents, since abstract polytopes don't care about angles and edge lengths, for example. And a regular abstract polytope may not be realisable as a classical polytope.

''All polygons'' are regular in the abstract world, for example, whereas only those having equal angles and edges of equal length are regular in the  classical world.

====Vertex figure of abstract polytopes====

The concept of ''vertex figure'' is also defined differently for an [[abstract polytope]]. The vertex figure of a given abstract ''n''-polytope at a given vertex ''V'' is the set of all abstract faces which contain ''V'', including ''V'' itself.  More formally, it is the abstract section

: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V'' = {''F'' | ''V'' ≤ ''F'' ≤ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximal face, i.e. the notional ''n''-face which contains all other faces. Note that each ''i''-face, ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 of the original polytope becomes an (''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-face of the vertex figure.

Unlike the case for Euclidean polytopes, an abstract polytope with regular facets and vertex figures ''may or may not'' be regular itself &amp;ndash; for example, the square pyramid, all of whose facets and vertex figures are regular abstract polygons.

The classical vertex figure will, however, be a realisation of the abstract one.

== Constructions ==

=== Polygons ===

The traditional way to construct a regular polygon, or indeed any other figure on the plane, is by [[compass and straightedge]]. Constructing some regular polygons in this way is very simple (the easiest is perhaps the equilateral triangle), some are more complex, and some are impossible ("not constructible"). The simplest few regular polygons that are impossible to construct are the ''n''-sided polygons with ''n'' equal to 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21,...

[[Constructible polygon|Constructibility]] in this sense refers only to ideal constructions with ideal tools. Of course reasonably accurate approximations can be constructed by a range of methods; while theoretically possible constructions may be impractical.

=== Polyhedra ===

Euclid's ''Elements'' gave what amount to ruler-and-compass constructions for the five Platonic solids. (See, for example, [http://www.dform.com/projects/euclid/home.html Euclid's Elements].) However, the merely practical question of how one might draw a straight line in space, even with a ruler, might lead one to question what exactly it means to "construct" a regular polyhedron. (One could ask the same question about the polygons, of course.)
[[Image:icosahedron flat.svg|thumb|[[Net (polyhedron)|Net]] for [[icosahedron]]]] 
The English word "construct" has the connotation of systematically building the thing constructed. The most common way presented to construct a regular polyhedron is via a [[Net (polyhedron)|fold-out net]]. To obtain a fold-out net of a polyhedron, one takes the surface of the polyhedron and cuts it along just enough edges so that the surface may be laid out flat. This gives a plan for the net of the unfolded polyhedron. Since the Platonic solids have only triangles, squares and pentagons for faces, and these are all constructible with a ruler and compass, there exist ruler-and-compass methods for drawing these fold-out nets. The same applies to star polyhedra, although here we must be careful to make the net for only the visible outer surface.

If this net is drawn on cardboard, or similar foldable material (for example, sheet metal), the net may be cut out, folded along the uncut edges, joined along the appropriate cut edges, and so forming the polyhedron for which the net was designed. For a given polyhedron there may be many fold-out nets. For example, there are 11 for the cube, and over 900000 for the dodecahedron. Some interesting fold-out nets of the cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron are available [http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjPoly/projPoly.html here].

Numerous children's toys, generally aimed at the teen or pre-teen age bracket, allow experimentation with regular polygons and polyhedra. For example, [[klikko]] provides sets of plastic triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons that can be joined edge-to-edge in a large number of different ways. A child playing with such a toy could re-discover the Platonic solids (or the [[Archimedean solid]]s), especially if given a little guidance from a knowledgeable adult.

In theory, almost any material may be used to construct regular polyhedra. Instructions for building [[origami]] models may be found  [https://web.archive.org/web/20041011191240/http://www1.zetosa.com.pl/~burczyk/origami/galery1-en.htm here], for example. They may be carved out of wood, modeled out of wire, formed from stained glass. The imagination is the limit.

=== Higher dimensions ===
[[Image:Tesseract2.svg|thumb|[[Net (polytope)|Net]] for [[tesseract]]]]

[[Image:24cell section anim.gif|right|frame|An animated cut-away cross-section of the [[24-cell]].]]
In higher dimensions, it becomes harder to say what one means by "constructing" the objects. Clearly, in a 3-dimensional universe, it is impossible to build a physical model of an object having 4 or more dimensions. There are several approaches normally taken to overcome this matter.

The first approach, suitable for four dimensions, uses four-dimensional stereography.&lt;ref name="Brisson"/&gt; Depth in a third dimension is represented with horizontal relative displacement, depth in a fourth dimension with vertical relative displacement between the left and right images of the stereograph.

The second approach is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous to the ways in which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [http://www.weimholt.com/andrew/polytope.shtml]. One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to "draw" the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either [[Orthographic projection|orthographic]] or [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/600-Cell.html]). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]).

The intersection of a four (or higher) dimensional regular polytope with a three-dimensional hyperplane will be a polytope (not necessarily regular). If the hyperplane is moved through the shape, the three-dimensional slices can be combined, [[animation|animated]] into a kind of four dimensional object, where the fourth dimension is taken to be time. In this way, we can see (if not fully grasp) the full four-dimensional structure of the four-dimensional regular polytopes, via such cutaway cross sections. This is analogous to the way a [[CAT scan]] reassembles two-dimensional images to form a 3-dimensional representation of the organs being scanned. The ideal would be an animated [[hologram]] of some sort, however, even a simple animation such as the one shown can already give some limited insight into the structure of the polytope.

Another way a three-dimensional viewer can comprehend the structure of a four-dimensional polytope is through being "immersed" in the object, perhaps via some form of [[virtual reality]] technology. To understand how this might work, imagine what one would see if space were filled with cubes. The viewer would be inside one of the cubes, and would be able to see cubes in front of, behind, above, below, to the left and right of himself. If one could travel in these directions, one could explore the array of cubes, and gain an understanding of its geometrical structure. An [[Cubic honeycomb|infinite array of cubes]] is not a polytope in the traditional sense. In fact, it is a tessellation of 3-dimensional ([[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) space. However, a 4-polytope can be considered a tessellation of a 3-dimensional [[non-Euclidean]] space, namely, a tessellation of the surface of a four-dimensional [[sphere]] (a 4-dimensional [[spherical tiling]]).

[[Image:Hyperbolic orthogonal dodecahedral honeycomb.png|thumb|left|[[Order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb|A regular dodecahedral honeycomb]], {5,3,4}, of hyperbolic space projected into 3-space.]]
Locally, this space seems like the one we are familiar with, and therefore, a virtual-reality system could, in principle, be programmed to allow exploration of these "tessellations", that is, of the 4-dimensional regular polytopes. The mathematics department at [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|UIUC]] has a number of pictures of what one would see if embedded in a [[tessellation]] of [[hyperbolic space]] with dodecahedra. Such a tessellation forms an example of an infinite abstract regular polytope.

Normally, for abstract regular polytopes, a mathematician considers that the object is "constructed" if the structure of its [[symmetry group]] is known. This is because of an important theorem in the study of abstract regular polytopes, providing a technique that allows the abstract regular polytope to be constructed from its symmetry group in a standard and straightforward manner.

A '''royalty''' is a payment made by one party, the licensee or franchisee to another that owns a particular asset, the licensor or franchisor for the right to ongoing use of that asset. Royalties are typically agreed upon as a percentage of gross or net revenues derived from the use of an asset or a fixed price per unit sold of an item of such, but there are also other modes and metrics of compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.com.au/pubs/tax/fotaxapr04.htm|title=Focus: Tax and Intellectual Property – April 2004|publisher=Allens Arthur Robinson|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1870&amp;bold=|publisher=law.com|title=Royalty (definition)|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation|year=1996|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|location=Vienna|isbn=92-1-106302-7|author=United Nations Industrial Development Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Guidelines for Evaluation of Transfer of Technology Agreements, United Nations, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=Licensing Guide for Developing Countries: A Guide on the Legal Aspects of the Negotiation and Preparation of Industrial Property Licenses and Technology Transfer Agreements Appropriate to the Needs of Developing Countries|year=1977|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=92-805-0395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNIDO International Workshop on Technology Transfer Negotiation and Plant Level Technology Needs Assessment, 7–8 December 1999, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vertexips.com/information/articles/licensing.html | author=Dave Tyrrell | title=Intellectual Property &amp; Licensing | publisher=Vertex|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''royalty interest''' is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=royalty%20interest | publisher=Schlumberger|title=Royalty interest (definition)|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[license agreement]] defines the terms under which a resource or property are [[license]]d by one party to another, either without restriction or subject to a limitation on term, business or geographic territory, type of product, etc. License agreements can be regulated, particularly where a government is the resource owner, or they can be private contracts that follow a general structure. However, certain types of [[franchising|franchise]] agreements have comparable provisions.{{Clarify|How is this related to royalties?|date=January 2012}}

==Non-renewable resources==
A landowner with petroleum or [[mineral rights]] to their property may license those rights to another party. In exchange for allowing the other party to extract the resources, the landowner receives either a [[resource rent]], or a "royalty payment" based on the value of the resources sold. When a government owns the resource, the transaction often has to follow legal and regulatory requirements.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the United States, [[fee simple]] ownership of mineral rights is possible and payments of royalties to private citizens occurs quite often. Local taxing authorities may impose a [[severance tax]] on the unrenewable natural resources extracted (or severed) from within their authority. The Federal Government receives royalties on production on federal lands, managed by the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], formerly the Minerals Management Service.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

An example from Canada's northern territories is the [[Government of Canada|federal]] [[Frontier Lands]] Petroleum Royalty Regulations. The royalty rate starts at 1% of gross [[revenues]] of the first 18 months of commercial production and increases by 1% every 18 months to a maximum of 5% until initial costs have been recovered, at which point the royalty rate is set at 5% of gross revenues or 30% of net [[revenues]]. In this manner risks and profits are shared between the government of Canada (as resource owner) and the petroleum developer. This attractive royalty rate is intended to encourage oil and gas exploration in the remote Canadian frontier lands where costs and risks are higher than other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law |title=Calculating Royalty |work=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada |year=2010 |accessdate=12 July 2018 |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100036110/1100100036114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions in North America, oil and gas royalty interests are considered real property under the NAICS classification code and qualify for a 1031 like-kind exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilgas1031.com/ |title=oilgas1031.com |publisher=oilgas1031.com |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406234155/http://www.oilgas1031.com/ |archivedate=6 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil and gas royalties are paid as a set percentage on all revenue, less any deductions that may be taken by the well operator as specifically noted in the lease agreement. The revenue decimal, or royalty interest that a mineral owner receives, is calculated as a function of the percentage of the total drilling unit to which a specific owner holds the mineral interest, the royalty rate defined in that owner's mineral lease, and any tract participation factors applied to the specific tracts owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadmoorminerals.com/resources/learn-more-sell-oil-and-gas-royalties-and-interests.html|title=Sell Gas Royalty, Sell Oil Royalty, Sell Mineral Rights &amp; Royalties|work=broadmoorminerals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a standard example, for every $100 bbl of oil sold on a U.S. federal well with a 25% royalty, the U.S. government receives $25. The U.S. government does not pay and will only collect revenues. All risk and liability lie upon the operator of the well.

Royalties in the lumber industry are called "[[stumpage]]".

==Patents==
{{Licensing of patents}}
An [[intangible asset]] such as a [[patent]] right gives the owner an [[exclusive right]] to prevent others from practicing the patented technology in the country issuing the patent for the [[Term of patent|term of the patent]]. The right may be enforced in a lawsuit for [[monetary damages]] and/or imprisonment for violation on the patent. In accordance with a patent license, royalties are paid to the patent owner in exchange for the right to practice one or more of the basic patent rights: to manufacture, to use, to sell, to offer for sale, or to import a patented product, or to perform a patented method.

Patent rights may be divided and licensed out in various ways, on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. The license may be subject to limitations as to time or territory. A license may encompass an entire technology or it may involve a mere component or improvement on a technology. In the United States, "reasonable" royalties may be imposed, both after-the-fact and prospectively, by a court as a remedy for [[patent]] infringement. In patent infringement lawsuits where the court determines an injunction to be inappropriate in light of the case's circumstances, the court may award "ongoing" royalties, or royalties based on the infringer's prospective use of the patented technology, as an alternative remedy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterioneconomics.com/ongoing-royalties-for-patent-infringement.html J. Gregory Sidak, ''Ongoing Royalties for Patent Infringement'', 24 TEX. INTELL. PROP. L.J. at 6 (forthcoming 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; At least one study analyzing a sample of 35 cases in which a court awarded an ongoing royalty has found that ongoing royalty awards "exceed[] by a statistically significant amount the jury-determined reasonably royalty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterioneconomics.com/ongoing-royalties-for-patent-infringement.html J. Gregory Sidak, ''Ongoing Royalties for Patent Infringement'', 24 TEX. INTELL. PROP. L.J. at 14 (forthcoming 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, patent rates within the United States were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ranges of royalty rates, and royalty guidelines, U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry | url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/royalties/ | accessdate = 2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* a pending patent on a strong [[business plan]], royalties of the order of 1%
:* issued patent, 1%+ to 2%
:* the pharmaceutical with pre-clinical testing, 2–3%

In 2002, the Licensing Economics Review found in a review of 458 licence agreements over a 16-year period an average royalty rate of 7% with a range from 0% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Economics Review. The Royalty Rate Journal of Intellectual Property, December 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample: License Parameters |url=http://www.intellectualpropertyanalysis.com/article4.html |accessdate=2007-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413013807/http://www.intellectualpropertyanalysis.com/article4.html |archivedate=13 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of these agreements may not have been at "arms length". In license negotiation, firms might derive royalties for the use of a patented technology from the retail price of the downstream licensed product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J. Gregory Sida|title=The Proper Royalty Base for Patent Damages (10 J.

In Arab countries, a royalty as a percentage of sales may be difficult to transact; a flat fee may be preferred as percentages may be interpreted as percentage of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallat.com/articles/joint_ventures.htm |title=Joint ventures in Lebanese and European law |first=Chibli |last=Mallat |publisher=mallat.com |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614111248/http://www.mallat.com/articles/joint_ventures.htm |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade mark==
[[Trade marks]] are words, logos, slogans, sounds, or other distinctive expressions that distinguish the source, origin, or sponsorship of a good or service (in which they are generally known as [[service mark]]s). Trade marks offer the public a means of identifying and assuring themselves of the quality of the good or service. They may bring consumers a sense of security, integrity, belonging, and a variety of intangible appeals. The value that inures to a trade mark in terms of public recognition and acceptance is known as goodwill.

A trade mark right is an exclusive right to sell or market under that mark within a geographic territory. The rights may be licensed to allow a company other than the owner to sell goods or services under the mark. A company may seek to license a trade mark it did not create in order to achieve instant [[name recognition]] rather than accepting the cost and risk of entering the market under its own brand that the public does not necessarily know or accept. Licensing a trade mark allows the company to take advantage of already-established goodwill and brand identification.

Like patent royalties, trade mark royalties may be assessed and divided in a variety of different ways, and are expressed as a percentage of sales volume or income, or a fixed fee per unit sold. When negotiating rates, one way companies value a trade mark is to assess the additional profit they will make from increased sales and higher prices (sometimes known as the "relief from royalty") method.

Trade mark rights and royalties are often tied up in a variety of other arrangements. Trade marks are often applied to an entire [[brand]] of products and not just a single one. Because trade mark law has as a public interest goal of the protection of a consumer, in terms of getting what they are paying for, trade mark licences are only effective if the company owning the trade mark also obtains some assurance in return that the goods will meet its quality standards. When the rights of trade mark are licensed along with a know-how, supplies, pooled advertising, etc., the result is often a [[franchising|franchise]] relationship. Franchise relationships may not specifically assign royalty payments to the trade mark licence, but may involve monthly fees and percentages of sales, among other payments.

In a long-running dispute in the United States involving the valuation of the DHL trade mark of [[DHL Express|DHL Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=DHL Corporation and Subsidiaries vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Docket Nos. 19570-95, 26103-95, United States Tax Court.| url=http://www.ausinc.com/news/More_on_Trademark.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2007-09-09| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307224114/http://www.ausinc.com/news/More_on_Trademark.pdf| archivedate=7 March 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reported that experts employed by the [[IRS]] surveyed a wide range of businesses and found a broad range of royalties for trade mark use from a low of 0.1% to a high of 15%.

===Franchises===
While a payment to employ a trade mark licence is a royalty, it is accompanied by a "guided usage manual", the use of which may be audited from time to time. However, this becomes a ''supervisory'' task when the mark is used in a [[franchising|franchise]] agreement for the sale of goods or services carrying the reputation of the mark. For a franchise, it is said, a ''fee'' is paid, even though it comprises a royalty element.

To be a franchise, the agreement must be a composite of the items:
::*  the right to use a trade mark to offer, sell or distribute goods or services (the trademark element)
::*  payment of a required royalty or fee (the fee element)
::*  significant assistance or control with respect to the franchisee's business (the supervisory element)

One of the above three items must ''not'' apply for the franchise agreement to be considered a trade mark agreement (and its laws and conventions). In a franchise, for which there is no convention, laws apply concerning training, brand support, operating systems/support and technical support in a written format ("Disclosure").&lt;ref&gt;Dicenstein_brands_2005-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Copyright law gives the owner the right to prevent others from copying, creating [[derivative work]]s, or using their works. Copyrights, like patent rights, can be divided in many different ways, by the right implicated, by specific geographic or market territories, or by more specific criteria. Each may be the subject of a separate license and royalty arrangements.

Copyright royalties are often very specific to the nature of work and field of endeavor. With respect to music, royalties for [[performance right]]s in the United States are set by the [[Library of Congress]]' [[Copyright Royalty Board]]. Performance rights to [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s of a performance are usually managed by one of several [[performance rights organization]]s. Payments from these organizations to performing [[artist]]s are known as [[residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] and performance royalties. [[Royalty-free music]] provides more direct compensation to the artists. In 1999, recording artists formed the [[Recording Artists' Coalition]] to repeal supposedly "technical revisions" to American copyright statutes which would have classified all "sound recordings" as "works for hire", effectively assigning artists' copyrights to [[record label]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Four little words | url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Don Henley Speaks on Behalf of Recording Artists | url=http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=1263  | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060117191640/http://www.yourcongress.com/ViewArticle.asp?article_id=1263 |archivedate = 2006-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Book [[author]]s may sell their [[copyright]] to the [[publishing|publisher]]. Alternatively, they might receive as a royalty a certain amount per book sold. It is common in the UK for example, for authors to receive a 10% royalty on book sales.

Some [[photographer]]s and [[musician]]s may choose to publish their works for a one-time payment. This is known as a [[royalty-free]] license.

==Book publishing==
All book-publishing royalties are paid by the publisher, who determines an author's royalty rate, except in rare cases in which the author can demand high advances and royalties.

For most cases, the publishers advance an amount (part of the royalty) which can constitute the bulk of the author's total income plus whatever little flows from the "running royalty" stream. Some costs may be attributed to the advance paid, which depletes further advances to be paid or from the running royalty paid. The author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author. There are many risks for the author—definition of cover price, the retail price, "net price", the discounts on the sale, the bulk sales on the POD ([[print on demand|publish on demand]]) platform, the term of the agreement, audit of the publishers accounts in case of impropriety, etc. which an agent can provide.

The following illustrates the income to an author on the basis chosen for royalty, particularly in POD, which minimizes losses from [[inventory]] and is based on computer technologies.

Hardback royalties on the published price of trade books usually range from 10% to 12.5%, with 15% for more important authors. On paperback it is usually 7.5% to 10%, going up to 12.5% only in exceptional cases. All the royalties displayed below are on the "cover price". Paying 15% to the author can mean that the other 85% of the cost pays for editing and [[proof-reading]], printing and binding, overheads, and the profits (if any) to the publisher.

The publishing company pays no royalty on bulk purchases of books since the buying price may be a third of the cover price sold on a singles basis.

Unlike the UK, the United States does not specify a "maximum retail price" for books that serves as base for calculation.

===Based on net receipts===

Methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, which demanded increasing discounts from publishers. As a result, rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a book's cover price, publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts. According to ''The Writers' and Artists' Yearbook'' of 1984, under the new arrangement, 'appropriate [upward] adjustments are of course made to the royalty figure and the arrangement is of no disadvantage to the author."&lt;ref name="WAYB"&gt;''The Writers and Artists Yearbook'', 1984, p.422&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this assurance, in 1991, [[Frederick Nolan]], author and former publishing executive, explained that "net receipts" royalties are often more in the interest of publishers than authors:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he receives, but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author. Example: 10,000 copies of a $20 book with a 10 percent cover-price royalty will earn him $20,000. The same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the publisher $90,000; the author's ten percent of that figure yields him $9,000. Which is one reason why publishers prefer "net receipts" contracts....Among the many other advantages (to the publisher) of such contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a 'sheet deal'. In this, the (multinational) publisher of that same 10,000 copy print run, can substantially reduce his printing cost by 'running on' a further 10,000 copies (that is to say, printing but not binding them), and then further profit by selling these 'sheets' at cost-price or even lower if he so chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches, then paying the author 10 percent of 'net receipts' from that deal. The overseas subsidiaries bind up the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the Group as a whole. The only one who loses is the author.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akmedea.com/xQFN.html|title=Malcolm v. Oxford: Fred Nolan|website=www.akmedea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003 two American authors Ken Englade and Patricia Simpson successfully sued HarperCollins (USA) for selling their work to its foreign affiliates at improperly high discounts ("Harper Collins is essentially selling books to itself, at discounted rates, upon which it then calculates the author's royalty, and then Harper Collins shares in the extra profit when the book is resold to the consumer by the foreign affiliates, without paying the author any further royalty.")&lt;ref name="Englade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/englade-v-harpercollins-publishers|title=Casetext|website=casetext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This forced a "class action" readjustment for thousands of authors contracted by HarperCollins between November 1993 and June 1999.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akmedea.com/englade1.html|title=Englade &amp; Simpson vs. HarperCollins|website=www.akmedea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music ==
Unlike other forms of intellectual property, music royalties have a strong linkage to individuals – composers (score), songwriters (lyrics) and writers of musical plays – in that they can own the exclusive copyright to created music and can license it for performance independent of corporates. Recording companies and the performing artists that create a "sound recording" of the music enjoy a separate set of copyrights and royalties from the sale of recordings and from their digital transmission (depending on national laws).

With the advent of pop music and major innovations in technology in the communication and presentations of media, the subject of music royalties has become a complex field with considerable change in the making.

A [[musical composition]] obtains copyright protection as soon as it is written out or recorded. But it is not protected from infringed use unless it is registered with the copyright authority, for instance, the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] in the United States, which is administered by the [[Library of Congress]]. No person or entity, other than the copyright owner, can use or employ the music for gain without obtaining a license from the composer/songwriter.

Inherently, as copyright, it confers on its owner, a distinctive "bundle" of five exclusive rights:

: (a) to make copies of the songs through print or recordings
: (b) to distribute them to the public for profit
: (c) to the "public performance right"; live or through a recording
: (d) to create a derivative work to include elements of the original music; and
: (e) to "display" it (not very relevant in context).

Where the score and the lyric of a composition are contributions of different persons, each of them is an equal owner of such rights.

These exclusivities have led to the evolution of distinct commercial terminology used in the music industry.

They take four forms:
: (1) royalties from "print rights"
: (2)  ''mechanical royalties'' from the recording of composed music on CDs and tape
: (3)  ''performance royalties'' from the performance of the compositions/songs on stage or television through artists and bands, and
: (4)  ''synch (for synchronization) royalties'' from using or adapting the musical score in the movies, television advertisements, etc. and

With the advent of the internet, an additional set of royalties has come into play: the ''digital rights'' from simulcasting, webcasting, streaming, downloading, and online "on-demand service".

In the following the terms "composer" and "songwriter" (either lyric or score) are synonymous.

===Print rights in music===
While the focus here is on royalty rates pertaining to music marketed in the print form or "sheet music", its discussion is a prelude to the much more important and larger sources of royalty income today from music sold in media such as CDs, television and the internet.

[[Sheet music]] is the first form of music to which royalties were applied, which was then gradually extended to other formats. Any performance of music by singers or bands requires that it be first reduced to its written sheet form from which the "song" (score) and its lyric are read. Otherwise, the authenticity of its origin, essential for copyright claims, will be lost, as was the case with folk songs and American "westerns" propagated by the oral tradition.

====Brief history====
The ability to print music arises from a series of technological developments in print and art histories over a long span of time (from the 11th to the 18th century) of which two will be highlighted.

The first, and commercially successful, invention was the development of the "movable type" printing press, the [[Gutenberg press]] in the 15th century. It was used to print the well-known Gutenberg Bible and later the printing system enabled printed music. Printed music, till then, tended to be one line chants. The difficulty in using movable type for music is that all the elements must align – the note head must be properly aligned with the staff, lest it have an unintended meaning.

[[Musical notation]] was well developed by then, originating around 1025. [[Guido d'Arezzo]] developed a system of pitch notation using lines and spaces. Until this time, only two lines had been used. Guido expanded this system to four lines, and initiated the idea of ledger lines by adding lines above or below these lines as needed. He used square notes called neumes. This system eliminated any uncertainty of pitch which existed at that time. Guido also developed a system of clefs, which became the basis for our clef system: bass clef, treble clef, and so on. (Co-existing civilizations used other forms of notation).

In Europe, the major consumers of printed music in the 17th and 18th centuries were the [[Court (royal)|royal courts]] for both solemn and festive occasions. Music was also employed for entertainment, both by the courts and the nobility. Composers made their livings from commissioned work, and worked as conductors, performers and tutors of music or through appointments to the courts. To a certain extent, music publishers also paid composers for rights to print music, but this was not royalty as it is generally understood today.

The European [[Christian Church|Church]] was also a large user of music, both religious and secular. However, performances were largely based on hand-written music or aural training.

=====American contribution: The Origins of Music Copyright and Royalties=====
Until the mid-18th century, American popular music largely consisted of songs from the British Isles, whose lyric and score were sometimes available in engraved prints. Mass production of music was not possible until the movable type was introduced. Music with this type was first printed in the US in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Printing &amp; Publishing of Music - A Short History &amp; How it is Done | url = http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/printing/printing.php | accessdate =2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning the type consisted of the notehead, stem and staff which were combined into a single [[font]]. Later the fonts were made up of the notehead, stems and flags attached to the staff line. Until that time, prints existed only on engraved plates.

The first federal law on copyright was enacted in the US [[Copyright Act of 1790]] which made it possible to give protection to original scores and lyrics.

America's most prominent contribution is [[jazz]] and all the music styles which preceded and co-exist with it – its variations on church music, African-American work songs, [[field holler|cornfield hollers]], wind bands in funeral procession, blues, rag, etc. – and of innovations in church music, rhythmic variations, stamping, tapping of feet, strutting, shuffling, wailing, laments and spiritual ecstasy.

Until its recent sophistication, jazz was not amenable to written form, and thus not copyrightable, due to its improvisational element and the fact that many of the creators of this form could not read or write music.&lt;ref&gt;Carter Harman, ''A Popular History of Music'', Dell Publishing Company, New York, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; It was its precursor, [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], which came to be written and royalties paid for the use of popular music.

[[Blackface]] minstrelsy was the first distinctly American theatrical form. In the 1830s and 1840s, it was at the core of the rise of an American music industry. &lt;ref&gt;Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians, Elizabeth C. Axford, Scarecrow Press, 2004,{{ISBN|0-8108-5027-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephen Foster]] was the pre-eminent songwriter in the United States of that time. His songs, such as "[[Oh! Susanna]]", "[[Camptown Races]]", "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]", "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]" and "[[Swanee River (song)|Swanee River]]" remain popular 150 years after their composition and have worldwide appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibeliusmusic.com/index.php?sm=home.score&amp;?scoreid=127497|title=Score Exchange - Page not found|work=sibeliusmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster composed songs for [[Christy's Minstrels]], one of the prominent minstrel groups of the time.

Foster had little formal music training. While he was able to publish several songs before he was twenty, his sophistication came from Henry Kleber and Dan Rice. Kleber was a classically trained German immigrant, and Rice was a popular blackface performer who befriended Foster. But it was his joining the Christy Minstrels which made him, and his songs, favorites in North America.

W.C. Peters was the first major publisher of Foster's works, but Foster saw very little of the profits. "Oh, Susanna" was an overnight success and a [[Goldrush]] favorite but Foster received just $100 from his publisher for it - in part due to his lack of interest in money and the free gifts of music he gave to him. Foster's first love lay in writing music and its success. Foster did later contract with Christy (for $15 each) for "Old Folks at Home" and "Farewell my Lilly Dear". "Oh, Susanna" also led Foster to two New York publishers, Firth, Pond and Co. and F.D. Benson, who contracted with him to pay royalties at 2 cents for every printed copy sold by them.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth C. Axford, ''Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004,{{ISBN|0-8108-5027-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-5027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minstrelsy slowly gave way to songs generated by the American Civil War, followed by the rise of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Parlour music]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/printing/printing.php |title=Printing &amp; Publishing of Music. A Short History &amp; How it is Done |publisher=parlorsongs.com |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which led to an explosion of sheet music, greatly aided by the emergence of the [[player piano]]. While the player piano was to make inroads deep into the 20th century, more and more music was reproduced through [[radio]] and the [[phonograph]], leading to new forms of royalty payments, but leading to the decline of sheet music.

American innovations in church music also provided royalties to its creators. While Stephen Foster is often credited as the originator of print music in America, [[William Billings]] is the real father of American music. In 1782, of the 264 music compositions in print, 226 were his church-related compositions. Similarly, Billings was the composer of a quarter of the 200 anthems published until 1810. Neither he nor his family saw any royalties, although the Copyright Act of 1790 was in place by then.

Church music plays a significant part in American print royalties. When the Lutheran Church split from the Catholic Church in the 16th century, more than religion changed. [[Martin Luther]] wanted his entire congregation to take part in the music of his services, not just the choir. This new chorale style finds its way in both present church music and jazz.

===Print royalties (music)===
The royalty rate for printing a book (a novel, lyrics or music) globally, or its download, for sale varies from 20-30% of the suggested retail sales value, typically 20–25%, for a new writer that is taken by the publisher/distributor. The payment is made by the publisher/distributor and corresponds to the agreement (license) between the writer and the publisher/distributor as with other music royalties. The agreement is typically non-exclusive to the publisher and the term may vary from 3–5 years. Established writers favor certain publishers/distributors and usually receive higher royalties.

All of the royalty does not occur to the writer. It is shared with the publisher on of book sales income on a 50:50 basis.

If a book involved is a play, it might be [[drama]]tized. The right to dramatize is a separate right – known as a [[grand right]]. This income is shared by the many personalities and organizations who come together to offer the play: the playwright, composer of the music played, producer, director of the play and so forth. There is no convention to the royalties paid for grand rights and it is freely negotiated between the publisher and the mentioned participants.

If the writer's work is only part of a publication, then the royalty paid is ''[[pro-rata]]'', a facet which is more often met in a book of lyrics or in a book of hymns and sometimes in an anthology.

Church music – that is, music that is based on written work – is important particularly in the Americas and in some other countries of Europe. Examples are hymns, anthems and songbooks. Unlike novels and plays, hymns are sung with regularity. Very often, the hymns and songs are sung from lyrics in a book, or more common nowadays, from the work projected on computer screen. In the US, the Christian Copyright Licensing International, Inc. is the collection agency for royalties but song or hymn writers have to be registered with them and the songs identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingalls|first=Monique M.|title=The Evangelical British Invasion: Challenging Boundaries, Transforming Congregational Song|journal=IASPM Conference|date=30 May 2009|url=http://iaspm-us.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Ingalls.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2011|location=San Diego, California|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205120049/http://iaspm-us.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Ingalls.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign publishing===
Viewed from a US perspective, foreign publishing involves two basic types of publishing – sub-publishing and co-publishing occurrences in one or more territories outside that of basic origin. Sub-publishing, itself, is one of two forms: sub-publishers who merely license out the original work or those which make and sell the products which are the subject of the license, such as print books and records (with local artists performing the work).

Sub-publishers who produce and market a product retain 10–15% of the marked retail price and remit the balance to the main publisher with whom they have the copyright license. Those sub-publishers who merely license out the work earn between 15–25%.&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Bergman, [http://www.alanbergman.com/musicbusinesslanguage.pdf ''The Language of the Music Business'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical royalties===
Although the terms "mechanical" and [[mechanical license]] have their origins in the [[piano roll]]s on which music was recorded in the early part of the 20th century, the scope of their modern usage is much wider and covers any copyrighted audio composition that is rendered mechanically (i.e., without human performers).  As such, it includes:
:* [[Compact disc]]s, [[vinyl records]] and tape recordings
:* music videos
:* [[ringtone]]s
:* [[MIDI]] files
:* downloaded tracks
:* DVDs, VHS, UMDs
:* computer games
:* musical toys etc.

The United States treatment of mechanical royalties differs markedly from international practice.  In the United States, while the right to use copyrighted music for making records for public distribution (for private use) is an exclusive right of the composer, the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] provides that ''once'' the music is so recorded, anyone else can record the composition/song without a negotiated license but on the payment of the statutory compulsory royalty. Thus, its use by different artists could lead to several separately owned copyrighted "sound recordings".

The following is a partial segment of the compulsory rates as they have applied from 1998 to 2007 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Compulsory Rates for Mechanical royalties | url= http://www.copyright.gov/carp/m200a.html | accessdate= 2007-10-15 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011074348/http://copyright.gov/carp/m200a.html | archivedate= 11 October 2007 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The royalty rates in the table have two elements: (i) a minimum rate applies for a duration equivalent to 5 minutes, or less, of a musical composition/song and (ii) a per-minute rate if the composition exceeds it, whichever is greater.

In the predominant case, the composer assigns the song copyright to a publishing company under a "publishing agreement" which makes the publisher exclusive owner of the composition. The publisher's role is to promote the music by extending the written music to ''recordings'' of vocal, instrumental and orchestral arrangements and to administer the collection of royalties (which, as will shortly be seen, is in reality done by specialized companies). The publisher also licenses 'subpublishers' domestically and in other countries to similarly promote the music and administer the collection of royalties.

In a fair publishing agreement, every 100 units of currency that flows to the publisher gets divided as follows: 50 units go to the songwriter and 50 units to the publisher minus operating and administrative fees and applicable taxes. However, the music writer obtains a further 25 units from the publisher's share, if the music writer retains a portion of the music publishing rights (as a co-publisher). In effect, the co-publishing agreement is a 50/50 share of royalties in favor of the songwriter if administrative costs of publishing are disregarded. This is near international practice.

When a company (recording label) records the composed music, say, on a CD master, it obtains a distinctly ''separate'' copyright to the sound recording, with all the exclusivities that flow to such copyright. The main obligation of the recording label to the songwriter and her publisher is to pay the contracted royalties on the license received.

While the compulsory rates remain unaffected, recording companies in the U.S. typically will negotiate to pay not more than 75% of the compulsory rate where the songwriter is also the recording artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= 'Reduced Rate' Royalties| url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-clauses.html |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will further (in the U.S.) extend that to a maximum of 10 songs, even though the marketed recording may carry more than that number. This 'reduced rate' results from the incorporation of a "controlled composition" clause in the licensing contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Royalties on Controlled Composition |url=http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-clauses.html |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since the composer as recording artist is seen to control the content of the recording.

Mechanical royalties for music produced outside of the United States are negotiated – there being no [[Compulsory license|compulsory licensing]] – and royalty payments to the composer and her publisher for recordings are based on the wholesale, retail, or "suggested retail value" of the marketed CDs.

''Recording artists'' earn royalties only from the ''sale'' of CDs and tapes and, as will be seen later, from sales arising from [[digital rights]]. Where the [[songwriter]] is also the recording artist, royalties from CD sales add to those from the [[recording contract]].

In the U.S., recording artists earn royalties amounting to 10%–25% (of the [[suggested retail price]] of the recording&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-recording.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106132315/http://www.ascap.com/musicbiz/money-recording.html |date=6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on their popularity but such is before deductions for "packaging", "breakage", "promotion sales" and holdback for "returns", which act to significantly reduce net royalty incomes.

In the U.S., the [[Harry Fox Agency]], HFA, is the predominant licensor, collector and distributor for mechanical royalties, although there are several small competing organizations. For its operations, it charges about 6% as commission. HFA, like its counterparts in other countries, is a state-approved quasi-monopoly and is expected to act in the interests of the composers/songwriters – and thus obtains the right to audit record company sales. Additional third party administrators such as [[RightsFlow]] provide services to license, account and pay mechanical royalties and are growing. RightsFlow is paid by the licensees (artists, labels, distributors, online music services) and in turn does not extract a commission from the mechanical royalties paid out.&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Ed, Billboard, 11 March 2011, [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/rightsflow-builds-a-business-around-clearing-1005083892.story "RightsFlow Builds A Business Around Clearing Song Rights"]. Retrieved 2011-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]], MCPS (now in alliance with PRS), acts to collect (and distribute) royalties to composers, songwriters and publishers for CDs and for digital formats. It is a [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit organization]] which funds its work through a commissions on aggregate revenues. The royalty rate for licensing tracks is 6.5% of retail price (or 8.5% of the published wholesale price).

In Europe, the major licensing and mechanical royalty collection societies are:

: [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]] in France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thorne|first=Michelle|title=Improbable Match: CC And Collecting Societies In Europe|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10819|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Creative Commons|date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Kevin J.|title=Royalty Dispute Stops Music Videos in Germany|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/internet/03youtube.html|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: SFA in Italy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scfitalia.it/webnew/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013054358/http://www.scfitalia.it/webnew/ |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SACEM acts collectively for "francophone" countries in Africa. The UK society also has strong links with English-speaking African countries.

Mechanical societies for other countries can be found at the main national collection societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

The mechanical royalty rate paid to the publisher in Europe is about 6.5% on the [[Published Price to Dealer]] (PPD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Language of the Music Business | url= http://www.alanbergman.com/articles.htm |accessdate= 2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record companies are responsible for paying royalties to those artists who have performed for a recording based on the sale of CDs by retailers.

===Performance===
"Performance" in the music industry can include any of the following:

:* a performance of a song or composition – live, recorded or broadcast
:* a live performance by any musician
:* a performance by any musician through a recording on physical media
:* performance through the playing of recorded music
:* music performed through the web (digital transmissions)

In the United Kingdom, the [[Church of England]] is specifically exempted from performance royalties for music performed in services because it is a state-established church. Traditionally, American music publishers have not sought performance royalties for music sung and played in church services–the license to perform being implied by distributors of church sheet music. [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], and [[SESAC]] exempt church worship services from performance royalties, but make no exemption for church-hosted concerts.

It is useful to treat these royalties under two classifications:

:(a) those associated with conventional forms of music distribution which have prevailed for most part of the 20th century, and
:(b) those from emerging 'digital rights' associated with newer forms of communication, entertainment and media technologies (from 'ring tones' to 'downloads' to 'live internet streaming'.

====Conventional forms of royalty payment====
In the conventional context, royalties are paid to composers and publishers and record labels for public performances of their music on vehicles such as the jukebox, stage, radio or TV. Users of music need to obtain a "performing rights license" from music societies – as will be explained shortly – to use the music. Performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés, skating rinks, etc.

Licensing is generally done by music societies called "Performing Rights Organizations" (PROs), ''some'' of which are government-approved or government-owned, to which the composer, the publisher, performer (in some cases) or the record label have subscribed.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bemuso-A.jpg|right|frame]] --&gt;

The diagram on the right titled "The Performance Rights Complex"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |title=Diagram courtesy |url=http://www.bemuso.com |publisher=bemuso.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the general sequences by which a song or a composition gets to be titled a "performance" and which brings royalties to songwriters/publishers, performing artists and record labels. How, and to whom, royalties are paid is different in the United States from what it is, for example, in the UK. Most countries have "practices" more in common with the UK than the US.

In the United Kingdom there are three principal organizations:

:(i) [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] (PPL)
:(ii) [[PRS for Music]] (formerly the Performing Right Society)
:(iii) [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] (MCPS)

who license music (to music-users) and act as royalty collection and distribution agencies for their members.

PPL issues performance licenses to all UK radio, TV and broadcast stations, as well as establishments who employ sound recordings (tapes, CDs), in entertaining the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='CITCO hotels cannot play PPL music'|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/citco-hotels-cannot-play-ppl-music/731460/|accessdate=12 December 2011|newspaper=Indian Express|date=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing company collects and distributes royalties to the "record label" for the sound recording and to "featured UK performers"  in the recording. Performers do not earn from sound recordings on video and film.

PRS, which is now in alliance with MCPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prsformusic.com/Pages/default.aspx |title=PRS for Music homepage |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127124500/http://prsformusic.com/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; collects royalties from music-users and distributes them directly to "song-writers" and "publishers" whose works are performed live, on radio or on TV on a 50:50 basis. MCPS licenses music for broadcast in the range 3 to 5.25% of net advertising revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Songwriters challenge UK online royalty rate | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/07/uk_music_downloads_royalty_dispute/ |publisher=The Register|date=7 November 2005 |accessdate =2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MCPS also collects and disburses mechanical royalties to writers and publishers in a manner similar to PRS. Although allied, they serve, for now, as separate organizations for membership.

The next diagram shows the sequences in the licensing of performances and the royalty collection and distribution process in the UK.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Every song or recording has a unique identity by which they are licensed and tracked. Details of songs or recordings are notified to the PROs directly, or through Catco, an electronic tracking system. It needs to be clarified that while blanket licenses are commonly issued to music-users, the latter are responsible for "usage returns" – the actual frequency of performances under the license – which then becomes the basis for the PRO to apportion royalties to writers, publishers and record labels. ("DIY indies" are  "do-it-yourself" independent songwriters – and, often, the performers as well – who record and publish under their own labels). In the UK, music is licensed (and royalties paid on it) ''at the track level''.

There is also a separate organization in the UK called VPL, which is the collecting society set up by the record industry in 1984 to grant licenses to users of music videos, e.g. broadcasters, program-makers, video jukebox system suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppluk.com/ |title=VPL |publisher=Ppluk.com |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing income collected from users is paid out to the society's members after administrative costs are deducted.

There are different models for royalty collection in the European countries. In some of them, mechanical and performing rights are administered jointly. SACEM (France), SABAM (Belgium), GEMA (Germany) and JASRAC (Japan) work that way.

In the United States, in contrast, the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers|ASCAP]], BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc) and [[SESAC]] (Society of European Stage Authors &amp; Composers) are the three principal Performance Rights Organizations (PROs), although smaller societies exist. The royalty that is paid to the composer and publisher is determined by the method of assessment used by the PRO to gage the utilization of the music, there being no external metrics as in mechanical royalties or the reporting system used in the UK. Very basically, a PRO aggregates the royalties that are due to all of the composers/songwriters "who are its members" and each composer and publisher is paid royalties based on the assessed frequency of the music's performance, post deductions of charges (which are many). The PROs are audited agencies. They "directly" pay the songwriter and the publisher their respective shares. (If part of the publisher's share is retained by the songwriter, the publisher pays the songwriter that part of the publisher's share).

Typically, the PRO negotiates blanket licenses with radio stations, television networks and other "music users", each of whom receives the right to perform any of the music in the repertoire of the PRO for a set sum of money.

PROs use different types of surveys to determine the frequency of usage of a composition/song. ASCAP uses [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]], SESAC utilizes cue sheets for TV performances and 'digital pattern recognition' for radio performances while BMI employs more scientific methods.

In the United States only the composer and the publisher are paid performance royalties and not performing artists (digital rights being a different matter). Likewise, the record label, whose music is used in a performance, is not entitled to royalties in the US on the premise that performances lead sales of records.

Where a performance has co-writers along with the composer/songwriter – as in a musical play – they will share the royalty.

====In digital distribution====
=====US regulatory provisions=====
Regulatory provisions in the US, EU and elsewhere is in a state of flux, continuously being challenged by developments in technology; thus almost any regulation stated here exists in a tentative format.

The US [[Copyright Act of 1976]] identified "musical works" and "[[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]]" eligible for copyright protection. The term "musical work" refers to the [[Musical composition|notes]] and [[Songwriter|lyrics]] of a song or a piece of music, while a "sound recording" results from its fixation on physical media. Copyright owners of musical works are granted exclusive rights to license over-the-air radio and TV broadcasts, entitling them royalties, which are, as said earlier, collected and distributed by the PROs. Under the Act, [[Record label|record companies]] and recording artists are, presently, not entitled to royalties from radio and TV broadcasts of their music, except in the case of digital services and [[webcast]]s where copyright owners and performers obtain royalties (see later). This is in contrast to international standards where performers also obtain royalties from over-the-air and digital broadcasting.

In 1995, the Congress introduced the ''[[Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act|Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA)]]'', which became effective 1 Feb 1996. This Act granted owners of ''sound recordings'' the exclusive license to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of digital audio transmissions but it exempted non-subscription services (and some other services). Where the rights owner could not voluntarily reach agreement with the [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]], it could avail of compulsory licensing provisions. Under the Act, the compulsory royalty (the royalty schedule follows) was to be shared in the manner: 50% to the record companies, 45% to featured artists, 2½% to non-featured musicians through [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) in the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Federation of Musicians |url=http://www.afm.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961023234517/http://www.afm.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 1996 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2½% for non-featured vocalists through [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Federation of Television and Radio Artists | url=http://www.aftra.org | accessdate=2008-02-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720195027/http://www.aftra.org/ | archivedate=20 July 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress]] also created a new compulsory license for certain subscription digital audio services, which transmit sound recordings via cable television and [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) on a non-interactive basis in the absence of a voluntary negotiation and agreement.

In 1998, the Congress amended DPRA to create the '''[[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)]]''' by redefining the above-noted subscription services of DPRA as "preexisting subscription services" and expanded the statutory license to include new categories of digital audio services that may operate under the license. In effect, DMCA created three categories of licensees:

# pre-existing satellite digital audio radio services
# new subscription services, and
# eligible non-subscription transmission services.

In addition to the above, a fourth license was created permit webcasters to make "ephemeral recordings" of a sound recording (temporary copies) to facilitate streaming but with a royalty to be paid.

Non-subscription webcasting royalties have also to be shared between record companies and performers in the proportions set out under DPRA.

The Table below titled SUMMARY OF STATUTORY ROYALTY RATES FOR DIGITAL WEBCASTING - UNITED STATES encapsulates the royalties set for non-interactive webcasting.

To qualify for compulsory licensing under non-subscription services, the webcasting needs to fit the following six criteria:

:* it is non-interactive
:* it does not exceed the sound recording performance complement
:* it is accompanied by information on the song title and recording artist
:* it does not publish a program schedule or specify the songs to be transmitted
:* it does not automatically switch from one program channel to another, and
:* it does not allow a user to request songs to be played particularly for that user.

An ''inter-active service'' is one which allows a listener to receive a specially created internet stream in which she dictates the songs to be played by selecting songs from the [[website]] menu. Such a service would take the website out from under the compulsory license and require negotiations with the copyright owners.

However, a service is non-interactive if it permits people to request songs which are then played to the public at large. Nonetheless, several rules apply such as, within any three-hour period, three cuts from a CD, but no more than two cuts consecutively can be played, or a site can play four songs from any singer from a boxed CD-set, but no more than three cuts consecutively.

Both interactive and non-interactive streaming services are required and regulated by the Copyright Royalty Judges to pay out a minimum fee per stream. Interactive services must pay out $0.0022 per stream while non-interactive streaming services must pay $0.0017 per stream. These rates are set to be what these services are required to distribute per stream and has been the rate since January 1, 2016 and will be reevaluated after December 31, 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[SoundExchange]], a non-profit organization, is defined under the legislation to act on behalf of record companies (including the majors) to license performance and reproduction rights and negotiate royalties with the broadcasters. It is governed by a board of artist and label representatives. Services include track level accounting of performances to all ''members'' and collection and distribution of foreign royalties to all members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Sound Exchange|url=http://www.soundexchange.com|accessdate =2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a voluntary agreement between the SoundExchange and the broadcasters, [[Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel]] (CARP) was authorized to set the statutory rates as could prevail between a "willing buyer" and "willing sellers". SoundExchange handles only the collection of royalties from "compulsory licenses" for non-interactive streaming services that use satellite, cable or internet methods of distribution.

To recap, under the law three types of licenses are required for streaming of musical recordings:

:(a) a performance license applicable for underlying words( lyrics) and music (score)
:(b) a performance license applicable to the streaming the sound recording
:(c) a storage license for the passage of a sound recording through a file server

The royalties for the first of the above two licenses are obtained from SoundExchange and the third from the PROs. Failure to make required payments constitutes copyright infringement and is subject to statutory damages.

Both broadcasters involved in webcasting and pure-Internet non-broadcasters are required to pay these royalties under the rules framed under the Act. All webcasters are also required to be registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]].

In 2017, 82% of revenues for the entire music industry was attributed to digital music services. Streaming accounted for 67% of revenues in the US music industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.riaa.com/facts/], The Recording Industry Association of America® (RIAA), All Music Facts&lt;/ref&gt;

=====UK legislation=====
The United Kingdom adopted the [[Copyright Directive|European Copyright Directive]] (EUCD) in 2003 and the meaning of broadcast performance was broadened to cover "communicating to the public". This then included music distribution through the internet and the transmission of [[ringtone]]s to mobiles. Thus a music download was a "copy" of proprietary music and hence required to be licensed.

After a prolonged battle on royalties between online music companies such as [[AOL]], [[Napster]] and the recording companies (but not all of them), represented by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), and organizations representing the interests of songwriters ([[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] and [[PRS for Music|PRS]]) a compromise was reached, leading to a subsequent 3-year interim legislation (2007) adopted by the UK [[Copyright Tribunal]] under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interim Settlement of Digital Royalty Rates (Music), United Kingdom |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ctribunaldownloadingdecision.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate =2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation, referring to a new JOL (Joint Online License), applies only to music purchased within UK.

The applicable royalties are given in the table below which, also includes music downloads and music services through mobile devices. This path-breaking legislation is expected to become the model for EU (which is yet to develop comprehensive legislation), and perhaps even extend to the US.

Note that the new legislation includes the distinction between downloads of musical tracks from iTunes and other stores, which were considered "sales" and the webcasts considered "performances".

In brief, the compromise reached is that songwriters will receive 8% of '''gross revenues''' (definition follows), less [[VAT]], as royalty for each track downloaded bridging the demand of the artists demanding a 12% royalty rate (what was, otherwise, the norm for a CD) and music companies holding out for 6.5%, slightly higher than the 5.7% paid for a 79p track sold by iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists bid for CD parity on digital royalties |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/78202/artists-bid-for-cd-parity-on-digital-royalties.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211115552/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/78202/artists-bid-for-cd-parity-on-digital-royalties.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-12-11 |accessdate=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum of four pence will be paid, in the new legislation, if tracks are discounted.

The terms used in the legislated Table are explained following it.

Not all music providers in the UK were part of the compromise that led to the legislation. For those not participating - principally, AOL, [[Yahoo!]] and RealNetworks - the Tribunal set the royalty rate for pure webcasting at 5.75%.

UK legislation recognizes the term '''[[Online and offline|online]]''' as referring to downloading digital files from the internet and mobile network operators.  '''Offline''' is the term used for the delivery of music through physical media such as a CD or a DVD.

A '''stream''' is a file of continuous music listened to through a consumer's receiving device with no playable copy of the music remaining.

'''Permanent Downloads''' are transfers (sale) of music from a website to a computer or mobile telephone for permanent retention and use whenever the purchaser wishes, analogous to the purchase of a CD.

A '''Limited Download''' is similar to a permanent download but differs from it in that the consumer's use of the copy is in some way restricted by associated technology; for instance, becomes unusable when the subscription ends (say, through an encoding, such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], of the downloaded music).

'''On-demand streaming''' is music streamed to the listener on the computer or mobile to enable her to listen to the music once, twice or a number of times during the period of subscription to the service.

'''Pure Webcasting''' is where the user receives a stream of pre-programmed music chosen "by the music service provider". It is non-interactive to the extent that even pausing or skipping of tracks is not possible.

'''Premium and Interactive Webcasting''' are personalized subscription services intermediate between pure webcasting and downloading.

'''Special webcasting''' is a service where the user can choose a stream of music, the majority of which comprises works from one source – an artist, group or particular concert.

'''Simulcasting''', although not in the Table above, is the simultaneous re-transmission by a licensed transmission of the program of a [[radio]] or [[TV station]] over the internet of an otherwise traditional broadcast. The person receiving the simulcast normally makes no permanent copy of it. It is defined in the legislation as an offline service.

''''Gross Revenue'''', which is comprehensively defined in the legislation, summarized here, means, all revenue received (or receivable) by the licensee from Users, all revenue received through advertisements associated with the music service, sponsorship fees, commissions from third parties and revenue arising from barter or contra deals. No deductions are permitted except for refunds of unused music due to technical faults.

The advertising revenue which is shared between the artist and music provider is defined as:
* when the advertising is in-stream;
* when the music offered forms the only content of a page featuring advertising (excluding the advertisement itself); and
* when the music offered forms more than 75% of a page featuring advertising (excluding the advertisement itself).

===Synchronization===
According to Joel Mabus, the term [[synchronization]] "comes from the early days of the [[talkies]] when music was first synchronized with film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelmabus.com/royalties.htm |title=Royalties |publisher=Joelmabus.com |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology originated in US industry but has now spread worldwide.

In the UK and elsewhere, with the exception of the US, there is apparently no legal prohibition to the combination of audio and visual images and no explicit statutory right for the collection of synch royalties. In the US, however, the Copyright Act defines the audiovisual format as that of combining images with music for use in machines and there is no explicit rate set such as the "compulsory royalty rate" for copying music. However, there are instances of courts implying the synchronization right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintons.co.uk/?news_id=38 |title=US Court Recognises Existence of a "Sync Right" |publisher=Clintons |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6128717C16DB42D8882573C400597DC7/$file/0655102.pdf?openelement]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018084025/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6128717C16DB42D8882573C400597DC7/%24file/0655102.pdf?openelement |date=18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but even so, it is an amorphous colloquial commercial term of acceptance.

Synchronization royalties ("sync licenses") are paid for the use of copyrighted music in (largely) audiovisual productions, such as in DVDs, movies, and advertisements. Music used in news tracks are also synch licenses. Synchronization can extend to live media performances, such as plays and live theatre. They become extremely important for new media - the usage of music in the form of [[mp3]], [[wav]], [[flac]] files and for usage in [[webcasts]], embedded media in microchips (e.g. [[karaoke]]), etc. but the legal conventions are yet to be drawn.

Synchronization royalties are due to the composer/songwriter or his/her publisher. They are strictly contractual in nature and vary greatly in amount depending on the subjective importance of the music, the mode of production and the media used. The royalty payable is that of mutual acceptance but is conditioned by industry practice.

It is useful to note in this connection the concept of the "needle drop" (now laser drop) in that the synch royalty becomes payable every time the needle drops 'on the record player' in a public performance. All openings and closings, every cut to advertisements, every cut back from ads, all re-runs shown by every TV company, in every country in the world generates a "synchro", although a single payment may be renegotiable in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current UK Limited Synchronisation Licence example |url=http://i.current.com/pdf/music_sync_uk.pdf |publisher=i.current.com |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213413/http://i.current.com/pdf/music_sync_uk.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a category of [[royalty free music]] in the field of synchronization. This refers to the use of music in a "library" for which a one-time royalty has been negotiated. It is an alternative to needle-drop negotiation.

In terms of numbers, royalties can range from, say. $500–2000 for a "festival-use license" to $250,000 or more for a movie film score. For low-budget films, which are deemed less than $2 million, the royalties range from 3%–6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VanReece |first=Nancy |url=http://www.musesmuse.com/pubart.html |title=Songwriting Articles: Publishing |publisher=North American Folk Alliance Newsletter |agency=The Muse's Muse |date=September 1998 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or could be per song per usage.

===Audio Home Recording Act of 1992===
In the US, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] became effective law in October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1001- |title=United States Code: Title 17,1001. Definitions |publisher=Legal Information Institute: Cornell University Law School |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law enabled the release of recordable digital formats such as Sony and Philips' Digital Audio Tape without fear of contributory infringement lawsuits.

==Art royalties==

===Resale royalty or ''droit de suite''===
Art Resale Royalty is a right to a royalty payment upon resales of art works, that applies in some jurisdictions. Whilst there are currently approximately 60 countries that have some sort of Resale Royalty on their statute books, evidence of resale schemes that can be said to be actually  operating schemes is restricted to Europe, Australia and the American state of California. For example, in May 2011 the European commissions ec.europa webpage on Resale royalty stated that, under the heading  'Indicative list of third countries (Article 7.2)'  :
'A letter was sent to Member States on 1 March 2006 requesting that they provide a list of third countries which meet these requirements and that they also provide evidence of application. '''To date the Commission has not been supplied with evidence for any third country which demonstrates that they qualify for inclusion on this list'''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/resale-right/resale-right_en.htm |title=» Internal Market &amp;raquo Copyright &amp;raquo Resale Right |publisher=European Commission: The EU Single Market |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [The emphasis is from the European commission web page.]

Apart from placing a levy on the resale of some art-like objects, there are few common facets to the various national schemes. Most schemes prescribe a minimum amount that the artwork must receive before the artist can invoke resale rights ( usually the hammer price or price). Some countries prescribe and others such as Australia, do not prescribe, the maximum royalty that can be received. Most do prescribe the calculation basis of the royalty. Some country's make the usage of the royalty compulsory. Some country's prescribe a sole monopoly collection service agency, while others like the UK and France, allow multiple agencies. Some schemes involve varying degrees of retrospective application and other schemes such as Australia's are not retrospective at all.
In some cases, for example Germany, an openly tax-like use is made of the "royalties"; Half of the money collected is redistributed to fund public programs.

The New Zealand and Canadian governments have not proceeded with any sort of artist resale scheme. The Australian scheme does not apply to the ''first'' resale of artworks purchased ''prior to the schemes enactment''( June 2010) and individual usage of the right (by Australian artists) is not compulsory. In Australia artists have a case by case right (under clause 22/23 of the Act) to refuse consent to the usage of the right by the appointed collection society and/or make their own collection arrangements. Details of the Australian scheme can be gotten from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resaleroyalty.org.au/ |title=About the artists resale royalty scheme |publisher=resaleroyalty.org.au |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the website of the sole appointed Australian agency; The "Copyright Agency Limited".

The UK scheme is in the context of common-law countries an oddity; No other common-law country has mandated an individual economic right where actual usage of the right is compulsory  for the individual right holder. Whether the common law conception of an individual economic right as an "individual right of control of usage" is compatible with the Code Civil origins of ''droit de suite'' is open to question.

The UK is the largest art resale market where a form of ARR is operating, details of how the royalty is calculated as a portion of sale price in the UK can be accessed here [http://www.dacs.org.uk/ DACS] 
In the UK, the scheme was, in early 2012, extended to all artists still in copyright. In most European jurisdictions the right has the same duration as the term of copyright. In California law, heirs receive royalty for 20 years.

The royalty applies to any work of graphic or plastic art such as a ceramic, collage, drawing, engraving, glassware, lithograph, painting, photograph, picture, print, sculpture, tapestry. However, a copy of a work is not to be regarded as a work unless the copy is one of a limited number made by the artist or under the artist's authority. In the UK the resale of a work bought directly from the artist and then resold within 3 years for a value of €10,000 or less is not affected by the royalty.

The situation as to how ARR applies in situations where an art work is physically made by a person or persons who are not the 'name artist' who first exhibits and sells the work is not clear. In particular whilst ARR is inalienable it seems conceivable that in cases where the copyright on an artwork is transferred/sold, prior to the first sale of an artwork, the inalienable ARR right is also effectively sold transferred.

Whether resale royalties are of net economic benefit to artists is a highly contested area. Many economic studies have seriously questioned the assumptions underlying the argument that resale royalties have net benefits to artists. Many modelings have suggested that resale royalties could be actually harmful to living artists' economic positions.&lt;ref&gt;name="Kirstein, R./Schmidtchen, D.

Australia's chief advocate for the adoption of artist resale royalties the collection society, Viscopy, commissioned in 2004 a report from Access Economics to model the likely impact of their scheme. In the resulting report, Access Economics warned that the claim of net benefit to artists was: "based upon extremely unrealistic assumptions, in particular the assumption that seller and buyer behaviour would be completely unaffected by the introduction of RRR [ARR]" and that, "Access Economics considers that the results of this analysis are both unhelpful and potentially misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/.../Viscopy_Access_Economics.pdf |format=PDF|title=Viscopy Access Economics|accessdate=29 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software royalties==
There is simply too much [[computer software]] to consider the royalties applicable to each. The following is a guide to royalty rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwds-ak.com/Web-Resources/Web-Design/Royalty-Rates |website=Northwest Data Solutions |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Computer Software: 10.5% (average), 6.8% (median)
*Internet: 11.7% (average), 7.5% (median)

For the development of customer-specific software one will have to consider:
* Total software development cost
* Break-even cost (if the software can be sold to many agencies)
* Ownership of code (if the client's, he bears the development cost)
* Life of the software (usually short or requiring maintenance)
* Risk in development (high, commanding A high price)

==Other royalty arrangements==
The term "royalty" also covers areas outside of IP and technology licensing, such as oil, gas, and mineral royalties paid to the owner of a property by a resources development company in exchange for the right to exploit the resource. In a business project the promoter, financier, LHS enabled the transaction but are no longer actively interested may have a royalty right to a portion of the income, or profits, of the business. This sort of royalty is often expressed as a contract right to receive money based on a royalty formula, rather than an actual ownership interest in the business. In some businesses this sort of royalty is sometimes called an ''override''.

===Alliances and partnerships===
Royalties may exist in technological alliances and partnerships. The latter is more than mere access to secret technical or a trade right to accomplish an objective. It is, in the last decade of the past century, and the first of this one of the major means of technology transfer. Its importance for the licensor and the licensee lies in its access to markets and raw materials, and labor, when the international trend is towards [[globalization]].

There are three main groups when it comes to technological alliances. They are Joint-ventures (sometimes abbreviated JV), the Franchises and Strategic Alliances (SA).&lt;ref&gt;Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer),1996 United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Internationalization for Developing Country Enterprises, United Nations Industrial Organization, Vienna, Austria 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-1-106443-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint-ventures are usually between companies long in contact with a purpose. JVs are very formal forms of association, and depending on the country where they are situated, subject to a rigid code of rules, in which the public may or may not have an opportunity to participate in capital; partly depending on the size of capital required, and partly on Governmental regulations. They usually revolve around ''products'' and normally involve an inventive step.

Franchises revolve around ''services'' and they are closely connected with trademarks, an example of which is McDonald's. Although franchises have no convention like trademarks or copyrights they can be mistaken as a trademark-copyright in agreements. The franchisor has close control over the franchisee, which, in legal terms cannot be tie-ins such as frachisee located in an areas owned by the franchisor.

Strategic Alliances can involve a project (such as bridge building). a product or a service. As the name implies, is more a matter of 'marriage of convenience' when two parties want to associate to take up a particular (but modest) short-term task but generally are uncomfortable with the other. But the strategic alliance could be a test of compatibility for the forming of a joint venture company and a precedent step.

Note that all of these ventures s could be in a third county. JVs and franchises are rarely found formed within a county. They largely involve third countries.

On occasion, a JV or SA may be wholly oriented to research and development, typically involving multiple organizations working on an agreed form of engagement. The Airbus is an example of such.

====Technical assistance and service in technology transfer====
Firms in developing countries often are asked by the supplier of know-how or patent licensing to consider technical service (TS) and technical assistance (TA) as elements of the technology transfer process and to pay "royalty" on them. TS and TA are associated with the IP (intellectual property) transferred – and, sometimes, dependent on its acquisition – but they are, by no means, IP.&lt;ref&gt;Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer),1996 United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}, pp 260-261&lt;/ref&gt; TA and TS may also be the sole part of the transfer or the tranferor of the IP, their concurrent supplier. They are seldom met with in the developed countries, which sometimes view even know-how as similar to TS.

TS comprises services which are the specialized knowledge of firms or acquired by them for operating a special process. It is often a "bundle" of services which can by itself meet an objective or help in meeting it. It is delivered over time, at end of which the acquirer becomes proficient to be independent of the service. In this process, no consideration is given on whether the transfer of the proprietary element has been concluded or not.

On the other hand, technical assistance is a package of assistance given on a short timetable. It can range variously from procurement of equipment for a project, inspection services on behalf of the buyer, the training of buyer's personnel and the supply technical or managerial staff. Again, TA is independent of IP services.

The payment for these services is a fee, not a royalty. The TS fee is dependent on how many of the specialized staff of its supplier are required and over what period of time. Sometimes, the "learning" capacity to whom the TS is supplied is involved. In any case, the cost per service-hour should be calculated and evaluated. Note that in selecting a TS supplier (often the IP supplier), experience and dependency are critical.

In the case of TA there is usually a plurality of firms and choice is feasible.

==Approaches to royalty rate==

===Intellectual property===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
The rate of royalty applied in a given case is determined by various factors, the most notable of which are:

:* Market drivers and demand structure
:* Territorial extent of rights
:* Exclusivity of rights
:* Level of innovation and stage of development (see [[The Technology Life Cycle]])
:* Sustainability of the technology
:* Degree and competitive availability of other technologies
:* Inherent risk
:* Strategic need
:* The portfolio of rights negotiated
:* Fundability
:* Deal-reward structure (negotiation strength)

To correctly gauge royalty rates, the following criteria must be taken into consideration:

:* The transaction is at "arms-length"
:* There is a willing buyer and a willing seller
:* The transaction is not under compulsion

===Rate determination and illustrative royalties===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
There are three general approaches to assess the applicable royalty rate in the licensing of intellectual property. They are

# The Cost Approach
# The Comparable Market Approach
# The Income Approach

For a fair evaluation of the royalty rate, the relationship of the parties to the contract should:

:– be at "arms-length" (related parties such as the subsidiary and the parent company need to transact as though they were independent parties)
:– be viewed as acting free and without compulsion

====Cost approach====
The Cost Approach considers the several elements of cost that may have been entered to create the intellectual property and to seek a royalty rate that will recapture the expense of its development and obtain a return that is commensurate with its expected life. Costs considered could include R&amp;D expenditures, pilot-plant and test-marketing costs, technology upgrading expenses, [[patent application]] expenditure and the like.

The method has limited utility since the technology is not priced competitively on "what the market can bear" principles or in the context of the price of similar technologies. More importantly, by lacking optimization (through additional expense), it may earn benefits below its potential.

However, the method may be appropriate when a technology is licensed out during its R&amp;D phase as happens with [[venture capital]] investments or it is licensed out during one of the stages of [[clinical trial]]s of a pharmaceutical.

In the former case, the venture capitalist obtains an equity position in the company (developing the technology) in exchange for financing a part of the development cost (recovering it, and obtaining an appropriate margin, when the company gets acquired or it goes public through the [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] route).

Recovery of costs, with opportunity of gain, is also feasible when development can be followed stage-wise as shown below for a pharmaceutical undergoing clinical trials (the licensee pays higher royalties for the product as it moves through the normal stages of its development):

{| class="wikitable"
! Success State of development !! Royalty rates (%) !! Nature
|-
| Pre-clinical success || 0–5 || in-vitro
|-
| Phase I (safety) || 5–10 || 100 healthy people
|-
| Phase II (efficacy) || 8–15 || 300 subjects
|-
| Phase III (effectiveness) || 10–20 || several thousand patients
|-
| Launched product || 20+ || regulatory body approval
|-
|}

A similar approach is used when [[custom software]] is licensed (an in-license, i.e. an incoming license). The product is accepted on a royalty schedule depending on the software meeting set stage-wise specifications with acceptable error levels in performance tests.

====Comparable market approach====
Here the cost and the risk of development are disregarded. The royalty rate is determined from comparing competing or similar technologies in an industry, modified by considerations of useful "remaining life" of the technology in that industry and contracting elements such as exclusivity provisions, front-end royalties, field of use restrictions, geographic limitations and the "technology bundle" (the mix of patents, know-how, trade-mark rights, etc.) accompanying it. Economist J. Gregory Sidak explains that comparable licenses, when selected correctly, "reveal what the licensor and the licensee consider to be fair compensation for the use of the patented technology" and thus "will most accurately depict the price that a licensee would willingly pay for that technology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterioneconomics.com/apportionment-frand-royalties-comparable-licenses-ericsson-dlink.html J. Gregory Sidak, ''Apportionment, FRAND Royalties, and Comparable Licenses After'' Ericsson v. D-Link, 2016 U. Ill. L. REV. (forthcoming)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] has on numerous occasions confirmed that the comparable market approach is a reliable methodology to calculate a reasonable royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Systems, Inc., 773 F.3d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2014); LaserDynamics, Inc. v. Quanta Comput., Inc., 694 F.3d 51 (Fed. Cir. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although widely used, the prime difficulty with this method is obtaining access to data on comparable technologies and the terms of the agreements that incorporate them. Fortunately, there are several recognized{{by whom|date=October 2014}} organizations (see "Royalty Rate Websites" listed at the end of this article) who have comprehensive{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} information on both royalty rates and the principal terms of the agreements of which they are a part. There are also IP-related organizations, such as the [[Licensing Executives Society]], which enable its members to access and share privately assembled data.

The two tables shown below are drawn, selectively, from information that is available with an IP-related organization and on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use Of The 25 Per Cent Rule In Valuing IP |url=http://lesanz.org.au/realmcommunications/royaltyrates.html |last1=Goldscheider |first1=Robert |last2=Jarosz |first2=John |last3=Mulhern |first3=Carla |authorlink=Les Nouvelles |date=Dec 2002 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912203311/http://www.lesanz.org.au/realmcommunications/royaltyrates.html |archivedate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Your Intellectual Property for Strategic Alliances and Financing |url=http://www.njsbdc.com/SciTech/scitech120804weiler.ppt |author=David G.

The comparability between transactions requires a comparison of the significant economic conditions that may affect the contracting parties:
* Similarity of geographies
* Relevant date
* Same industry
* Market size and its economic development;
* Contracting or expanding markets
* Market activity: whether wholesale, retail, other
* Relative market shares of contracting entities
* Location-specific costs of production and distribution
* Competitive environment in each geography
* Fair alternatives to contracting parties

====Income approach====
The Income approach focuses on the licensor estimating the profits generated by the licensee and obtaining an appropriate share of the generated profit. It is unrelated to costs of technology development or the costs of competing technologies.

The approach requires the licensee (or licensor): (a) to generate a cash-flow projection of incomes and expenses over the life-span of the license under an agreed scenario of incomes and costs (b) determining the [[Net Present Value]], NPV of the profit stream, based on a ''selected'' [[discounting|discount factor]], and c) negotiating the division of such profit between the licensor and the licensee.

The NPV of a future income is always lower than its current value because an income in the future is attended by risk. In other words, an income in the future needs to be discounted, in some manner, to obtain its present equivalent. The factor by which a future income is reduced is known as the  'discount rate'. Thus, $1.00 received a year from now is worth $0.9091 at a 10% [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]], and its discounted value will be still lower two years down the line.

The actual discount factor used depends on the risk assumed by the principal gainer in the transaction. For instance, a mature technology worked in different geographies, will carry a lower risk of non-performance (thus, a lower discount rate) than a technology being applied for the first time. A similar situation arises when there is the option of working the technology in one of two different regions; the risk elements in each region would be different.

The method is treated in greater detail, using illustrative data, in [[Royalty rate assessment|Royalty Assessment]].

The licensor's share of the income is usually set by the "25% rule of thumb", which is said to be even used by tax authorities in the US and Europe for arms-length transactions. The share is on the operating profit of the licensee firm. Even where such division is held contentious, the rule can still be the starting point of negotiations.

Following are three aspects that are important for the profit:

:(a) the profit that accrues to the licensee may not arise solely through the engine of the technology. There are returns from the mix of assets it employs such as fixed and working capital and the returns from intangible assets such as distribution systems, trained workforce, etc. Allowances need to be made for them.

:(b) profits are also generated by thrusts in the general economy, gains from infrastructure, and the basket of licensed rights – patents, trademark, know-how. A lower royalty rate may apply in an advanced country where large market volumes can be commanded, or where protection to the technology is more secure than in an emerging economy (or perhaps, for other reasons, the inverse).

:(c) the royalty rate is only one aspect of the negotiation. Contractual provisions such as an exclusive license, rights to sub-license, warranties on the performance of technology etc may enhance the advantages to the licensee, which is not compensated by the 25% metric.

The basic advantage of this approach, which is perhaps the most widely applied, is that the royalty rate can be negotiated without comparative data on how other agreements have been transacted. In fact, it is almost ideal for a case where precedent does not exist.

It is, perhaps, relevant to note that the [[IRS]] also uses these three methods, in modified form, to assess the attributable income, or division of income, from a royalty-based transaction between a US company and its foreign subsidiary (since [[Law of the United States|US law]] requires that a foreign subsidiary pay an appropriate royalty to the [[Holding company|parent company]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Evaluations |url=http://www.intltaxlaw.com/shared/transfer/regs.htm |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920001149/http://www.intltaxlaw.com/SHARED/TRANSFER/REGS.HTM |archivedate=20 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other compensation modes===
Royalties are only one among many ways of compensating owners for use of an asset. Others include:
:*buying the asset outright, possibly with a [[leaseback]] arrangement
:*offering the licensor an [[Ownership equity|equity]] position in the licensee company
:*staged [[milestone]] payments (as in [[drug development]] and commissioned software arrangements)
:*[[lump sum]] payment made to the licensor in one or more installments
:*[[cross-licensing]] agreements with or without cash payments, and
:*entering into a [[strategic alliance]] or Joint Venture.

In discussing the licensing of Intellectual Property, the terms ''[[Intellectual property valuation|valuation]]'' and ''evaluation'' need to be understood in their rigorous terms.
Evaluation is the process of assessing a license in terms of the specific metrics of a particular negotiation, which may include its circumstances, the geographical spread of licensed rights, product range, market width, licensee competitiveness, growth prospects, etc.

On the other hand, valuation is the [[fair market value]] (FMV) of the ''asset'' – trademark, patent or know-how – at which it can be sold between a willing buyer and willing seller in the context of best awareness of circumstances. The FMV of the IP, where assessable, may itself be a metric for evaluation.

If an emerging company is listed on the [[stock market]], the [[Market capitalization|market value]] of its intellectual property can be estimated from the data of the [[balance sheet]] using the equivalence:

Market Capitalization = Net [[Working capital|Working Capital]] + Net [[Fixed asset|Fixed Assets]] + Routine [[Intangible asset|Intangible Assets]] + IP

where the IP is the residual after deducting the other components from the market valuation of the stock. One of the most significant intangibles may be the work-force.

The method may be quite useful for valuing trademarks of a listed company if it is mainly or the only IP in play (franchising companies).

[[File:Sedgeford portrait.jpg|thumbnail|The "Sedgeford Hall Portrait," oil on canvas by unknown artist circa 1830; courtesy of Borough Council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk, UK]]

The "'''Sedgeford Hall Portrait'''" (location: [[King's Lynn]] Town Hall, Norfolk, UK), is an oil on canvas portrait in the American School&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, David. Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk&lt;/ref&gt; by an unknown artist circa 1830. It depicts Pe-o-ka, wife of the [[Seminole]] chief, [[Osceola]], and their son.&lt;ref&gt;PalmCoastObserver.com, March 31, 2011. https://www.palmcoastobserver.com/article/palm-coast-author-solves-160-year-pocahontas-mystery&lt;/ref&gt; It was once believed by many to be a portrait painted from life of [[Pocahontas]] and her son, [[Thomas Rolfe]].

==Provenance and identification==
Eustace Neville Rolfe of [[Heacham|Heacham Hall]] in Norfolk, a possible&lt;ref&gt;''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.'' Vol. 21, No. 2 (Apr., 1913), pp. 208-211&lt;/ref&gt; distant relative of Thomas, acquired the painting, believing it to be of Pocahontas and Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, David. Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk&lt;/ref&gt; At some point it was hung in a Rolfe family estate building called [[Sedgeford|Sedgeford Hall]] (Norfolk, England), from whence it acquired its name. Art experts later disputed the painting's origin, saying it could not have been painted during the lifetime of Pocahontas.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of King's Lynn Museum Newsletter Spring 2011. http://www.oldkingsroad.com/king's%20lynn/King's%20Lynn%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the child in the portrait appears to be several years older than Thomas Rolfe would have been when his mother was still alive. [[Thomas Rolfe]] was born in January 1615, making him two years, two months old at the time of Pocahontas's death.

In 2010, researcher Bill Ryan, while reviewing magazine archives on the Seminole Indians, found a black-and-white drawn version of the painting in the 1848 edition of ''Illustrated London News'' identifying the portrait as "the wife and child of Osceola, the last of the Seminole Indian chiefs."&lt;ref&gt;PalmCoastObserver.com, March 31, 2011. https://www.palmcoastobserver.com/article/palm-coast-author-solves-160-year-pocahontas-mystery&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osceola]] himself was of mixed race ([[Muscogee|Creek]] Indian and English), which explains the European features of the child. The portrait is now generally accepted as being his wife and son, though some questions still remain.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of King's Lynn Museum Newsletter Spring 2011. http://www.oldkingsroad.com/king's%20lynn/King's%20Lynn%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, David. Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk&lt;/ref&gt; Many printed and Internet sources, however, still refer to this painting as a portrait of Pocahontas and Thomas Rolfe.

[[File:The Wife and Child of Oscela from Holden's Dollar Magazine 1850.jpg|thumb|right|"The Wife and Child of Osceola" from ''Holden's Dollar Magazine'', volume 6, no. 4 (October 1850): 591-592.]]

An article from ''Holden's Dollar Magazine'' in 1850 labels the engraving "The Wife and Child of Osceola" and bemoans the loss of the continent's native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Wife and Child of Osceola | journal = Holden's Dollar Magazine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 591–592 | publisher = | location = | date = October 1850 | url = https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011827740 | access-date = 2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plaque,&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, David. Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk&lt;/ref&gt; presumably composed by the Rolfe family, is attached to the frame stating:

&lt;poem&gt;
PRINCESS POCAHONTAS    
Dau. of PRINCE POWHATTAN &amp; 2nd WIFE of 
JOHN ROLFE of HEACHAM (1585-1630)
b. 1595   m.1614   d. AT GRAVESEND 1617
&lt;/poem&gt;

The plaque contains some questionable information besides the likely misidentification of the subjects. Pocahontas was said to be a "princess" by members of the Virginia Company who marketed her as such to investors and to the royal family during her trip to England in 1616-1617.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, H. C. (2005) ''Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown,'' University of Virginia Press, p. 176-178&lt;/ref&gt; While she was the daughter of paramount chief, Powhatan, she was not in a matrilineal line to succeed him, and the Powhatan Indians are not known to have given her any special title corresponding to the English notion of princess, though she was likely treated with respect as the daughter of Powhatan.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, H. C. (2005) ''Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown,'' University of Virginia Press, p. 24; p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Further, John Rolfe is often said to be John Rolfe of Heacham, but this has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.'' Vol. 21, No. 2 (Apr., 1913), pp. 208-211&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the stated birth year of 1595 is an estimate. Anthropologist and Powhatan Indian researcher Helen Rountree estimates her birth year to have been 1596 based on Pocahontas's statement of how old she was at the time of the Simon [[Van de Passe family|van de Passe]] engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, H. C. (2005) ''Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown,'' University of Virginia Press, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

A sign posted under the painting at King's Lynn Town Hall gives some brief biographical details of the life of Pocahontas as well as this paragraph explaining the mis-identification of the painting's subjects:
* "The mother and child portrayed are probably Pe-o-ka, the wife of Osceola, the War Chief of the Seminoles of Florida, and their child in 1837. It was acquired by Eustace Neville Rolfe of Heacham Hall who believed it represented Pocahontas and her son."&lt;ref&gt;King's Lynn Civic Society, King's Lynn Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Additional details'''
* "[The Sedgeford Hall Portrait] was purchased by Eustace Neville Rolfe (1845–1908) of Heacham Hall from a Mrs Charlton who stated that ‘her husband had bought it in America years ago'."&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, David. Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A founder member of the King’s Lynn Town Guides, Mrs Jill Price, and her husband, encouraged the Rolfe family to hang the painting in the [King's Lynn] Town Hall. It was presented and hung in 1990."&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, David. Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sfire''' or '''Sefire steles''' are three 8th-century BCE basalt ''[[stelae]]'' containing [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscriptions discovered at [[Al-Safirah]] ("Sfire") near [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=Aramaic&gt;{{cite web|title=Aramaic |publisher=Anchor Bible Dictionary |pages=173–78 |author=S. A. Kaufman |url=http://www.nelc.ucla.edu/Faculty/Schniedewind_files/NWSemitic/Aramaic_ABD.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104215025/http://www.nelc.ucla.edu/Faculty/Schniedewind_files/NWSemitic/Aramaic_ABD.pdf |archivedate=November 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Sefire treaty inscriptions''' are the three inscriptions on the steles.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Fitzmyer The Aramaic inscriptions of Sefîre 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification of the treaty kings ==
Two treaties conducted between minor kings from the Kingdom of [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] inscribed on the stelae are often cited as evidence of the [[Aramaean]] tradition of treaty-making.&lt;ref name=Healy&gt;{{cite web|title=''Ancient Aramaic Culture and the Bible'' |author=John F. Healy |publisher=[[University of Durham]] |date=13 June 1987 |accessdate=2007-10-12 |url=http://www.urhoy.info/culture.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828012607/http://www.urhoy.info/culture.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sefire inscriptions are of interest to those studying beliefs and practices in ancient [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the text is considered notable for constituting "the best extrabiblical source for [[Semitic people|West Semitic]] traditions of covenantal blessings and curses."&lt;ref name=Aramaic/&gt;

They tell of ''"The treaty of King Bar-ga'yah of K[a]t[a]k, with Mati'el son of Attarsamak, king of Arpad."'' Some have identified this as the treaty of "Ashurnerari V" ([[Adad-nirari III]] or his son [[Tiglath-pileser III]]?) of Assyria and [[Matiilu]] (unknown) of [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] (probably modern [[Tel Rifaat]], Syria).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Elliott Grosby ''Biblical ideas of nationality: ancient and modern''  2002 p126 "Thus, they think that the Sefire treaty is the Aramaic version of the treaty of approximately 754 bc between Ashurnerari V and Matîoil of Arpad. But why the use of KTK as a pseudonym for Assyria? If, in fact, Dupont-Sommer's (1958) ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the inscriptions ==

=== Sefire I ===
This is a basalt slab broken in two horizontally. The first two steles each have three faces bearing writing.

=== Sefire II ===
As with Sefire I stele Sefire II had three faces bearing writing. While most of the text of Sefire II A and B permit coherent translation only with comparison with Sefire I and III, the concluding portion of Sefire II A and B is quite clear.&lt;ref&gt;James Bennett Pritchard  The ancient Near East: supplementary texts and pictures   1969 "In Sfire II A 9, lions seem to be mentioned in the same context, offering a good parallel to ... (Sfire II C) (While most of the preserved text of Sfire II A and B permits a coherent translation only where the missing links can be supplied on the basis of Sfire I and III, the concluding portion is quite clear.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holger Gzella, M. L. Folmer  Aramaic in its historical and linguistic setting 2008 p153 "personal names: Sfire II, C, 14; place names: Zkr B:10, 11 and perhaps B 4; Sfire II, C, 5; "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Folmer The Aramaic language in the [[Achaemenid period]] 1995 p427 "6,8 In combination with the infinitive (hbzthm Sfire ii B 7)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sefire III===
Nine fragments of the reverse of a broad slab.

==Overview==
The inscriptions record two treaties that "list curses and magical rites which take effect if the treaty is violated."&lt;ref name=Jeffers&gt;{{cite book|title=Magic and Divination in Ancient Palestine and Syria|author=Ann Jeffers|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|page=18|isbn=90-04-10513-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One is a treaty between two minor kings, Barga'yah and Matti'el, who hailed from the southwestern periphery of the [[Assyrian empire]].&lt;ref name=Faraone&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molten Wax, Spilt Wine and Mutilated Animals: Sympathetic Magic in near Eastern and Early Greek Oath Ceremonies|author=Christopher A. Faraone|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume= 113|year=1993|pages=60–80|accessdate=2007-10-12|url=http://www.wac.ucla.edu/pdf/greekoathceremonies.pdf|doi=10.2307/632398|format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3A%22Molten+Wax%2C+Spilt+Wine+and+Mutilated+Animals%3A+Sympathetic+Magic+in+near+Eastern+and+Early+Greek+Oath+Ceremonies%22&amp;as_publication=%27%27The+Journal+of+Hellenic+Studies%27%27&amp;as_ylo=1993&amp;as_yhi=1993&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;|jstor=632398|publisher=The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies}} {{Dead link|date=April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the text, Matti'el swears to accept dire consequences for himself and his cities should he violate the stipulations of the treaty:&lt;ref name=Faraone/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''"....'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''As this wax is consumed by fire, thus Ma[tti'el] shall be consumed b[y fi]re.'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''As this bow and these arrows are broken, thus Inurta and [[Hadad]] (= names of local deities) shall break [the bow of Matti'el] and the bows of his nobles.'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''As a man of wax is blinded, thus Matti'el shall be blinded.'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''[As] this calf is cut up, thus Matti'el and his nobles shall be cut up."'''&lt;ref name=Faraone/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This loyalty oath from the Sefire inscriptions is similar to other loyalty oaths imposed by Assyrian kings on other less powerful monarchs in the [[Levant]] throughout the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.&lt;ref name=Faraone/&gt;

The inscriptions may, under one possible interpretation, record the names of ''[[El (deity)|El]] and [[Elyon]],'' "God, God Most High" possibly providing prima facie evidence for a distinction between the two deities first worshipped by the [[Jebusites]] in [[Jerusalem]], and then elsewhere throughout the ancient Levant.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite book|title=Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan|author=John Day|publisher=Continuum International|year=2000|page=20|isbn=0-8264-6830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought to be reflective of Assyrian or neo-Assyrian culture and similar to other documents dating from the first millennium BCE, scholars such as [[Joseph Fitzmyer]] have perceived [[Canaan]]ite influences in the text, while Dennis McCarthy has noted similarities to second millennium BCE treaties imposed by [[Hittites|Hittite]] kings on Syrian vassals.&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sefire Treaty Stipulations and the Mesopotamian Treaty Tradition|journal=The World of the Aramaeans|author=William Morrow|editor=Paul-Eugène Dion|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=1-84127-179-9|pages=83–84|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's childhood is the focus of ''Young Sheldon''; the series' first season is set in 1989 when 9-year-old prodigy Sheldon has skipped ahead five grades, to start high school alongside his older brother.

Sheldon is a senior [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] at [[Caltech]] and for the first ten seasons of ''The Big Bang Theory'', shares an apartment with his colleague and best friend, [[Leonard Hofstadter]] ([[Johnny Galecki]]).

==Characterization==

===Early life===
Sheldon was raised in [[Galveston, Texas]]&lt;ref name="S02E09"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The White Asparagus Triangulation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep26|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 24, 2008|season=2|number=9|minutes=04:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his elder brother, George Jr., and [[Twin|fraternal twin]] sister, Missy, by his mother, Mary Cooper, an overtly devout Baptist; and George Cooper, an alcoholic who was rarely around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/the-family-dynasty-part-1-sheldon-coopers-family/|title=The Family Dynasty - Part 1: Sheldon Cooper’s Family|date=2016-11-16|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon once got his father fired when he told Mr. Hinckley, a store owner, that George was stealing from the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Sales Call Sublimation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 9)#ep12|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=January 7, 2015|season=9|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Young Sheldon'', this is [[retcon]]ned: his father is a football coach who was fired from his coaching position in Galveston because he disclosed that other coaches were illegally recruiting players to their school, forcing the family to return to Medford. He does drink, mostly beer, but is a loving father who is trying to understand his intellectually gifted son. The only member of his family to have actively encouraged his work in science was his grandfather, whom he cherished and affectionately called "Pop-Pop", and who died when Sheldon was five years old. Pop-Pop's loss is what caused Sheldon to despise Christmas when his Christmas wish to bring Pop-Pop back didn't come true. Sheldon's closest relative is his maternal grandmother whom he affectionately calls "Meemaw", and who in turn calls him "Moon Pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/family-dynasty-part-2-sheldon-coopers-family/|title=The Family Dynasty Part 2: Sheldon Cooper’s Family|date=2016-11-16|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aunt also encouraged Sheldon by giving him medical equipment, "in case his work in physics failed, he'd have a 'trade' to fall back on".

===Personality===
{{Redirect|Bazinga|the jellyfish genus|Bazinga (genus)}}
Sheldon is often described as a stereotypical "geek". He is usually characterized as being extremely intelligent, detail-oriented, eccentric, and occasionally disturbing. Despite his intelligence, he often displays childlike qualities, such as extreme stubbornness and a lack of [[common sense]]. It is claimed by Bernadette that the reason Sheldon is sometimes unpleasant is because the part of his brain that tells him it is wrong to be nasty is "getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain", although, in season 8's "The Space Probe Disintegration",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/big-bang-theory-sheldon-bloopers/|title=The Big Bang Theory Sheldon Bloopers|date=2018-01-28|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon tearfully admits to Leonard that he ''is'' aware of his peculiarities and how his behavior comes across. The first four episodes of ''The Big Bang Theory'' portray Sheldon slightly inconsistently with respect to his later characterization, in which he is depicted as rather witty and sarcastic, and slightly flirtatious towards Penny in the pilot episode: according to Prady, the character "began to evolve after episode five or so and became his own thing".&lt;ref name="squad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/08/14/come-up-with-a-new-theory-sheldon-does-not-have-aspergers|title=Come up with a new theory: Sheldon does NOT have Asperger's |publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=August 14, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817125113/http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/08/14/come-up-with-a-new-theory-sheldon-does-not-have-aspergers|archivedate=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also has [[hemophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)|s5 e16, The Vacation Solution]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon has difficulty coping when asked to keep a secret, when he is interrupted, or when he hears arguing.&lt;ref name="S02E01"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bad Fish Paradigm|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 22, 2008|season=2|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S02E13"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Friendship Algorithm|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=January 19, 2009|season=2|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S03E07"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Guitarist Amplification|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 9, 2009|season=3|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a [[notary public]] and uses his knowledge in law and contracts usually for his own advantage and is always distressed when challenged in a legal aspect that he cannot logically defend. In his mannerisms, Sheldon also shows symptoms associated with [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]. Whenever approaching a person's home, he must knock three times, then say the person's name, and must repeat this at least three times (where "The first one is traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on"), as a result of him walking in on his father with another woman when he was thirteen.&lt;ref name="S10E05"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Hot Tub Contamination|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 16, 2016|season=10|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering a person's home, he must select the proper seat before sitting down. When it is suggested by Penny that he "just sit anywhere", his response is "Oh, no, if only it were that simple!" This extends to his inability to accept change. His rigidity in maintaining [[homeostasis]] often causes him frustration. Because of his rigidity and stubbornness, only his mother and Bernadette&lt;ref name="S03E14"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep14|The Einstein Approximation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 1, 2010|season=3|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; – both possessing strong maternal personalities – have shown the ability to order him to do things.

Like his friends, Sheldon is fond of comic books (especially the [[DC Universe]]), [[cosplay|costumes]], [[video game]]s, [[roleplaying game]]s, [[tabletop game]]s, [[collectible card game]]s, and action figures. Sheldon has [[restraining orders]] from his heroes [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Carl Sagan]], and [[Stan Lee]],&lt;ref name="S03E15"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Large Hadron Collision|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 8, 2010|season=3|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S03E16"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Excelsior Acquisition|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 1, 2010|season=3|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Vacation Solution|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep103|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 9, 2012|season=5|number=16|minutes=12:55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S02E11&gt;Season 2, episode 11: The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt; as well as television scientist [[Bill Nye]].&lt;ref name=S07E7&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Proton Displacement|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep142|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 7, 2013|season=7|number=7|minutes=16:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon often wears vintage T-shirts adorned with superhero logos.  One of his shirts is emblazoned with the number 73, and in the episode "The Alien Parasite Hypothesis" he explains that 73 is the 21st prime number, its mirror, 37, is the 12th prime number and its mirror (21) is the product of multiplying 7 and 3, also in binary, 73 is 1001001, a [[palindrome]]. The boys use video games like bowling and archery for "exercise" and use the traditional sport rules.

Sheldon has sometimes shown empathy, including lending money to [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]] without expecting it back quickly (although that may just have been his logical Spock-like response to a problem to be solved; it was, after all, money he was not using and would not miss&lt;ref name="S02E14"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Financial Permeability|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 2, 2009|season=2|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and driving her to a hospital when her shoulder was dislocated.&lt;ref name="S03E8"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Adhesive Duck Deficiency|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=November 16, 2009|season=3|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since season 10, his empathy skills have improved to the extent that he goes out of his way to pamper his fiance Amy.

''The Big Bang Theory''.Season 5. episode 12. January 12, 2012.

In response to criticism from his friends that he is mentally ill, Sheldon often retorts, "I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested" – which his mother has confirmed to be true (once while wishing she had gone through with a follow-up examination).&lt;ref name="S02E16"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Cushion Saturation|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 2, 2009|season=2|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S02E04"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Griffin Equivalency|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2008|season=2|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S05E06"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Rhinitis Revelation|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 20, 2011|season=5|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Sheldon contrasts strongly with his family, who are neither scientists nor intellectuals. His father George died before the start of ''The Big Bang Theory'', when Sheldon was 14,&lt;ref name="S07E22"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Proton Transmogrification|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 1, 2014|season=7|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother Mary is a devout born-again Christian and loving parent.

Sheldon has a maternal uncle, Edward, who is called "Stumpy" as the result of a time when he cleaned a wood chipper by hand. He also has a maternal aunt, Charlene, which was revealed in ''Young Sheldon'' when his mother told Meemaw that she made dinner for “Charlene and Edward” more times than her. Sheldon had another uncle, named Carl Cooper, who was killed by a badger while cleaning a chimney and another uncle that may have done things to children that were legal in Oklahoma per "The Clean Room Infiltration".

In "The Engagement Reaction", Sheldon mentions that his aunt Ruth died a week after being infected by a pathogen she contracted in the hospital where she visited Sheldon's uncle Roger, and that their ashes are now stored in a coffee can on Sheldon's mother’s mantle.

In the ''Young Sheldon'' episode "Vanilla Ice Cream, Gentleman Callers, and a Dinette Set", it is revealed that Sheldon has children in the future.

===Relationships===
Sheldon's closest friends are [[Leonard Hofstadter]], [[Howard Wolowitz]], and [[Raj Koothrappali]]. Of the three, Sheldon is openly dismissive of Howard and constantly [[wikt:opine|opines]] that a master's degree in engineering demonstrates a lesser intellect than that of the others, who all possess science doctorates. Despite that, Sheldon has referred to Howard as a "treasured acquaintance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bozeman Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep13|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=January 18, 2010|season=3|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later his friend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Friendship Turbulence|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep17|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=March 6, 2014|season=7|number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at various points. Sheldon constantly belittles Leonard and dismisses his work, yet at the same time considers Leonard his best friend, as they used to live together and can tolerate each other: in "The Space Probe Disintegration", Sheldon admits to Leonard that he is aware of how difficult he can be, and tearfully expresses his gratitude for having Leonard in his life in spite of himself, causing Leonard to break down beside him. Prady stated that "the fact that, despite everything, Leonard considers Sheldon his best friend reminds us of Sheldon's essential humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/01/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-cbs-sheldon-leonard.html|title=Having 'Big' fun on a hit comedy: A chat with 'Big Bang Theory's' Johnny Galecki|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon can only handle having a limited number of friends in his life at a time, but later shows flexibility when he accepts Bernadette and Amy as part of the social group.

It has been speculated that Sheldon may be [[Asexuality|asexual]] or [[aromantic]]. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre said: "Part of what's wonderful and unique about [Sheldon] is he has chosen not to play in the relationship game either way&amp;nbsp; – heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, any sexuality."&lt;ref name="EW1"/&gt; This is referenced in "The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem", when Sheldon unknowingly attracts the attention of grad student Ramona Nowitzki, and Penny, seeing this, asks his friends what his "deal" (i.e., sexual orientation) is, to which Leonard responds, "Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no 'deal'."

[[File:Mayim Bialik and Jim Parsons at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mayim Bialik]] (who portrays [[Amy Farrah Fowler]]) and Jim Parsons at PaleyFest 2013 for the TV show "Big Bang Theory"]]
In the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep63|season 3 finale]], Howard and Raj blackmail Sheldon into meeting [[Amy Farrah Fowler]], with whom they matched him on a dating website. After some obnoxious comments about the dating website, Sheldon finds that Amy agrees with him, and he grows fond of her when she says that "Any or all physical contact up to and including [[coitus]] are off the table". Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship. The two enjoy intellectual games they create, and Amy and Sheldon openly express the same type of intellectual superiority.&lt;ref name="S04E03"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep3|The Zazzy Substitution]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 7, 2010|season=4|number=03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season 5, when Leonard inadvertently implies that he and Amy may have had sex after a wedding reception that they both attended, Sheldon unexpectedly reacts violently, karate-chopping Leonard's neck while telling Leonard "She is not for you... not for you!"&lt;ref name="S05E03"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep3|The Pulled Groin Extrapolation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 29, 2011|season=5|number=03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Sheldon formally asks Amy to be his girlfriend in "[[The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition]]". During their relationship, Amy begins a campaign to give Sheldon more attention to increase his feelings for her by embracing his interests.&lt;ref name="S05E23"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep3|The Launch Acceleration]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 3, 2012|season=5|number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they watch Howard being launched into space in its season finale, Amy is surprised when Sheldon takes her hand for emotional support.&lt;ref name="S05E24"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep3|The Countdown Reflection]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first half of season 6, in "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Parking Spot Escalation]]" and "[[The Fish Guts Displacement]]", Sheldon is pushed further after seeing Amy partially exposed and taking care of her while she is ill respectively. In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.

In season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy.

The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]", when he finally admits being in love with her: "I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love." In the season 8 finale, "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of "commitment".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.

In the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that "I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them". In "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his ovinaphobia), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.

In season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.&lt;ref name="The Veracity Elasticity"/&gt; In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki. In the eleventh season premiere, Amy accepts his proposal, and they marry in the season finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mondaymondaynetwork.com/entertainment/the-big-bang-theory/these-behind-the-scenes-big-bang-theory-wedding-details-will-shock-you/|title=These Behind The Scenes Big Bang Theory Details Will SHOCK You|last=|first=|date=2018-05-28|work=MondayMondayNetwork.com|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]]). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers [[Barry Kripke]] and [[Leslie Winkle]]. Later, Wheaton managed to patch things up with Sheldon, only to inadvertently pass the enemy list spot to [[Brent Spiner]].&lt;ref name=S05E05&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Russian Rocket Reaction|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep5|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 13, 2011|season=5|number=5|minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon would later resume his enmity with Wheaton in season 11's "The Proton Regeneration" when they compete for the lead role in an Internet reboot of Sheldon's childhood favorite science TV series, ''Professor Proton'', and Wheaton gets the part: however, when he sees how well Wheaton plays the role and on the advice of Howard, he apologizes to him.

===Asperger syndrome===
Some viewers have asserted that Sheldon's behavior is consistent with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="av"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soraya|first=Lynne|title=Sheldony or Aspergery?: The Big Bang Theory|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/aspergers-diary/200904/sheldony-or-aspergery-the-big-bang-theory|work=Asperger's Diary (Author's Note (08/16/2009))|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers have stated that they did not use Asperger syndrome as a basis for the character, but instead thought of his actions as "Sheldony".&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=Must-Geek TV: Is the world ready for an Asperger's sitcom?|work=Slate|publisher=www.slate.com|date=February 6, 2009|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2210635/pagenum/all/#p2|accessdate=April 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210061649/http://www.slate.com/id/2210635/pagenum/all/|archivedate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series co-creator Bill Prady stated: "We write the character as the character. A lot of people see various things in him and make the connections. Our feeling is that Sheldon's mother never got a diagnosis, so we don't have one."&lt;ref name="squad"/&gt; Prady also told Alan Sepinwall of the New Jersey ''[[Star-Ledger]]'' that while Sheldon shares traits with people with Asperger's, he was uncomfortable labeling Sheldon as having Asperger's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=Does Sheldon from 'Big Bang Theory' have Asperger's?|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/08/reader_mail_does_sheldon_from.html|publisher=The Star-Ledger|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Jim Parsons noted the writers' response, but added that, in his opinion, Sheldon "couldn't display ''more'' traits" of Asperger's.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyford|first=Kathy|title='Big Bang Theory': Jim Parsons – 'Everybody has a little Sheldon in them'|work=Season Pass|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 13, 2008|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2008/11/big-bang-theory.html|accessdate=April 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722163909/http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2008/11/big-bang-theory.html|archivedate=July 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}} Specific video is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH2XD7KEeY Jim Parsons interview, part 5]. Question is from 03:18–3:31. Answer is from 4:36–6:00. Specific quote is from 5:15–5:20.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has read [[John Elder Robison]]'s memoir ''[[Look Me in the Eye]]'' about his life with Asperger syndrome, and said that: "A majority of what I read in that book touched on aspects of Sheldon." He also stated that "the way his brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/jim-parsons,27415/|title=Jim Parsons|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When another actor on the series, [[Mayim Bialik]], who plays Amy and has a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, was interviewed by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] on ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', she said of the theory that Sheldon has Asperger's: "All of our characters are in theory on the neuropsychiatric spectrum, I would say. Sheldon often gets talked about in terms of Asperger’s or OCD. He has a thing with germs, he has a thing with numbers, he’s got a lot of that precision that we see in OCD. There’s a lot of interesting features to all of our characters that make them technically unconventional socially.... And what we’re trying to show with our show is that this is a group of people who likely were teased, mocked, told that they will never be appreciated or loved, and we have a group of people who have successful careers, active social lives (that involve things like Dungeons and Dragons and video games), but they also have relationships, and that’s a fulfilling and satisfying life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Jim|title='Is Sheldon autistic?

==Background==

The Philippine festival referred to in Rosca's ''State of War'' have similarities with the yearly "[[Mardi Gras]]" held on [[Panay Island]].  However, the festival was used by Rosca as a literary instrument to present the "revolutionary theme" of the novel.&lt;ref name=Falassi/&gt;

Rosca’s ''State of War'' was also a narrative description of the effects of [[colonialism]] to the Filipinos' national [[Filipino values|identity]].&lt;ref name= "Manuel p. 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Manuel|2004| p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State of war shows women continuing their struggle in years of colonization against generations of, " rape, violence, and oppresion."&lt;ref name= "Manuel p. 106"&gt;{{harvnb|Manuel|2004|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State of War is written with nostalgia for the pre-contact days of a strong female presence in Filipino society.&lt;ref name= "Manuel p. 104"/&gt;  Other reviews also reveal that Rosca uses an, "intricate interplay of discourses on sexuality and (post)colonialism."&lt;ref name= "Nelson p. 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2000|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also traced the ancestry of the principal characters during [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish]] and [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonialism]] in the Philippines. The personal memories of the main characters was a recollection of a "[[Declaration of war|state of war]]" in the Philippines during Marcos's regime that failed to become a true revolution.&lt;ref name="Falassi"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= January 1, 2002 |url = http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1558628/The-politics-and-poetics-of.html|title = The Politics and Poetics of Philippine Festival in Ninotchka Rosca's State of War.|publisher = [[Gale (publisher)|Goliath]]| accessdate = March 23, 2010 | last=Falassi| first= Alessandro |quote= |work=International Fiction Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

T. V. Smith and [[Gaye Advert|Gaye Black]] (aka Gaye Advert) both moved from [[Bideford]], a small coastal town in [[Devon]], to form The Adverts in London in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= ''Up Yours!

Smith's Explorers'''. They were: Erik Russell (guitar), [[Stoner (bass guitarist)|Colin Stoner]] (bass), Mel Wesson (keyboards) and David Sinclair (drums). The Explorers released debut single "Tomahawk Cruise" (a response to the installation of [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[Cruise missile]]s on UK soil) in 1980, followed by an [[album]], ''The Last Words of the Great Explorer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Rabid |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-last-words-of-the-great-explorer-mw0000956554 |title=The Last Words of the Great Explorer - TV Smith,TV Smith's Explorers &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Smith then recorded as a solo artist, releasing the album ''Channel Five'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C.

Smith's next band was '''Cheap'''. They toured the UK and Europe from 1986 to 1991 and recorded the politically charged single "Third Term", released in 1990. Cheap also recorded a [[Peel Session]] for the [[BBC]]. However, they failed to find commercial backing for their album ''RIP...Everything Must Go'', which was eventually released in 1993 after the band had split up.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;

Smith went solo again with album ''March of the Giants''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/march-of-the-giants-mw0000464337 |title=March of the Giants - TV Smith &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2000-11-20 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992.

In 2005, he joined the [[United States|American]] punk band [[Amen (American band)|Amen]] on their UK tour. As well as supporting, he joined them on stage for several [[cover version|covers]] of Adverts songs, such as "One Chord Wonders", and "Gary Gilmore's Eyes". [[Casey Chaos]], lead singer, is a lifelong [[fan (person)|fan]] of The Adverts, and referenced them in the song "Hello (One Chord Lovers)".

In 2006 Smith contributed vocals to the song "Ein Jahr (Es geht voran)" on [[Fehlfarben]]'s album ''26{{frac|1|2}}''.
The same year saw his first album (''Misinformation Overload''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/misinformation-overload-mw0000777543 |title=Misinformation Overload - TV Smith &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on Boss Tuneage records. ''In The Arms of My Enemy'' followed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-arms-of-my-enemy-mw0001673127 |title=In the Arms of My Enemy - TV Smith &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2008-05-26 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a series of re-issue CDs began with 'Sparkle In The Mud',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/sparkle-in-the-mud |title=Sparkle In The Mud - Record Collector Magazine |publisher=Recordcollectormag.com |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compilation of previously unreleased material from the early-1980s period.

'''''The House of Hunger''''' ([[1978 in literature|1978]]) is a [[short story collection]] that was the first book by [[Zimbabwe]]an writer [[Dambudzo Marechera]] (1952–1987), published three years after he left university.&lt;ref name=bbaw&gt;[http://www.bbawriting.com/dambudzo-marechera/ "Dambudzo Marechera"], bbawriting.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes subtitled ''Short Stories'', this work is actually a collection of one novella of 80-odd pages ("House of Hunger") and nine satellite short stories.  The small group of texts in its entirety reflects the author’s vision of (mainly township) life in [[Rhodesia]] (specifically, the period of [[Ian Smith]]’s rule of the country that at independence became Zimbabwe) — with a minority of the shorter pieces in the book depicting an African exile's experience of life in [[Great Britain|Britain]] (mainly at [[Oxford University]], where Marechera had studied).

==Content and reception==
Commenting on the semi-autobiographical nature of the book, April McCallum has said: "Marechera’s debut ''The House of Hunger'' is as much a product of being down and out in [[Oxford]], sleeping rough, being beaten up by thugs and policeman alike and struggling with alcoholism, as it is of the Rhodesia it describes.... The 'hunger' of the book’s title does not refer only to the literal starvation which was ravaging post-independent Zimbabwe at the time. Rather it implies a more far reaching and metaphorical hunger of the soul – the vacuous yearning and emptiness within the national consciousness, aspiring for more but held back by poverty and corruption."&lt;ref&gt;April McCallum, [https://theculturetrip.com/africa/zimbabwe/articles/dambudzo-marechera-and-the-house-of-hunger/ "Zimbabwe, Literature: Dambudzo Marechera and The House of Hunger"], The Culture Trip.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published to critical acclaim in 1978 ([[Heinemann African Writers Series]], no. 207), ''The House of Hunger'' the following year was joint winner — alongside [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''Night In Tunisia'' — of the [[Guardian Fiction Prize]]. At the award ceremony,  with typically unconventional and disruptive behaviour, Marechera threw plates at his fellow guests.&lt;ref name=Witness /&gt; [[Doris Lessing]] wrote that reading Marechera's work was "like overhearing a scream".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Power, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/07/survey-short-story-dambudzo-marechera "A brief survey of the short story, part 54: Dambudzo Marechera"], ''The Guardian'', 7 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was so vivid about the experience of growing up in slum conditions in [[Harare]], [[James Currey]] (his former publisher as editorial director of [[Heinemann Educational Books]]) has described it as "a shocking book".&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p024mfks "Zimbabwe's Rebel Writer"], ''Witness'', [[BBC World Service]], 18 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helon Habila]] has called the book's opening line ("''I got my things and left''") "the coolest opening line in African fiction" as well as being "a fair summary of the writer's life."&lt;ref name=Habila&gt;Helon Habila, [http://www.vqronline.org/essay/dambudzo-marechera-life-and-times-african-writer "On Dambudzo Marechera: The Life and Times of an African Writer"], ''VQR'', Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist Drew Johnson said in 2009: "Marechera’s knack for surprise and ambush would be the envy of any airport thriller writer, yet here it’s entirely divorced from plot.  Surprise is managed in a way that I don’t know how to explain or what exactly to compare it to—it’s just genuinely unexpected.  ''The House of Hunger'' shocked me, not because it brought me the news about some bit of brutality or another—literature from every continent and era has made that more or less routine—but because I was shocked by the words on the page, the book in my hands.  Marechera seemed to be coming at me with everything, yet with an enormous artistry.  His life seemed to be at stake in his words and, while I was reading, so did mine."&lt;ref&gt;Drew Johnson, [http://therumpus.net/2009/11/drew-johnson-the-last-book-i-loved-the-house-of-hunger/ "The Last Book I Loves, ''The House of Hunger''"], ''The Rumpus'', 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BuscotParkSaloonView.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Saloon at Buscot Park showing two of the major panels – ''The Garden Court'' and ''The Rose Bower'' – in their context between the adjoining panels]]
'''''The Legend of Briar Rose''''' is the title of a series of paintings by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which were completed between 1885 and 1890. The four original paintings – '''''The Briar Wood''''', '''''The Council Chamber''''', '''''The Garden Court''''' and '''''The Rose Bower''''' – and an additional ten adjoining panels, are located at [[Buscot Park]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]].

The four major panels were first exhibited at Agnew's Gallery in [[Bond Street]], [[London]] in 1890. They were acquired by [[Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon|Alexander Henderson]], later to become the Lord Faringdon, for Buscot Park. When Burne-Jones visited the house and saw the paintings in their new setting he decided to extend the frames of each of the four paintings and fill in the gaps with joining panels which continued the rose motif from the main paintings.

==Major panels==
Each major panel measures 49 by 98¼ inches but the ten joining panels vary in width. The paintings do not tell a sequential story but record the same moment in each location.

===''The Briar Wood''===
[[Image:Briar Wood Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Briar Wood'',]]
The painting depicts the discovery of the sleeping soldiers by a Knight. In their slumber they have become completed entwined by the barbed thorns of the [[Rosa rubiginosa|Briar rose]].

Running beneath each of the major panels is an inscription of a poem by [[William Morris]], under ''The Briar Wood'' the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fateful slumber floats and flows&lt;br&gt;
About the tangle of the rose;&lt;br&gt;
But lo! the fated hand and heart&lt;br&gt;
To rend the slumberous curse apart!" &lt;ref name="vic"&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/gallery/buscot_park.htm Buscot Park, Faringdon, Oxfordshire. The Home of The Briar Rose. The Most Complete Cycle of Paintings by Edward Burne-Jones] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504110126/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/gallery/buscot_park.htm |date=2007-05-04 }} at Victorian Art in Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Council Chamber''===
[[Image:The Council Chamber Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Council Chamber'']]
The painting shows the scene in the Council chamber. The members of the council sleep, as does the King who is slumped on his throne. Under the draped curtains and through the window further soldiers can be seen sleeping.

Under ''The Council Chamber'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The threat of war, the hope of peace,&lt;br&gt;
The Kingdoms peril and increase&lt;br&gt;
Sleep on, and bide the latter day&lt;br&gt;
When Fate shall take her chain away." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Garden Court''===
[[Image:The Garden Court Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Garden Court'']]
The painting shows the weavers having fallen asleep at their [[loom]]. The walls of the castle form the backdrop to the painting as do arches of roses. 

Under ''The Garden Court'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The maiden pleasance of the land&lt;br&gt;
Knoweth no stir of voice or hand,&lt;br&gt;
No cup the sleeping waters fill,&lt;br&gt;
The restless shuttle lieth still." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Rose Bower''===
[[Image:The Rose Bower Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Rose Bower'']]
The sleeping beauty lies on her bed surrounded by her slumbering attendants. The rose is seen encircling the drapery in the background

Under ''The Rose Bower'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here lies the hoarded love, the key&lt;br&gt;
To all the treasure that shall be;&lt;br&gt;
Come fated hand the gift to take&lt;br&gt;
And smite this sleeping world awake." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subject==
The paintings depict a moment in the story of "[[Sleeping Beauty]]", the title of the series coming from the version presented by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their collection of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html "Little Briar-Rose"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related works==
Burne-Jones created two other series of paintings on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buscot-park.com/gallery/pic_035.html Paintings at Buscot page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Small Briar Rose series|''Small Briar Rose'' series]] was completed before the Buscot Park series. All three paintings –  ''The Briar Wood, The Council Chamber, The Rose Bower'' – are now in the [[Ponce Museum of Art|Museo de Arte de Ponce]], Puerto Rico.
*The [[Third Briar Rose series]] was completed after the Buscot Park series. The three paintings have been split between three collections. ''The Garden Court'' is in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]], ''The Council Chamber'' is in the [[Delaware Art Museum]], Wilmington and ''The Rose Bower'' is in the [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery|Hugh Lane Gallery of Modern Art]], Dublin.

'''''Every Blood''''' ({{lang-es|'''Todas las sangres'''}}) is the fifth novel of the [[Peruvian]] writer [[José María Arguedas]] published in 1964.  It is the author's longest and most ambitious novel, being an attempt to portray the whole of Peruvian life, by means of representations of geographic and social scenes of the entire country, although its focus is on the [[Andean]] sierra. The title alludes to the racial, regional and cultural diversity of the Peruvian nation. The novel revolves around two fundamental ideas: the danger of imperialist penetration into the country through large [[transnational companies]], and the problem of modernization of the [[indigenous people|indigenous]] world.

==Plot==
The novel starts with the suicide of Don Andres Aragon of Peralta, head of the most powerful family in the village of San Pedro de Lahuaymarca, in the mountains of Peru. His death announces the end of the feudal system that until then has been predominant in the region. Don Andres leaves two sons: Don Fermin and Don Bruno, enemies and rivals, who during the life of their father had already divided his vast property.

The principal conflict revolves around the exploitation of the Apar'cora mine, discovered by Don Fermin on his lands. Don Fermin, a prototypical national capitalist, wants to exploit the mine and bring progress to the region, which his brother Don Bruno opposes. Don Bruno is a traditional landowner and fanatical Catholic, who doesn't want his tenant farmers or Indian slaves contaminated by modernity, which, according to his judgment, corrupts people.

With the arrival of an international consortium - Wisther-Bozart- a dispute over control of the silver mine begins. Don Fermin cannot compete against the enormous transnational corporation, and sees himself forced to sell the mine, which then adopts the name Aparcora Mining Company. Anticipating the need for abundant water to work the mine, the company shows interest in the lands of the town and the neighboring rural communities, requiring that they be sold at ridiculously low prices; this counts on the complicity of corrupt authorities. The company acts as a disintegrating force that does everything necessary to maximize profit, without regard to the damages caused to the townspeople. Then there begins a process of unrest that leads to the mobilisation of peasants led by Rendon Willka, an Indian rebel who has lived in the capital of the country where he has learnt a lot. Under his orders uprisings explode, which are bloodily repressed by forces supporting the government, but which are the forerunners of the final rebellion.

==Characters==

=== Main ===
* '''Don Andrés Aragón y Peralta''' is the old man mentioned at the beginning of the story. He is the head of the most powerful family of the village of San Pedro de Lahuaymarca, a typically feudal region of the Peruvian mountains. In his proudest moment, Don Andres captures a lot of land, displacing other big landowners or feudal lords, as well as Indian rebels. Later he becomes an alcoholic and his family environment disintegrates: his children quarrel among themselves and his wife, disappointed by her family, also starts drinking. Before committing suicide by ingesting poison, Don Andrés curses his two sons, Don Fermin and Don Bruno, whom he accuses of illegally appropriating his properties, and in his will, he bequeaths his last possessions to the Indians.
* '''Don Fermín Aragón de Peralta''' is a cold businessman, a representative of national capitalism. Ambitious and obsessed by economic power, he aspires to bring economic progress into the mountains, displacing the traditional order. He believes modernization is necessary to achieve a change in Peru, but with a dose of nationalism. However, he cannot compete with a mining transnational to whom he sells his silver mine. With the money obtained he ventures in the fishing industry, buying flour mills and fish canneries in the port of Supe. He also decides to expand and modernize his mountain estate "La Esperanza". At the end of the novel he will be wounded by a shot from his own brother, Don Bruno.
* '''Don Bruno Aragón de Peralta''' is the landowner of the "La Providencia" estate, where he has tenant farmers and Indian slaves. He is violent with his workers, whom he hits and whips without mercy, and sexually abuses the women, the latter being his favourite sport. Against the arrival of modernisation, he defends the maintenance of the feudal system, because he believes that only this ensures that his Indians remain "pure", away from the corruption of money, a position with which he confronts his elder brother, Don Fermin. He is also a religious fanatic who considers that the preservation of said traditional system is a divine order that must be carried out. In the middle of the novel, and after knowing and impregnating a half-caste named Vicenta, he produces a change in his behaviour: he dedicates himself to doing good, distributing his lands to indigenous people and helping other rebels in their struggles against the overlords. He ends as righteous, executing the wicked overlord Don Lucas and trying to murder his brother, which will lead him to prison.
* '''Demetrio Rendón Willka''' is an Indian or free rebel from Lahuaymarca. He is a serene, wise, patient, lucid, brave, astute, heroic and chaste man. He represents the new consciousness of the Indians, those who expect to break with the antiquated social structure, but preserving its more positive aspects, like the social community, with the aim of counteracting the harmful effects of the imminent modernisation. He represents then an option for development in contrast with the planned modernisation of Don Fermin and the defence of the old feudal system of Don Bruno. Rendon Wilka is the first son of comuneros who arrives in Lima, where he lives in slums for 8 years, working as a road sweeper, servant, textile and construction worker. He learns to read at night-school and spends time in prison, where he has a political-religious realisation. All that experience makes him feel a new man and he returns to his land determined to lead the fight for the liberation of the Indians. He arrives in the town soon after the death of Don Andres and puts himself at the service of Don Fermin as foreman of the mine. Later Don Bruno names him as administrator of his estate "La Providencia". Finally, he leads the uprising of the Indians and his end is heroic because he dies, shot by the forces of order.

==Analysis==
The novel presents the image of a nation subjected to imperialist penetration and, above all, the problem of modernization of indigenous culture. Arguedas attempts to provide a comprehensive portrait of Peru by the representation of geographic and social settings throughout the country, although the narrative focus is on the sierra. The title of the novel expresses the complex national life of Peru, in which 'all bloods' intermingle and compete with each other harshly. But this fight envelops not only Peru but also an imperialist power seeking to manipulate it.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Tapia Soriano, reader's guide in ''El Comercio''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The confrontation between the forces of modernity and a traditional society is the main conflict that the novel addresses. Its large question revolves around the possibility of achieving genuine national development, with the certainty that a historical era of the country has ended, and that a new homeland must be built on its ruins. The destroyed order is the old [[feudal]] order. The alternatives facing the imperialist project range from a utopian return to a feudal order, imagined by Don Bruno as a natural system presided by moral principles, to a proposal of national capitalism, as stated by Don Fermin. In the novel these options are invalidated and the moral and historical legitimacy of the other alternative, represented by the rebel Rendon Willka, is emphasized. This alternative could be summarized by his collectivist sensibility (in the social sphere), in his adherence to [[Quechua people|Quechua]] values (in the cultural sphere), and a cautious modernization (at both levels).

Willka's project, however, has some components which are more idealistic than realistic, and contains perhaps an insurmountable failing: it is a project limited to the rural highlands, that distrusts and even rejects participation of the [[proletariat]] and calls into question the service of political parties. It is a project more cultural than social (although it brings into relief the importance of collectivist organization under the model of indigenous community), and more ethical than political.

In any case, during the course of the novel a consistent reflection on many aspects of Peruvian reality unfolds: in this process, precisely because it is reflective, the novel observes the impossibility of understanding the national dynamics, made up of familiar oppositions, at the margins of the overall structure of the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cornejo Polar, pp. 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over the work==
In 1965 the Institute for Peruvian Studies (Instituto de Estudios Peruanos) organized a series of roundtables to discuss the relationship between literature and sociology. The second of these, held on June 23, devoted itself to the discussion of the novel Todas las sangres, with the participation of Arguedas himself. This event was extremely important because it signified the incorporation of Arguedas' narrative into a discussion of the literature of his time.

The roundtable consisted of leftist intellectuals who were admirers of Arguedas. All of them, some cautiously and others openly, criticized the work because it was thought to be a distorted version of Peruvian society: starting with the description of a caste system which had long disappeared in the whole of the Peruvian Andes, and a primitive and caricatural view of social mechanisms. These reviews were devastating for Arguedas, who, according to [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], wrote later that night these heartbreaking lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it was almost proved by two wise sociologists and an economist, [...] that my book Todas las sangres is detrimental to the country, I don't have anything to do in this world anymore. My forces have declined, I think, inevitably.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa 1996, pp. 261-263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
According to Vargas Llosa, the criticisms that were made regarding the work during the roundtable of June 23, 1965 would be valid from a sociological point of view. Obviously, another point of view would be an analysis of the novel as literary fiction. Vargas Llosa argues that the work is also flawed in this respect, that the description of Peruvian society is profoundly false and unconvincing, not because of distance from objective truth, but because of a lack of internal force emanating from the intricacies of the fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa 1996, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the British critic and poet Martin Seymour-Smith praised the novel highly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those who by temperament reject the horrors of machinery and man's misuse of it will find rich reward in this, the most poetic of all novels about 'savages'. If Levi-Strauss is a great thinker, and he is (at his best), then what can Arguedas be? Something infinitely larger, certainly."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Seymour-Smith, The New Guide to Modern World Literature (New York: Peter Bedrick Books, 1985) p. 950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Message==
Arguedas' novel reveals his proposed solution to indigenous problems: Andean culture must not be destroyed, as part of some or other form of modernization that assimilates. Harmonious thinking with nature is accepted, in order to develop a revolutionary mindset that projects a future of well-being and freedom. The national ideal is that of multivariate Peru, with ecological, multicultural and multilingual diversity.&lt;ref&gt;as witnessed in the [[Peruvian Constitution]] of 1993, which aims to preserve diversity of customs, alternative medicine, languages etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peruvian nation can be seen as being more than a national project; it can be said that there are several national cores, but they are not geographically localizable. In the intellectual underworld of Peru, bound to political power, is a subsidiary Western worldview, strongly refuted and distorted by current social historical reality.

==Film adaptation==
The film adaptation of the novel was directed by Michel Gomez in 1987. The actors Richardo Tosso, Rafael Delucchi, Pilar Brescia, Andres Alencastre, Oswaldo Sivirichi and Juan Manuel Ochoa appear in the cast.

'''The Women's Art Association of Saskatchewan''' (1928-1957) was a community organization of women artists and wives of the Regina art community, who were promoting Saskatchewan women's art locally and outside the province.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sknac.ca/index.php?page=ArticlesDetail&amp;id=36|title=Saskatchewan NAC Articles {{!}} A History of the Regina Artist Guilds|last=Squareflo.com|website=www.sknac.ca|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1928 by artists [[Barbara Barber]] and [[Sybil Henley Jacobson]], the association organized exhibitions and classes, often in collaboration with local art collector, Norman Mackenzie.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/art/associations1.html|title=Women's Art Association|last=|first=|date=|website=Saskatchewan Council for Archives and Archivists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
[[Everal Brown]], who had grown up in Swift Current and taken painting as part of her primary education, was known to be another notable member.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
The association was involved in local art classes, which led to the creation of the [[Moose Jaw Art Guild]] (formerly the Moose Jaw Fine Art Guild) in 1949 by ten Moose Jaw women. In the Guild's early years, some members continued to meet with the Women's Art Association, and in 1950, the Guild even sent members' work to the National [[Women's Art Association of Canada]] Show in Toronto.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Women's Art Association of Saskatchewan disbanded in 1957.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow''' (Traceability is Credibility) is an ongoing [[conceptual art]] work created by [[Bryan McCormack]], encompassing performance, [[social media]] installation art and drawings, on the subject of the [[European migrant crisis|European refugee crisis]].

== Development ==

[[File:Refugee Drawing Yesterday.jpg|thumb|''Yesterday'' drawing by an 18 year old Syrian boy currently living in Kara Tepe Refugee Camp, Lesbos Island, Greece]]

Throughout 2016 and part of 2017, McCormack visited squats and [[Syrian refugee camps|refugee camps]] across Europe. At each location he worked with refugees, asking them to produce three drawings: one of their life before (Yesterday), one of their current life (Today) and one of their life imagined in the future (Tomorrow). The results of these drawings have been shared through the project's social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.villamedici.it/fr/programme.../les...villa/.../les-jeudis-de-la-villa-3-novembre|title=www.villamedici.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/.../ruolo-dell-arte-contemporanea-nella-crisi|title=www.adnkronos.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artemagazine.it/.../2721-roma-villa-medici-gli-appuntamenti|title=www.artemagazine.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gossip.libero.it/search/bryan-mccormack|title=gossip.libero.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artribune.com/artista-mostre-biografia/bryan-mccormack/|title=www.artribune.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==

Several hundred of these refugee drawings along with video performance studies inspired by the drawings will be part of a multidisciplinary installation created by McCormack at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini during the 2017 [[Venice Biennale]]. This installation is in conjunction with a performance, curated by the artist and Dr. Henry Bell, with over forty students from [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exibart.com/notizia.asp?IDNotizia=51263&amp;IDCategoria=204|title=COME PUÒ AGIRE L’ARTE CONTEMPORANEA NELLA CRISI EUROPEA DEI RIFUGIATI?
