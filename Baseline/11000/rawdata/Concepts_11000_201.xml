{{tone|date=October 2015}}
An '''absurdity''' is a thing that is extremely [[reason|unreasonable]], so as to be [[Foolishness|foolish]] or not taken [[Seriousness|seriously]], or the state of being so. "Absurd" is an adjective used to describe an absurdity, e.g., "Tyler and the boys laughed at the absurdity of the situation." "this encyclopedia article is absurd".&lt;ref name=WD&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/absurd?show=0&amp;t=1296966875 Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the Latin ''absurdum'' meaning "[[out of tune]]", hence irrational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/absurdities Wordreference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin ''surdus'' means "[[deaf]]", implying [[stupidity]].&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;
Absurdity is contrasted with [[seriousness]] in reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/laughable Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, absurdity may be synonymous with [[ridiculous]]ness and [[nonsense]]. In specialized usage, absurdity is related to extremes in bad reasoning or pointlessness in reasoning; ridiculousness is related to extremes of incongruous juxtaposition, laughter, and ridicule; and nonsense is related to a lack of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaningfulness]]. [[Absurdism]] is a concept in philosophy related to the notion of absurdity.

== History ==
Absurdity has been used throughout western history regarding foolishness and extremely poor reasoning to form belief.&lt;ref name=AWTD&gt;Absurdities – Webster’s Timeline Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Ancient Greece ===
In [[Aristophanes]]' 5th century BC comedy ''[[The Wasps]]'', his protagonist [[Philocleon]] learned the "absurdities" of [[Aesop's Fables]], considered to be unreasonable fantasy, and not true.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wasps'', Parmenides&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] often used "absurdity" to describe very poor reasoning, or the conclusion from adopting a position that is false and reasoning to a false conclusion, called an "absurdity" (argument by reductio ad absurdum). Plato describes himself as not using absurd argumentation against himself in [[Parmenides]].&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'', Plato&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gorgias]], Plato refers to an "inevitable absurdity" as the outcome of reasoning from a false assumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Gorgias'', Plato&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] rectified an irrational absurdity in reasoning with empiricism using [[likelihood]], "once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Aristotle in Poetics, S.H. Butcher&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that absurdity in reasoning being veiled by charming language in poetry, "As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it… But in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

=== Renaissance and early modern periods ===
[[Michel de Montaigne]], father of the [[essay]] and modern [[skepticism]], argued that the process of abridgement is foolish and produces absurdity, "Every abridgement of a good book is a foolish abridgement… absurdity &lt;nowiki&gt;[is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not to be cured… satisfied with itself than any reason, can reasonably be."&lt;ref&gt;''The Essays of Michel De Montaigne'', Michel de Montaigne name&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]], an early promoter of [[empiricism]] and the scientific method, argued that absurdity should not always be laughed at, since it is a necessary component of scientific progress, where bold new ways of thinking and bold hypotheses often led to absurdity, "For if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you but great [[WP:Bold|boldness]] is seldom without some absurdity."&lt;ref&gt;Essays, Francis Bacon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobbes' ''Table of Absurdity'' ====
[[Thomas Hobbes]] distinguished absurdity from errors, including basic linguistic errors as when a word is simply used to refer to something which does not have that name. According to [[Aloysius Martinich]]: "What Hobbes is worried about is absurdity. Only human beings can embrace an absurdity, because only human beings have language, and philosophers are more susceptible to it than others".&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{Citation|last=Martinich|first=Aloysius|year=1995|title=Hobbes Dictionary|publisher=Blackwell}} page 27, citing ''[[Leviathan]]'' 5.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes wrote that "words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call absurd, insignificant, and nonsense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangle; or, accidents of bread in cheese; or, immaterial substances; or of a free subject; a free will; or any free, but free from being hindered by opposition, I should not say he were in an error, but that his words were without meaning, that is to say, absurd".&lt;ref name=L&gt;''[[Leviathan]]'', [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;layout=html#chapter_89826 Chapter V].&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished seven types of absurdity. Below is the summary of Martinich, based on what he describes as Hobbes' "mature account" found in ''"De Corpore"'' 5., which all use examples that could be found in Aristotelian or scholastic philosophy, and all reflect "Hobbes' commitment to the new science of [[Galileo]] and [[William Harvey|Harvey]]". This is known as "Hobbes' Table of Absurdity".
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of an accident." For example, "existence is a being" or, "a being is existence". These absurdities are typical of [[scholastic philosophy]] according to Hobbes.
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of a phantasm." For example, "a ghost is a body".
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of a name." For example, "a universal is a thing".
#"Combining the name of an accident with the name of a phantasm." For example, "colour appears to a perceiver".
#"Combining the name of an accident with the name of a name." For example, "a definition is the [[essence]] of a thing".
#"Combining the name of a phantasm with the name of a name." For example, "the idea of a man is a universal".
#"Combining the name of a thing with the name of a speech act." For example, "some entities are beings ''per se''".

According to Martinich, [[Gilbert Ryle]] discussed the types of problem Hobbes refers to as absurdities under the term "[[category error]]".

Although common usage now considers "absurdity" to be synonymous with "[[ridiculous]]ness", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning,&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;&lt;ref name=L/&gt; while ridiculousness has to do with [[laughter]], [[superior (hierarchy)|superiority]], and [[deformity]].&lt;ref&gt;The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke?

== Demarcation with sound reasoning ==
Medical commentators have criticized  methods and reasoning in [[alternative and complementary medicine]] and [[integrative medicine]] as being either absurdities, or being between [[evidence]] and absurdity, often misleading the public with euphemistic terminology such as the expressions "alternative medicine" and "complementary medicine", and calling for a clear demarcation between valid scientific evidence and [[scientific method]]ology and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;"Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Between Evidence and Absurdity", ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine'', Volume 52, Number 2, Spring 2009, pp. 289–303, Edzard Ernst&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Propagation of the Absurd: demarcation of the Absurd revisited", Wallace Sampson, Kimball Atwood IV, ''The Medical Journal of Australia'', 183 (11/12)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humor ==
{{Further|Theory of humor|Absurdist humor}}
{{quote|"I can see nothing" – Alice in Wonderland
::"My, you must have good eyes" – Cheshire Cat}}
Absurdity is used in [[theory of humor|humor]] to make people laugh or to make a sophisticated point, for example in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky]]", a poem of nonsense verse, originally featured as a part of his absurdist novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' (1872); Carroll was a logician and parodied [[logic]] using illogic and inverting logical methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4334590 ''Wonderland Revisited'', Harry Levin]&lt;/ref&gt;
Argentine novelist [[Jorge Luis Borges]] used absurdities in his short stories to make points.&lt;ref&gt;''"to justify this 'absurdity' is the primordial object of this note"'', Labyrinths, Jorge Luis Borges, p. 39, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wtPxGztYx-UC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Borges+Absurdity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yyqv5MUbM8&amp;sig=6wj59dP1zrXuD1kparLFIOpFkDY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=975VTbTSC4WosQOH2rH4BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' is considered absurdist by some.&lt;ref&gt;"On the Absurdity of Kafka's Works from Transformer", G Yan-li, ''Journal of Yunyang Teachers College'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
[[Psychology|Psychologists]] study how humans adapt to constant absurdities in life.&lt;ref&gt;''The psychology of adaptation to absurdity: tactics of make-believe'', by Seymour Fisher, Rhoda Lee Fisher, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kejcgoDXJDwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=absurdity&amp;ots=eKERP2kuuX&amp;sig=ZpvYE8ZEzNwRGsxY_lT1nuopN9Q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising ===
In [[advertising]], the presence or absence of an absurd image was found to moderate negative attitudes toward products and increase product recognition.&lt;ref&gt;"Effects of Absurdity in Advertising: The Moderating Role of Product Category Attitude and the Mediating Role of Cognitive Responses", ''Journal of Advertising'', 2000, Leopold Arias-Bolzmann, Goutam Chakraborty, John C. Mowen, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4189133]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Rhetoric==
Absurdity arises when one’s own speech deviates from common sense, is too poetic, or when one is unable to defend themselves with speech and reason. In Aristotle’s book [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]], Aristotle discusses the situations in which absurdity is employed and how it affects one’s use of persuasion. The idea of a man being unable to persuade someone by his words is absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honeycutt|first=Lee|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html|publisher=Alpine Lakes Design|accessdate=October 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008201141/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html|archive-date=2014-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, a speech should not be too poetic because it imports absurdity and tastelessness to a speech. Any unnecessary information to the case is unreasonable and makes the speech unclear. If the speech becomes too unclear; the justification for their case becomes unpersuasive, making the argument absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honeycutt|first=Lee|title=Aritotle's Rhetoric|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet3-3.html|publisher=Alpine Lakes Design|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Legal ==&lt;!--'Doctrine of absurdity' redirects here--&gt;
The absurdity doctrine is a legal theory in American courts.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scalia |first1=Antonin  |last2=Garne |first2=Bryan A.  |date=2012 |title=Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts|trans-title= |url= |format= |language= |location= |publisher= |isbn=9780314275554 |via= |subscription= |quote=A provision may be either disregarded or judicially corrected as an error (when the correrection is textually simple) if failing to do so would result in a disposition that no reasonable person could approve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|234-239}} One type of absurdity, known as the "[[Clerical error|scrivener's error]]", occurs when simple textual correction is needed to amend an obvious clerical error, such as a misspelled word.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012/&gt;{{rp|234-235}} Another type of absurdity, called "evaluative absurdity", arises when a legal provision, despite appropriate spelling and grammar, "makes no substantive sense". An example would be a statute that mistakenly provided for a ''winning'' rather than ''losing'' party to pay the other side's reasonable attorney's fees.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012/&gt;{{rp|235-237}} In order to stay within the remit of [[textualism]] and not reach further into [[purposivism]], the doctrine is restricted by two limiting principles: "...the absurdity and the injustice of applying the provision to the case would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application"&lt;ref&gt;Story, Joseph.

== Philosophy ==
{{Further|Absurdism}}
It is illogical to seek purpose or meaning in an uncaring world without purpose or meaning, or to accumulate excessive wealth in the face of certain death. Absurdity is used in existentialist and related philosophy to describe absurdly pointless efforts to try to find such meaning or purpose in an objective and uncaring world, a philosophy known as [[absurdism]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

In his paper, ''The Absurd'', [[Thomas Nagel]] analyzed the perpetual absurdity of human life. Absurdity in life becomes apparent when we realize the fact that we take our lives seriously, while simultaneously perceiving that there is a certain arbitrarity in everything we do.  He suggests never to stop searching for the absurd.  Furthermore, he suggests searching for irony amongst the absurdity.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 
=== Philosophy of language ===
{{Further|Moore's paradox}}
[[G. E. Moore]], an English [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]], cited as a paradox of language such superficially absurd statements as, "I went to the pictures last Tuesday but I don't believe it", which can be true and logically consistent, and which are not contradictory on further consideration of the user's linguistic intent. [[Wittgenstein]] observes that in some unusual circumstances absurdity itself disappears in such statements, as there are cases where "It is raining but I don't believe it" can make sense, i.e., what appears to be an absurdity is not nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgensteinian Accounts of Moorean Absurdity,  Philosophical Studies, Volume 92, Number 3, John N. Williams, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t77l87484l2860mu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theater of the Absurd ===
The [[Theater of the Absurd]] was a [[surrealist]] movement demonstrating [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s of absurdism.

== Logic and computer science ==
=== ''Reductio ad absurdum'' ===
[[Reductio ad absurdum]], reducing to an absurdity, is a method of proof in polemics, logic and [[mathematics]], whereby assuming that a proposition is true leads to absurdity; a proposition is assumed to be true and this is used to deduce a proposition known to be false, therefore the original proposition must have been false. It is also an argumentation style in [[polemics]], whereby a position is demonstrated to be false, or "absurd", by assuming it and reasoning to reach something known to be believed to be false or to violate common sense; e.g., as used by Plato to argue against other philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Reduction to Absurdity, Yao-yong, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[absurdity constraint]] is used in the logic of [[model transformation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A Constructive Approach to Testing Model Transformations, Theory and Practice of Model Transformations, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2010, Volume 6142/2010, 77-92, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-13688-7_6}}, Camillo Fiorentini, Alberto Momigliano, Mario Ornaghi, Iman Poernomo, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n572730744340m56/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constant in logic ===
The "absurdity constant" is used in formal logic.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical harmony'', Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, Volume 27, Number 4 (1986), 459-482, Alan Weir&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule in logic ===
The absurdity rule is a rule in logic, as used by [[Patrick Suppes]] in ''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings''.&lt;ref&gt;''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings'', Patrick Suppes [https://books.google.com/books?id=QUgmsMm5LcAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=Absurdity+constant+Suppes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkoEeQ8WGF&amp;sig=9S55s11JoR22Pov8IGBHV7qKhXA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Eh9kTa_ZDo-ssAPoksygCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
{{Quote|"I believe because it is absurd"|Tertullian}}
Absurdity is cited as a basis for some theological reasoning about formation of belief and faith, such as in [[fideism]], an [[epistemological]] theory that reason and faith may be hostile to each other. The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is attributed to [[Tertullian]] from ''[[De Carne Christi]]'', as translated by philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Philosophical Dictionary: From the French'', Voltaire&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[New Advent Church]], what Tertullian actually says in DCC 5 is "... the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm On the Flesh of Christ, Fathers of the Church, New Advent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the Spanish theologian [[Tostatus]] used what he thought was a reduction to absurdity arguing against a spherical earth using dogma, arguing that a spherical earth would imply the existence of [[antipodes]], which would be impossible since this would require either that Christ has appeared twice, or that the inhabitants of the antipodes would be forever damned, which he claimed was an absurdity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Absurdity can refer to any strict religious dogma that pushes something to the point of violating common sense. For example, inflexible religious dictates are sometimes termed [[pharisaism]], referring to unreasonable emphasis on observing exact words or rules, rather than the intent or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic "Pharisaic", Your Diciontionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It was Pharisaic in its ritualism and… asceticism… proclaiming a doctrine of absurdity to the enlightened pagan", ''The Churches of the New Testament'', George W. McDaniel, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic Your Dictionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Willet]] grouped absurdities with "flat contradictions to scripture" and "heresies".&lt;ref&gt;The doctrines and practices of the Church of Rome truly represented, John Gother, 1593&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America''''' is a 1997 book by [[art critic]] [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' called ''American Visions'' a "sensational history of American art." and wrote "The contrast between the influence of nature and of the city on American art is the fulcrum of Hughes' entire narrative ..."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice Reviews]]'' stated "The book bears the stamp of the author's aesthetic sensibilities (which value works of art for their technical competence as well as visual and intellectual qualities), his critical acuity, and his accomplished writing."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/900642/Reviews |title=American visions : the epic history of art in America |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a starred review and described it as an "eminently readable handbook on American art.", writing "His readings of three centuries of both art works and trends are lively, detailed, and persuasive (though perhaps a bit too harsh regarding recent art), and his ultimately pessimistic take is expressed with great clarity. A meaty and illuminating excavation, full of vigor and punch..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-hughes-6/american-visions-the-epic-history-of-an-in-amer/ |title=AMERICAN VISIONS: The Epic History of An in America |date=1 March 1997 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] noted "this is no bland, dumbed-down survey intended to flatter its subject or its audience. Hughes writes with an aesthete's disdain for political posturing, a traditionalist's belief in the importance of technical skills (painters are frequently taken to task for their shoddy draftsmanship) and a pragmatist's contempt for mystagogical bunk.", found "his account of the contemporary scene is disappointingly brief." and concluded "This slashingly witty, briskly paced, ferociously opinionated tour of the American visual landscape is a book that even the most un-likeminded readers will love to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-679-42627-1 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America |date=31 March 1997 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' review calls it a "witty and impassioned history of American art from its beginnings to the present day", "beautiful and essential", notes that "Mr. Hughes fortunately remains the critic throughout his historical canvassing, making distinctions and judgments without taking sides." and concludes "With it, Mr. Hughes has made American art safe for the receptive alien deep inside us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Siegel |date=27 April 1997 |title=A critic interprets American art as a perpetual beginning  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/970427.27siegelt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Visions'' has also been reviewed by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=30 October 1997 |title=Big Daddy |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n21/linda-nochlin/big-daddy |journal=London Review of Books |publisher=LRB Limited |volume=19 |number=21 |pages=10,11 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Journal of American History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.

{{selfref|For the blocking policy on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy]].}}

On the [[Internet]], a '''block''' or '''ban''' is a technical measure intended to restrict access to information or resources. Blocking and its inverse, unblocking, may be implemented by the owners of computers using software.&lt;ref name="Westfall"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.airsassociation.org/services-new/airs-knowledge-network-n/airs-articles/item/119-internet-blocking |title=Internet Blocking |first=Joseph |last=Westfall |year=2012 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|including China]] and Singapore, block access to certain news information.&lt;ref name="Westfall"/&gt; In the United States, the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] requires schools receiving federal funded discount rates for Internet access to install [[Content-control software|filter software]] that blocks obscene content, pornography, and, where applicable, content "harmful to minors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act |title=Children's Internet Protection Act &amp;#124; FCC.gov  |work=fcc.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocking may also refer to denying access to a web server based on the [[IP address]] of the client machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/access.html |title=Access Control - Apache HTTP Server|work=httpd.apache.org |year=2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain websites, including [[social networking service|social networks]] such as [[Facebook]] or editable databases like [[Wikimedia project]]s and other [[wiki]]s, users can apply blocks (based in either IP number or account) on other users deemed undesirable to prevent them from performing certain actions. Blocks of this kind may occur for several reasons and produce different effects: in social networks, users can unrestrictedly block other users, typically by preventing them from sending messages or viewing the blocker's information or profile. Privileged users can apply blocks that affect the access of the undesirables to the entire website.

Blocking is used by [[Internet_forum#Moderators|moderators]] and administrators of social media and forums to deny access to users that have broken their rules and will likely do so again, in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly discussion place. Common reasons for blocking are [[spamming]], [[trolling]], and [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]. Some criticize cases of the use of bans by administrators of large websites, such as [[Twitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/07/20/twitter-bans-milo-yiannopoulos-for-good-while-cracking-down-on-abuse/ |title=Twitter bans conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos for good, while cracking down on abuse|year=2016 |accessdate=15 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that these bans may be politically or financially motivated. However, websites have a legal right to decide who is allowed to post, and users often respond by [[Foot voting|"voting with their feet"]] and going to a place where the administrators see their behavior as acceptable.

==Effects==
Blocked users may be completely unable to access all or part of a site's content, which is usually the case when censoring or filtering mechanisms are responsible for the block. Under a [[Stealth banning|stealth ban]], a user is given the false impression that their content is still being posted to the site, when in reality it is being hidden from all other users.

==Evasion==

Ban evasion is the act of attempting to get around a ban, whether temporary or permanent, on a website.

Alternate accounts set up by people evading bans from websites are referred to as [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]]. Typically, if someone is caught evading a ban with a sockpuppet, the sockpuppet account is banned. If the original ban was temporary, it may be extended or even made permanent. Sometimes, the user's [[IP address]] may be banned as well so the user cannot access the site or create new accounts. Some sites may remove all but a few traces of the ban-evader. [[TV Tropes]] and [[Wikipedia]], for example, may mass-delete any pages created by a ban-evader.

Ban evasion can be detected by tracing a user's IP address. If two accounts are using the same IP address, it could be a sign of ban evasion. Also, the use of a [[VPN]], shown by rapid, drastic changes of IP address by the same user in a short period of time, can also be a sign that the user was trying to get around a ban. Ban evasion can also be spotted if posts or other contributions from two accounts look the same or similar, or on sites where the same email can be associated with multiple accounts, identical or similar emails can be a sign of ban evasion. Users who have been permanently banned for ban evasion may not be able to appeal their ban, which is the case on sites such as TV Tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/WhatToDoIfYouAreSuspended|title=What to Do If You Are Suspended / Administrivia|website=Tvtropes.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating sockpuppets, ban evaders use a variety of tactics to disguise the fact that the new account was created by a previously banned user, such as using new names, an alternate email address, [[Virtual private network|VPNs]] or [[proxy server]]s to mask their IP address, changing their IP address (sometimes only needing to rely on a dynamic IP address to automatically change it after a time), or using the site from public Internet access locations such as schools and libraries.

[[Image:Clockwise arrow.svg|thumb|right|The clockwise direction]]
Two-dimensional [[rotation]] can occur in two possible directions. A '''clockwise''' (typically abbreviated as '''CW''') motion is one that proceeds in the same direction as a [[clock]]'s hands: from the top to the right, then down and then to the left, and back up to the top. The opposite sense of [[rotation]] or [[Turn_(geometry)|revolution]] is (in [[North American English]]) '''counterclockwise''' ('''CCW''') or (in [[Commonwealth English]]) '''anticlockwise''' ('''ACW''').

==Terminology==
Before clocks were commonplace, the terms "[[sunwise]]" and "deasil", "deiseil" and even "deocil" from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language and from the same root as the Latin "dexter" ("right") were used for clockwise. "[[Widdershins]]" or "withershins" (from [[Middle Low German]] "weddersinnes", "opposite course") was used for counterclockwise.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
[[Image:Counterclockwise arrow.svg|thumb|right|The counterclockwise or anticlockwise direction]]

The terms clockwise and counterclockwise can only be applied to a rotational motion once a side of the rotational plane is specified, from which the rotation is observed. For example, the daily rotation of the [[Earth]] is clockwise  when viewed from above the [[South Pole]], and counterclockwise when viewed from above the [[North Pole]] (considering "above a point" to be defined as "farther away from the center of earth and on the same ray").

Clocks traditionally follow this sense of rotation because of the clock's predecessor: the [[sundial]]. Clocks with hands were first built in the Northern Hemisphere (see ''[[Clock]]''), and they were made to work like horizontal sundials. In order for such a sundial to work north of the equator during spring and summer, and north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] the whole year, the noon-mark of the dial must be placed northward of the pole casting the shadow. Then, when the [[Sun]] moves in the sky (from east to south to west), the shadow, which is cast on the sundial in the opposite direction, moves with the same sense of rotation (from west to north to east). This is why hours must be drawn in horizontal sundials in that manner, and why modern clocks have their numbers set in the same way, and their hands moving accordingly. For a vertical sundial (such as those placed on the walls of buildings, the dial being ''below'' the post), the movement of the sun is from right to top to left, and, accordingly, the shadow moves from left to down to right, i.e., counterclockwise. This effect is caused by the plane of the dial having been rotated through the plane of the motion of the sun and thus the shadow is observed from the other side of the dial's plane and is observed as moving in the opposite direction. Some clocks were constructed to mimic this. The best-known surviving example is the astronomical clock in the [[Münster Cathedral]], whose hands move counterclockwise.

Occasionally, clocks whose hands revolve counterclockwise are nowadays sold as a novelty. Historically, some [[Judaism|Jewish]] clocks were built that way, for example in some synagogue towers in Europe such as the [[Jewish Town Hall (Prague)|Jewish Town Hall in Prague]], to accord with right-to-left reading in the [[Hebrew language]]. In 2014 under [[Bolivia]]n president [[Evo Morales]], the clock outside the Legislative Assembly in [[Plaza Murillo]], [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]], was shifted to counterclockwise motion to promote indigenous values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/25/bolivia-clocks-time-run-different|title= Bolivia turns back the clock in bid to rediscover identity and 'southernness'|author= Sam Jones and Sara Shahriari|date= June 25, 2014|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Shop-work===
Typical [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]], [[screw]]s, [[Screw#Bolt|bolt]]s, [[bottle cap]]s, and jar lids are tightened (moved away from the observer) clockwise and loosened (moved towards the observer) counterclockwise in accordance with the [[right-hand rule]].

To apply the right-hand rule, place one's loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw, nut, bolt, or cap ultimately to move, and the curl of the fingers, from the palm to the tips, will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw, nut, bolt or cap to achieve the desired result. Almost all threaded objects obey this rule except for a few left-handed exceptions described below.

The reason for the clockwise standard for most screws and bolts is that [[supination]] of the arm, which is used by a right-handed person to tighten a screw clockwise, is generally stronger than [[pronation]] used to loosen. 

Sometimes the opposite (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading is used for a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older [[car]]s and trucks had right-handed [[lug nut]]s on the right wheels and left-handed lug nuts on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen.  For [[bicycle pedal]]s, the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the [[Spinning wheel#Treadle wheel|flyer whorl]] of a [[spinning wheel]] uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A [[turnbuckle]] has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other.  Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but [[acetylene]], [[propane]], and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.

===Mathematics===
In [[trigonometry]] and [[mathematics]] in general, plane [[angle]]s are conventionally measured counterclockwise, starting with 0° or 0 [[radian]]s pointing directly to the right (or east), and 90° pointing straight up (or north).  However, in [[navigation]], [[compass]] headings increase clockwise around the compass face, starting with 0° at the top of the compass (the northerly direction), with 90° to the right (east).

A circle defined parametrically in a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Orientation and "handedness"|positive Cartesian plane]] by the equations {{nowrap|1=''x'' = cos ''t''}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = sin ''t''}} is traced counterclockwise as the angle ''t'' increases in value, from the right-most point at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}. An alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point.

===Games and activities===
In general, most card games, board games, parlor games and multiple team sports play in a clock-wise turn rotation in Western Countries and Latin America with a notable resistance to playing in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise). Traditionally (and still continued for the most part) turns pass counter-clockwise in many Asian countries. In Western countries when speaking and discussion activities take part in a circle, turns tend to naturally pass in a clockwise motion even though there is no obligation to do so. Curiously, unlike with games, there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counter-clockwise motion.

Notably, the game of baseball is played counter-clockwise.

==In humans==
Most left-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings clockwise, while most right-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings counterclockwise. This is believed to result from dominant brain hemispheres,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. Blau, ''The torque test: A measurement of cerebral dominance.'' 1974, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; though some attribute it to muscle mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Poster of a public decency campaign in Qatar.png|thumb|200px|right|Poster in Qatar calling on foreign women to dress modestly]]
[[Clothing]] laws vary considerably around the world. In general, in most countries, there are no laws which prescribe what clothing is required to be worn. However, the community standards of clothing are set indirectly by way of prosecution of those who wear something that is not socially approved. Those people who wear insufficient clothing can be prosecuted in many countries under various offences termed [[indecent exposure]], public indecency or other descriptions. Generally, these offences do not themselves define what is and what is not acceptable clothing to constitute the offence, and leave it to a judge to determine in each case.

Most clothing laws concern which parts of the body must ''not'' be exposed to view; there are exceptions. Some countries have strict clothing laws, such as in some [[Islamic]] countries. Other countries are more tolerant of non-conventional attire and are relaxed about nudity.  Many countries have different laws and customs for men and women, what may be allowed or perceived often varies by gender.&lt;ref Name="Kirby"&gt;{{cite book

Separate laws are usually in place to regulate [[obscenity]], which includes certain depictions of people in various states of undress, and [[child pornography]], which may include similar photographs of children.

In some countries, non-sexual toplessness or nudity is legal. However, private or public establishments can establish a [[dress code]] which requires visitors to wear prescribed clothing.

There are a variety of laws around the world which affect what people can and cannot wear. For example, some laws require a person in authority to wear the appropriate uniform. For example, a policeman on duty may be required to wear a uniform; and it can be illegal for the general public to wear a policeman's uniform. The same could apply to firefighters and other emergency personnel. In some countries, for example in Australia, the [[Scouts Australia|boy scouts]] uniform is also protected.

In most [[Court|courts of law]] lawyers and judges are required by law or custom to wear [[Court Dress|court dress]], which may entail robes or traditional wigs.

In many countries, regulations require workers to wear protective clothing, such as [[safety helmet]]s, shoes, vests etc., as appropriate. The obligation is generally on employers to ensure that their workers wear the appropriate protective clothing. Similarly, health regulations may require those who handle food to wear hair covering, gloves and other clothing.

Governments can also influence standards of dress shown on television through its licensing powers.

In addition to nude beaches and similar exceptional locations, there are some public events in which nudity is tolerated more than usual, such as the [[naked bike ride]]s held in several countries.

== International laws and customs and culture ==
There are many specific circumstances where body parts have to be covered, often for safety or sanitary reasons.

In some [[Islamic countries]], women must conceal almost their entire bodies (see [[hijab]]).

==Australia==

In [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area.&lt;ref name=Lifehackerau&gt;{{cite news|title=Is it legal to sunbathe topless in Australia?|date=Nov 30, 2015|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Chris Jager|publisher=Lifehacker|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/is-it-legal-to-sunbathe-topless/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Legally #FreeTheNipple in Australia|date=March 11, 2016|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Katherine Gillespie|publisher=Vice.com|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/mbv4pb/how-to-legally-freethenipple-in-australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbake topless without fuss.&lt;ref name=Lifehackerau&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Breastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia. Under the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]], no business or service provider can discriminate against a breastfeeding woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bf-info/breastfeeding-and-law/legalright|title=Breastfeeding in public - your legal rights|date=Aug 2016|access-date=12 Nov 2018|publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1940, in the Title VI of the Penal Code, naming crimes against sexual dignity (until 2009 crimes against [social] conventions), the fourth chapter is dedicated to a crime named "public outrage [related] to modesty" ({{lang-pt|ultraje público ao pudor}}, {{IPA-pt|uwˈtɾaʒi ˈpublikw aw puˈdoʁ|pron}}).

It is composed of two articles, Art. 233 "Obscene Act", "to practice an obscene act in a public place, or open or exposed to the public", punished with arrest of 3 months to 1 year or a fine; and Art. 234 "Obscene Written Piece or Object", to do, import, export, purchase or have in one's property, to ends of trade, distribution or public display, any written, drawn, painted, stamped or object piece of obscenity, punished with arrest of 6 months to 1 years or a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm DJi -233 a 234- DL-002.848-1940 - Còdigo Penal - Ultraje Público ao Pudor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918053011/http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm |date=2013-09-18 }} Dji.com.br, {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often used against people who expose their nude bodies in public environments that were not warranted a license to cater to the demographic interested in such practice (the first such place was the Praia do Abricó in Rio de Janeiro, in 1994), even if no sexual action took place, and it may include, for example, the chest area of women. Such a thing took place in [[FEMEN]] protests in São Paulo, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://direito.folha.uol.com.br/1/category/ato+obsceno/1.html|title=Category:|website=Para Entender Direito|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Pervasive points of criticism to the legislation have included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pauloqueiroz.net/a-proposito-dos-crimes-de-ultraje-publico-ao-pudor/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221225924/http://pauloqueiroz.net/a-proposito-dos-crimes-de-ultraje-publico-ao-pudor/ |archive-date=2014-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* They do not attack anyone's sexual dignity, instead causing outrage at best, but generally just slight discomfort or embarrassment, that can be easily avoided through not looking to such a scene.
* The Art. 234 is aside obsolete, unconstitutional, for the 1988 post-military dictatorship Constitution having in its Fifth Chapter: "[the people] are free to the expression of intellectual, artistic, scientific and communicative activity, independently of censorship and license", reason to which, instead of making it suffer penal restriction, gives any distribution of media the right to be fully exerted.
* The flourishing internet culture of Brazil, where such clearly banned media is freely shared in a public place, as well as its pornographic industry and sex shops.

===Exceptions===
Brazil has about 35 spaces open or mostly open to the public where it is possible to freely practice nudism, its sole public spaces being 8 beaches. They are not criminalized when the clothes-free area is private and away from a view from the street, or through legislation when the beaches are officiated by a municipal decree, for example. It has hosted the meeting of the International Federation of Naturism in 2008, and there is a growing interest in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/turismo/praia/conheca-praias-de-nudismo-e-saiba-como-se-comportar,98b4512006c04410VgnVCM4000009bcceb0aRCRD.html|title=Conheça praias de nudismo e saiba como se comportar|website=Vidaeestilo.terra.com.br|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada, s.173 of the ''Criminal Code''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.part-v.html|title=PART V -- SEXUAL OFFENCES, PUBLIC MORALS AND DISORDERLY CODUCT|website=Efc.ca|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits "indecent acts". There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act (other than that the exposure of the genitals for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-80.html#h-59|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
so the decision of what state of undress is "indecent", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges to decide. Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Beaupré'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: "mere nude sunbathing is not of sufficient moral turpitude to support a charge for doing an indecent act."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court&lt;/ref&gt; Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends "against public decency or order," in view of the public and "without a lawful excuse."  The courts have found that [[nude swimming]] is not offensive under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Benolkin'', 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that "this offence is not aimed at conduct such as swimming nude at an isolated beach, even where the accused misjudges the loneliness of the beach".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toplessness]] is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in [[Guelph, Ontario]] while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121121082438/http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | archivedate = 2012-11-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?language=en&amp;searchTitle=1996+CanLII+1119+%28ON+CA%29&amp;origin=%2Fen%2Fon%2Fonca%2Fdoc%2F1996%2F1996canlii1119%2F1996canlii1119.html&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2000/2000bcsc902/2000bcsc902.html District of Maple Ridge v. Meyer, 2000 BCSC 902 (CanLII)]. See esp. para [49] and [55].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the court ruling has been tested and upheld several times.

A Canadian legal advice web site observes, "Canada has a tangle of confusing and inconsistently-enforced nudity laws. . . . The public nudity section is one of the few areas of the Criminal Code that requires the attorney general’s consent to lay a charge, implying a certain grey area around what constitutes illegal nudity. According to the government’s Public Prosecution Service, the attorney general’s consent is needed for two reasons: to avoid the specific harm that could result from prosecuting an innocent person; and to avoid the general harm resulting from prosecuting a case that isn’t in the public interest. &lt;ref&gt; https://criminal.findlaw.ca/article/is-it-legal-to-be-naked-in-canada/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places. If a person is nude ''and'' also exhibiting lewd and lascivious, or obscene behaviour, then they may fall afoul of obscenity laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebeaches.org.nz/legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Court of New Zealand]] has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves. However in practice, the likelyhood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public ''beach'' is low, and in the past authorities have declined to prosecute topless and nude people on beaches.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebeaches.org.nz/legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/6321828/Nudity-not-necessarily-an-offence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzherald.co.nz/front-page-top-stories/news/article.cfm?c_id=698&amp;objectid=11824550&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qatar==
In [[Qatar]], the penal code punishes and forbids the wearing of revealing or indecent clothes,&lt;ref name=Doha&gt;{{cite news|title=Organizers are calling this campaign "One of Us" - not "No Nudity"|url=http://dohanews.co/post/24459500266/update-organizers-are-calling-this-campaign-one|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Doha News}}&lt;/ref&gt; this dressing-code law is enforced by a government body called "Al-Adheed". In 2012, a Qatari [[NGO]] organized a campaign of "public decency" after they deemed the government to be too lax in monitoring the wearing of revealing clothes; defining the latter as "not covering shoulders and knees, tight or transparent clothes".&lt;ref name=Doha/&gt; The campaign targets foreigners who constitute the majority of Qatar's population.&lt;ref name=Doha/&gt;

==Singapore==
In [[Singapore]], nudity is illegal. Offenders will be charged under Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.

==South Africa==
In [[South Africa]] specific clothing laws exist for the general public. Nudity is treated under indecent exposure. On 3 April 2015 the country's first official clothing optional beach, Mpenjati Beach near Trafalgar in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], opened after the [[Hibiscus Coast Local Municipality]] approved the South African Nudist Association's (SANNA) application. Although nudity has gradually been tolerated on [[Sandy Bay, Cape Town|Sandy Bay]] in [[Cape Town]] after the National Party (NP) lost the election in 1994, and strict enforcement of its moral values is no longer applied, it is not an official legally recognised public nude beach. Partial nudity is also tolerated on other beaches.

==United Arab Emirates==
Since 2008, the municipality of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] has ensured that signs are posted on beaches warning women against topless bathing and indecent exposure contrary to the cultural values of the UAE. There is no fine for breaking this rule, however a warning is issued and if necessary, ejection from the beach. This was said to be in response to residents' complaints about tourists sunbathing topless or nude and changing their clothes in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubai-takes-action-on-indecent-sunbathing|title=Dubai takes action on 'indecent' sunbathing|website=Thenational.ae|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also signs at malls and shopping centers that advocates modest clothing which indicates that shoulders and knees must be covered, and public nudity is against the law. Violation of the law lead to a warning to cease and desist at first and would be followed with arrest if the person chooses to disobey the law.

==United Kingdom==
There are three legal jurisdictions in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]). There are a further three jurisdictions that are [[Crown dependencies]] ([[Isle of Man]], [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and [[Bailiwick of Jersey]]). The details of the law regarding [[public nudity]] differ substantially between them. In general nudity is not an explicit offence but there are various offences that may apply to nudity in unsuitable circumstances. What constitutes unsuitable circumstances varies according to the jurisdiction but nudity is legal in a much wider range of circumstances than many people assume.

The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] has published guidance for England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/nudity_in_public/|title=Nudity in Public - Guidance on handling cases of Naturism|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|website=Crown Prosecution Service|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Naturism]] has published guidance for England and Wales, and Scotland. They are preparing guidance for Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bn.org.uk/activities/frn_legal/|title=Free Range Naturism - Legal Guidance|publisher=British Naturism|website=British Naturism|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales the two statutes most likely to be applicable are s.5 [[Public Order Act 1986]], and for aggressive nudity s.66 [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].

==United States==
In the [[United States of America]] there are variety of different offenses, such as "indecent exposure", "public lewdness", "public indecency", "disorderly conduct" and so on, may involve exposure of a specific body part (genitals, buttocks, anus, nipples on women), a specific intention or effect (being sexually suggestive, offending or annoying observers).  In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present.  In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception.  There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having [[sexual intercourse in public]], or publicly [[caressing]] someone in a sexual way.  In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably [[erection|erect]] penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing.  In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act.  In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances. In most states, there is a governing state statute which defines the offense; in Maryland and Massachusetts, indecency is defined by [[case law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/state_laws.htm|title=Naturist State Laws|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some local (county and municipal) governments also regulate personal exposure, as well as commercial activities such as [[strip club]]s.

Case law in general governs the interpretation of the statutory definition, and in some cases allows for additional exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/us_district_courts.html|title=US District Courts|first=Robert|last=Morton|website=Naturisteducation.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/Court%20Cases.htm#List%20of%20Cases|title=Nudist Court Cases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, exposure of the head, upper chest, and limbs is legal, and considered socially acceptable except among certain religious communities.

Federal, state, and local regulations for certain occupations require various pieces of protective clothing for the safety of the wearer.  Such items include [[hard hat]]s, safety [[vest]]s, life jackets, [[apron]]s, [[hairnet]]s, and [[steel-toe boots]].

In the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear ([[sagging (fashion)|sagging]]). The practice was banned in some places.

Some states and towns have loose, or no, regulations for requiring clothing. The city of San Francisco has a history of [[Social nudity in San Francisco|public nudity]], including at public events such as [[Bay to Breakers]]. The town of [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], [[Vermont|VT]] experienced a brief period during which there was public nudity, until a law was passed banning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brattleborochamber.org/one-and-only|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315061920/http://brattleborochamber.org/one-and-only|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 March 2013|title=The One and Only - Brattleboro Vermont|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Germany
|There are no explicit legal regulations on clothing in Germany. Nudity on private grounds is considered as legal even if visible from outside. The same applies for naked sunbathing as long as not otherwise stated by local laws. On the other hand, naked jogging or naked cycling have been considered in certain circumstances as public nuisance by several courts.&lt;br&gt;
Note: The German Penal Code determines "exhibitionism" (sec. 183) as an act of public exposure committed by a man for sexual arrousal and "causing a public disturbance" (sec. 183a) as a sexual activity in public. Therefore, non-sexual nudity is not considered as crime or misdemeanour.
|Section 118 of the Act on Regulatory Offences: "(1) Whoever commits a grossly offensive act which is apt to disturb or endanger the public and to prejudice public order shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.&lt;br&gt;
(2) The regulatory offence may be sanctioned by a regulatory fine unless the act may be sanctioned pursuant to other provisions."&lt;br&gt;
The regulatory fine is between 5 and 1.000 Euros (sec. 17 (2) of the act). More likely, the local or state police may politely demand to cover up without further sanction or a cautionary fine of 5 to 55 Euros if immediately obeyed (sec. 56 (1) of the act).

'''Cotton made in Africa''' is a project initiative launched and managed by the [[Aid by Trade Foundation]] (AbTF), headquartered in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabu.de/themen/international/laender/westafrika/ Participation of the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union [[NABU]]]&lt;/ref&gt; AbTF was founded in 2005 by Dr. Michael Otto, the Hamburg business entrepreneur and Chairman of [[Otto GmbH|Otto Group]]. Cotton marketed under the badge is produced according to strict criteria for environmental, economic and social sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Promising agribusiness |author=Christina Gradl |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/de/article/kleinbauern-und-unternehmen-koennen-von-klug-geplanten-wertschoepfungsketten-profitieren|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development work in Africa==
===Core principles===
'Helping people to help themselves' is a core CmiA principle. The smallholder farmers receive on-site training in improved cultivation methods which allow them to increase their crop yields, generate higher income and thus raise their standard of living through their own efforts. CmiA plans to finance training over the long term through financial contributions from participating cotton trading companies, as well as through levying CmiA licence fees. Strictly speaking, CmiA is not organic cotton but places a strong emphasis on reducing the use of pesticides. However, pesticides listed under the [[Stockholm Convention]] are banned, as non-degradable or partially degradable [[Persistent Organic Pollutant|organic toxins]], so-called POPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/10 Project objectives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702041928/http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/10 |date=2010-07-02 }} (source: CimA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/15 Ecology]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (source: CimA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries===
CmiA Project countries include the West African states of Benin and Burkina Faso as well as Zambia - and since April 2008, also Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greeninnovation.googlepages.com/Studie_Cotton_made_in_Africa.pdf In the German WWF’s feasibility study (February 2005, Executive Summary, p. 1) [[Mali]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]] are listed as Project countries instead of Zambia und Mozambique]&lt;/ref&gt; These four countries are amongst the poorest on the planet. The Project reaches around 130,000 smallholder farmers in these regions and their efforts produce some 85,000 tonnes of raw CmiA cotton from a cultivation area of some 160.000 [[hectar]]es.

===Training===
In on-site training the African smallholder farmers learn about efficient methods of cultivation and how best to conserve precious resources. These skills help them increase their crops’ yield and quality through their own efforts. This qualification approach is aimed at helping the smallholder farmers find their own way out of the poverty trap in the long term, through targeting a significant improvement in the farmers’ income. And the results of initial studies show that the Project is having a beneficial effect: in Zambia, for instance, the crop yields of some groups of farmers have more than doubled,&lt;ref&gt;Data supplied by [http://www.welthungerhilfe.de/baumwolle_afrika.html German Agro Action]&lt;/ref&gt; while in Benin the quality of the cotton has been substantially improved after only two planting seasons.

===Strategic alliance===
In its detailed implementation of the Project, the Foundation works closely with its partners and specialists on site in the Project areas. Besides the [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ), CmiA is also supported by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmz.de/de/presse/nl/newsletter_2009_01/index.html#anker7590571 [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|BMZ]] newsletter, January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; while the DEG, GTZ as well as the cotton traders Dunavant, ICA Talon and Faso Coton also participate in the Project. Further [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] supporting CmiA in an advisory capacity are [[Accenture]], [[Avery Dennison]], [[German Agro Action]],  [[Naturschutzbund Deutschland|German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union]] (NABU), [[McCann Erickson]] and the [[World Wide Fund For Nature]]. With the signature of a partnership agreement in December 2008 between the DEG and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for the support of the cotton sector in sub-saharan Africa, CmiA gained a further valuable partner and sponsor to help finance the roll-out of the Project to other West African countries.

=== Verification ===
In-field cotton production, transport, ginning and storage of the raw cotton are all evaluated within the framework of an independent verification process based on a filter and traffic-light system. The structure and content of the CmiA verification system was prepared by the Dutch [[University of Wageningen]] and subsequently further developed by the consultancy [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]], in close co-operation with central Aid by Trade Foundation stakeholders. The core of the verification system contains a filter based on a series of exclusion criteria, as well as a group of sustainability indicators. The exclusion criteria include the most abusive forms of child labour, slavery, forced labour and infringement of freedom of association (union membership). The sustainability indicators include soil and water protection practices such as [[crop rotation]] and [[soil refertilisation]] as well as the responsible use of pesticides.

== Marketing ==
=== Concept ===
As a pragmatic, market-orientated approach, the economic feasibility of Cotton made in Africa is not dependent on charity but on activating market forces. This means that expenses such as premium payments to the farmers, which ultimately add to the cost of the raw product, do not arise. CmiA-produced raw cotton is traded at market prices; in this regard the AbTF does not act as a cotton trader but rather as Project developer and holds the marketing rights to CmiA. As distribution partners, the members of the Demand Alliance pay a licence fee which is then reinvested in the Project countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/11 Textile chain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827051700/http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/11 |date=2010-08-27 }} (source: CimA)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand Alliance ===
CmiA targets the mass market for cotton goods, and the Demand Alliance of international textile companies is a decisive factor in the Project initiative’s success. These companies take up CmiA cotton for the production of their own goods and through this demand create a pull effect which runs right along the textile chain to reach the smallholder farmers in Africa. Demand Alliance members include Anson's, Celio, Otto Group, Peek &amp; Cloppenburg, PUMA, QVC, Tchibo, Tom Tailor, s.Oliver and 1888 Mills, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;Members of the [http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/12 Demand Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024041849/http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/12 |date=2009-10-24 }} (source: CmiA)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality Seal ===
Cotton made in Africa is used in the fashion and home textiles segments and all articles using CmiA are distinguished by a red label. CmiA is an ingredient brand: this means that it is not a product brand, but rather a brand for African cotton which is used as a raw material in branded products. CmiA thus defines itself as a Quality Seal and appears besides an already existing brand. It is also applied by branded product suppliers as an ‘extra quality mark’ to distinguish and differentiate their respective product.

=== Consumer trends ===
A 2008 survey of German consumers, commissioned by Accenture and carried out by market research institute Forsa, confirms the validity of the business model and development approach of initiatives such as [[Fairtrade]] or CmiA and organic products. Results show that 85 percent of German consumers are willing to pay more for clothing that can be proven to have been produced under environmentally sustainable and ethical working conditions. According to the survey, the significance of the topic of sustainability in consumer behaviour is also growing: a quarter of consumers surveyed stated they were willing to pay over 20 percent more for clothing produced under sustainable conditions, although one in three respondees stated they planned to reduce their clothing expenditure. A clear consequence of these developments is that companies which ignore the trend towards sustainability are very likely to lose customers. 77 percent of Germans stated that they would buy less or even no products from their preferred supplier, if it could not prove that these had been produced under sustainable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accenture.com/Countries/Germany/About_Accenture/Newsroom/News_Releases/AccentureUmfrageMode.htm Forsa survey for Accenture]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8738">'''Delegitimisation''' (also spelled '''delegitimation''') is the withdrawal of legitimacy, usually from some institution such as a state, cultural practice, etc. which may have acquired it explicitly or implicitly, by statute or accepted practice. It is a [[Social psychology|sociopsychological]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlN6FyNjMRsC&amp;pg=PA29 The Oxford Handbook of Intergroup Conflict] edited by Linda Tropp, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikt:process|process]] which undermines or marginalises an entity by presenting facts and/or value judgments e construed to withdraw [[wikt:legitimacy|legitimacy]] &lt;ref&gt;Clabaugh, Gary ''et al.''

"Causes and Consequences of Delegitimization: Models of Conflict and Ethnocentrism," ''Journal of Social Issues,'' Vol. 46, pp. 65-89; retrieved 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; with the ultimate goal of justifying [[harm]] of an [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]].&lt;ref name="Tropp31" /&gt;

The concept applies to a wide spectrum of social contexts ranging from disputes about political entities to [[chronic illness]]es.&lt;ref name="Illness"&gt;Arthur Kleinman, "The Social Course of Chronic Illness" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bzAwGBbGJTwC&amp;pg=PA181 Chronic Illness: From Experience to Policy]'' edited by S. Kay Toombs, David Barnard, Ronald Alan Carson, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition, function and mechanisms==
{{POV-section|date=November 2014}}
Delegitimization is the process of constructing a "categorization of groups into extreme social categories which are ultimately excluded from society".&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, p. 272; retrieved 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegitimization provides "the moral and the discursive basis to harm the delegitimized group, even in the most inhumane ways".&lt;ref name=Tropp31&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlN6FyNjMRsC&amp;pg=PA31 The Oxford Handbook of Intergroup Conflict] edited by Linda Tropp, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Bar-Tal]] identified five [[rhetoric]]al strategies by which delegitimization occurs: [[dehumanization]] (e.g. "uncivilized savages"), trait characterization ("idiots", "parasites"), [[outcast (person)|outcast]]ing ("murderers", "terrorists"), use of political labels ("Nazis", "imperialists"), and delegitimization by group comparison (e.g. with the [[Huns]]).&lt;ref name="Christie"/&gt; Volpato et al. found eight delegitimizing strategies,&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, (abstract); retrieved 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; including trait characterisation, political labels, group comparison, segregation, outcasting and using a delegitimized group to stigmatize another group. For example, images of derogated target groups were published in the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] magazine ''La Difesa della Razza'' in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, p. 275; retrieved 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A process affecting actual beliefs rather than mere rhetoric is presumed to be at work however. An early controlled study published in 1960 showed that "serious and violent conflict can change previously held positive views of the other group" as in the case of the 1959 border disputes between India and China, eventually leading to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]. "Before the dispute, Indian students considered the Chinese to be artistic, religious, industrious, friendly, progressive, and honest. But, as the conflict developed, the Chinese were [[stereotype]]d by the same Indian students also as aggressive, cheating, selfish, war-mongering, cruel and shrewd."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlN6FyNjMRsC&amp;pg=PA35 The Oxford Handbook of Intergroup Conflict] edited by Linda Tropp, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Bar-Tal found that the process mostly occurs in the cases of intractable [[Conflict (process)|conflict]]s and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x-YL3Rgl80sC&amp;pg=PA321 Delegitimization] entry in ''The Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology'' edited by Daniel J. Christie.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bar-Tal, in these contexts delegitimization is part of an unholy trinity together with beliefs in justness of own goals and collective self-victimhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlN6FyNjMRsC&amp;pg=PA37 The Oxford Handbook of Intergroup Conflict] edited by Linda Tropp, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and examples ==
In 1975, "delegitimization" became a kind of "[[buzz word]]" when then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] accused the international body of [[Delegitimization of Israel|delegitimizing Israel]] by passing a "[[Zionism is racism]]" resolution.&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;Rosenberg, M.J.

Au contraire, elle implique la reconnaissance de son existence et consolide la solution des deux Etats''"; retrieved 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paired concepts of "legitimize" and "de-legitimize" have gained currency in discussions about nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Bruce ''et al.'' [http://carnegieendowment.org/static/npp/pdf/Smaller_and_Safer.pdf  "Smaller and Safer, A New Plan for Nuclear Postures,"] ''Foreign Affairs'' (US), Vol. 89, No. 5, September/October 2010; excerpt, "These postures also perpetuate a mutual reliance on nuclear weapons that lends legitimacy to the nuclear ambitions of other nations"; ''compare'' Berry, Ken ''et al.''

[[Arthur Kleinman]] found that a delegitimation discourse affects the social course of many [[chronic illness]]es, including [[pain]] patients, disorders like [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], and other [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] illnesses like [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] or [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Illness"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''diagonal functor''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a) = \langle a,a \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which maps objects as well as morphisms.  This [[functor]] can be employed to give a succinct alternate description of the product of objects ''within'' the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;: a product &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; is a universal arrow from &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.  The arrow comprises the projection maps.

More generally, given a  [[small category|small]] [[index category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt;, one may construct the [[functor category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt;, the objects of which are called [[Diagram (category theory)|diagrams]]. The diagonal functor is one particular diagram: for each object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[constant functor]] with fixed object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a) \in \mathcal{C}^\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt;.  The diagonal functor &lt;math&gt;\Delta : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}^\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt; assigns to each object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; the functor &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a)&lt;/math&gt;, and to each morphism &lt;math&gt;f: a \rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; the obvious [[natural transformation]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt; (given by &lt;math&gt;\eta_j = f&lt;/math&gt;).  Thus, for example, in the case that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[discrete category]] with two objects, the diagonal functor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is recovered.

Diagonal functors provide a way to define [[limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[colimit]]s of diagrams. Given the functor &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a)&lt;/math&gt;, the natural transform from this functor  to any other [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} : \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[cone (category theory)|cone]]. Among all such cones is a [[universal cone]]; this cone is the limit of the diagram &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the limit of any functor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} : \mathcal{J} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; 
is a [[universal arrow]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta \rightarrow \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;; the [[colimit]] is a universal arrow &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \Delta&lt;/math&gt;.  

If every functor from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; has a limit (which will be the case if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Complete category|complete]]), then the operation of taking limits is itself a functor from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{J}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  The limit functor is the [[adjoint functors|right-adjoint]] of the diagonal functor.  Similarly, the colimit functor (which exists if the category is cocomplete) is the left-adjoint of the diagonal functor.  

For example, the diagonal functor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; described above is the left-adjoint of the binary [[product (category theory)|product functor]] and the right-adjoint of the binary [[coproduct|coproduct functor]]. Other well-known examples include the [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]], which is the limit of the [[span (category theory)|span]], and the [[terminal object]], which is the limit of the [[Initial and terminal objects|empty category]].

&lt;!-- many terms should be wikilinked and/or defined. --&gt;

A '''digital identity''' is information on an entity used by [[Computer|computer systems]] to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organization, application, or device. ISO/IEC 24760-1 defines identity as "set of attributes related to an entity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2011 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57914 |title=ISO/IEC 24760-1: A framework for identity management - Part 1: Terminology and concepts |publisher=ISO |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information contained in a digital identity allows for assessment and authentication of a user interacting with a business system on the web, without the involvement of human operators. Digital identities allow our access to computers and the services they provide to be automated, and make it possible for computers to mediate relationships.

The term "digital identity" has also come to denote aspects of civil and personal identity that have resulted from the widespread use of identity information to represent people in computer systems.

Digital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to their civil, or national, identities. Furthermore, the use of digital identities are now so widespread that many discussions refer to "digital identity" as the entire collection of information generated by a person’s online activity. This includes usernames and passwords, online search activities, birth date, social security, and purchasing history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23915/digital-identity|title=What is a Digital Identity? - Definition from Techopedia|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially where that information is publicly available and not anonymized, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social identity. This may also be referred to as an [[online identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=Digital Identity – A Gateway to All Other Use Cases|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2018/01/Digital-Identity-Gateway-to-All-Other-Use-Cases-004-01-2018-0034.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal and social effects of digital identity are complex and challenging. However, they are simply a consequence of the increasing use of computers, and the need to provide computers with information that can be used to identify external agents.

==Background==

A critical problem in cyberspace is knowing with whom one is interacting. Using static identifiers such as password and email there are no ways to precisely determine the identity of a person in digital space, because this information can be stolen or used by many individuals acting as one. Digital identity based on dynamic entity relationships captured from behavioral history across multiple websites and mobile apps can verify and authenticate an identity with up to [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ 95 percent accuracy].

By comparing a set of entity relationships between a new event (e.g., login) and past events, a pattern of [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ convergence] can verify or authenticate the identity as legitimate where divergence indicates an attempt to mask an identity. Data used for digital identity is generally [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ anonymized] using a one-way hash, thereby avoiding privacy concerns. Because it is based on behavioral history, a digital identity is impossible to fake or steal.
==Related terms==

===Subject and entity===
A digital identity may also be referred to as a digital Subject or digital [[entity]] and is the digital representation of a set of claims made by one party about itself or another person, group, thing or concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eclipse.org/Digital_Identity|title=Digital Identity - Eclipsepedia|website=wiki.eclipse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deh|first=Dragana|last2=Glođović|first2=Danica|date=2018-09-05|title=The Construction of Identity in Digital Space|url=https://fmkjournals.fmk.edu.rs/index.php/AM/article/view/257|journal=AM Journal of Art and Media Studies|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|pages=101|doi=10.25038/am.v0i16.257|issn=2406-1654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attributes, preferences and traits===
Every digital identity has zero or more [[identity attributes]]. Attributes are acquired and contain information about a subject, such as medical history, purchasing behaviour, bank balance, age and so on.&lt;ref name=Windley&gt;{{cite book |first=Phillip J. |last=Windley |title=Digital Identity |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2005 |pages=8–9 |isbn=978-0596008789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferences retain a subject's choices such as favourite brand of shoes, preferred currency. Traits are features of the subject that are inherent, such as eye colour, nationality, place of birth. While [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of a subject can change easily, traits change slowly, if at all. Digital identity also has entity relationships derived from the devices, environment and locations from which an individual transacts on the web.

==Technical aspects==

===Trust, authentication and authorization===
In order to assign a digital representation to an entity, the attributing party must trust that the claim of an attribute (such as name, location, role as an employee, or age) is correct and associated with the person or thing presenting the attribute (see [[Digital identity#Authentication|Authentication]] below). Conversely, the individual claiming an attribute may only grant selective access to its information, e.g. (proving identity in a bar or PayPal authentication for payment at a web site). In this way, digital identity is better understood as a particular viewpoint within a mutually-agreed relationship than as an objective property.

====Authentication====
[[Authentication]] is a key aspect of trust-based identity attribution, providing a codified assurance of the identity of one entity to another. Authentication methodologies include the presentation of a unique object such as a [[bank credit card]], the provision of confidential information such as a [[password]] or the answer to a pre-arranged question, the confirmation of ownership of an e-mail address, and more robust but relatively costly solutions utilizing [[encryption]] methodologies. In general, business-to-business authentication prioritises security while user to business authentication tends towards simplicity. Physical authentication techniques such as [[iris scan]]ning, [[handprinting]], and [[Speaker recognition|voiceprinting]] are currently being developed and in the hope of providing improved protection against [[identity theft]]. Those techniques fall into the area of Biometry ([[biometrics]]). A combination of static identifiers (username &amp; passwords) along with personal unique attributes (biometrics), would allow for [[Multi-factor authentication|multi factor authentication]]. This process would yield more creditable authentication, which in nature is much more difficult to be cracked and manipulated.

Whilst technological progress in authentication continues to evolve, these systems do not prevent aliases from being used. The introduction of [[strong authentication]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for online payment transactions within the [[European Union]] now links a verified person to an account, where such person has been identified in accordance with statutory requirements prior to account being opened. Verifying a person opening an account online typically requires a form of device binding to the credentials being used. This verifies that the device that stands in for a person on the Web is actually the individuals device and not the device of someone simply claiming to be the individual. The concept of [[reliance authentication]] makes use of pre-existing accounts, to piggy back further services upon those accounts, providing that the original source is reliable. The concept of reliability comes from various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding legislation in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/bsa_aml_examination_manual2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; EU28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52013PC0045 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00371&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Anti-Money-Laundering-AMLCFT-Act-and-Regulations|title=AML/CFT Act and Regulations|first=The Department of Internal|last=Affairs|website=www.dia.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; where second parties may place reliance on the customer due diligence process of the first party, where the first party is say a financial institution. An example of reliance authentication is PayPal's verification method.

====Authorization====
[[Authorization (computer access control)|Authorization]] is the determination of any entity that controls resources that the authenticated can access those resources.  Authorization depends on authentication, because authorization requires that the critical attribute (i.e., the attribute that determines the authorizer's decision) must be verified.  For example, authorization on a credit card gives access to the resources owned by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], e.g., Amazon sends one a product. Authorization of an employee will provide that employee with access to network resources, such as printers, files, or software.   For example, a database management system might be designed so as to provide certain specified individuals with the ability to retrieve information from a database but not the ability to change data stored in the database, while giving other individuals the ability to change data.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Consider the person who rents a car and checks into a hotel with a credit card. The car rental and hotel company may request authentication that there is credit enough for an accident, or profligate spending on room service.  Thus a card may be refused when trying to book the balloon trip,  though there is adequate credit to pay for the rental, the hotel, and the balloon trip. Then when the person leaves the hotel and returns the car, the actual charges are authorized (too late for the balloon trip).

Valid online authorization requires analysis of information related to the digital event including device and environmental variables. These are generally derived from the [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ hundreds of entities] exchanged between a device and business server to support an event using standard Internet protocols.

===Digital identifiers===
Digital identity fundamentally requires digital identifiers—strings or tokens that are unique within a given scope (globally or locally within a specific domain, community, directory, application, etc.). Identifiers are the key used by the parties to an identification relationship to agree on the entity being represented. Identifiers may be classified as ''omnidirectional'' and ''unidirectional''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=Kim |title=The Laws of Identity |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996456 |work=msdn.microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omnidirectional identifiers are intended to be public and easily discoverable, while unidirectional identifiers are intended to be private and used only in the context of a specific identity relationship.

Identifiers may also be classified as resolvable or non-resolvable. Resolvable identifiers, such as a [[domain name]] or [[e-mail address]], may be dereferenced into the entity they represent, or some current state data providing relevant attributes of that entity.  Non-resolvable identifiers, such as a person's real-world name, or a subject or topic name, can be compared for equivalence but are not otherwise machine-understandable.

There are many different schemes and formats for digital identifiers. The most widely used is [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) and its internationalized version [[Internationalized Resource Identifier]] (IRI)—the standard for identifiers on the [[World Wide Web]]. [[OpenID]] and [[Light-Weight Identity]] (LID) are two web authentication protocols that use standard [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] URIs (often called URLs), for example.

===Digital Object Architecture===
Digital Object Architecture (DOA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Robert |last1=Kahn |first2=Robert |last2=Wilensky |title=A Framework for Distributed Digital Object Services |url=http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/k-w.html |publisher=Corporation for National Research Initiatives |date=May 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a means of managing digital information in a network environment. A digital object has a machine and platform independent structure that allows it to be identified, accessed and protected, as appropriate. A digital object may incorporate not only informational elements, i.e., a digitized version of a paper, movie or sound recording, but also the unique identifier of the digital object and other metadata about the digital object. The metadata may include restrictions on access to digital objects, notices of ownership, and identifiers for licensing agreements, if appropriate.

===Handle System===
The [[Handle System]] is a general purpose distributed information system that provides efficient, extensible, and secure identifier and resolution services for use on networks such as the internet. It includes an open set of protocols, a [[namespace]], and a reference implementation of the protocols. The protocols enable a [[distributed computing|distributed computer system]] to store identifiers, known as handles, of arbitrary resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate, access, contact, authenticate, or otherwise make use of the resources. This information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state of the identified resource without changing its identifier, thus allowing the name of the item to persist over changes of location and other related state information. The original version of the Handle System technology was developed with support from the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]].

===Extensible Resource Identifiers===
A new [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard for abstract, structured identifiers, [[XRI]] (Extensible Resource Identifiers), adds new features to URIs and IRIs that are especially useful for digital identity systems. [[OpenID]] also supports XRIs, and XRIs are the basis for [[i-name]]s.

===Risk-Based Authentication===

[https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+RiskBased+Authentication+Q3+2017/-/E-RES121265 Risk-Based Authentication] is an application of digital identity whereby multiple entity relationship from the device (e.g., operating system), environment (e.g., DNS Server) and data entered by a user for any given transaction is evaluated for correlation with events from known behaviors for the same identity. Analysis are performed based on quantifiable metrics, such as transaction velocity, locale settings (or attempts to obfuscate), and user-input data (such as ship-to address). Correlation and deviation are mapped to tolerances and scored, then aggregated across multiple entities to compute a transaction risk-score, which assess the risk posed to an organization.

===Policy aspects===
There are proponents of treating self-determination and freedom of expression of digital identity as a new [[Human rights|human right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Some have speculated that digital identities could become a new form of [[Juristic person|legal entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Clare|title=Digital Identity and Mistake|journal=International Journal of Law and Technology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomies of identity===
Digital identity attributes—or data—exist within the context of [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].

The development of digital identity network solutions that can interoperate taxonomically-diverse representations of digital identity is a contemporary challenge. [[Folksonomy|Free-tagging]] has emerged recently as an effective way of circumventing this challenge (to date, primarily with application to the identity of digital entities such as bookmarks and photos) by effectively flattening identity attributes into a single, unstructured layer. However, the organic integration of the benefits of both structured and fluid approaches to identity attribute management remains elusive.

===Networked identity===
Identity relationships within a digital network may include multiple identity entities. However, in a decentralised network like the Internet, such extended identity relationships effectively require both (a) the existence of independent trust relationships between each pair of entities in the relationship and (b) a means of reliably integrating the paired relationships into larger relational units. And if identity relationships are to reach beyond the context of a single, federated ontology of identity (see [[#Taxonomies of identity|Taxonomies of identity]] above), identity attributes must somehow be matched across diverse ontologies. The development of network  approaches that can embody such integrated "compound" trust relationships is currently a topic of much debate in the [[blogosphere]].

Integrated compound trust relationships allow, for example, entity A to accept an assertion or claim about entity B by entity C. C thus vouches for an aspect of B's identity to A.

A key feature of "compound" trust relationships is the possibility of selective disclosure from one entity to another of locally relevant information. As an illustration of the potential application of selective disclosure, let us suppose a certain Diana wished to book a hire car without disclosing irrelevant personal information (utilising a notional digital identity network that supports compound trust relationships). As an adult, UK resident with a current driving license, Diana might have the UK's [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] vouch for her driving qualification, age and nationality to a car-rental company without having her name or contact details disclosed. Similarly, Diana's bank might assert just her banking details to the rental company.  Selective disclosure allows for appropriate [[privacy]] of information within a network of identity relationships.

A classic form of networked digital identity based on international standards is the "White Pages".

An electronic white pages links various devices, like computers and telephones, to an individual or organization. Various attributes such as X.509v3 digital certificates for secure cryptographic communications are captured under a schema, and published in an [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] or [[X.500]] directory. Changes to the LDAP standard are managed by working groups in the [[IETF]], and changes in X.500 are managed by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The ITU did significant analysis of gaps in digital identity interoperability via the FGidm, focus group on [[identity management]].

Implementations of X.500[2005] and LDAPv3 have occurred worldwide but are primarily located in major data centers with administrative policy boundaries regarding sharing of personal information. Since combined X.500 [2005] and LDAPv3 directories can hold millions of unique objects for rapid access, it is expected to play a continued role for large scale secure identity access services. LDAPv3 can act as a lightweight standalone server, or in the original design as a TCP-IP based Lightweight Directory Access Protocol compatible with making queries to a X.500 mesh of servers which can run the native OSI protocol.

This will be done by scaling individual servers into larger groupings that represent defined "administrative domains", (such as the country level digital object) which can add value not present in the original "White Pages" that was used to look up phone numbers and email addresses, largely now available through non-authoritative search engines.

The ability to leverage and extend a networked digital identity is made more practicable by the expression of the level of trust associated with the given identity through a common [[Identity Assurance Framework]].

===Self-sovereign identity===
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is the concept that people can store information about their digital identity in a location of their choice. This information can then provide to third parties on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitsonblocks.net/2017/05/17/gentle-introduction-self-sovereign-identity/|title=A gentle introduction to self-sovereign identity|date=2017-05-16|work=Bits on blocks|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of blockchain technologies decentralized identities can be based on SSI that are not owned by a single provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-rising-tide-of-decentralized-identity-2e163e4ec663|title=The Rising Tide of Decentralized Identity|last=Foundation|first=Decentralized Identity|date=2017-10-11|website=Decentralized Identity Foundation|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security issues and privacy==
With automated face recognition, tagging, location tracking and widespread digital authentication systems many actions of a person become easily associated with identity,&lt;ref name=Camp&gt;{{cite news |first=L. Jean |last=Camp |title=Digital Identity |journal=IEEE Technology and Society Magazine |publisher=IEEE |year=2004 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1337889&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Dasc_p_Sequence%26filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A29516%29}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cause, sometimes [[privacy]] is lost and security is subverted. An identity system that builds on confirmed [[Pseudonymity|pseudonyms]] can provide privacy and enhance security for digital services and transactions. Cyberspace creates opportunities for identity theft. Exact copies of everything sent over a digital communications channel can be recorded. Thus, cyberspace needs a system that allows individuals to verify their identities to others without revealing to them the digital representation of their identities.

With sharing content on social media and the internet becoming a social norm there are many preventive measures that users can take to protect themselves. Companies and databases collect information about us, even if we're simply browsing the internet or online shopping. Collecting all this data allows for them to customize what we see based on what we like. Derived through algorithms these third parties gather information to track us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Estee N.|date=2015-03|title=The Invisible Digital Identity: Assemblages in Digital Networks|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compcom.2015.01.005|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=35|pages=125–140|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2015.01.005|issn=8755-4615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding all of this information, many of it is stored on a cloud.   Protecting one's personal information and digital identity is a gray area. As of right now laws regarding digital safety are very vague and lack validity. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Clare|date=2013-08|title=Digital identity, privacy and the right to identity in the United States of America|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2013.05.011|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=29|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2013.05.011|issn=0267-3649}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to the legal aspects, this ethically cross a line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; We are presented with the legal terms which are known as the terms and conditions, which are discussed more in depth in [[Privacy]], however as users we do not always know what we are agreeing to. Companies capitalize on the fine print and gather more information about us then needed for that product to successfully work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Jennifer|last2=Malčić|first2=Steven|date=2015|title=The Privacy Ecosystem: Regulating Digital Identity in the United States and European Union|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.5.2015.0155|journal=Journal of Information Policy|volume=5|pages=155–178|doi=10.5325/jinfopoli.5.2015.0155}}&lt;/ref&gt; With data breaches and identity fraud occurring more and more, an example of a solution is to remove the idea of a whole identity from users. Instead of using very specific information to identify oneself online, use one thing to separate yourself from the rest of online users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/jpss/2018/00000012/00000001/art00006|title=Rethinking digital identity|last=Michael|first=Salmony,|website=www.ingentaconnect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anonymous attribute systems===
An anonymous attribute is one that retains its uniqueness, but is put through a one-way hash so that it is represented in a string of characters that have no innate meaning or value. The one-way hash is an algorithm of inordinate complexity that generates the character string so that it is indecipherable compared to the original. In this way, a social security number, can be retained for attribute comparison, but the values used for comparison, while unique, would in no way resemble the original social security number.

==Legal issues==
Clare Sullivan presents the grounds for digital identity as an emerging legal concept.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite book |first=Clare |last=Sullivan |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/digital-identity/ |title=Digital Identity |publisher=The University of Adelaide |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9807230-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] confirms Sullivan's argument and unfolds the new legal concept involving database identity and transaction identity. Database identity refers to the collection of data that is registered about an individual within the databases of the scheme and transaction identity is a set of information that defines the individual's identity for transactional purposes. Although there is reliance on the verification of identity, none of the processes used are entirely trustworthy. The consequences of digital identity abuse and fraud are potentially serious, since in possible implications the person is held legally responsible.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt;

==Business aspects==
Corporations have begun to recognize the Internet's potential to facilitate the tailoring of the online storefront to each individual customer. Purchase suggestions, personalised adverts and other tailored marketing strategies are a great success to businesses. Such tailoring however, depends on the ability to connect attributes and preferences to the identity of the visitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Hal |last1=Ableson |first2=Lawrence |last2=Lessig |title=Digital Identity in Cyberspace |date=10 September 1998 |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall98-papers/identity/linked-white-paper.html |work=MIT.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variance by jurisdiction==
While many facets of digital identity are universal owing in part to the ubiquity of the Internet, some regional variations exist due to specific laws, practices and government services that are in place.  For example, [[Digital identity in Australia]] can utilize services that validate [[Driving licences]], [[Passports]] and other physical documents online to help improve the quality of a digital identity, also strict [[Money laundering#Australia|Anti-money laundering]] policies mean that some services, such as money transfers need a stricter level of validation of digital identity.

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]], the '''doctrine of chances''' is a [[rules of evidence|rule of]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that allows evidence to show that it is unlikely a defendant would be repeatedly, innocently involved in similar, suspicious circumstances.

Normally, under [[Federal Rules of Evidence|Federal Rule of Evidence]] 404, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

Using the doctrine of chances allows a prosecutor to admit evidence of prior "accidents" that can persuade a jury that prior incidents are so similar that it is very improbable that the case at bar is actually accidental.

The doctrine of chances was first developed by English courts in the case ''[[George Joseph Smith|Rex v. Smith]]'', 11 Cr. App. R. 229, 84 L.J.K.B. 2153 (1915), better known as the "brides in the bath murder". In this case the defendant was accused of murdering his wife by drowning her in a bath. The defendant claimed that his wife had fainted in the bath. The prosecutor sought to include evidence in the trial that the defendant's two previous wives had both died in the same way. The evidence was allowed.

'''Ekāgratā''' ([[Sanskrit]]: एकाग्रता, "one-pointedness") is intent pursuit of one object, close and undisturbed  attention. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+ekagrata&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]] emphasises regular practice (''[[Abhyasa]]'') [[meditation]] and self-imposed discipline to acquire ekagrata.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

Austerity (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'') is allied to this conception of ''ekagrata''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=146|url=  http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]]'s [[Brahma Sutras]] (chapter 3) uses the term to mean [[dharana|concentration]]: it is held to be a quality resulting from practices discussed in the previous chapter,which are briefly mentioned in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=812-833|url=  http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] the seeker after Truth should meditate with his mind fixed on the Lord (''machchittāh'') and absorbed in Him (''matparāh''). This is ''ekagrata''. The term ''nityayuktāh'' refers to devotees who keep their mind fixed on God uninterruptedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadagita Tattvavivecani|author= Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|page=400|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] highlights the importance of continuous practice of prescribed methods to gain ekagrata, the state of the meditative mind free of diverted attention etc.; and thereafter explains that:-

:ततः पुनःशान्तोदितौ तुल्यप्रत्ययौ चित्तस्यैकाग्रतापरिणामः | - Yoga Sutra III.12

intentness on a single point (ekagrata) of the thinking principle (''[[citta]]'') gives rise to equilibrium of placid states (previously accumulated impressions) and aroused states (present eagerness to gain more knowledge), which are modifications (of the mind). These two states of mind remain unchanged and are brought to the state of stillness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: A Scientific Exposition |author=Vinod Verma|publisher=Clarion Books|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lax-nToYgt8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ekagrata'' and ''[[Dhāraṇā|dharana]]'' do not differ from each other, or else ''dharana'' is achieving and maintaining ''ekagrata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ekagrata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bsH5UoPyEtOFhQfvr4DIAw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=ekagrata&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dharana'' converges on a particular concept or object.

[[File:Euler_diagram_of_solar_system_bodies.svg|thumb|right|300px|An Euler diagram showing the relationships between different [[Solar System]] objects]]
{{Not a typo|An}} '''Euler diagram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔɪ|l|ər}}, {{respell|OY|lər}}) is a [[diagram]]matic means of representing [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and their relationships. Typically they involve overlapping shapes, and may be scaled, such that the area of the shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains. They are particularly useful for explaining complex hierarchies and overlapping definitions. They are often confused with [[Venn diagram]]s. Unlike Venn diagrams, which show all possible relations between different sets, the Euler diagram shows only relevant relationships.

The first use of "Eulerian circles" is commonly attributed to Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783). In the United States, both Venn and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement of the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readingquest.org/strat/venn.html Strategies for Reading Comprehension Venn Diagrams]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as organizations and businesses.

Euler diagrams consist of simple closed shapes in a two dimensional plane that each depict a set or category. How or if these shapes overlap demonstrates the relationships between the sets. There are only 3 possible relationships between any 2 sets; completely inclusive, partially inclusive, and exclusive. This is also referred to as containment, overlap or neither or, especially in mathematics, it may be referred to as [[subset]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]].

Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.  Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent [[disjoint sets]].  Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the sets).  A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a [[subset]] of it.

[[File:Syllogism-Set-Diagrams.svg|thumb|300px|right|Examples of small [[Venn diagram]]s ''(on left)'' with shaded regions representing [[empty set]]s, showing how they can be easily transformed into equivalent Euler diagrams ''(right)'']]
[[Venn diagram]]s are a more restrictive form of Euler diagrams.  A Venn diagram must contain all 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; logically possible zones of overlap between its ''n'' curves, representing all combinations of inclusion/exclusion of its constituent sets.  Regions not part of the set are indicated by coloring them black, in contrast to Euler diagrams, where membership in the set is indicated by overlap as well as color.  When the number of sets grows beyond 3 a Venn diagram becomes visually complex, especially compared to the corresponding Euler diagram. The difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:

* &lt;math&gt;A = \{1,\, 2,\, 5\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B = \{1,\, 6\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C = \{4,\, 7\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Euler and the Venn diagrams of those sets are:

File:3-set Euler diagram.svg|Euler diagram
File:3-set Venn diagram.svg|Venn diagram
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In a logical setting, one can use model theoretic semantics to interpret Euler diagrams, within a [[universe of discourse]]. In the examples below, the Euler diagram depicts that the sets ''Animal'' and ''Mineral'' are disjoint since the corresponding curves are disjoint, and also that the set ''Four Legs'' is a subset of the set of ''Animal''s. The Venn diagram, which uses the same categories of ''Animal'', ''Mineral'', and ''Four Legs'', does not encapsulate these relationships. Traditionally the ''emptiness'' of a set in Venn diagrams is depicted by shading in the region. Euler diagrams represent ''emptiness'' either by shading or by the absence of a region.

Often a set of well-formedness conditions are imposed; these are topological or geometric constraints imposed on the structure of the diagram.  For example, connectedness of zones might be enforced, or concurrency of curves or multiple points might be banned, as might tangential intersection of curves. In the adjacent diagram, examples of small Venn diagrams are transformed into Euler diagrams by sequences of transformations; some of the intermediate diagrams have concurrency of curves. However, this sort of transformation of a Venn diagram with shading into an Euler diagram without shading is not always possible. There are examples of Euler diagrams with 9 sets that are not drawable using simple closed curves without the creation of unwanted zones since they would have to have non-planar dual graphs.

[[File:Hamilton Lectures on Logic 1874 Euler Diagrams.png|thumb|344x344px|Photo of page from Hamilton's ''Lectures on Logic''. The symbolism A, E, I, and O refer to the categorical statements that can occur in a [[syllogism]]. The small text to the left erroneously states: "The first employment of circular diagrams in logic improperly ascribed to Euler. To be found in Christian Weise", a book actually written by Johann Christian Lange.&lt;ref name="Venn_1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailand_1967"/&gt;]]
[[File:Couturat 1914 and Venn assignments1.jpg|thumb|500px|right|On the right is a photo of page 74 from Couturat 1914 wherein he labels the 8 regions of the Venn diagram. The modern name for these "regions" is [[minterm]]s. These are shown on the left with the variables x, y and z per Venn's drawing. The symbolism is as follows: logical AND ( &amp; ) is represented by arithmetic multiplication, and the logical NOT ( ~ )is represented by " ' " after the variable, e.g. the region x'y'z is read as "NOT x AND NOT y AND z" i.e. ~x &amp; ~y &amp; z.]]

[[File:Veitch and Karnaugh 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Both the Veitch and Karnaugh diagrams show all the [[minterms]], but the Veitch is not particularly useful for reduction of formulas. Observe the strong resemblance between the Venn and Karnaugh diagrams; the colors and the variables x, y, and z are per Venn's example.]]

As shown in the illustration to the right, [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] in his posthumously published ''Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic'' (1858–60) erroneously asserts that the original use of circles to "sensualize ... the abstractions of Logic" (p.&amp;nbsp;180) was not [[Leonhard Paul Euler]] (1707–1783) but rather [[Christian Weise]] (1642–1708) in his ''Nucleus Logicae Weisianae'' that appeared in 1712 posthumously, however, the latter book was actually written by Johann Christian Lange rather than Weise.&lt;ref name="Venn_1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailand_1967"/&gt; He references Euler's ''[[Letters to a German Princess]]'' [Partie ii., Lettre XXXV., ed. Cournot.  – ED.]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;By the time these lectures of Hamilton were published, Hamilton too had died. His editors (symbolized by ED.), responsible for most of the footnoting, were the logicians [[Henry Longueville Mansel]] and [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamilton's illustration the four [[categorical proposition]]s that can occur in a [[syllogism]] as symbolized by the drawings A, E, I and O are:&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton 1860:179. The examples are from Jevons 1881:71ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A: The ''Universal Affirmative'', Example: "All metals are elements".
* E: The ''Universal Negative'', Example: "No metals are compound substances".
* I: The ''Particular Affirmative'', Example: "Some metals are brittle".
* O: The ''Particular Negative'', Example: "Some metals are not brittle".

In his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'' Chapter V "Diagrammatic Representation", [[John Venn]] (1834–1923) comments on the remarkable prevalence of the Euler diagram:
: "...of the first sixty logical treatises, published during the last century or so, which were consulted for this purpose:-somewhat at random, as they happened to be most accessible :-it appeared that thirty four appealed to the aid of diagrams, nearly all of these making use of the Eulerian Scheme." (Footnote 1 page 100)

[[File:Venn 1881 p 115-116 pasteup.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Composite of two pages 115–116 from Venn 1881 showing his example of how to convert a syllogism of three parts into his type of diagram. Venn calls the circles "Eulerian circles" (cf Sandifer 2003, Venn 1881:114 etc) in the "Eulerian scheme" (Venn 1881:100) of "old-fashioned Eulerian diagrams" (Venn 1881:113).]]

But nevertheless, he contended, "the inapplicability of this scheme for the purposes of a really general Logic" (page 100) and on page 101 observed that, "It fits in but badly even with the four propositions of the common Logic to which it is normally applied." Venn ends his chapter with the observation illustrated in the examples below—that their use is based on practice and intuition, not on a strict [[algorithm]]ic practice:
:“In fact ... those diagrams not only do not fit in with the ordinary scheme of propositions which they are employed to illustrate, but do not seem to have any recognized scheme of propositions to which they could be consistently affiliated.” (pp. 124–125)

Finally, in his Chapter XX HISTORIC NOTES Venn gets to a crucial criticism (italicized in the quote below); observe in Hamilton's illustration that the O (''Particular Negative'') and I (''Particular Affirmative'') are simply rotated:

:"We now come to Euler's well-known circles which were first described in his ''Lettres a une Princesse d'Allemagne'' (Letters 102–105). The weak point about these consists in the fact that they only illustrate in strictness the actual relations of classes to one another, rather than the imperfect knowledge of these relations which we may possess, or wish to convey, by means of the proposition. Accordingly they will not fit in with the propositions of common logic, but demand the constitution of a new group of appropriate elementary propositions.... This defect must have been noticed from the first ''in the case of the particular affirmative and negative, for the same diagram is commonly employed to stand for them both, which it does indifferently well''". (italics added: page 424)

(Sandifer 2003 reports that Euler makes such observations too; Euler reports that his figure 45 (a simple intersection of two circles) has 4 different interpretations). Whatever the case, armed with these observations and criticisms, Venn then demonstrates (pp.&amp;nbsp;100–125) how he derived what has become known as his [[Venn diagrams]] from the "...old-fashioned Euler diagrams." In particular he gives an example, shown on the left.

By 1914, [[Louis Couturat]] (1868–1914) had labeled the terms as shown on the drawing on the right. Moreover, he had labeled the ''exterior region'' (shown as a'b'c') as well. He succinctly explains how to use the diagram – one must ''strike out'' the regions that are to vanish:
:"VENN'S method is translated in geometrical diagrams which represent all the constituents, so that, in order to obtain the result, we need only ''strike out (by shading)'' those which are made to vanish by the data of the problem." (italics added p. 73)

Given the Venn's assignments, then, the unshaded areas ''inside'' the circles can be summed to yield the following equation for Venn's example:
: "No Y is Z and ALL X is Y: therefore No X is Z" has the equation x'yz' + xyz' + x'y'z for the unshaded area ''inside'' the circles (but note that this is not entirely correct; see the next paragraph).

In Venn the 0th term, x'y'z', i.e. the background surrounding the circles, does not appear.  Nowhere is it discussed or labeled, but Couturat corrects this in his drawing. The correct equation must include this unshaded area shown in boldface:
: "No Y is Z and ALL X is Y: therefore No X is Z" has the equation x'yz' + xyz' + x'y'z + ''' x'y'z' '''.

In modern usage the Venn diagram includes a "box" that surrounds all the circles; this is called the universe of discourse or the [[domain of discourse]].

Couturat now observes that, in a direct [[algorithm]]ic (formal, systematic) manner, one cannot derive reduced Boolean equations, nor does it show how to arrive at the conclusion "No X is Z". Couturat concluded that the process "has ... serious inconveniences as a method for solving logical problems": 
:"It does not show how the data are exhibited by canceling certain constituents, nor does it show how to combine the remaining constituents so as to obtain the consequences sought. In short, it serves only to exhibit one single step in the argument, namely the equation of the problem; it dispenses neither with the previous steps, i. e., "throwing of the problem into an equation" and the transformation of the premises, nor with the subsequent steps, i. e., the combinations that lead to the various consequences. Hence it is of very little use, inasmuch as the constituents can be represented by algebraic symbols quite as well as by plane regions, and are much easier to deal with in this form."(p. 75)

Thus the matter would rest until 1952 when [[Maurice Karnaugh]] (1924–&amp;nbsp;) would adapt and expand a method proposed by [[Edward W. Veitch]]; this work would rely on the [[truth table]] method precisely defined in [[Emil Post]]'s 1921 PhD thesis "Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions" and the application of propositional logic to [[switching logic]] by (among others) [[Claude Shannon]], [[George Stibitz]], and [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See footnote at [[George Stibitz]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in chapter "Boolean Algebra" Hill and Peterson (1968, 1964) present sections 4.5ff "Set Theory as an Example of Boolean Algebra" and in it they present the Venn diagram with shading and all. They give examples of Venn diagrams to solve example switching-circuit problems, but end up with this statement:
::"For more than three variables, the basic illustrative form of the Venn diagram is inadequate. Extensions are possible, however, the most convenient of which is the Karnaugh map, to be discussed in Chapter 6." (p. 64)
In Chapter 6, section 6.4 "Karnaugh Map Representation of Boolean Functions" they begin with:
::"The Karnaugh map&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Karnaugh 1953] is one of the most powerful tools in the repertory of the logic designer. ... A Karnaugh map may be regarded either as a pictorial form of a truth table or as an extension of the Venn diagram." (pp. 103–104)

The history of Karnaugh's development of his "chart" or "map" method is obscure. Karnaugh in his 1953 referenced Veitch 1951, Veitch referenced [[Claude E. Shannon]] 1938 (essentially Shannon's Master's thesis at [[M.I.T.]]), and Shannon in turn referenced, among other authors of logic texts, Couturat 1914. In Veitch's method the variables are arranged in a rectangle or square; as described in [[Karnaugh map]], Karnaugh in his method changed the order of the variables to correspond to what has become known as (the vertices of) a [[hypercube]].

=== Example: Euler- to Venn-diagram and Karnaugh map ===
This example shows the Euler and Venn diagrams and Karnaugh map deriving and verifying the deduction "No ''X''s are ''Z''s".
In the illustration and table the following logical symbols are used:
* 1 can be read as "true", 0 as "false"
* ~ for NOT and abbreviated to ' when illustrating the minterms e.g. x' =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; NOT x,
* + for Boolean OR (from [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]: 0+0=0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1=1)
* &amp; (logical AND) between propositions; in the mintems AND is omitted in a manner similar to arithmetic multiplication: e.g. x'y'z =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; ~x &amp; ~y &amp; z (From Boolean algebra: 0*0=0, 0*1 = 1*0=0, 1*1 = 1, where * is shown for clarity)
* → (logical IMPLICATION): read as IF ... THEN ..., or " IMPLIES ", ''P'' → ''Q'' =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; NOT ''P'' OR ''Q''

[[File:Veitch and Karnaugh truth table 4.jpg|thumb|921px|center|Before it can be presented in a Venn diagram or Karnaugh Map, the Euler diagram's syllogism "No ''Y'' is ''Z'', All ''X'' is ''Y''" must first be reworded into the more formal language of the [[propositional calculus]]: " 'It is not the case that: {{var|Y}} AND {{var|Z'}} AND 'If an {{var|X}} then a {{var|Y'}} ". Once the propositions are reduced to symbols and a propositional formula ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ), one can construct the formula's [[truth table]]; from this table the Venn and/or the Karnaugh map are readily produced. By use of the adjacency of "1"s in the Karnaugh map (indicated by the grey ovals around terms 0 and 1 and around terms 2 and 6) one can "reduce" the example's [[Boolean equation]] i.e. (x'y'z' + x'y'z) + (x'yz' + xyz') to just two terms: x'y' + yz'. But the means for deducing the notion that "No X is Z", and just how the reduction relates to this deduction, is not forthcoming from this example.]]

Given a proposed conclusion such as "No ''X'' is a ''Z''", one can test whether or not it is a correct [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] by use of a [[truth table]]. The easiest method is put the starting formula on the left (abbreviate it as ''P'') and put the (possible) deduction on the right (abbreviate it as ''Q'') and connect the two with [[logical implication]] i.e. ''P'' → ''Q'', read as IF ''P'' THEN ''Q''. If the evaluation of the truth table produces all 1s under the implication-sign (→, the so-called ''major connective'') then ''P'' → ''Q'' is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]. Given this fact, one can "detach" the formula on the right (abbreviated as ''Q'') in the manner described below the truth table.

Given the example above, the formula for the Euler and Venn diagrams is:
: "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s": ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; ''P''
And the proposed deduction is:
: "No ''X''s are ''Z''s": ( ~ (x &amp; z) ) =&lt;sub&gt;defined&lt;/sub&gt; ''Q''

So now the formula to be evaluated can be abbreviated to:
: ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) → ( ~ (x &amp; z) ): ''P'' → ''Q''
: IF ( "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s" ) THEN ( "No ''X''s are ''Z''s" )

{| style="width:auto; border:1px solid darkgray; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center"
|+ The Truth Table demonstrates that the formula ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) → ( ~ (x &amp; z) ) is a tautology as shown by all 1s in yellow column.

At this point the above implication ''P'' → ''Q'' (i.e. ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) →  ~(x &amp; z) ) is still a formula, and the deduction – the "detachment" of ''Q'' out of ''P'' → ''Q'' – has not occurred. But given the demonstration that ''P'' → ''Q'' is tautology, the stage is now set for the use of the procedure of [[modus ponens]] to "detach" Q: "No ''X''s are ''Z''s" and dispense with the terms on the left.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This is a sophisticated concept. Russell and Whitehead (2nd edition 1927) in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' describe it this way: "The trust in inference is the belief that if the two former assertions [the premises P, P→Q ] are not in error, the final assertion is not in error . . . An inference is the dropping of a true premiss [sic]; it is the dissolution of an implication" (p. 9). Further discussion of this appears in "Primitive Ideas and Propositions" as the first of their "primitive propositions" (axioms): *1.1 Anything implied by a true elementary proposition is true" (p. 94). In a footnote the authors refer the reader back to Russell's 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics'' §38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''Modus ponens'' (or "the fundamental rule of inference"&lt;ref&gt;cf Reichenbach 1947:64&lt;/ref&gt;) is often written as follows: The two terms on the left, ''P'' → ''Q'' and ''P'', are called ''premises'' (by convention linked by a comma), the symbol ⊢ means "yields" (in the sense of logical deduction), and the term on the right is called the ''conclusion'': 
: ''P'' → ''Q'', ''P'' ⊢ ''Q''

For the modus ponens to succeed, both premises P → Q and P must be ''true''. Because, as demonstrated above the premise ''P'' → ''Q'' is a tautology, "truth" is always the case no matter how x, y and z are valued, but "truth" will only be the case for ''P'' in those circumstances when ''P'' evaluates as "true" (e.g. rows {{EquationNote|0}} OR {{EquationNote|1}} OR {{EquationNote|2}} OR {{EquationNote|6}}: x'y'z' + x'y'z + x'yz' + xyz' = x'y' + yz').&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Reichenbach discusses the fact that the implication ''P'' → ''Q'' need not be a tautology (a so-called "tautological implication"). Even "simple" implication (connective or adjunctive) will work, but only for those rows of the truth table that evaluate as true, cf Reichenbach 1947:64–66.&lt;/ref&gt; 
: ''P'' → ''Q'' , ''P'' ⊢ ''Q''
:* i.e.: ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) → ( ~ (x &amp; z) ) , ( ~(y &amp; z) &amp; (x → y) ) ⊢ ( ~ (x &amp; z) )
:* i.e.: IF "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s" ''THEN'' "No ''X''s are ''Z''s", "No ''Y''s are ''Z''s" and "All ''X''s are ''Y''s" ⊢ "No ''X''s are ''Z''s"

One is now free to "detach" the conclusion "No ''X''s are ''Z''s", perhaps to use it in a subsequent deduction (or as a topic of conversation).

The use of tautological implication means that other possible deductions exist besides "No ''X''s are ''Z''s"; the criterion for a successful deduction is that the 1s under the sub-major connective on the right ''include'' all the 1s under the sub-major connective on the left (the ''major'' connective being the implication that results in the tautology). For example, in the truth table, on the right side of the implication (→, the major connective symbol) the bold-face column under the sub-major connective symbol " '''~''' " has the all the same 1s that appear in the bold-faced column under the left-side sub-major connective '''&amp;''' (rows {{EquationNote|0}}, {{EquationNote|1}}, {{EquationNote|2}} and {{EquationNote|6}}), plus two more (rows {{EquationNote|3}} and {{EquationNote|4}}).

The '''Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative''' (EITI) is a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas and mineral resources. It seeks to address the key governance issues in the extractive sectors.

The EITI Standard requires information along the extractive industry value chain from the point of extraction, to how the revenue makes its way through the government, to how it contributes to the economy.

This includes how licenses and contracts are allocated and registered, who are the beneficial owners of those operations are, what are the fiscal and legal arrangements are, how much is produced, how much is paid, where are those revenues allocated, and what is the contribution to the economy, including employment.

The [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative#The EITI Standard|EITI Standard]] is implemented in 52 countries around the world. Each of these countries is required publish to an annual EITI Report to disclose information on: contracts and licenses, production, revenue collection, revenue allocation, and social and economic spending.

Every country goes through a quality-assurance mechanism, called Validation, at least every three years. Validation serves to assess performance towards meeting the EITI Standard and promote dialogue and learning at the country level. It also safeguards the integrity of the EITI by holding all EITI implementing countries to the same global standard.

Each implementing country has its own national secretariat and multi-stakeholder group, made up of representatives from the country’s government, extractive companies and civil society. The multi-stakeholder group takes decisions on how the EITI process is carried out in the country.

The EITI Standard is developed and overseen by an international [[Multistakeholder governance model|multi-stakeholder]] Board, consisting of representatives from governments, extractives companies, civil society organisations, financial institutions and international organisations.

The Chair of the EITI is [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]], former [[Prime Minister of Sweden]]. The previous chairs have been the [[Clare Short]] (2011-2016), former [[Secretary of State for International Development|UK Secretary of State for International Development]] and [[Peter Eigen]] (2009-2011). The EITI International Secretariat is located in [[Oslo, Norway]] and is headed by former Swedish diplomat Jonas Moberg.

== History ==
The “Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative” (EITI) was first launched in September 2002 by [[Tony Blair|UK Prime Minister Tony Blair]] at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130715054456/http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/html/basic_info/basicinfo.html World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Principles and Agreed Actions, EITI|url=http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090422161958/http:/www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 April 2009|website=UK Web Archive|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following years of academic debate, as well as lobbying from civil society and companies, on the management of government revenues from the extractive industries. In particular, the EITI was established to be an answer to public discussions on the “[[Resource Curse]]” or the “[[Paradox of Plenty]]”. NGOs such as by [[Global Witness]] and “[[Publish What You Pay]]”, as well as companies such as [[BP]] pushed the UK government to working towards an international transparency norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of EITI|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/history|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was founded at a conference in [[London]] in 2003. The 140 delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final attendee list, Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) London  Conference 17 June 2003|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportattendance.pdf|publisher=DFID, UK|accessdate=1 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701080507/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportattendance.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from government, companies and civil society agreed on twelve principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Principles and Agreed Actions, EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE (EITI)  London Conference, 17 June 2003|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf |publisher=DFID, UK |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701080507/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/eitidraftreportstatement.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase transparency over payments and revenues in the extractive sector. A pilot phase of the EITI was launched in Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Ghana and the Kyrgyz Republic. The management of the Initiative continued to lay with the UK [[Department for International Development]].

The second EITI Conference on 17 March 2005 in London established six [https://web.archive.org/web/20140719154306/http://eiti.org/eiti/criteria criteria] based on the principles. These set out the minimum requirements for transparency in the management of resources in the oil, gas and mining sectors, laying the foundation for a rule-based organisation. This conference also established an international advisory group (IAG) under the Chairmanship of [[Peter Eigen]] to further guide the work of how the EITI is to be set up and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the EITI|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/history|website=www.eiti.org|publisher=EITI|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More countries, companies and civil-society organisations joined the initiative. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] endorsed the EITI.

The report issued in June 2006 by the international advisory group recommended the establishment of a multi-stakeholder board and an independent secretariat, and these were set in place at the third EITI conference held in Oslo, Norway on 11 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EITI Oslo Conference: Making transparency a global norm|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs/Veiledninger-og-brosjyrer/2006/eiti_conference.html?regj_oss=1&amp;id=419568|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oslo was chosen as the new location for the secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norway to host EITI international secretariat|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/archive/Stoltenbergs-2nd-Government/Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/pressemeldinger/2006/norway-to-host-eiti-international-secret.html?regj_oss=1&amp;id=439120|website=regjeringen.no/en/archive.html?id=115322|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years the body further fleshed out the criteria, turning them into a set of 23 requirements, known as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191309/http://eiti.org/news-events/2011-edition-eiti-rules EITI Rules in 2011].

The EITI Standard replaced the EITI Rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Stella|title=EITI board raises bar on global standards to report natural resource revenues|url=http://www.trust.org/item/?map=eiti-board-raises-bar-on-global-standards-to-report-natural-resource-revenues|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Thompson Reuters Foundation|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 May 2013. The Standard was revised in February 2016.

== Structure and Funding  ==
The EITI is organised as a non-profit association under Norwegian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EITI Articles of Association|url=http://eiti.org/document/eiti-articles-association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has three institutional bodies: The Members’ Meeting, the EITI Board, and the International Secretariat. The Members’ Meeting governs the EITI and convenes alongside the EITI global conferences, which are held every two to three years.

The board develops the Standard and assesses the progress of the countries. It is supported by the international secretariat, located in Oslo, Norway.
[[File:EITI Global Conference 2016.jpg|thumb|303x303px|EITI Global Conference, February 2016]]
The EITI Board meets between two and four times a year and is composed of three groups: countries, companies and civil society. The membership of the Board reflects the multi-stakeholder nature of the EITI. The EITI Board has eight committees (audit, finance, governance and oversight, implementation, nominations, outreach and candidature, rapid response and Validation) to develop recommendations to the full board.

The funding of the EITI is two-fold. At the country level, implementation is funded by the governments. At the international level, the EITI is funded by implementing countries, supporting governments and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EITI - How we are funded|url=http://eiti.org/about/funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member countries ==
Any country with [[Extractive industry|extractive industry sectors]] can adhere to the EITI Standard. Countries implementing the transparency standard include OECD states such as Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as countries in Africa, Central and East Asia, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/countries|title=EITI Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a country intends to join the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative#The EITI Standard|EITI Standard]], it is required to undertake five sign-up steps before applying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/eiti/faq-countries-considering-eiti|title=FAQs for governments considering EITI implementation|website=eiti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These steps relate to a clear commitment of the government, company and civil society engagement, the establishment of a multi-stakeholder group and agreement on a work plan, which sets out what the country wants to achieve within a certain time frame.

Once the application of the country has been accepted by the board, the country is called an “EITI candidate”. The candidate receives the deadlines for publishing information and undergoes “Validation” two and a half years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/validation#validation-consequences|title=Validation consequences|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of Validation is a measure of how well the country is progressing to meet the requirements of the standard.

== Impact of the EITI ==
The EITI has made significant contributions to improved governance of the extractive sector in several countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcomes and impact of the EITI|url=https://eiti.org/outcomes-impact-of-eiti|website=eiti.org|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the EITI has been central to many reforms of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/progress-report-2017/analysing-impact|title=EITI Progress Report 2017 - analysing impact|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2017|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the international level, debates on transparency in the sector are unrecognisable from ten years ago, and the EITI is seen as being at the forefront of many frontier debates including beneficial ownership, commodity trading, and artisanal and small-scale mining.

It is also clear that the EITI process is one of the only ''functioning'' global mechanisms to inform and channel debate in resource-rich countries in a way that includes all stakeholders. In Peru, EITI Reports have highlighted that, only about 15% of revenues from the mining and hydrocarbon sector has been used for developmental spending, such as infrastructure or economic diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://progrep.eiti.org/2016/country-focus/peru|title=EITI Progress Report 2016|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=29 April 2016|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest has been spent on current expenditures such as salaries and servicing debts. Local citizens are using this information to engage with their regional authorities on alternative ways to spend these resources.

EITI Reports make recommendations aimed at addressing weaknesses in government systems and improving extractive sector management. In Nigeria, President Buhari has initiated major reforms in the oil sector, starting with restructuring the national oil company, a review of oil contracts, an pause in the awarding of the notorious oil swap deals, and a review of subsidy arrangements. These were all recommendations from Nigeria EITI Reports.

Furthermore, the EITI can lead to higher attractiveness for investments. There is “mounting evidence that information release supports greater competition around government contracting and that being an EITI signatory leads to greater inflows of both aid and foreign direct investment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/big-signing|title=A big signing: Donald Trump signs a law repealing a disclosure rule for oil companies|last=The Economist|first=|date=17 February 2017|website=economist.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malden|first=Alexander|date=26 January 2017|title=A safer bet?

== Supporting Companies ==
Around 80 companies involved in oil, gas, and mining support the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=http://eiti.org/supporters/companies|website=eiti.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting companies publicly endorse the EITI and  contribute to covering the cost of the international secretariat of the EITI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/funding#contributions-from-implementing-countries-and-companies|title=EITI funding - contributions from implementing countries and companies|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=17 July 2016|website=eiti.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extractive companies are involved on the national level in countries implementing the transparency standard. They are part of the stakeholders and are required to hand over numbers on payments as part of the reporting process under the EITI standard. Company advocacy has resulted in several countries beginning EITI implementation.

== Criticism ==
Campaigning organisations have criticised the organisation for the lack of sanction possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extracting oil, burying data|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548214|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=The Economist|issue=Feb 25th, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, business representatives have commented that the EITI board is captured by civil society organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment - Beyond transparency: EITI stretches 'civil society' role|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-4/general-interest/comment-beyond-transparency.html|publisher=Oil &amp; Gas Journal|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EITI has been seen as insufficient to bring full transparency to payments in the extractive industries, since it does not cover countries active in commodity trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohstoffhandel blüht gleiches Schicksal wie den Banken|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Rohstoffhandel-blueht-gleiches-Schicksal-wie-den-Banken/story/23012824|accessdate=3 September 2014|agency=Tagesanzeiger online|date=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been addressed by new requirements of the EITI standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eiti.org/GN26|title=Guidance note 26 - Reporting on first trades in oil|last=EITI International Secretariat|first=|date=June 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EITI has also been criticised for ignoring the violations of [[human rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extractive Industries: A New Accountability Agenda|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/21/extractive-industries-new-accountability-agenda|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Azerbaijan]], and for not reacting sufficiently strongly to the harassment of Azerbaijani civil society groups that are part of EITI's multi-stakeholder approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Transparency Group Should Suspend Membership|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/14/azerbaijan-transparency-group-should-suspend-membership|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=25 August 2014|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the EITI has been criticised by an international lending institution for shifting its mandate beyond the promition of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/ebrd-pushes-on-with-azerbaijan-gas-loan-after-transparency-rift|title=EBRD Pushes on With Azerbaijan Gas Loan After Transparency Rift|last=Bloomberg|first=|date=4 May 2017|work=Bloomberg Markets|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falling on a grenade''' refers to the deliberate act of using one's body to cover a live [[fuse (explosives)|time-fused]] [[hand grenade]], absorbing the explosion and fragmentation in an effort to save the lives of others nearby. Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the [[Medal of Honor]] have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act.

Such an act can be survivable: In [[World War II]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Jacklyn H. Lucas|Jack Lucas]], in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], placed two grenades under his steel [[M1 Helmet]] and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near [[Sangin]] in [[Afghanistan]] British [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] [[Matthew Croucher]] used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor, and that and his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in  [[Marjah]], [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]] in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], US Marine [[Lance Corporal]] [[Kyle Carpenter]] threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim.

"Falling on a grenade" is also used colloquially in non-military contexts to indicate individual acceptance of a personally harmful or sacrificial task in an effort to protect a larger group; during a scandal, corporate leaders or politicians who attempt to draw negative attention away from their company or party by pleading guilt, publicly admitting culpability and drawing condemnation on themselves (at the cost of their freedom or career) are often said to have "fallen on a grenade". 

==Examples==
*On July 1, 1916, at the [[Battle of Thiepval Ridge]] in [[World War I]], British Army Private [[William McFadzean]] of the 14th Battalion, the Royal Irish Rifles threw himself on top of a box of [[Mills bomb]]s after the pin came loose on two of them whilst he was attempting to load the bombs into a bandolier. As a result of his action only one other man in the trench was injured in the resulting explosion. McFadzean was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].
* On December 19, 1941, at the [[Battle of Hong Kong]], [[Canadian Army]] [[Company Sergeant Major]] [[John Robert Osborn]] jumped on a grenade, sacrificing himself to save his men. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.
* On November 7, 1943, at [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Sergeant]] [[Herbert Joseph Thomas|Herbert J. Thomas, Jr]] deliberately fell on a grenade, sacrificing himself to protect nearby Marines. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On April 3, 1945, [[Walter C. Wetzel]], threw himself on two grenades thrown by attacking Germans, suffering wounds from which he died. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On September 1, 1950, near [[Yongsan]], [[South Korea]], U.S. Army [[Private First Class]] [[David M. Smith]] noticed an enemy grenade lobbed into his company's emplacement. Smith shouted a warning to his comrades and flung himself upon it. Although he was mortally wounded, his act saved five men from injury or death. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On November 26, 1950, during the Korean war, U.S. Army [[Sergeant]] [[John A. Pittman]] threw himself on the grenade, which was thrown in the midst of his squad, and absorbed the burst with his body. Pittman survived and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
* On February 11, 1954, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Private [[Nathan Elbaz]] was disarming grenades when he noticed one of the grenade's safeties had slipped. He grabbed the grenade and ran from the tent but realized he would not be able to throw the grenade away without harming some of his friends, so he smothered the explosion with his body. He was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Distinguished Service]].
* On November 1, 1956, during [[Suez Crisis]], [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Officer [[Ovad Ladijinski]] threw a grenade towards the opening of a high Egyptian station. The grenade fell back towards him and his group. He pressed the closest soldier to a rock and protected him using his body, facing the grenade. He was posthumously awarded a Chief of General Staff Citation (later changed to [[Medal of Courage]]), which was his second one.
* On February 25, 1966, [[Peter S. Connor]] held a grenade against his body after realizing the fuse was burning despite his holding the safety pin, and he did not have time to throw it safely away from his comrades. He died eleven days later and was awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On August 16, 1966, during a cave search and destroy mission in the Vietnam War, [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps]] Captain Lee In-Ho smothered a grenade to save his men around him. He was posthumously awarded the highest South Korean military honor, the Taegeuk Cordon of Military Merit.
* On February 28, 1967, [[James Anderson, Jr.]] sacrificed his life by smothering a grenade with his body in the [[Vietnam War]] and was awarded a Medal of Honor.
* On September 6, 1967, Sgt. Rodney Maxwell Davis, USMC, threw himself on an enemy grenade in the Quang Nam Province of Vietnam during Operation Swift while under attack from Vietnamese forces.  He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
* On February 23, 1971, a [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck]] was ambushed by a squad of [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) soldiers near [[An Khê]]. At one point during the firefight, an NVA soldier threw a fragmentation grenade into the truck's compartment. 21-year-old [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Four]] [[Larry G. Dahl]] was the only occupant who heard the grenade land in the truck. Realizing that there was not sufficient time to toss it out, he immediately threw himself on top of the grenade, saving his comrades' lives at the cost of his own. Dahl was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
* On May 25, 1971, [[Michael Willetts]] smothered an explosive device planted at Springfield Road Police Station, Belfast, by a member of the [[Provisional IRA]]. In doing so, he saved the lives of several civilians, including two children. He was posthumously awarded the [[George Cross]] for his actions.
* On April 14, 2004, near [[Husaybah]], [[Iraq]], [[Jason Dunham]] used his body and helmet to shield others from a grenade explosion - but died shortly afterward from his injuries. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Whos_Who/Dunham_JL.htm|title=Corporal Jason L.

* On September 3, 2004, in [[Beslan]], [[Russia]], Lt. [[Andrey Turkin]], a member of a Russian counter-terrorist unit "Vympel", smothered a grenade, which was thrown by a terrorist in the school canteen, with his own body in order to shield hostages from the explosion.

In scholastic [[metaphysics]], a '''formal distinction''' is a distinction intermediate between what is merely conceptual, and what is fully real or mind-independent.  It was made by some realist philosophers of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period in the thirteenth century, and particularly by [[Duns Scotus]].

== Background ==

Many realist philosophers of the period (such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Henry of Ghent]]), recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual, but not fully real or mind-independent either.  Aquinas held that the difference between our concepts arises not just in the mind, but has a foundation in the thing (''fundamentum in re'').  Henry held that there was an 'intentional' distinction (''distinctio intentionalis'') such that 'intentions' (i.e. concepts) that are distinct in the mind, correspond to things which are potentially distinct in reality.

Scotus argued for a formal distinction (''distinctio formalis a parte rei''), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality, but whose definitions are not identical.  For example, the personal properties of the [[Trinity]] are formally distinct from the Divine essence.  Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or ''haecceity'' of a thing and its existence is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.

[[William of Ockham|Ockham]] was opposed to the idea, arguing that whenever there is any distinction or non-identity in reality, then two contradictory statements can be made.  But  contradictory statements cannot be truly asserted unless the realities they stand for are either (1) distinct real things (2) distinct concepts or (3) a thing and a concept.  But if they all exist in reality, they are not distinct concepts, nor are they a real thing and a concept.  Therefore, they are distinct in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Ordinatio'' I. i. q1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green information system''' ('''green IS''') or Green IT as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT"  is a combination of [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[information technology]] (IT). The relationship between information technology and the environment is complex, because of  the negative environmental impact of IT production, use, and disposal then, making this effect greener has been termed [[Green Information Technology]], which considers IT's environmental impact primarily as a problem to be mitigated. Another effect involves the positive impact of using [[information system]]s (IS) to improve the eco-sustainability of businesses and society; this is termed green IS. This green IS viewpoint sees IS as a partial solution to many environmental problems. So green IS is a solution for the negative environmental effect of information technology. IS facilitates the reuse of waste and energy and can serve as a tool for industrial symbiosis, which involves "the mutualistic interaction of different industries for beneficial reuse of waste flows or energy cascading that results in a more resource-efficient production system and fewer adverse environmental impacts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gholami|first1=Roya|last2=Binti Sulaiman|first2=Ainin|last3=Ramayah|first3=T|last4=Molla|first4=Alemayehu|title=Senior managers’ perception on green information systems (IS) adoption and environmental performance: Results from a field survey.|journal=Information &amp; Management|date=2013|volume=50|issue=7|pages=431–438|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720613000724|doi=10.1016/j.im.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model form ==

The general case is a [[non-linear system|non-linear model]] with a partial theoretical structure and some unknown parts derived from data. Models with unlike theoretical structures need to be evaluated individually,&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathworks13"&gt;Mathworks, 2013. [http://www.mathworks.com.au/help/ident/ug/supported-grey-box-models.html Supported grey box models ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauth08"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hauth |first=J. |year=2008|title=Grey Box Modelling for Nonlinear Systems| url=https://kluedo.ub.uni-kl.de/files/2045/diss.pdf | type= dissertation, [[Kaiserslautern University of Technology]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly using [[simulated annealing]] or [[genetic algorithms]].

Within a particular model structure, [[System identification|parameters]]&lt;ref name="Hauth08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" &gt;Nash, J.C. and Walker-Smith, M. 1987.

Queensland Branch, Brisbane), 129-148.&lt;/ref&gt; may need to be found. For a particular structure it is arbitrarily assumed that the data consists of sets of feed vectors '''f''', product vectors '''p''', and operating condition vectors '''c'''.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;  Typically '''c''' will contain values extracted from '''f''', as well as other values. In many cases a model can be converted to a function of the form:&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"&gt;Whiten, W.J., 1994. Determination of parameter relations within non-linear models, SIGNUM Newsletter,   29(3–4,) 2–5.  10.1145/192527.192535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"&gt;Whiten, B., 2014. [http://journal.austms.org.au/ojs/index.php/ANZIAMJ/article/view/7767 Determining the form of ordinary differential equations using model inversion], ANZIAM J. 55 (EMAC2013) pp.C329–C347. &lt;/ref&gt;
: '''m(f,p,q)'''
where the vector function '''m''' gives the errors between the data '''p''', and the model predictions. The vector '''q''' gives some variable parameters that are the model's unknown parts.

The parameters '''q''' vary with the operating conditions '''c''' in a manner to be determined.&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; This relation can be specified as '''q''' = '''Ac''' where '''A''' is a matrix of unknown coefficients, and '''c''' as in [[linear regression]]&lt;ref name="Draper98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisburg05"/&gt; includes a constant term and possibly transformed values of the original operating conditions to obtain non-linear relations&lt;ref name="Wikipolynomial"&gt;[[Polynomial]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikispline"&gt;[[Spline (mathematics)]]&lt;/ref&gt; between the original operating conditions and '''q'''. It is then a matter of selecting which terms in '''A''' are non-zero and assigning their values. The model completion becomes an [[Mathematical optimization|optimisation]] problem to determine the non-zero values in '''A''' that minimizes the error terms '''m(f,p,Ac)''' over the data.&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" &gt;Kojovic, T., and Whiten W. J., 1994. Evaluation of the quality of simulation models, Innovations in mineral processing, (Lauretian University, Sudbury) pp 437–446.  {{isbn|088667025X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"&gt;Kojovic, T., 1989.

== Model completion ==

Once a selection of non-zero values is made, the remaining coefficients in '''A''' can be determined by minimizing '''''m''(''f'',''p'',''Ac'')''' over the data with respect to the nonzero values in '''A''', typically by [[non-linear least squares]]. Selection of the nonzero terms can be done by optimization methods such as [[simulated annealing]] and [[evolutionary algorithms]]. Also the [[non-linear least squares]] can provide accuracy estimates&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" /&gt; for the elements of '''A''' that can be used to determine if they are significantly different from zero, thus providing a method of [[Model selection|term selection]].&lt;ref name="Linhart86"&gt;{{cite book|first=H. |last=Linhart|first2=W. |last2=Zucchini|title=Model selection|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fzDm34Z8ctUC}}|year=1986|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-83722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan |last=Miller|title=Subset Selection in Regression|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V-vLBQAAQBAJ}}|date=15 April 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes possible to calculate values of '''q''' for each data set, directly or by [[non-linear least squares]]. Then the more efficient [[linear regression]] can be used to predict '''q''' using '''c'''  thus selecting the non-zero values in '''A''' and estimating their values. Once the non-zero values are located [[non-linear least squares]] can be used on the original model '''m(f,p,Ac)''' to refine these values .&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt;

A third method is [[model inversion]],&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt; which converts the non-linear '''m'''('''f''','''p''','''Ac''') into an approximate linear form in the elements of '''A''', that can be examined using efficient term selection&lt;ref name="Linhart86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"/&gt; and evaluation of the linear regression.&lt;ref name="Lawson96"/&gt;  For the simple case of a single '''q''' value ('''q''' = '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c''') and an estimate '''q*''' of '''q'''. Putting d'''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''q*''' gives

: '''m(f,p,a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c) = m(f,p,q* + '''d'''q) ≈ m(f,p.q*) + '''d'''q m’(f,p,q*) = m(f,p.q*) + (a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c − q*) m’(f,p,q*)'''

so that '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is now in a linear position with all other terms known, and thus can be analyzed by [[linear regression]] techniques. For more than one parameter the method extends in a direct manner.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; After checking that the model has been improved this process can be repeated until convergence. This approach has the advantages that it does not need the parameters '''q''' to be able to be determined from an individual data set and the linear regression is on the original error terms&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;

== Model validation ==

Where sufficient data is available, division of the data into a separate model construction set and one or two [[Cross-validation (statistics)|evaluation sets]] is recommended. This can be repeated using multiple selections of the construction set and the [[Bootstrap aggregating|resulting models averaged]] or used to evaluate prediction differences.

A statistical test such as [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] on the residuals is not particularly useful.&lt;ref name="Deming2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=William Edwards | last = Deming|title=Out of the Crisis p272|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LA15eDlOPgoC |page=272}}|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54115-2| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chi squared test requires known standard deviations which are seldom available, and failed tests give no indication of how to improve the model&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;

An attempt to predict the residuals '''m(, )''' with the operating conditions '''c''' using linear regression will show if the residuals can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt; Residuals that cannot be predicted offer little prospect of improving the model using the current operating conditions.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Terms that do predict the residuals are prospective terms to incorporate into the model to improve its performance.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;

The model inversion technique above can be used as a method of determining whether a model can be improved. In this case selection of nonzero terms is not so important and linear prediction can be done using the significant [[eigenvectors]] of the [[Design matrix|regression matrix]]. The values in '''A''' determined in this manner need to be substituted into the nonlinear model to assess improvements in the model errors. The absence of a significant improvement indicates the available data is not able to improve the current model form using the defined parameters.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Extra parameters can be inserted into the model to make this test more comprehensive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">'''Insensitivity to sample size''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when people judge the probability of obtaining a [[sample statistic]] without respect to the [[sample size]]. For example, in one study subjects assigned the same probability to the likelihood of obtaining a mean height of above six feet [183&amp;nbsp;cm] in samples of 10, 100, and 1,000 men. In other words, variation is more likely in smaller samples, but people may not expect this.&lt;ref name="kv1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Daniel Kahneman|title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases|journal=Science|year=1974|volume=185|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|pmid=17835457|issue=4157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] asked subjects

&lt;blockquote&gt;A certain town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital about 45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 15 babies are born each day. As you know, about 50% of all babies are boys. However, the exact percentage varies from day to day. Sometimes it may be higher than 50%, sometimes lower.
&lt;br /&gt;
For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. Which hospital do you think recorded more such days?
# The larger hospital
# The smaller hospital
# About the same (that is, within 5% of each other) &lt;ref name="kv1"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

56% of subjects chose option 3, and 22% of subjects respectively chose options 1 or 2. However, according to [[statistical sampling|sampling theory]] the larger hospital is much more likely to report a sex ratio close to 50% on a given day than the smaller hospital which requires that the correct answer to the question is the smaller hospital (see [[Law of large numbers|the law of large numbers]]).

Relative neglect of sample size were obtained in a different study of statistically sophisticated psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Daniel Kahneman|title=Belief in the law of small numbers|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1971|volume=76|issue=2|pages=105–110|doi=10.1037/h0031322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tversky and Kahneman explained these results as being caused by the [[representativeness heuristic]], according to which people intuitively judge samples as having similar properties to their population without taking other considerations into effect. A related bias is the [[clustering illusion]], in which people under-expect streaks or runs in small samples. Insensitivity to sample size is a subtype of [[extension neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Choices, Values and Frames|year=2000|page=708|editor=Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Eds.)|chapter=Evaluation by moments, past and future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate this point, [[Howard Wainer]] and Harris L. Zwerling demonstrated that kidney cancer rates are lowest in counties that are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South, and the West, but that they are also ''highest'' in counties that are mostly rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South, and the West. While various environmental and economic reasons could be advanced for these facts, Wainer and Zwerlig argue that this is an artifact of sample size.  Because of the small sample size, the incidence of a certain kind of cancer in small rural counties is more likely to be further from the mean, in one direction or another, than the incidence of the same kind of cancer in much more heavily populated urban counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0031-7217| volume = 88| issue = 4| pages = 300–303| last1 = Wainer| first1 = Howard| last2 = Zwerling| first2 = Harris L.| title = Evidence That Smaller Schools Do Not Improve Student Achievement| journal = The Phi Delta Kappan| date = 2006| jstor = 20442243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jangama dhyana''' is a [[meditation]] technique, which has been practiced by various sages over the centuries. In modern times, it has been used by Shri [[Shivabalayogi]] Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri [[Shivarudra Balayogi]] Maharaj to achieve [[self-realization]]. The technique is currently taught by Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. ''Jangama'' means 'eternal existence' and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' means 'meditation.' Hence ''Jangama dhyana'' is 'Meditation on the Eternal Existence (of the [[Self]]).'

== Origins ==
''Jangama dhyana'' is an ancient meditation technique which involves concentrating the mind and sight between the eyebrows. According to Patanjali, this is one method of achieving the initial concentration (''[[dharana]]'': [[Yoga Sutras]], III: 1) necessary for the mind to go introverted in meditation (''dhyana'': [[Yoga Sutras]], III: 2). In the deeper practice of the Jangama dhyana technique, the mind concentrated between the eyebrows begins to automatically lose all location and focus on the watching itself. Eventually, the meditator experiences only the consciousness of existence and achieves [[Self Realization]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] describes the process in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point. This state is called ''dhyana''. When one has so intensified the power of ''dhyana'' as to be able to reject the external part of perception and remain meditating only on the internal part, the meaning, that state is called ''Samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Vivekenanda on ''Dhyana'' and ''Samadhi'' in Raja Yoga [[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Raja-Yoga/Dhyana And Samadhi/here]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The point between the eyebrows is referred to as the ''[[bhrikuti]]'' and symbolically as the ''[[ajna chakra]]'', which means 'commanding circle.' When the mind becomes totally concentrated at this point, one becomes the commander of one's mind. Until then, the meditator will not have achieved self-mastery. The [[Bhagavad Gita]] describes the process and benefits of the meditation technique as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shutting off sense &lt;br /&gt; 
From what is outward,&lt;br /&gt; 
Fixing the gaze &lt;br /&gt; 
At the root of the eye-brows,&lt;br /&gt; 
Checking the breath-stream&lt;br /&gt; 
In and outgoing &lt;br /&gt; 
Within the nostrils, &lt;br /&gt;
Holding the senses, &lt;br /&gt;
Holding the intellect, &lt;br /&gt;
Thrusts fear aside, &lt;br /&gt;
Thrusts aside anger &lt;br /&gt;
And puts off desire: &lt;br /&gt;
Truly that man &lt;br /&gt;
Is made free for ever.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Prabhavananda and Christoper Isherwood, 1987, ''Bhagavad-Gita: The Song of God'',  p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern times, the 19th century Yogi, Shri [[Ramakrishna]] Paramahamsa, practiced meditating between the eyebrows in order to achieve ''[[Nirvikalpa Samadhi]]'' (bringing the mind to a complete standstill, beyond imagination). Though he was able to withdraw his mind from all external sensations and objects, he initially could not go beyond the vision of goddess [[Kali]], which his mind had become totally concentrated upon during his long period of devotional ''[[tapas]]''. Shri [[Ramakrishna]] recounts how his [[Guru]] on the path of [[Advaita Vedanta]], Totapuri, gave him further instruction in the meditation technique to overcome this obstacle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He cast his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows... 'Concentrate the mind on this point!' he thundered. Then with stern determination I again sat to meditate... The last barrier fell. My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in ''Samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;M., ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Shri Ramakrishna was to give the same instruction in meditation to his illustrious disciple [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of the Swami Vivekananda'', Volume I, 1979, Advaita Ashrama, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the technique is associated with Shri [[Shivabalayogi]] Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri [[Shivarudra Balayogi]] Maharaj. Shri Shivabalayogi was initiated into the technique at the age of fourteen. On 7 August 1949, he experienced a vision of a tall Jangama Sage (ancient order of ascetics) with matted hair, who told him to sit in padmasana (lotus posture), and close his eyes. The Sage then touched the young boy between the eyebrows and instructed, 'Watch here.' Thus, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj sat in ''[[tapas]]'' (deep, prolonged meditation) for twelve years, meditating for 23 hours a day for eight years and around 12 hours a day for the remaining four years. After this period, he initiated tens of thousands of people into the meditation technique he had used to achieve Self Realization. 
In 1994, Shri Shivabalayogi initiated his direct disciple, Seenu, into ''tapas'' using the Jangama dhyana technique. He achieved Self Realization in November 1999 and was given the name Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, after meditating for around 20 hours a day over five years.

== Name ==
The name for the technique was coined by Shri Shivabalayogi while walking around the [[Dehradun]] [[ashram]] one night with his direct disciple, Seenu, who was later to become the Enlightened Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. He suddenly turned to Seenu and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps it would be nice to name the meditation technique we are teaching worldwide as ''Jangama dhyana.'' Lord Shiva first appeared to me in the form of a Jangama Sage to impart the technique, and ''Jangama'' means 'Eternal Existence'; so ''Jangama dhyana'' would mean 'meditation on the Eternal Existence of the Self.'&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, 2008, ''Guru-Disciple'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Technique ==
The Jangama dhyana technique is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See description on the [http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=38/ website of Shri Shivarudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sit, closing the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
Concentrate the mind and sight in between eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;
Keep watching there by focusing the attention.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not repeat any mantra or name.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not imagine anything.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not open eyes until the duration of meditation is over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, initiation into this technique is given by Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj. He identifies the greatest secret of meditation as not analyzing any thoughts or visions that may appear:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This meditation is a purification process, but this purification doesn't occur quietly. During the purification, visions and thoughts come. It is just like when you are washing clothes; you see the dirt coming out into the water. In the same way, when the mind is going through the purification, then thoughts and visions occur. But they occur only for a moment, and then they disappear. That is why we need to be so careful in this regard, because if you are watching, then the mind can very easily get involved in the thought, and if it gets involved it can further acquire new imprints. This re-acquiring is so subtle. This is why it is so important not to analyze thoughts during meditation, and this is also why the total cleansing of the mind takes time.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, C&amp;C, 2007, ''From the Heart of Peace'', p. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Visions and experiences are not important in meditation. The only symptom of progress is greater peace. After being totally cleansed through meditation, the mind becomes pure consciousness capable of realizing through deeper meditation (''Samadhi'') its existence beyond imagination as the eternal [[Self]].  This state is known as [[Self Realization]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]].

The '''levee''' (from the French word ''lever'', meaning "getting up" or "rising")&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/levee "levee"]. Dictionary.com. ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. Accessed January 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was traditionally a daily moment of intimacy and accessibility to a monarch or leader. It started out as a royal custom, but, in America, it later came to refer to a reception by the king’s representatives and, even later, by the president.

==History==

===France===
In [[Einhard]]'s ''Life of Charlemagne'', the author recounts the Emperor's practice, when he was dressing and putting on his shoes, to invite his friends to come in and, in case of a dispute brought to his attention, "he would order the disputants to be brought in there and then, hear the case as if he were sitting in tribunal and pronounce a judgement."&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', §24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the sixteenth century, it had become a formal event, requiring invitation.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J.H. ''Europe Divided 1559-1998, Fontana History of Europe'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks 1968) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563 [[Catherine de' Medici]] wrote in advice to her son, the King of France, to do as his father ([[Henry II of France|Henry II]]) had done and uphold the practice of ''lever''. Catherine describes that Henry II allowed his subjects, from nobles to household servants, to come in while he dressed. She states this pleased his subjects and improved their opinion of him.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the King (8 September 1563?) LCM. Vol. II, p. 90, cited in Potter, David, ''The French Wars of Religion: Selected Documents'' (New York 1997) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice was raised to a ceremonial custom at the court of King [[Louis XIV]]. In the court [[etiquette]] that Louis formalised, the set of extremely elaborate conventions was divided into the ''grand lever'', attended by the full court in the gallery outside the king's bedchamber, and the ''petit lever'' that transpired in degrees in the king's chamber, where only a very select group might serve the king as he rose and dressed.  In fact, the king had often risen early and put in some hours hunting before returning to bed for the start of the ''lever''.  Louis's grandson, King [[Philip V of Spain]], and his queen typically spent all morning in bed, as reported by Saint-Simon, to avoid the pestering by ministers and courtiers that began with the lever.

The king's retiring ceremony proceeded in reverse order and was known as the ''coucher''.

The successors of Louis XIV were not as passionate about the Sun King's daily routine and, over time, the frequency of the ''lever'' and ''coucher'' decreased, much to the dismay of their courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chateauversailles.fr/history/versailles-during-the-centuries/living-at-the-court/a-day-in-the-life-of-louis-xiv Official website of the Palace of Versailles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
[[File:St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room, by Charles Wild, 1816 - royal coll 922164 313723 ORI 2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Wild]] (1816) ''St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room'']]
When the court of [[Charles II of England]] adopted the custom, first noted as an English usage in 1672,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "Levée".&lt;/ref&gt; it was called a ''levée''. In the 18th century, as the fashionable dinner hour was incrementally moved later into the afternoon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/dinner2.html Sherrie McMillan, "What Time is Dinner?" ''History Magazine'' on-line]).&lt;/ref&gt; the morning reception of the British monarch, attended only by gentlemen, was shifted forward towards noon.

The practice of holding court levées was continued by the British Monarchy until 1939. These took the form of a formal reception at [[St James's Palace]] at which officials, diplomats, and military officers of all three armed services, were presented individually to the sovereign. [[Full dress]] uniform or [[court dress]] was worn by all participants, who formed a queue in the Throne Room before stepping forward when their names and ranks were called. Each then bowed to the king who was seated on a dais with male members of his family, officials of the Royal Household and senior officers behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Niven|pages=118–120|title=The Moon's a Balloon|isbn=0-340-15817-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Levees in the British Empire and Commonwealth====
Levée ceremonies were held by regal representatives of the British Empire, such as the [[Governor-General of India |Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland| the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the [[Governor-General of Australia| Governor-General]] or Governors of Australia.&lt;ref name="Governor's levee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Governor's Levee |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5425609 |website=Trove |publisher=The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA: 1889 - 1931) |accessdate=11 September 2018 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial event of the [[New Year's levee|Canadian Governor General's New Year's Day]] reception is still called his levée.

===United States===
By the 1760s, the custom was being copied by the colonial governors in [[British America]], but was abandoned in the [[United States]] following the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Beginning in 1789, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] and [[First Lady]] [[Martha Washington]] held weekly public gatherings and receptions at the presidential mansion that were called levees. Designed to give the public access to the president and to project a dignified public image of the presidency, they were continued by [[John Adams|John]] and [[Abigail Adams]], but were discarded in 1801 by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Levees (Receptions)| url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/levees-receptions/| work=Digital Encyclopedia| publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, George Washington's Mount Vernon| location=Mount Vernon, Virginia| accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis XIV's ''lever''==
The ceremony at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonies were abbreviated when the king was at [[Château de Marly|Marly]] or one of his other occasional retreats, providing a sense of intimacy that was only comparative, but engendering struggles among courtiers to be invited on such occasions, precisely the kind of competition Louis fostered.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described in detail by [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]]. Louis XIV was a creature of habit and the inflexible routine that tired or irritated his heirs served him well. Wherever the king had actually slept, he was discovered sleeping in the close-curtained [[state bed]] standing in its alcove, which was separated from the rest of the ''[[chambre du roi]]'' by a gilded balustrade.&lt;ref&gt;The comparison with the communion rail that separated the [[sanctuary]] in a church was not unintentional. The ''chambre du roi'' marked the centre of the [[Palace of Versailles|château de Versailles]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was woken at eight o'clock by his head [[valet de chambre]] —[[Alexandre Bontemps]] held this post for most of the reign — who alone had slept in the bedchamber. The chief physician, the chief surgeon and Louis' childhood nurse, as long as she lived, all entered at the same time, and the nurse kissed him. The night [[chamberpot]] was removed.

===Grande entrée===
[[Image:William Hogarth 022.jpg|thumb|270px|The second scene of  [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' (1732-33) showing the wealthy Tom at his morning levée in London, attended by musicians and other hangers-on all dressed in expensive costumes. Surrounding Tom from left to right: a music master at a harpsichord, who was supposed to represent [[George Frideric Handel]]; a fencing master; a quarterstaff instructor; a dancing master with a violin; a landscape gardener [[Charles Bridgeman]]; an ex-soldier offering to be a bodyguard; a bugler of a [[fox hunt]] club. At lower right is a jockey with a silver trophy.]]

Then the curtains of the bed were drawn once again and, at a quarter past eight, the Grand Chamberlain was called, bringing with him the nobles who had the privilege of the ''grande entrée'', a privilege that could be purchased, subject to the king's approval, but which was restricted in Louis' time to the nobles. The King remained in bed, in his nightshirt and a short wig. The [[Grand Chamberlain of France]] or, in his absence, the Chief [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]] presented [[holy water]] to the king from a vase that stood at the head of the bed and the king's morning clothes were laid out. First, the Master of the Bedchamber and the First Servant, both high nobles, pulled the king's nightshirt over his head, one grasping each sleeve. The Grand Chamberlain presented the day shirt which, according to Saint-Simon, had been shaken out and sometimes changed, because the king perspired freely. This was a moment for any of those with the privilege of the ''grande entrée'' to have a swift private word with the king, which would have been carefully rehearsed beforehand to express a request as deferentially, but in as few words as possible. The King was given a [[missal]] and the gentlemen retired into the adjoining ''chambre du conseil'' (the "council chamber") while there was a brief private prayer for the King.

===Première entrée===
When the King had them recalled, now accompanied by those who had the lesser privilege of the ''première entrée'', his process of dressing began. Louis preferred to dress himself "for he did almost everything himself, with address and grace", Saint-Simon remarked. The King was handed a dressing-gown, and a mirror was held for him, for he had no [[Toilette|toilet table]] like ordinary gentlemen. Every other day the King shaved himself. Now, other privileged courtiers were admitted, a few at a time, at each stage, so that, as the King was putting on his shoes and stockings, "everyone" — in Saint-Simon's view — was there. This was the ''entrée de la chambre'', which included the king's readers and the director of the ''[[Menus Plaisirs du Roi|Menus Plaisirs]]'', that part of the royal establishment in charge of all preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, to the last detail of design and order. At the ''entrée de la chambre'' were admitted the [[Grand Almoner of France|Grand Aumônier]] and the [[Marshal of France]] and the king's ministers and secretaries. A fifth entrée now admitted ladies for the first time, and a sixth entrée admitted, from a privileged position at a cramped backdoor, the king's children, legitimate and illegitimate indiscriminately — in scandalous fashion Saint-Simon thought — and their spouses.

The crowd in the ''chambre du Roi'' can be estimated from Saint-Simon's remark of the King's devotions, which followed: the King knelt at his bedside "where all the clergy present knelt, the cardinals without cushions, all the laity remaining standing".

The King then passed into the ''[[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]]'' where all those who possessed any court office attended him. He then announced what he expected to do that day and was left alone with those among his favourites of the royal children born illegitimately (whom he had publicly recognised and legitimated&lt;ref&gt;These eventually were five in all.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a few favourites, with the valets. These were less pressing moments to discuss projects with the King, who parcelled out his attention with strict regard for the current standing of those closest to him.
[[File:Le Lever.jpg|thumb|275px|''Le Lever'', engraving by Louis Romanet (1742–1810), after Sigmund Freudenberg (1745-1801)]]

===''Grand lever''===
With the entry of the King into the ''Grande Galerie'', where the rest of the court awaited him, the ''petit lever'' was finished, and with the ''grand lever'' the day was properly begun, as the king proceeded to daily Mass, sharing brief words as he progressed and even receiving some petitions. It was of these occasions that the King habitually remarked, in refusing a favour asked for some noble, "We never see him", meaning that he did not spend enough time at Versailles, where Louis wanted to keep the nobility penned up, to prevent them interesting themselves in politics.

==For the aristocracy==
Among the aristocracy, the levée could also become a crowded and social occasion, especially for women, who liked to put off the donning of their uncomfortable formal clothes, and whose hair and perhaps make-up needed prolonged attention.  There is a famous depiction of the levée of an 18th-century Viennese lady of the court in [[Richard Strauss]]'s later opera ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where she has her hair dressed while surrounded by a disorderly crowd of tradesmen touting for work or payment, and other petitioners, followed by a visit from a cousin.  The second scene of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' shows a male equivalent in 1730s London.

In the French engraving ''Le Lever'' after Freudenberg, of the 1780s (''illustration, right''), gentle social criticism is levelled at the lady of the court; that she slept without unlacing her stays, apparently, perhaps can be seen as artistic licence. Her maids dress her with deference, while the wallclock under the hangings of her ''lit à la polonaise'' appears to read noon.

==In popular culture==
In [[Sophia Coppola]]'s ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' the levée of the French queen, during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI is represented.

A '''Macroscopic traffic flow model''' is a [[mathematical model|mathematical]] [[traffic model]] that formulates the relationships among [[traffic flow]] characteristics like [[density]], [[Traffic flow|flow]], mean speed of a traffic stream, etc.. Such models are conventionally arrived at by integrating [[microscopic traffic flow models]] and converting the single-entity level characteristics to comparable system level characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | doi=10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | volume=217 | issue=3 | title=Rigorous Derivation of Nonlinear Scalar Conservation Laws from Follow-the-Leader Type Models via Many Particle Limit | journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis | pages=831–871| year=2015 | last1=Di Francesco | first1=M. | last2=Rosini | first2=M.D. | arxiv=1404.7062 | bibcode=2015ArRMA.217..831D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of modeling traffic flow at macroscopic level originated under an assumption that traffic streams as a whole are comparable to [[fluid flow|fluid streams]]. The first major step in macroscopic modeling of traffic was taken by Lighthill and Whitham in 1955, when they indexed the comparability of ‘traffic flow on long crowded roads’ with ‘flood movements in long rivers’. A year later, Richards (1956) complemented the idea with the introduction of ‘[[shock-wave]]s on the highway’, completing the so-called LWR model. 
Macroscopic modeling may be primarily classified according to the type of traffic as homogeneous and heterogeneous, and further with respect to the order of the mathematical model.

== Biography ==
Ho received a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1967 from [[Hong Kong University]], was postdoctoral fellow in biochemical genetics, [[University of California, San Diego]], from 1968 to 1972, senior research fellow in [[Queen Elizabeth College]], lecturer in genetics (from 1976) and [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in biology (from 1985) in the [[Open University]], and since retiring in June 2000 visiting professor of biophysics in Catania University, Sicily.&lt;ref name="Independent Science Panel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Mae-Wan Ho bio"/&gt;

Ho died of cancer in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samburcher.com/articles/public-health/109-tribute-to-dr-mae-wan-ho-1941-2016.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wessex.ac.uk/news/general-news/910-obituary-mae-wan-ho&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institute of Science in Society ==
Ho was a co-founder and director of the Institute of Science in Society (ISIS), an [[Advocacy group|interest group]] that campaigns against what it sees as unethical uses of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-sis.org.uk/about.php ISIS Report 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The group published about climate change, GMOs, [[homeopathy]], traditional Chinese medicine, and [[water memory]].

In reviewing the organisation, [[David Colquhoun]] accused the ISIS of promoting [[pseudoscience]] and specifically criticised Ho's understanding of [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref name="Colquhoun"/&gt;

The institute is on the [[Quackwatch]] list of questionable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Questionable Organizations: An Overview|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016 ISIS announced it was "terminating" activities due to the "serious illness" of Mae Wan Ho.  They noted, The "Institute of Science in Society website will remain as a static archive, but we will not be circulating any more reports beyond the end of March 2016."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-sis.org.uk/index.php ISIS "Termination Notice"], Institute of Science in Society statement, February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic engineering ==
Ho, together with Joe Cummins of the [[University of Western Ontario]], has argued that a sterility gene engineered into a crop could be transferred to other crops or wild relatives and that "This could severely compromise the agronomic performance of conventional crops and cause wild relatives to go extinct". They argued that this process could also produce genetic instabilities, which might be "leading to catastrophic breakdown", and stated that there are no data to assure that this has not happened or cannot happen.&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacLeod, "Who's listening? Will public opinion on genetically modified crops make any difference to the government?", ''The Guardian'', 19 May 2003. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/may/19/gm.food Reprint]. Accessed 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern contrasts with the reason why these sterile plants were developed, which was to prevent the transfer of genes to the environment by preventing any plants that are bred with or that receive these genes from reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daniell H |title=Molecular strategies for gene containment in transgenic crops |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=581–6 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12042861 |doi=10.1038/nbt0602-581 |pmc=3471138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, any gene that caused sterility when transferred to a new species would be eliminated by [[natural selection]] and could not spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee D, Natesan E |title=Evaluating genetic containment strategies for transgenic plants |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=109–14 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16460821 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho expressed concerns about the spread of altered genes through [[horizontal gene transfer]] and that the experimental alteration of genetic structures may be out of control. One of her concerns is that the [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] gene that was isolated from bacteria and used in some [[Genetically modified food|GM crops]] might cross back from plants by [[horizontal gene transfer]] to different species of bacteria, because "If this happened it would leave us unable to treat major illnesses like [[meningitis]] and ''[[Escherichia coli|E coli]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Antony Barnett, "GM genes 'jump species barrier', GM food: special report", ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2000. [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/may/28/gm.food Reprint]. Accessed 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her views were published in an opinion article based on a review of others' research.&lt;ref name=Ho1999&gt;{{cite journal

Ho has also argued that bacteria could acquire the bacterial gene [[barnase]] from transgenic plants. This gene kills any cell that expresses it and lacks [[barstar]], the specific inhibitor of barnase activity. In an article entitled ''Chronicle of An Ecological Disaster Foretold'', which was published in an ISIS newsletter, Ho speculated that if a bacterium acquired the barnase gene and survived, this could make the bacteria a more dangerous pathogen.

==Evolution==

Ho has claimed that evolution is pluralistic and non-Darwinian because there are many mechanisms that can produce variation in phenotypes independently of [[natural selection]]. Ho has advocated a form of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolution. She has been criticized by the [[scientific community]] for setting up [[straw man]] arguments in her criticism of natural selection and supporting discredited evolutionary theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas J. Futuyma|J. Futuyma, Douglas]]. (1984). ''Neo-Darwinism in Disfavor''. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. New Series, Vol. 226, No. 4674. pp. 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ghiselin|Ghiselin, Michael]]. (1985). ''Evolutionary Theory: Paths into the Future by J. W. Pollard; Beyond Neo-Darwinism: An Introduction to the New Evolutionary Paradigm by Mae-Wan Ho; Peter T. Saunders''. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 73, No. 6. p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Ledyard Stebbins|Stebbins, G. Ledyard]]. (1985). ''A New Approach to Research on Evolution?''. ''[[BioScience]]''.

The paleontologist [[Philip D. Gingerich|Philip Gingerich]] has noted that Ho's evolutionary ideas are based on [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip D. Gingerich|Gingerich, Philip D]]. (1989). ''New Vitalism in Evolution: Evolutionary Processes and Metaphors M.-W. Ho S. W. Fox''. ''[[BioScience]]'' 39: 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12239">In modern usage, metric is used almost exclusively in commercial transactions. These units are mostly historical, although they are still used in some limited contexts and in Maltese idioms and set phrases. Many of these terms are directly related to [[Ancient Arabic weights and measures|Arabic units]] and some to Sicilian units.  The ''Weights and Measures Ordinance'' of 1921 established uniformity in the conversion of such weights and measures. All these measures were defined as simple multiples of the Imperial units then in use in Britain.

== Length ==

Length units were typically used for measuring goods and building sizes. Distances were traditionally measured in terms of travel time, which explains the lack of large-scale units.

== Volume ==

These units were all (except for the cubic units) defined in 1921 relative to the British Imperial gallon, which was defined in the 1824 act. This is equal to 10 pounds of water at a specified temperature and air pressure. This (~4.546 090 31 litres) is slightly larger than the modern definition (exactly 4.546 09 litres).

=== Beer, wine, and spirits measure ===

== Mass ==

All the Maltese mass units were redefined relative to the British Imperial ton in 1921. Before this, the units were presumably based on an Arabic standard. All equivalent measures listed in pounds below are exact values.

nb. There are two distinct units which are named ''kwart''.

During the summer of 2010, the military charged five members of the platoon with murder of three Afghan civilians in [[Kandahar Province]] and collecting their body parts as trophies. In addition, seven soldiers were charged with crimes such as [[hashish]] use, impeding an investigation, and attacking the [[whistleblower]], [[Private First Class]] Justin Stoner.&lt;ref name=Cnn-2010-09-09&gt;

In March 2011, U.S. Army [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Jeremy Morlock pleaded guilty to three counts of [[premeditated murder]]. He told the court that he had helped to kill unarmed native Afghans in faked combat situations. Under a plea deal, Morlock received 24 years in prison for murdering three Afghan civilians in return for testimony against other soldiers. [[Staff Sergeant]] Calvin Gibbs, the highest-ranking soldier and the ringleader, was also convicted on three counts of premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison. Private First Class Andrew Holmes pleaded guilty to murder without premeditation and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Specialist Adam C. Winfield, who informed his father after the first murder and whose father attempted to alert the Army, pleaded guilty to [[manslaughter]] and was sentenced to three years in prison. In total, eleven of the twelve soldiers charged were convicted of crimes. All charges against the twelfth soldier, Specialist Michael Wagnon, were dropped by the U.S. military "in the interest of justice" without further explanation. PFC Justin Stoner, who initiated the case by reporting the murders to his superiors, was not charged.&lt;ref name=24years &gt;{{cite web |title=Court Sentences 'Kill Team' Soldier to 24 Years in Prison |author=  |publisher=Der Spiegel |date=March 24, 2011 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,752918,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/23/us-soldier-admits-killing-afghans | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Harris | title=US military (News),US news,Afghanistan (News),World news | date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/04/us-military-drops-kill-team-charges | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US military drops 'kill team' charges against soldier | date=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashton |first=Adam |url=http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2012/02/03/2379675/army-drops-murder-charge-against.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720061924/http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2012/02/03/2379675/army-drops-murder-charge-against.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-20 |title=Army drops murder charge against last soldier tied to "kill team" cases &amp;#124; Northwest McClatchy |publisher=The Bellingham Herald |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Young Afghan farmer boy murdered by US soldiers.jpg|thumb|15-year-old Gul Mudin, killed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] SPC Jeremy Morlock and PFC Andrew Holmes on 15 January 2010.]]
All of the three staged killings of Afghan civilians occurred in the [[Maywand District]] of [[Afghanistan]]:

*On January 15, 2010, in the village of [[La Mohammad Kalay]], fifteen-year-old Gul Mudin was doing farm work for his father. He was unarmed and killed "by means of throwing a fragmentary grenade at him and shooting him with a rifle," an action carried out by SPC Jeremy Morlock and PFC Andrew Holmes under the direction of Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs. The boy was then stripped and the soldiers took photos with his body. Then the boy was left on the ground, stark naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/03/31/v-printerfriendly/1606618/news-brief-31karzais.html |title=The News Tribune – Karzai 'hurt' by photos of killing by Stryker soldiers (print) |publisher=Thenewstribune.com |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908004259/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/03/31/v-printerfriendly/1606618/news-brief-31karzais.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012712859_civiliandeaths25m.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827001420/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012712859_civiliandeaths25m.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-08-27 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Hal |last=Bernton |title=Stryker soldiers plotted to kill Afghan civilians |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On February 22, using thermal imagery, the soldiers discovered Marach Agha curled in a ball by a roadside. Gibbs and SPC Michael S. Wagnon shot him and placed a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] next to the body to justify the killing. Morlock pleaded guilty for his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goetz |first=John |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,754141-4,00.html |title=Adam's War: The Good Boy and the 'Kill Team' – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army later said it believed Marach Agha to be deaf or [[mentally retarded]].

Tribal elders had complained to Army officers that the cleric had been unarmed and that the shooting was a setup.

Stoner was not charged and was honorably discharged in 2012.

&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the news from his son, Christopher Winfield called the Army inspector general's 24-hour hotline, the office of Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] (D-Fla.), and a sergeant at [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] who told him to call the Army's [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]].  He then contacted the Fort Lewis command center and spoke to a sergeant on duty who agreed that SPC Winfield was in potential danger but he had to report the crime to his superiors before the Army could take action.&lt;ref name=post0918&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/18/AR2010091803935_pf.html |title=Members of U.S. platoon in Afghanistan accused of killing civilians for sport |author=Whitlock, Craig |publisher=Washington Post |date=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2011, Winfield, charged with [[premeditated murder]] and conspiracy to commit murder, pleaded guilty under a plea deal to involuntary [[manslaughter]] and use of an illegal controlled substance. The involuntary manslaughter charge stems from Winfield's failure to intervene and prevent the other soldiers from carrying out the attack against the Afghan in U.S. custody. Under the plea deal he didn't admit to the killing of Mullah Adahdad. He claimed that he fired his automatic weapon away from Adahdad but that he did nothing to stop the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-soldier-plot-20110805,0,4050714.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Kim | last=Murphy | title=Soldier pleads guilty to manslaughter in Afghan's killing | date=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/08/05/washington.winfield/ | work=CNN | title=Soldier gets 3 years for part he played in deaths of Afghan civilians | date=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015830986_winfield06m.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715030139/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015830986_winfield06m.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Hal |last=Bernton |title=3 years for Lewis-McChord soldier in war-crimes case |date=2011-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iNhCeiqPbpwHjKwqON4K-Q0QO4yA?docId=CNG.c08d50927e48321e5e784e1f7b45cbbc.7a1 |title=AFP: US soldier pleads guilty in Afghan killing spree |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole |first=Matthew |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/kill-team-soldier-years-prison/story?id=14239130 |title='Kill Team' Soldier Gets Three Years in Prison – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2011-08-06 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from prison in August 2012.

'''Mootral''' is the name given to a programme to reduce [[methane]] emissions from [[ruminant]] animals, chiefly [[cow]]s and [[sheep]], but also [[goat]]s. Methane is a major target [[greenhouse gas]] and in the 4th protocol report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) is recommended to increase from a x23 to x72 multiplier because of the magnitude of its effect relative to [[carbon dioxide]] and short longevity in [[Earth's atmosphere]].

== Natural feed supplement ==

The Mootral natural feed supplement is produced by Neem Biotech. The active ingredient is an organic [[Organosulfur compounds|organosulfur]] compound (normally found in [[garlic]]), Research at the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]] has demonstrated up to a 94% reduction in methane production.

==Emission trading==
Mootral is the brand for the project, designed to certify approved methane reduction programmes in which corporates may participate and prove the provenance of their involvement.  Proceeds of [[emission trading]] credits are part donated to [[farmer]]s, who will receive Mootral without charge for adding to their cattle feed. Further surpluses return to programme participants and charities allied to greenhouse gas reduction research.

==Publicity==
Mootral has attracted much recent  attention as runner-up in the FT Global Climate Challenge and Dutch Postcode Lottery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  

Mootral is a finalist in the Shell/BBC/Newsweek World Challenge 2009 as one of the 12 most promising solutions to [[climate change]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5859">In sociology, '''moral shock''' is a cognitive and emotional process that encourages participation. [[James M. Jasper]], who originally coined the term, used it to help explain why people might join a [[social movement]] in the absence of pre-existing social ties with members. It denotes a kind of visceral unease, triggered by personal or public events, that captures people’s attention. Moral shocks often force people to articulate their moral intuitions. It is an appealing concept because it brings together emotional, moral, and cognitive dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Jasper, ''The Art of Moral Protest'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David A. Snow]] and Sarah A. Soule, authors of “A Primer on Social Movements”, the moral shock argument says that some events may be so emotionally moving or morally reprehensible that individuals will feel that they must join the cause regardless of their connection or ties to members of that organization.&lt;ref name="Snow"&gt;Snow, David A., and Sarah Anne Soule. A Primer on Social Movements. New York, NY: W. W. Norton, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral shock is similar in many ways to [[shock advertising]] which uses analogous techniques to help increase brand success and awareness.  Moral shocks have been shown to help recruit people to the [[animal rights]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;James M. Jasper and Jane Poulsen, "Recruiting Strangers and Friends: Moral Shocks and Social Networks in Animal Rights and Antinuclear Protest," ''Social Problems'' 42 (1995), pp. 493-512.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[peace movement|movement for peace]] in Central America,&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Erikson Nepstad, ''Convictions of the Soul'' (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; anti-[[abortion]] campaigns &lt;ref name="Snow"/&gt; and [[anti-racist]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Warren, ''Fire in the Heart: How White Activists Embrace Racial Justice'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deborah Gould has suggested another role for moral shocks: radicalizing or reinforcing the commitment of those already active in a protest movement. She says that the 1986 [[Bowers v. Hardwick]] decision by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] had this effect on the U.S. gay and lesbian rights movements. Hardwick told the lesbian and gay community that their own government supported their oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gould, ''Moving Politics'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Indignation at one’s own government can be especially moving, as it involves a sense of betrayal. Furthermore, violent repression of peaceful protest is thus a frequent source of moral shock.

The impact of moral shock is illustrated in the film [[Unborn in the USA]] in which the ProLife on Campus organization is highlighted in its travels to college campuses across the country. Using a set of extremely large and graphic images of abortion and abortion procedures the group attempts to portray their anti-abortion messages on college campuses—targeting young people who they believe are particularly prone to getting involved. They believe the images are very effective ways to shine light on the truth of what abortion does to innocent children. Unless the public is made aware of this perceived injustice, it will never be able to end, according to statements on their website. The group’s slogan is “Winning Hearts…Changing Minds…and Saving Lives…” &lt;ref&gt;ProLife on Campus." Pro Life On Campus - Pro Life on Campus. 2009. Web. 04 Dec. 2011. http://www.prolifeoncampus.com/home.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowe suggests that moral shocks are especially likely when someone holds a sweeping movement ideology that takes the form of a “quasi-religion.”&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Lowe, ''Emerging Moral Vocabularies'' (Lanham, MD.: Rowman and Littlefield, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jasper on Moral Shocks==
In Chapter 5 of ''The Art of Moral Protest'', Jasper defines a moral shock as "an unexpected event or piece of information [which] raises such a sense of outrage in a person that she becomes inclined toward political action, with or without the network of personal contacts emphasized in mobilization and process theories."&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Moral Protest'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, seeing a documentary about illicit banking practices may motivate an individual to participate in financial reform efforts.  The motivation generated by a moral shock is, as the conceptual label makes plain, moral in nature; it operates at a level of normative force beyond just the purely cognitive or emotional.  However, it is important to note that "for a moral shock to lead to protest, it must have an explicit cognitive dimension as well as moral and emotional ones."&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Moral Protest'', 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moral shocks are moral insofar as they create a sense of outrage or indignation, emotional insofar as anger or frustration accompanies this outrage, and cognitive insofar as the shock is delivered via words and symbols.  For instance, the aforementioned documentary uses such cognitive devices to get its message across, but it also relies on emotional appeal and the resulting, normatively stronger, sense of moral outrage.

Moral shock as a concept is especially important because it pinpoints a factor that motivates individuals to protest that is not reducible to factors highlighted by [[resource mobilization]] and [[political opportunity]] theories (e.g., social networks, preexisting beliefs).  ''The Art of Moral Protest'' shows that would-be protestors do not always know other protestors and often formulate their beliefs on the fly, so to speak.  Hence, Jasper’s concept is able to account for an additional path into protest, a path emphasizing the relative importance of events and their initial consciousness-raising effects on individuals.

'''Organizational conflict''', or '''workplace conflict''', is a state of discord caused by the actual or perceived opposition of [[needs]], [[values]] and [[Conflict of interest|interests]] between people working together. [[Conflict (process)|Conflict]] takes many forms in [[organization]]s. There is the inevitable clash between formal authority and power and those individuals and groups affected. There are disputes over how revenues should be divided, how the work should be done, and how long and hard people should work. There are jurisdictional disagreements among [[individual]]s, [[Departmentalization|departments]], and between [[Trade union|unions]] and [[management]]. There are subtler forms of conflict involving rivalries, [[jealousies]], [[personality clashes]], role definitions, and struggles for [[Power (social and political)|power]] and favor. There is also conflict within individuals&amp;nbsp;– between [[competition|competing needs]] and demands&amp;nbsp;– to which individuals respond in different ways.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn= 9780876205402|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type==
Conflict affecting organizations can occur in [[individual]]s, between individual and between groups. Conflicts within work groups are often caused by struggles over control, status, and scarce resources. Conflicts between groups in organizations have similar origins. The constructive [[conflict resolution|resolution]] of such conflicts can most often be achieved through a rational process of problem solving, coupled with a willingness to explore issues and alternatives and to listen to each other.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Personal conflict ===
A personal conflict involves a conflict between two people, most often from a mutual dislike or personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conflict Resolution Principles 150|url=http://www.toolingu.com/definition-950150-105250-personal-conflict.html|work=Supervisor Essentials Training|publisher=TOOLINGU|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Boston University FSAO, "Causes for workplace conflict can be personality or style differences and personal problems such as substance abuse, childcare issues, and family problems. Organizational factors such as leadership, management, budget, and disagreement about core values can also contribute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Conflict|url=http://www.bu.edu/fsao/resources/workplace/|work=Faculty and Staff Assistance|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Colorado–Boulder]] cites as primary causes of workplace conflict as poor communication, different values, differing interests, scarce resources, personality clashes, and poor [[Job performance|performance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/fsap/conflict.html Resolving Workplace Conflict], University of Colorado–Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many difficulties in this area are beyond the scope of [[management]] and more in the province of a professional counselor or workplace mediator, but there are some aspects of personal conflict that managers should understand and some they can possibly help remedy. Social conflict refers to interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup differences.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; Organizational conflict at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ ''Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

It was pointed out that there is a basic incompatibility between the authority and structure of formal organizations and the human personality. [[Human behavior]] cannot be separated from the culture that surrounds it.&lt;ref name="conf2"&gt;{{cite book |author = Chris Argyris|title = Personality and organization; the conflict between system and the individual|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|location = New York|year = 1957|pages = 47–54|isbn = |oclc = 243920|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intragroup conflict ===
Conflict arises in groups because of the scarcity of freedom, position, and resources. People who value independence tend to resist the need for interdependence and, to some extent, conformity within a group. People who seek power therefore struggle with others for position or status within the group. Rewards and recognition are often perceived as insufficient and improperly distributed, and members are inclined to compete with each other for these prizes.&lt;ref name="conf3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore M Mills|title= The Sociology of Small Groups|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|year=1967 |pages=14–17|isbn= |oclc=255221|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western culture, winning is more acceptable than losing, and competition is more prevalent than cooperation, all of which tends to intensify [[intragroup conflict]]. Group meetings are often conducted in a win-lose climate&amp;nbsp;— that is, individual or subgroup interaction is conducted for the purpose of determining a winner and a loser rather than for achieving mutual problem solving.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

=== Intergroup conflict ===
Intergroup conflict occurs in four general forms. Horizontal strain involves competition between functions, for example, sales versus production, research and development versus engineering, purchasing versus legal, line versus staff, and so on. Vertical strain involves competition between hierarchical levels, for example, union versus management, foremen versus middle management, shop workers versus foremen.&lt;ref name="conf5" /&gt; A struggle between a group of employees and management is an example of vertical strain or conflict. A clash between a sales department and production over inventory policy would be an example of horizontal strain.

Certain activities and attitudes are typical in groups involved in a win-lose conflict. Each side closes ranks and prepares itself for battle. Members show increased loyalty and support for their own groups. Minor differences between group members tend to be smoothed over, and deviants are dealt with harshly. The level of morale in the groups increases and infuses everyone with competitive spirit. The power structure becomes better defined, as the "real" [[leader]]s come to the surface and members rally around the "best" thinkers and talkers.&lt;ref name="conf3" /&gt;

In addition, each group tends to distort both its own views and those of the competing group. What is perceived as "good" in one's own position is emphasized, what is "bad" is ignored; the position of the other group is assessed as uniformly "bad," with little "good" to be acknowledged or accepted. Thus, the judgment and objectivity of both groups are impaired. When such groups meet to "discuss" their differences, constructive, rational behavior is severely inhibited.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt; Each side phrases its questions and answers in a way that strengthens its own position and disparages the other's. Hostility between the two groups increases; mutual understandings are buried in negative [[stereotype]]s.

It is easy to see that under the conditions described above, mutual [[solution]]s to problems cannot be achieved. As a result, the side having the greater power wins; the other side loses. Or the conflict may go unresolved, and undesirable conditions or circumstances continue. Or the conflict may be settled by a higher authority.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt;

None of these outcomes is a happy one. Disputes settled on the basis of power, such as through a [[strike action|strike]] or a lockout in a labor-management dispute, are often deeply resented by the loser. Such settlements may be resisted and the winner defeated in underground ways that are difficult to detect and to counter. When this happens, neither side wins; both are losers. If the conflict is left unresolved, as when both sides withdraw from the scene, intergroup cooperation and effectiveness may be seriously impaired to the detriment of the entire [[organization]]. Disputes that are settled by higher authority also may cause resentment and what is called "lose-lose" consequences. Such settlements are invariably made on the basis of incomplete [[information]]&amp;nbsp;— without data that the conflict itself obscures&amp;nbsp;— and therefore are poor substitutes for mutually reasoned solutions. Again, both sides have lost. A specific approach to resolving intergroup conflict is outlined in the next chapter on organization development.&lt;ref name="conf3"/&gt;

== Causes ==

===Role conflict===
{{Main|Role conflict}}
One fact of personal conflict includes the multiple roles people play in organizations.
[[Behavioral]] scientists sometimes describe an [[organization]] as a system of position roles. Each member of the organization belongs to a role set, which is an association of individuals who share interdependent tasks and thus perform formally defined roles, which are further influenced both by the expectations of others in the role set and by one's own personality and expectations. For example, in a common form of classroom organization, students are expected to learn from instructors by listening to them, following their directions for study, taking exams, and maintaining appropriate standards of conduct. [[teacher|Instructors]] are expected to bring students high-quality learning materials, give lectures, write and conduct tests, and set a scholarly example. Another in this role set would be the dean of the school, who sets standards, hires and supervises faculty, maintains a service [[Employment|staff]], readers and graders, and so on. The system of roles to which an individual belongs extends outside the organization as well, and influences their functioning within it. As an example, a person's roles as partner, parent, descendant, and church member are all intertwined with each other and with their set of organizational roles.&lt;ref name="conf5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Daniel Katz; Robert Louis Kahn|title= The social psychology of organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1966 |pages=18–33|isbn= |oclc=255184|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, there exist opportunities for role conflict as the various roles interact with one another. Other types of role conflict occur when an individual receives inconsistent demands from another person; for example, they are asked to serve on several time-consuming committees at the same time that they are urged to get out more production in their work unit. Another kind of role strain takes place when the individual finds that they are expected to meet the opposing demands of two or more separate members of the [[organization]]. Such a case would be that of a worker who finds himself pressured by their boss to improve the quality of their work while their work group wants more production in order to receive a higher bonus share.

These and other varieties of role conflict tend to increase an individual's anxiety and [[frustration]]. Sometimes they motivate him to do more and better work. Other times they can lead to frustration and reduced efficiency.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971 |pages=Chapter 8|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passive aggressive behavior===
{{Main|Passive aggressive behavior}}Passive aggressive behavior is a common response from workers and managers which is particularly noxious to team unity and productivity. In workers, it can lead to sabotage of projects and the creation of a hostile environment. In managers, it can end up stifling a team's creativity. De Angelis says "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;De Angelis, Paula: Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Leadership in the Workplace, (Kindle Edition - Jun 22,2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Office romance ===
{{Main|Office romance}}Office romances can be a cause of workplace conflict. 96 percent of human resource professionals and 80 percent of executives said workplace romances are dangerous because they can lead to conflict within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/02/14/BU144015.DTL Dangerous love: An Office romance could cost you your job, Julie N. Lynem, [[San Francisco Chronicle]], Feb. 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public displays of affection]] can make co-workers uncomfortable and accusations of favoritism may occur, especially if it is a supervisor-subordinate relationship. If the relationship goes awry, one party may seek to exact revenge on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://working.canada.com/national/resources/atwork/story.html?id=4f8d63ab-a97a-42b5-b3a1-54983d3aef8f When an Office Romance Sours], Working.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, quality problems, missed deadlines or delays, increased stress among employees, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, disruption to work flow, decreased customer satisfaction, distrust, split camps, and [[Gossip#Workplace gossip|gossip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/337162_workcoach29.html Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict], Maureen, Moriarty, [[Seattlepi]], Oct. 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The win-lose conflict in groups may have some of the following negative effects:&lt;ref name="conf4"&gt;{{cite book |author=John E Jones;  J William Pfeiffer|title=The 1973 annual handbook for group facilitators|publisher=University Associates|location=San Diego, Calif. |year=1973 |pages=106–109|isbn= 9780883900819|oclc=9160197|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Divert time and energy from the main issues
* Delay decisions
* Create [[deadlocks]]
* Drive unaggressive committee members to the sidelines
* Interfere with listening
* Obstruct exploration of more alternatives
* Decrease or destroy [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]]
* Cause members to drop out or resign from committees
* Arouse anger that disrupts a meeting
* Interfere with [[empathy]]
* Incline underdogs to [[sabotage]]
* Provoke [[personal abuse]]
* Cause defensiveness
Conflict is not always destructive. When it is destructive, however, managers need to understand and do something about it. A rational process for dealing with the conflict should be programmed. Such a process should include a planned action response on the part of the manager or the organization, rather than relying on a simple reaction or a change that occurs without specific action by management.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

===Stress===
{{Main|Occupational stress}}Interpersonal conflict among people at work has been shown to be one of the most frequently noted stressors for employees.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, A., &amp; Newton, T. (1985). Stressful events, stressors and psychological strains in young professional engineers. Journal of Occupational Behaviour, 6(2), 151-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu, C., Spector, P. E., &amp; Shi, L. (2007). Cross-National Job Stress: A Quantitative and Qualitative Study. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 28(2), 209-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict has been noted to be an indicator of the broader concept of workplace harassment.&lt;ref name="Bowling, N. A. 2006"&gt;Bowling, N. A., &amp; Beehr, T. A. (2006). Workplace harassment from the victim's perspective: A theoretical model and meta-analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology, 91(5), 998-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to other stressors that might co-occur, such as [[role conflict]], role ambiguity, and [[workload]]. It also relates to strains such as [[anxiety]], depression, physical symptoms, and low levels of [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Bowling, N. A. 2006"/&gt;

===Positive outcomes===

Group conflict does not always lead to negative consequences. The presence of a dissenting member or subgroup often results in more penetration of the group's problem and more creative solutions. This is because disagreement forces the members to think harder in an attempt to cope with what may be valid objections to general group opinion. But the group must know how to deal with differences that may arise.&lt;ref name="conf2" /&gt;

True interdependence among members leads automatically to [[Dispute resolution|conflict resolution]] in the group. Interdependence recognizes that differences will exist and that they can be helpful. Hence, members learn to accept ideas from dissenters (which does not imply agreeing with them), they learn to listen and to value openness, and they learn to share a mutual problem-solving attitude to ensure the exploration of all facets of a problem facing the group.&lt;ref name="conf4" /&gt;

Intergroup conflict between groups is a sometimes necessary, sometimes destructive, event that occurs at all levels and across all functions in [[organization]]s. Intergroup conflict may help generate creative tensions leading to more effective contributions to the organization's [[goal]]s, such as competition between sales districts for the highest [[Sales|sale]]s.&lt;ref name="conf5"/&gt; Intergroup conflict is destructive when it alienates groups that should be working together, when it results in win-lose [[competition]], and when it leads to compromises that represent less-than-optimum outcomes.

== Resolution ==

=== Conflict management ===
Constantino helps organizations design their own, ad hoc [[conflict management]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=adr] Conflict and dispute management system design: overview.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tosi, Rizzo, and Caroll suggested that improving organizational practices could help resolve conflicts, including establishing [[superordinate goals]], reducing vagueness, minimizing authority- and domain-related disputes, improving policies, procedures and rules, re-apportioning existing resources or adding new, altering communications, movement of personnel, and changing reward systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W7504E/w7504e07.htm Conflict Management], FAO Corporate Document Repository.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large organizations have a [[human resources]] department, whose tasks include providing confidential advice to internal "customers" in relation to problems at work. This could be seen as less risky than asking one's manager for help. HR departments may also provide an impartial person who can mediate disputes and provide an objective point of view. Another option is the introduction of the Ombudsman figure at the organizational level, charged with surveying common causes of conflict and suggesting structural improvements to address them.

* [[Counseling]] - when personal conflict leads to frustration and loss of [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], counseling may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener&amp;nbsp;— something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt;  Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings&amp;nbsp;— that is, to express them to a concerned and understanding listener, is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting their work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.  There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
*[[Conflict avoidance]] - non-attention or creating a total or partial separation of the combatants allowing limited interaction&lt;ref name="Montana"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick J. Montana|title=Management|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=New York|year=2008 |page=265|isbn=0-7641-3931-2|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Smoothing]] - stressing the achievement of harmony between disputants&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[Power (social and political)|Dominance or power intervention]] - the imposition of a solution by management at a higher level than the level of the conflict&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[Compromise]] - seeking a resolution satisfying at least part of each party's position&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;
*[[wikt:confrontation|Confrontation]] - a thorough and frank discussion of the sources and types of conflict and achieving a resolution that is in the best interest of the group, but that may be at the expense of one or all of the conflicting parties&lt;ref name="Montana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindred Greer, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVWpipM-Rnw&amp;list=UUGwuxdEeCf0TIA2RbPOj-8g Managing Conflict in Teams] (8-min video). ''[[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].'' Professor Lindred Greer gives tips for managing conflicts, which left unchecked, can go viral, hurt productivity, and create employee turnover.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trained conflict resolver can begin with an economical intervention, such as getting group members to clarify and reaffirm shared goals. If necessary, they move through a systematic series of interventions, such as testing the members' ability and willingness to compromise; resorting to confrontation, enforced counseling, and/or termination as last resorts.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Kaye 1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kenneth Kaye]]|title=Workplace Wars and How to End Them: Turning Personal Conflict into Productive Teamwork|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York|year=1994|isbn=0-8144-0215-1|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace conflict may include disputes between peers, supervisor-subordinate conflict or intergroup disputes. When disputes are not dealt with in a timely manner, greater efforts may be needed to solve them. [[Party-Directed Mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between colleagues or peers, especially those based on deep-seated interpersonal conflict or multicultural or multiethnic ones. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The [[Negotiated Performance Appraisal]] (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change===
Management is presumed to be guided by a vision of the future. The manager reflects in their decision-making activities the values of the organization as they have developed through time, from the original founder-owner to the present top-management personnel. In navigating a path between the values of the organization and its objectives and goals, management has expectations concerning the organization's effectiveness and efficiency and frequently initiates changes within the organization. On other occasions, changes in the external environment&amp;nbsp;— [[market demand]], [[technology]], or the political, social, or economic environment&amp;nbsp;— require making appropriate changes in the activities of the [[organization]]. The organization faces these demands for change through the men and women who make up its membership, since organizational change ultimately depends on the willingness of employees and others to change their attitudes, behavior, their degree of knowledge and skill, or a combination of these.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alfred W Clark|title= Experimenting with organizational life: the action research approach|publisher=Plenum Press|location= New York|year=1976 |pages=|isbn= 9780306308796|oclc=1976875|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence and conflict with colonists were also important causes of the decline of certain indigenous American populations since the 16th century.]]

The population figure of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] before the 1492 voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] have proven difficult to establish. Scholars rely on archaeological data and written records from settlers from Europe. Most scholars writing at the end of the 19th century estimated that the [[pre-Columbian]] population was as low as 10 million; by the end of the 20th century most scholars gravitated to a middle estimate of around 50 million, with some historians arguing for an estimate of 100 million or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPoAQRgkrOcC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=pre-Columbian+population+million&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-Columbian%20population%20million&amp;f=false |title=American colonies; Volume 1 of The Penguin history of the United States, History of the United States Series |first=Alan|last=Taylor |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |year=2002 |ISBN=9780142002100 |page=40 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with the Europeans led to the [[European colonization of the Americas]], in which millions of immigrants from Europe eventually settled in the Americas.

The population of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Eurasia]]n peoples in the Americas grew steadily, while the indigenous population plummeted. Eurasian diseases such as [[influenza]], [[bubonic plague]] and [[pneumonic plague]]s, [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], and [[malaria]] devastated the Native Americans, who did not have immunity to them. Conflict and outright warfare with Western European newcomers and other American tribes further reduced populations and disrupted traditional societies. The extent and causes of the decline have long been a subject of academic debate, along with [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#The question of colonization and genocide in the Americas|its characterization as a genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=David E.

==Population overview==
Given the fragmentary nature of the evidence, even semi-accurate pre-Columbian population figures are impossible to obtain. Scholars have varied widely on the estimated size of the indigenous populations prior to colonization and on the effects of [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name="HainesSteckela"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael R. Haines|author2=Richard H. Steckel|title=A Population History of North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPdgiysIVcgC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49666-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates are made by extrapolations from small bits of data. In 1976, geographer [[William Denevan]] used the existing estimates to derive a "consensus count" of about 54&amp;nbsp;million people. Nonetheless, more recent estimates still range widely.&lt;ref&gt;20th century estimates in Thornton, p.&amp;nbsp;22; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305224956/http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/kolp/HH345/PRE1492.HTM Denevan's consensus count]; [http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#America recent lower estimates]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028051334/http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/kolp/HH345/PRE1492.HTM |date=28 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using an estimate of approximately 37&amp;nbsp;million people in Mexico, Central and South America in 1492 (including 6&amp;nbsp;million in the [[Aztec Empire]], 5-10 million in the Mayan States, 11 million in what is now [[Brazil]], and 12 million in the [[Inca Empire]]), the lowest estimates give a death toll due from disease of 90% by the end of the 17th century (nine million people in 1650).&lt;ref name="Histoire"&gt;"La catastrophe démographique" (The Demographic Catastrophe"), ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin America would match its 15th-century population early in the 19th century; it numbered 17&amp;nbsp;million in 1800, 30&amp;nbsp;million in 1850, 61&amp;nbsp;million in 1900, 105&amp;nbsp;million in 1930, 218&amp;nbsp;million in 1960, 361&amp;nbsp;million in 1980, and 563&amp;nbsp;million in 2005.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt; In the last three decades of the 16th century, the population of present-day Mexico dropped to about one&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt; The [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population is today estimated at six million, which is about the same as at the end of the 15th century, according to some estimates.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;  In what is now Brazil, the indigenous population declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated four million to some 300,000.

Historian [[David Henige]] has argued that many population figures are the result of arbitrary formulas selectively applied to numbers from unreliable historical sources. He believes this is a weakness unrecognized by several contributors to the field, and insists there is not sufficient evidence to produce population numbers that have any real meaning. He characterizes the modern trend of high estimates as "pseudo-scientific number-crunching."  Henige does not advocate a low population estimate, but argues that the scanty and unreliable nature of the evidence renders broad estimates inevitably suspect, saying "high counters" (as he calls them) have been particularly flagrant in their misuse of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Henige, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many population studies acknowledge the inherent difficulties in producing reliable statistics, given the scarcity of hard data.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The population debate has often had [[ideological]] underpinnings.&lt;ref name="Krech"&gt;{{cite book| last = Krech III| first = Shepard| title = The ecological Indian: myth and history| url = https://books.google.com/?id=4SVRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82| edition = 1| year = 1999| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.| location = New York| isbn = 0-393-04755-5| pages = 81–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low estimates were sometimes reflective of European notions of cultural and [[racial superiority]]. Historian [[Francis Jennings]] argued, "Scholarly wisdom long held that Indians were so inferior in mind and works that they could not possibly have created or sustained large populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jennings|1993|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous population of the Americas in 1492 was not necessarily at a high point and may actually have been in decline in some areas. Indigenous populations in most areas of the Americas reached a low point by the early 20th century. In most cases, populations have since begun to climb.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. xvii, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Noble David Cook, a community of scholars have recently, albeit slowly, "been quietly accumulating piece by piece data on early epidemics in the Americas and their relation to subjugation of native peoples." They now believe that widespread epidemic disease, to which the natives had no prior exposure or resistance, was the primary cause of the massive population decline of the Native Americans.&lt;ref name="NDCook"&gt;Cook, Noble David. ''Born To Die''; Cambridge University Press ;1998; pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier explanations for the population decline of the American natives include the European immigrants' accounts of the brutal practices of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es, as recorded by the Spaniards themselves. This was applied through the [[encomienda]], which was a system ostensibly set up to protect people from warring tribes as well as to teach them the Spanish language and the [[Catholic religion]], but in practice was tantamount to [[serfdom]] and [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Junius P.

It took five years for the Taíno rebellion to be quelled by both the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|''Real Audiencia'']]—through diplomatic sabotage, and through the Indian auxiliaries fighting with the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| title = De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122| accessdate = 10 July 2010| date = July 2009| publisher = BiblioLife| isbn = 978-1-113-14760-8| page = 199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] personally eradicated the notion of the encomienda system as a use for slave labour, there were not enough Spanish to have caused such a large population decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David M.

Many Native Americans viewed their troubles in terms of religious or supernatural causes within their own belief systems.&lt;ref name="Guilmet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilmet |first1=George M |last2=Boyd |first2=Robert T |last3=Whited |first3=David L |last4=Thompson |first4=Nile |year=1991 |title=The Legacy of Introduced Disease: The Southern Coast Salish |journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1–32 |doi=10.17953/aicr.15.4.133g8x7135072136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Europeans and enslaved Africans arrived in the New World, bringing with them the infectious diseases of Europe and Africa, observers noted immense numbers of indigenous Americans began to die from these diseases. One reason this death toll was overlooked is that once introduced, the diseases raced ahead of European immigration in many areas. Disease killed a sizable portion of the populations before European written records were made. After the epidemics had already killed massive numbers of natives, many newer European immigrants assumed that there had always been relatively few indigenous peoples. The scope of the epidemics over the years was tremendous, killing millions of people—possibly in excess of 90% of the population in the hardest hit areas—and creating one of "the greatest human catastrophe in history, far exceeding even the disaster of the [[Black Death]] of medieval Europe",&lt;ref name="NDCook"/&gt; which had killed up to one-third of the people in Europe and Asia between 1347 and 1351.

One of the most devastating diseases was [[smallpox]], but other deadly diseases included [[typhus]], [[measles]], [[influenza]], [[bubonic plague]], [[cholera]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[mumps]], [[yellow fever]] and [[pertussis]], which were chronic in Eurasia.&lt;ref name="Horseman"&gt;''The First Horseman: Disease in Human History''; John Aberth; Pearson-Prentice Hall (2007); pp. 47–75(51)&lt;/ref&gt;

This transfer of disease between the Old and New Worlds was later studied as part of what has been labeled the "[[Columbian Exchange]]".

The epidemics had very different effects in different regions of the Americas. The most vulnerable groups were those with a relatively small population and few built-up immunities. Many island-based groups were annihilated. The [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] and [[Arawaks|Arawak]]s of the Caribbean nearly ceased to exist, as did the [[Beothuk]]s of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. While disease raged swiftly through the densely populated empires of [[Mesoamerica]], the more scattered populations of North America saw a slower spread.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Virulence and mortality===
[[virus|Viral]] and [[bacteria]]l diseases that kill victims before the illnesses spread to others tend to flare up and then die out. A more resilient disease would establish an [[Homeostasis|equilibrium]]; if its victims lived beyond [[infection]], the disease would spread further. The [[evolutionary]] process selects against quick lethality, with the most immediately fatal diseases being the most short-lived.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}   A similar evolutionary pressure acts upon victim populations, as those lacking genetic resistance to common diseases die and do not leave descendants, whereas those who are resistant procreate and pass resistant genes to their offspring. For example, in the first fifty years of the sixteenth century, an unusually strong strain{{clarify|reason=what does this mean. There appears to only be one type of spirochete that causes this. Not documented is "two types" of syphilis|date=August 2015}} of [[syphilis]] killed a high proportion of infected Europeans within a few months; over time, however, the disease has become much less virulent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thus both infectious diseases and populations tend to evolve towards an equilibrium in which the common diseases are non-symptomatic, mild or manageably chronic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  When a population that has been relatively isolated is exposed to new diseases, it has no resistance to the new diseases (the population is "biologically naive"). These people die at a much higher rate, resulting in what is known as a [[virgin soil epidemic|"virgin soil" epidemic]]. Before the European arrival, the Americas had been isolated from the Eurasian-African landmass. The peoples of the Old World had had thousands of years for their populations to accommodate to their common diseases.

The fact that all members of an immunologically naive population are exposed to a new disease simultaneously increases the fatalities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} In populations where the disease is endemic, generations of individuals acquired immunity; most adults had exposure to the disease at a young age. Because they were resistant to reinfection, they are able to care for individuals who caught the disease for the first time, including the next generation of children. With proper care, many of these "[[childhood diseases]]" are often survivable. In a naive population, all age groups are affected at once, leaving few or no healthy caregivers to nurse the sick. With no resistant individuals healthy enough to tend to the ill, a disease may have higher fatalities.

The natives of the Americas were faced with several new diseases at once creating a situation where some who successfully resisted one disease might die from another. Multiple simultaneous infections (e.g., smallpox and typhus at the same time) or in close succession (e.g., smallpox in an individual who was still weak from a recent bout of typhus) are more deadly than just the sum of the individual diseases. In this scenario, death rates can also be elevated by combinations of new and familiar diseases: smallpox in combination with American strains of [[yaws]], for example.

Other contributing factors:

* Native American medical treatments such as [[Sweat lodge|sweat baths]] and cold water immersion (practiced in some areas) weakened some patients and probably increased mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 208; Thornton, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Europeans brought many diseases with them because they had many more domesticated animals than the Native Americans. [[Domestication]] usually means close and frequent contact between animals and people, which allows diseases of domestic animals to migrate into the human population when the necessary mutations occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Jared Diamond]]| title = Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies| url = https://books.google.com/?id=kLKTa_OeoNIC&amp;pg=PA357| year = 1997| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn = 978-0-393-03891-0| page = 357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Eurasian landmass extends many thousands of miles along an east–west axis. Climate zones also extend for thousands of miles, which facilitated the spread of agriculture, domestication of animals, and the diseases associated with domestication. The Americas extend mainly north and south, which, according to the environmental determinist theory popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', meant that it was much harder for cultivated plant species, domesticated animals, and diseases to migrate.

===Biological warfare===

When Old World diseases were first carried to the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century, they spread throughout the southern and northern hemispheres, leaving the indigenous populations in near ruins.&lt;ref name="Horseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook1"&gt;Cook; pp. 205–16&lt;/ref&gt;  No evidence has been discovered that the earliest Spanish colonists and missionaries deliberately attempted to infect the American natives, and some effort was actually made to limit the devastating effects of disease before it killed off what remained of their forced slave labor under their [[encomienda]] system.&lt;ref name="Horseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook1"/&gt; The cattle introduced by the Spanish contaminated various water reserves which Native Americans dug in the fields to accumulate rain water. In response, the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] created public fountains and aqueducts to guarantee access to [[drinking water]].&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;  But when the Franciscans lost their privileges in 1572, many of these fountains were not guarded any more and deliberate [[well poisoning]] may have happened.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;  Although no proof of such poisoning has been found, some historians believe the decrease of the population correlates with the end of religious orders' control of the water.&lt;ref name=Histoire/&gt;

In the centuries that followed, accusations and discussions of biological warfare were common. Well-documented accounts of incidents involving both threats and acts of deliberate infection are very rare, but may have occurred more frequently than scholars have previously acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;''Empire of Fortune''; Francis Jennings; W. W. Norton &amp; Company; 1988; pp. 200, 447–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A. [http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html Biological Warfare in Eighteenth-Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403033815/http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html |date=3 April 2015 }};  The Journal of American History, Vol. 86, No. 4, March, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the instances likely went unreported, and it is possible that documents relating to such acts were deliberately destroyed,&lt;ref name="Fenn"/&gt; or sanitized.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cherokee Medicine, Colonial Germs: An Indigenous Nation's Fight Against Smallpox, 1518–1824''; Paul Kelton; University of Oklahoma Press; 2015; pp. 102–05&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 18th century, colonists had the knowledge and technology to attempt biological warfare with the smallpox virus. They well understood the concept of quarantine, and that contact with the sick could infect the healthy with smallpox, and those who survived the illness would not be infected again. Whether the threats were carried out, or how effective individual attempts were, is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Horseman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;''The Tainted Gift''; Barbara Alice Mann; ABC-CLIO; 2009; pp. 1–18&lt;/ref&gt;

One such threat was delivered by fur trader [[James McDougall (explorer)|James McDougall]], who is quoted as saying to a gathering of local chiefs, "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All I have to do is to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends."&lt;ref name="Stearn"&gt;''The Effect of Smallpox on the Destiny of the Amerindian''; Esther Wagner Stearn, Allen Edwin Stearn; University of Minnesota; 1945; pp. 13–20, 73–94, 97&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, another fur trader threatened [[Pawnee Indians]] that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them."  The Reverend [[Isaac McCoy]] was quoted in his ''History of Baptist Indian Missions'' as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War.&lt;ref name="Stearn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chardon"&gt;''Chardon's Journal at Fort Clark, 1834–1839''; Annie Heloise Abel; Books for Libraries Press; 1932; pp. 319, 394&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist and writer [[George Catlin]] observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them."&lt;ref name="Hopkins"&gt;''Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History''; Donald R. Hopkins; University of Chicago Press; 1983; pp. 270–71&lt;/ref&gt;  So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief [[Four Bears]] denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blaisdell ed., ''Great Speeches by Native Americans'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotting"&gt;''Rotting Face: Smallpox and the American Indian''; R. G. Robertson; Caxton Press; 2001 pp. 80–83; 298–312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present''; George C. Kohn; pp. 252–53&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Seven Years' War]], British militia took blankets from their smallpox hospital and gave them as gifts to two neutral [[Lenape]] Indian dignitaries during a peace settlement negotiation, according to the entry in the Captain's ledger, "To convey the Smallpox to the Indians".&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peckham"&gt;''Pontiac and the Indian Uprising''; Peckham, Howard H.; University of Chicago Press; 1947; pp. 170, 226–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;''Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754–1766''; Anderson, Fred; New York: Knopf; 2000; pp. 541–42, 809 n11; {{ISBN|0-375-40642-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following weeks, the high commander of the British forces in North America conspired with his Colonel to "Extirpate this Execreble Race" of Native Americans, writing, "Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them." His Colonel agreed to try.&lt;ref name="Fenn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peckham"/&gt; Most scholars have asserted that the [[1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic]] was "started among the tribes of the upper Missouri River by failure to quarantine steam boats on the river",&lt;ref name="Stearn"/&gt; and Captain Pratt of the ''St. Peter'' "was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offense criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences."&lt;ref name="Rotting"/&gt; However, some sources attribute the 1836–40 epidemic to the deliberate communication of smallpox to Native Americans, with historian Ann F. Ramenofsky writing, "''Variola Major'' can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem."&lt;ref&gt;''Vectors of Death: The Archaeology of European Contact''; University of New Mexico Press; 1987; pp.&amp;nbsp;147–48&lt;/ref&gt; Well into the 20th century, deliberate infection attacks continued as Brazilian settlers and miners transported infections intentionally to the native groups whose lands they coveted."&lt;ref name="Cook1"/&gt;

===Vaccination===

After [[Edward Jenner]]'s 1796 demonstration that the [[Smallpox vaccine|smallpox vaccination]] worked, the technique became better known and smallpox became less deadly in the United States and elsewhere. Many colonists and natives were vaccinated, although, in some cases, officials tried to vaccinate natives only to discover that the disease was too widespread to stop. At other times, trade demands led to broken quarantines. In other cases, natives refused vaccination because of suspicion of whites. The first international healthcare expedition in history was the [[Balmis Expedition|Balmis expedition]] which had the aim of vaccinating indigenous peoples against [[smallpox]] all along the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1803. In 1831, government officials vaccinated the [[Yankton Sioux]] at [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation|Sioux Agency]]&lt;!---this link is not exactly one-for-one overlap--&gt;. The [[Santee Sioux Reservation|Santee Sioux]] refused vaccination and many died.&lt;ref name=Krech /&gt;

==Depopulation from European Conquest==

===War and violence===
{{Main article|Spanish colonization of the Americas|American Indian Wars|Arauco War|Chichimeca War|Conquest of the Desert}}
[[File:Leutze, Emanuel — Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops — 1848.jpg|Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops|right|thumb|Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops by [[Emanuel Leutze]]]]
While epidemic disease was a leading factor of the population decline of the American indigenous peoples after 1492, there were other contributing factors, all of them related to European contact and colonization. One of these factors was warfare. According to demographer Russell Thornton, although many lives were lost in wars over the centuries, and war sometimes contributed to the near extinction of certain tribes, warfare and death by other violent means was a comparatively minor cause of overall native population decline.&lt;ref&gt;War not a major cause : Thornton, pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1894: "The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on Indians taxed and Indians not taxed in the United States (except Alaska)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWkUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA637|origyear=1894|year=1994|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement among scholars about how widespread warfare was in pre-Columbian America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = W. D. Rubinstein| title = Genocide: A History| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&amp;pg=PA12| year = 2004| publisher = Pearson Education| isbn = 978-0-582-50601-5| page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is general agreement that war became deadlier after the arrival of the Europeans and their firearms. The South or Central American infrastructure allowed for thousands of European [[conquistador]]s and tens of thousands of their [[Indian auxiliaries]] to attack the dominant indigenous civilization. Empires such as the [[Inca]]s depended on a highly centralized administration for the distribution of resources. Disruption caused by the war and the colonization hampered the traditional economy, and possibly led to shortages of food and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Government/|title= Inca Government |last= Cartwright |first= Mark |date= Oct 2015 |website= Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher= Knights of Vatican |access-date= 19 July 2017 |quote= Eventually 40,000 Incas would govern some 10 million subjects speaking over 30 different languages.

Some Spaniards objected to the [[encomienda]] system, notably [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who insisted that the Indians were humans with souls and rights. Due to many revolts and military encounters, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] helped relieve the strain on both the Indian laborers and the Spanish vanguards probing the Caribana for military and diplomatic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David M. Traboulay| title = Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA44| accessdate=11 July 2010 |year = 1994| publisher = University Press of America| isbn = 978-0-8191-9642-2| page = 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on [[New Laws]] were promulgated in Spain in 1542 to protect isolated natives, but the abuses in the Americas were never entirely or permanently abolished. The Spanish also employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/bolivia/29.htm Bolivia – Ethnic Groups].&lt;/ref&gt; and treated their subjects as something between slaves and [[serfdom|serfs]]. Serfs stayed to work the land; slaves were exported to the mines, where large numbers of them died. In other areas the Spaniards replaced the ruling Aztecs and Incas and divided the conquered lands among themselves ruling as the new [[feudal]] lords with often, but unsuccessful lobbying to the [[viceroys]] of the [[crown of Castile|Spanish crown]] to pay Tlaxcalan war demnities. The infamous [[Bandeirantes]] from [[São Paulo]], adventurers mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward in their search for Indian [[slavery|slaves]]. Serfdom existed as such in parts of Latin America well into the 19th century, past independence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Massacres===

Friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and Antonius Flávio Chesta (Tony Chesta) and other dissenting Spaniards from the colonial period described the manner in which the natives were treated by colonials. This has helped to create an image of the Spanish conquistadores as cruel in the extreme.{{citation needed|reason=sounds very original research|date=December 2014}}

Great revenues were drawn from [[Hispaniola]] so the advent of losing manpower{{clarify|reason="through war?" NATIVE manpower? Shouldn't it state that?|date=May 2013}} didn't benefit the Spanish crown. At best, the reinforcement of vanguards sent by the [[Council of the Indies]] to explore the Caribana country and gather information on alliances or hostilities was the main goal of the local viceroys and their [[adelantado]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| title = De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122| accessdate=14 July 2010 |date = July 2009| publisher = BiblioLife| isbn = 978-1-113-14760-8| page = 395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mass killings and [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] were not a significant factor in native depopulation, no mainstream scholar dismisses the sometimes humiliating circumstances now believed to be precipitated by [[civil disorder]] as well as Spanish cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| title = De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e7hU_LePtIQC| accessdate=10 July 2010| date = July 2009| publisher = BiblioLife| isbn = 978-1-113-14760-8| page = 198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Great Inca Rebellion | author=Jay O.

===Displacement and disruption===
{{main article|Indian removal|Trail of Tears}}

The populations of many Native American peoples were reduced by the common practice of intermarrying with Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/history/indianblood.htm Indian Mixed-Blood].&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Indian cultures that once thrived are extinct today, their descendants exist today in some of the bloodlines of the current inhabitants of the Americas.

A '''psychometric function''' is an inferential model applied in detection and discrimination tasks. It models the relationship between a given feature of a physical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], e.g. velocity, duration, brightness, weight etc., and forced-choice responses of a human test subject. The psychometric function therefore is a specific application of the [[generalized linear model]] (GLM) to [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] data. The probability of response is related to a linear combination of predictors by means of a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] [[link function]] (e.g. [[probit]], [[logit]], etc.). 

== Design ==
Depending on the number of choices, the psychophysical experimental paradigms classify as simple forced choice (also known as yes-no task), [[two-alternative forced choice]] (2AFC), and n-alternative forced choice. The number of alternatives in the experiment determine the lower asymptote of the function. 

== Example ==
A common example is [[visual acuity]] testing with an [[eye chart]]. The person sees symbols of different sizes (the size is the relevant physical stimulus parameter) and has to decide which symbol it is. Usually, there is one line on the chart where a subject can identify some, but not all, symbols. This is equal to the transition range of the psychometric function and the sensory threshold corresponds to visual acuity. (Strictly speaking, a typical optometric measurement does not exactly yield the sensory threshold due to biases in the standard procedure.)

== Plotting ==
Two different types of psychometric plots are in common use: 
# Plot the percentage of correct responses (or a similar value) displayed on the [[y-axis]] and the physical parameter on the [[x-axis]]. If the stimulus parameter is very far towards one end of its possible range, the person will always be able to respond correctly. Towards the other end of the range, the person never perceives the stimulus properly and therefore the probability of correct responses is at chance level. In between, there is a transition range where the subject has an above-chance rate of correct responses, but does not always respond correctly. The [[inflection point]] of the sigmoid function or the point at which the function reaches the middle between the chance level and 100% is usually taken as [[sensory threshold]]. 
# Plot the proportion of "yes" responses on the y-axis, and therefore create a sigmoidal shape covering the range [0, 1], rather than merely [0.5, 1]. This moves from a subject being certain that the stimulus was not of the particular type requested to certainty that it was. 
The second way of plotting psychometric functions is often preferable, as it is more easily amenable to principled quantitative analysis using tools such as [[probit]] analysis (fitting of cumulative Gaussian distributions). However, it also has important drawbacks. First, the threshold estimation is based only on p(yes), namely on "Hit" in Signal Detection Theory terminology. Second, and consequently, it is not bias free or criterion free. Third, the threshold is identified with the p(yes) = .5, which is just a conventional and arbitrary choice.

{{nihongo|'''''RapeLay'''''|レイプレイ|Reipurei}} is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[eroge]] video game made by [[Illusion Soft|Illusion]], released on April 21, 2006 in [[Japan]]. Compared to Illusion's previous games, the main story is shorter, it features an improved 3D engine and is mainly played through mouse control. The game centers on a male character who stalks and rapes a mother and her two daughters. Three years after its initial release, the game garnered international attention and controversy for its content. Yoshimura Tei was arrested for obscenity charges.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Similar to 2004 video game ''[[The Guy Game]]'', the game was subsequently banned in several countries. This game could be only downloaded digitally in North America.

==Gameplay==
''RapeLay'' is played from the perspective of a ''[[Chikan (body contact)|chikan]]'' named Masaya Kimura, who [[stalking|stalks]] and subsequently [[rape]]s the Kiryuu family (a mother and her two daughters).

==Plot==

===Story===
In story mode, the player rapes the three women in the order of Manaka, Yuuko, and Aoi. The player starts off in the train station. Upon entering the train, the main character [[Frotteurism|gropes]] the woman the main character is currently in the train with. After the main character finishes raping all three women, the players has the option of free play scenes.&lt;ref name=walkthru&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jsemts.twbbs.org/view_en_error_rapelay_ZmV1ZXJkcmFjaGUncyBDb21waWxhdGlvbiBSYXBlTGF5IFdhbGt0aHJ1IENvbGxlY3Rpb24gRmluYWwgMTAwJS50eHQ=.html |title=feuerdrache's Compilation RapeLay Walkthru Collection Final 100% |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=JSEMTS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414161138/http://jsemts.twbbs.org/view_en_error_rapelay_ZmV1ZXJkcmFjaGUncyBDb21waWxhdGlvbiBSYXBlTGF5IFdhbGt0aHJ1IENvbGxlY3Rpb24gRmluYWwgMTAwJS50eHQ%3D.html |archivedate=April 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being caught by Aoi groping a woman on a [[Rapid transit|subway train]], Masaya Kimura is arrested by authorities. On the morning of the next day, Aoi and her young sister Manaka help their mother Yuuko find a wallet she lost around their home while talking about the incident the previous day. Unknown to them, Kimura secretly eavesdrops on their conversation while waiting outside their house. It is revealed here that his father, a well known influential/important politician, managed to release him from custody. When Kimura discovers that Yuuko is widowed, he decided to put his revenge plan into action.

Kimura first starts with the youngest, Manaka. Following her to the subway, he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, he traps her in a public bathroom and rapes her, taking pictures of her semen-covered naked body with his mobile phone. Kimura instructs Manaka to feign sickness the next day and stay in her room.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

[[File:RapeLay screenshot 01.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of ''Chikan'' mode, where the player gropes the final victim, Aoi Kiryu, on the subway.]]

The next day he follows Yuuko, the mother, from her house to the train station where he fondles her on the train. Kimura follows her to the city park. As per his plan, Manaka calls Yuuko on her mobile phone, telling her that she is in the bushes at the park. When Yuuko walks towards the bushes, Kimura ambushes her, ties her up and rapes her in the park. He takes pictures of her semen-covered naked body before handing her over to his gang of henchmen on the side, who detain her for him.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

The third day he follows Aoi, the eldest daughter, to the train station and shows her the photo of her tied up mother. Shocked, she can only follow his orders as he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, she asks Kimura why he is doing this, at which point she remembers he is the same groper whom she reported for molesting a woman. Getting in a vehicle, Kimura and his henchmen take Aoi to a hotel owned by his family. He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and takes photos after withdrawing.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

After having his way with Aoi, Yuuko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all 3 captured, Kimura reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He considers this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind and that they are all there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with the ominous title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

====Endings====

The game is open-ended and there are two possible outcomes to the game where the main character dies.

* '''Black Ending'''&lt;ref name="rapelaystrategy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusion.jp/support/rapelay/index.html|title=RapeLay Strategy Page (レイプレイ 攻略ページ)|publisher=[[Illusion Soft]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2012-01-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420034549/http://www.illusion.jp/support/rapelay/index.html|archivedate=2009-04-20|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Kimura impregnates either Manaka or Aoi and decides to keep the child. After a certain number of days afterwards, Kimura falls onto the train tracks and is killed by a moving train. This ending is avoidable when a girl gets pregnant, at some point, the game asks the player whether he/she wishes the girl to have an abortion. If the player selects "no", the black ending will play. 
* '''Red ending'''&lt;ref name="rapelaystrategy" /&gt; – If the [[cowgirl position]] is used with Aoi before she breaks, the game will shift onto a scene of the same cowgirl session where Aoi brandishes a knife and stabs Kimura many times while hysterically laughing.

Yūko also has the largest breasts and optionally can wear glasses to make her produce virgin/geek sound effects. Voiced by Akari Tomiyama (credited as "Kaori").

==Reception and controversy==
Critics of violent game imagery, such as British Member of Parliament [[Keith Vaz]], have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated, and Yoshimura Tei was arrested and charged with obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arendt |first=Susan |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/uk-politician-c.html |title=UK Politician Claims Games Feature Virtual Rape |accessdate=2008-03-25 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2008-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000826/http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/uk-politician-c.html |archive-date=2008-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} ''RapeLay'' in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as being one of the rape games purchasable on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]], despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold.

{{Confucianism|Fundamental}}
{{Love sidebar|cultural}}
'''''Ren''''' ({{zh|c=仁}}) is the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] virtue denoting the good feeling a virtuous human experiences when being [[altruistic]]. ''Ren'' is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children.  It is considered the outward expression of Confucian ideals.

[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]], one of the [[Four Sages]], once asked his master to describe the rules of ''ren''. Confucius replied, "One should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper."&lt;ref&gt;Analects 12:1&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also defined ''ren'' in the following way: "wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others."&lt;ref&gt;Analects 6:30 http://ctext.org/analects/yong-ye/zh?en=on&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also said, "''Ren'' is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it." ''Ren'' is close to man and never leaves him.&lt;ref&gt;(Do-Dinh 107)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation of the Chinese character ==
The single [[Hanzi|logogram]] for ''ren'' is a composite of two distinct common [[hanzi]], 人 (Man, a man, a person ) and 二 (two), with 人 assuming its common form inside another character, to which various interpretations have been assigned. One often hears that ''ren'' means "how two people should treat one another". While such folk etymologies are common in discussions of Chinese characters, they often are as misleading as they are entertaining. In the case of ''ren'' - usually translated as "benevolence" or "humaneness" - Humaneness is Human-ness, the essence of being human. For Confucius the interaction of completely dependent infant and caring parent is the most emotionally charged human interaction, “To love a thing means wanting it to live…”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Analects]] XII.10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tao|Way]] of humaneness is human interaction and through shared experience knowing one’s family. “Fan Chi asked about humaneness. The Master said it is loving people. Fan Chi asked about wisdom. The Master said it is knowing people”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Analects]] XII.22&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, human love and interaction is the source of humaneness, the source of the human self. Another common interpretation of the graphical elements is Man or a man connecting [[Tian|Heaven]] and [[Tianxia|Earth]].

人+二=仁 (Rén) man on left two on right, the relationship between two human beings, means humanity, benevolence, seed. Originally the character was just written as丨二 representing [[Yin and yang|yin yang]], the vertical line is yang (male, penis, heaven, odd numbers), the two horizontal lines are yin (female, vagina, earth, even numbers), 仁 is the seed and core of everything. The character 人 (man, rén) and 仁 have the same pronunciation. When a human is unable to be humane, he or she does not qualify to be a human but an animal. But when a human is able to be humane, he or she qualifies to be a human. For example, when Buddhism was first introduced to China in the Han Dynasty the Chinese people translated the Buddha's name into "able to be human" or someone with ”ability and humanity" (能人，能仁) because Confucius's teachings and Buddha's teachings are "one to two, two to one."

Pre-imperial epigraphic sources testify to alternative writings of the same character: 忎 (given as a variant of 仁 in the [[Shuowen]] dictionary), 身 with 心 below, and the latter compound with 人 on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Behr, Wolfgang. "In the Interstices of Representation: Ludic Writing and the Locus of Polysemy in the Chinese Sign".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of ''li'', ''ren'', and ''yi''==
The principle of ''ren'' is related to the concepts of [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']] and [[Yi (Confucianism)|''yi'']].  ''Li'' is often translated as "[[ritual]]" while ''yi'' is often translated as "[[righteousness]]".  These three interrelated terms deal with agency as Confucians conceive it.  ''Li'' is the action which has been deemed appropriate by society, ''yi'' is the action that is indeed correct, while ''ren'' deals with the relationship between the agent and object of the action.  Often ''li'' and ''yi'' are the same; however, that is not always the case.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}

''Li'' is the outward expression of Confucian ideals, while ''ren'' is both the inward and outward expressions of those same ideals. According to Hopfe and Woodward: "Basically, ''li'' seems to mean 'the course of life as it is intended to go'. ''Li'' also has religious and social connotations. When a society lives by ''li'', it moves smoothly: men and women respect their elders and superiors; the proper rituals and ceremonies are performed; everything and everyone is in its proper place."&lt;ref&gt;(Hopfe 180-181)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of ''ren'' ==
''Ren'' relies heavily on the relationships between two people, but at the same time encompasses much more than that. It represents an inner development towards an altruistic goal, while simultaneously realizing that one is never alone, and that everyone has these relationships to fall back on, being a member of a family, the state, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Chi-Yun 34)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ren'' is not a concept that is learned; it is innate, that is to say, everyone is born with the sense of ''ren''. Confucius believed that the key to long-lasting integrity was to constantly think, since the world is continually changing at a rapid pace.

There have been a variety of definitions for the term ''ren''. ''Ren'' has been translated as "benevolence", "perfect virtue", "goodness" or even "human-heartedness".&lt;ref&gt;(Hopfe 181)&lt;/ref&gt; When asked, Confucius defined it by the ordinary Chinese word for love, ''ai'', saying that it meant to "love others".&lt;ref&gt;(Dubs 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ren'' also has a political dimension. Confucianism says that if the ruler lacks ''ren'', it will be difficult for his subjects to behave humanely. ''Ren'' is the basis of Confucian political theory; the ruler is exhorted to refrain from acting inhumanely towards his subjects. An inhumane ruler runs the risk of losing the [[Mandate of Heaven]] or, in other words, the right to rule. A ruler lacking such a mandate need not be obeyed, but a ruler who reigns humanely and takes care of the people is to be obeyed, for the benevolence of his dominion shows that he has been mandated by heaven. Confucius himself had little to say on the active will of the people, though he believed the ruler should definitely pay attention to the wants and needs of the people and take good care of them. Mencius, however, did state that the people's opinion on certain weighty matters should be polled.

''Ren'' also includes traits that are a part of being righteous, such as ''[[hsin]]'', meaning to make one's words compliment one's actions; [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']], which means to properly participate in everyday rituals; ''ching'', or "seriousness"; and ''yi'', which means right action. When all these qualities are present, then one can truly be identified as a ''[[junzi]]'' (君子), or "superior man," which means a morally superior human being. Confucians basically held the view that government should be run by ''junzi'' who concentrate solely on the welfare of the people they govern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41578">'''Secular morality''' is the aspect of philosophy that deals with [[morality]] outside of religious traditions. Modern examples include [[humanism]], [[freethinking]], and most versions of [[consequentialism]]. Additional philosophies with ancient roots include those such as [[skepticism]] and [[virtue ethics]]. [[Greg M. Epstein]] also states that, "much of ancient Far Eastern thought is deeply concerned with human goodness without placing much if any stock in the importance of gods or spirits."&lt;ref name=Epstein2010&gt;

A variety of positions are apparent regarding the relationship between [[religion and morality]]. Some believe that religion is necessary as a guide to a moral life. According to some, this idea has been with us for nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|5}} Others suggest this idea goes back at least 2,600 years as exemplified in Psalm 14 of the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Gunkel, ''Die Psalmen'' (61986), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; According to others, the idea goes back as far as 4,000 years, with the ancient Egyptians' [[Maat#42 Negative Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|42 Principles of Ma'at]].&lt;ref name=42prinmaat&gt;{{cite web
  |last1=Richard

  |website=Liberal America
  |accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others eschew the idea that religion is required to provide a guide to right and wrong behavior. The ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' however states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other".&lt;ref name=Childress/&gt;{{rp|401}} Some believe that religions provide poor guides to moral behavior. Various commentators, such as [[Richard Dawkins]] (''[[The God Delusion]]''), [[Sam Harris]] (''[[The End of Faith]]'') and [[Christopher Hitchens]] (''[[God Is Not Great]]'') are among those who have asserted this view.

== Secular moral frameworks ==

=== Consequentialism ===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}
{{See also|Utilitarianism}}
"Consequentialists", as described by [[Peter Singer]], "start not with moral rules, but with goals. They assess actions by the extent to which they further those goals."&lt;ref name=Singer2010&gt;
{{cite book 
  |title= Practical Ethics
  |edition= Second
  |last= Singer|first= Peter
  |year= 2010
  |publisher= Cambridge University Press
  |location= New York
  |isbn= 978-0-521-43971-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Singer also notes that [[utilitarianism]] is "the best-known, though not the only, consequentialist theory."&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{rp|3}} Consequentialism is the class of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] holding that the [[wikt:consequence|consequences]] of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. In his 2010 book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] describes a utilitarian [[science of morality]].

=== Freethought ===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] viewpoint that holds that [[opinion]]s should be formed on the basis of [[science]], [[logic]], and [[reason]], and should not be influenced by [[authority]], [[tradition]], or other [[dogma]]s. Freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of [[authority]], [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sectarianism]], [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s.

=== Secular humanism ===
{{Main|Secular humanism}}
Secular humanism focuses on the way human beings can lead [[Happiness|happy]] and functional lives.   It posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or [[God]], it neither assumes humans to be inherently [[Good and evil|evil]] or innately [[Good and evil|good]], nor presents humans as "above nature" or superior to it. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions.  Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

==Positions on religion and morality==
{{See also|Ethics in religion|Secular ethics}}
The subject of secular morality has been discussed by prominent secular scholars as well as popular culture-based [[atheism|atheist]] and [[antireligion|anti-religious]] writers.

=== "Morality does not require religious tenets" ===
According to Greg Epstein, "the idea that we can't be 'good without God'&amp;thinsp;" has been with us for nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|5}} Others suggest this idea goes back further; for example in [[Psalm 14]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] which according to [[Hermann Gunkel]] date to the exile period of approximately 580 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Gunkel, ''Die Psalmen'' (61986), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; It states, "The fool says in his heart, 'there is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good ... not even one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm+14/|title= Psalm 14 - ESVBible.org|author= ESVBible.org|work= |publisher= Crossway|accessdate= 4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] famously declared [[God is Dead]] but also warned "When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident...Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer|date=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This idea is still present today. "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name=Dixon2008&gt;

Lewis]] made the argument in his popular book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' that if a supernatural, objective standard of right and wrong does not exist outside of the natural world, then right and wrong becomes mired in the [[is-ought problem]]. Thus, he wrote, preferences for one moral standard over another become as inherently indefensible and arbitrary as preferring a certain flavor of food over another or choosing to drive on a certain side of a road.&lt;ref name=Lewis2001&gt;

Proponents of theism argue that without a God or gods it is impossible to ''justify'' moral behavior on metaphysical grounds and thus to make a coherent case for abiding by moral standards. C. S. Lewis makes such an argument in ''Mere Christianity''. [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], a political author and commentator with [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s [[Hoover Institution]], has commented that, if an inner moral conscience is just another adaptive or evolved feeling in the human mind like simple emotional urges, then no inherent reason exists to consider morality as over and above other urges.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;
According to Thomas Dixon, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name=Dixon2008/&gt;

=== "Morality does not rely on religion" ===
{{Quote|"A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death."| [[Albert Einstein]], "Religion and Science," New York Times Magazine, 1930}}

Various commentators have stated that morality does not require religion as a guide. ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' states that, "it is not hard to imagine a society of people that has no religion but has a morality, as well as a legal system, just because it says that people cannot live together without rules against killing, etc., and that it is not desirable for these all to be legally enforced. There have also certainly been people who have had a morality but no religious beliefs."&lt;ref name=Childress&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} Williams also argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{rp|64–65}}

[[Socrates]]' "[[Euthyphro dilemma]]" is often considered one of the earliest refutations of the idea that morality requires religion. This line of reasoning is described by Peter Singer:

{{quote|"Some theists say that ethics cannot do without religion because the very meaning of 'good' is nothing other than 'what God approves'. Plato refuted a similar claim more than two thousand years ago by arguing that if the gods approve of some actions it must be because those actions are good, in which case it cannot be the gods' approval that makes them good. The alternative view makes divine approval entirely arbitrary: if the gods had happened to approve of torture and disapprove of helping our neighbors, torture would have been good and helping our neighbors bad. Some modern theists have attempted to extricate themselves from this type of dilemma by maintaining that God is good and so could not possibly approve of torture; but these theists are caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{rp|3–4}}}}

[[Greg Epstein]], a [[Secular humanism|Humanist]] [[chaplain]] at [[Harvard University]], dismisses the question of whether God is needed to be good "because that question does not need to be answered—it needs to be rejected outright," adding, "To suggest that one ''can't'' be good without belief in God is not just an opinion&amp;nbsp;... it is a prejudice. It may even be discrimination."&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|ix}} This is in line with the ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' which states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref name=Childress/&gt;{{rp|401}} Others share this view. Singer states that morality "is not something intelligible only in the context of religion".&lt;ref name=Singer2010/&gt;{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Atheistic philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] stated that "there is nothing to stop atheists believing in morality, a meaning for life, or human goodness. Atheism is only intrinsically negative when it comes to belief about God. It is as capable of a positive view of other aspects of life as any other belief."&lt;ref name=Baggini&gt;{{cite book |title= Atheism: A Very Short Introduction|last= Baggini|first= Julian|year= 2003|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280424-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} He also states that "Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him.&lt;!-- "Him" is not capitalized in Baggini's work --&gt; That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse [[Divine command theory|divine law]] and punishment with right and wrong.&lt;ref name=Baggini/&gt;{{rp|37}}

Popular atheist author and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] remarked on the program ''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'':
{{quote|"I think our knowledge of right and wrong is innate in us. Religion gets its morality from humans. We know that we can't get along if we permit perjury, theft, murder, rape, all societies at all times, well before the advent of monarchies and certainly, have forbidden it...

=== "Religion is a poor moral guide" ===
Popular atheist author and biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that are considered today to be morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. Dawkins insists that, since Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Bible have changed over the span of history so that what was formerly seen as permissible is now seen as impermissible, it is intellectually dishonest for them to believe theism provides an absolute moral foundation apart from secular intuition. In addition, he argued that since Christians and other religious groups do not acknowledge the binding authority of all parts of their holy texts (e.g., The books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] state that those who work on the Sabbath&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bible.cc/exodus/31-15.htm|title= Exodus 31:15|author= Biblos.com|date= 2004–2011|work= |publisher= Biblos.com|accessdate= 6 September 2012}} Exodus 35:2 is similarly worded.&lt;/ref&gt; and those caught performing acts of homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bible.cc/leviticus/20-13.htm|title= Leviticus 20:13|author= Biblos.com|date= 2004–2011|work= |publisher= Biblos.com|accessdate= 6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, were to be put to death.), they are already capable of distinguishing "right" from "wrong."&lt;ref&gt;

The well-known passage from [[Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', "If God is dead, all is permitted,"&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|63}} suggests that non-believers would not hold moral lives without the possibility of punishment by a God. [[Greg M. Epstein]] notes a similar theme in reverse. Famous apologies by Christians who have "sinned" (such as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Swaggart]]) "must embolden some who take enormous risks for the thrill of a little immoral behavior: their Lord will forgive them, if they only ask nicely enough when—or if—they are eventually caught. If you're going to do something naughty, you're going to do it, and all the theology in the world isn't going to stop you."&lt;ref name=Epstein2010/&gt;{{rp|115–116}} Some survey and sociological literature suggests that theists do no better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).{{Ref label|E|e|none}}

=== Other views ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Some non-religious [[nihilism|nihilistic]] and [[existentialism|existentialist]] thinkers have affirmed the prominent theistic position that the existence of the personal God of theism is linked to the existence of an objective moral standard, asserting that questions of right and wrong inherently have no meaning and, thus, any notions of morality are nothing but an anthropogenic fantasy. Agnostic author and [[Absurdism|Absurdist]] philosopher [[Albert Camus]] discussed the issue of what he saw as the universe's indifference towards humankind and the meaninglessness of life in his prominent novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which the [[protagonist]] accepts [[capital punishment|death via execution]] without sadness or feelings of injustice. In his philosophical work, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', Camus argues that human beings must choose to live defiantly in spite of their longing for purpose or direction and the apparent lack of evidence for God or moral imperatives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The atheistic existentialist philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] proposed that the individual must create his own [[existence precedes essence|essence]] and therefore must freely and independently create his own subjective moral standards by which to live.

Cases can also be seen in nature of animals exhibiting behavior we might classify as "moral" without religious directives to guide them.

'''Self-envy''' is a psychoanalytic concept developed by [[Rafael E. López-Corvo|Rafael López-Corvo]] who argues that it is crucial for the understanding of disorders of the self that are manifested in addictions, acting out, and inhibition of creativity. This concept is based on the use of [[object relations theory]], that many [[psychoanalysts]] view as a fundamental instrument for examining the architecture of the internal world  that describes behavior as influenced by the multiple interactions of early representations of self and other that operate in our inner selves. 

Self-envy is produced by 'child part self-objects', self representations from early development that remain split off from the self and harbor destructive and envious feelings toward the creative aspects of the self and results from direct aggressive attacks by these childhood self-objects against the part of the self identified with a harmonious mother-father or parent-sibling relationship. 

The internal dynamics of self-envy cause intense [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] conflict, dissociation, and disturbances of the self, all of which underlie severe [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]], such as repetitive destructive behavior, and even the living of seemingly ''normal'' but constricted lives. [[Rafael E. López-Corvo|López-Corvo]] suggests that the psychoanalytic interpretation of such patients, for whom one part of the self is ruthlessly pitted against another, should address directly the phenomenon of a war within the internal self.

W.C.M. Scott first used this term in 1975 in his article "Remembering sleep and dreaming: self-envy and envy of dreams and dreaming" in the International Review of Psychoanalysis, Vol. 2/3 (1975): 333-354. López-Corvo credits Scott in his paper "About Interpretation of Self-Envy" in the same journal (1992): 73, 719, and also in his book ''Self-Envy: Therapy and the Divided Inner World'', which also draws from Melanie Klein, Wilfred Bion, and other object-relations theorists in order to develop its more extended argument.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9072">In [[psychophysics]], '''sensory threshold''' is the weakest [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] that an organism can detect. Unless otherwise indicated, it is usually defined as the weakest stimulus that can be detected half the time, for example, as indicated by a point on a probability curve.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christopher U. M.|title=Biology of Sensory Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRHYqVumK6gC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=20 November 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-69438-1|pages=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods have been developed to measure thresholds in any of the senses.

The first systematic studies to determine sensory thresholds were conducted by [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]], a physiologist and pioneer of experimental psychology at the [[Leipzig University]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/thresholds.html|title=Sensation: Thresholds and Psychophysics|website=users.ipfw.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experiments were intended to determine the absolute and difference, or differential, thresholds. Weber was able to define absolute and difference threshold statistically which lead to the establishment of Weber’s Law and the concept of [[Just-noticeable difference|just noticeable difference]] to describe threshold perception of stimuli.

Following Weber’s work, [[Gustav Fechner]], a pioneer of [[psychophysics]], studied the relationship between the physical intensity of a stimulus and the psychologically perceived intensity of the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swets|first=John A.|date=1961-07-21|title=Is There a Sensory Threshold?|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/134/3473/168|journal=Science|language=en|volume=134|issue=3473|pages=168–177|doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.168|issn=0036-8075|pmid=13774294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the measured intensity of sound waves with the perceived loudness, Fechner concluded that the intensity of a stimulus changes in proportion to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. His findings would lead to the creation of the [[decibel]] scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Several different sensory thresholds have been defined;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ttktamop.elte.hu/online-tananyagok/physiology_practical/apas03.html|title=Determination of sensory thresholds|website=ttktamop.elte.hu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Absolute threshold]]:''' the lowest level at which a stimulus can be detected.
*'''Recognition threshold:''' the level at which a stimulus can not only be detected but also recognised.
*'''[[Just noticeable difference|Differential threshold]]:''' the level at which an increase in a detected stimulus can be perceived.
*'''Terminal threshold:''' the level beyond which a stimulus is no longer detected.
'''Measuring and Testing Sensory Thresholds'''

Defining and measuring sensory thresholds requires setting the sensitivity limit such that the perception observations lead to the absolute threshold. The level of sensitivity is usually assumed to be constant in determining the threshold limit. There are three common methods used to determine sensory thresholds:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# '''Method of Limits:''' In the first step, the subject is stimulated by strong, easily detectable stimuli that are decreased stepwise (descending sequence) until he/she cannot detect the stimulus. Then another stimulation sequence is applied called ascending sequence. In this sequence, stimulus intensity increases from subthreshold to easily detectable. Both sequences are repeated several times. This yields several momentary threshold values. In the following step, mean values are calculated for ascending and descending sequences separately. The mean value will be lower for descending sequences. In case of audiometry, the difference of the means in case of ascending vs. descending sequences has a diagnostic importance. In the final step, average of the previously calculated means will result the absolute threshold.
# '''Method of constant stimuli:''' Stimuli of varying intensities are presented in random order to a subject. Intensities involve stimuli which are surely subthreshold and stimuli which are surely supra-threshold. For the creation of the series, the approximate threshold judged by a simpler method (i.e.: by the method of limits). The random sequences are presented to the subject several times. The strength of the stimulus, perceived in more than half of the presentations will be taken as the threshold.
# '''Adaptive method:''' Stimulation starts with a surely supra-threshold stimulus; then further stimuli are given with an intensity decreased in previously-defined steps. The series is stopped when the stimulus strength become subthreshold (this is called the turn phenomena). Then the step is halved and the stimulation is repeated, but now with increasing intensities, until the subject perceives the sound again. This process is repeated several times, until the step size reaches the preset minimal value. With this method, the threshold value can be delineated very accurately. The initial size of the step can be selected depending on the expected accuracy.
In measuring sensory threshold, noise must be accounted for.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Theodore E|last2=Lasley|first2=D J|year=1986|title=Visual sensitivity|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=37|pages=495–521|doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.37.020186.002431|issn=0066-4308|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Signal-to-noise ratio|Signal noise]] is defined as the presence of extra, unwanted energy in the observational system which obscures the information of interest. As the measurements come closer to the absolute threshold, the variability of the noise increases causing the threshold to be obscured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Different types of internal and external noise include excess stimuli, nervous system over- or under-stimulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classes.kumc.edu/sah/resources/sensory_processing/learning_opportunities/concepts/sp_concepts_main.htm#neuro|title=Sensory Processing - Introduction to Concepts|website=classes.kumc.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conditions that falsely stimulate nerves in the absence of external stimuli.

A universal absolute threshold is difficult to define a standard because of the variability of the measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meddis|first=Ray|last2=Lecluyse|first2=Wendy|year=2011|title=The psychophysics of absolute threshold and signal duration: A probabilistic approach|url=|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=129|issue=5|pages=3153–3165|doi=10.1121/1.3569712|issn=0001-4966|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sensation occurs at the physical nerves, there can be reasons why it is not consistent.

Similarly, psychological factors can affect perception of physical sensation. Mental state, memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thurgood|first=Clementine|last2=Whitfield|first2=T W A|last3=Patterson|year=2011|title=Towards a visual recognition threshold: New instrument shows humans identify animals with only 1 ms of visual exposure|url=|journal=Vision Research|volume=51|pages=1966–1971|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.07.008|issn=0042-6989|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; mental illness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Georg|last2=Gattaz|first2=Wagner F|year=1993|title=Pain perception threshold in major depression|url=|journal=Biological Psychiatry|publisher=Elsevier Science|volume=34|pages=687–689|doi=10.1016/0006-3223(93)90041-B|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; fatigue, and other factors can alter perception.

'''Aviation use'''.  When related to motion in any of the possible six degrees of freedom (6-DoF), the fact that sensory
thresholds exist is why it is essential that aircraft have blind-flying instruments.  Sustained flight in cloud is not possible by `seat-of-the-pants' cues alone since errors build up due to aircraft movements below the pilot's sensory threshold,
ultimately leading to loss of control. 
* In flight simulators with motion platforms, the motion sensory thresholds are utilised in the technique known as `acceleration-onset cueing'.  This is where a motion platform, having made the initial acceleration that is sensed by the simulator crew, the platform is re-set to approximately its neutral position by being moved at a rate below the sensory threshold and is then ready to respond to the next acceleration demanded by the simulator computer.

This format is also known as the [[Argus finals system]].

In either variant, the winners of the first two games would then compete for the league championship. Some lower-level leagues use a Shaughnessy playoff for purposes of [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the next-higher league.

Another variant of the Shaughnessy system exempts a certain number of top teams from the playoffs (usually one to three teams) and instead involves the next four teams in the league standings. This variation is almost always used by a lower-level league for promotion purposes. Typically, the exempted top finishers earn automatic promotion and the playoffs determine the final promotion place.

==History and usage==

===North America===
The Shaughnessy playoff system was implemented in 1933 by [[Frank Shaughnessy]], the [[general manager]] of the [[Montreal Royals]] [[minor league]] [[baseball]] team of the [[International League]]. After its successful implementation by the International League, the popularity of the new postseason format spread to other leagues in other sports, including the [[All-America Football Conference]] (which used the Shaughnessy playoff system in the league's last season of existence)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-07-035.pdf All-America Football Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119163642/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-07-035.pdf |date=2013-01-19 }} - Stan Grosshandler, Professional Football Researchers Association (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and the minor American football league [[American Association (football)|American Association]], which used the format in five of its championship seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-02-398.pdf Nothing Minor About It: The American Association/AFL of 1936-1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326042625/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-02-398.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }} - Bob Gill, Pro Football Researchers Association (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The format has also been widely used in minor league baseball on all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fieldofdreams.sabr.org/book/1950sThreeI-MWL.pdf The Rise of the Midwest League and the Decline of the Three-I League] - Tim Rask, Society for American Baseball Research (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Original Six era]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (1942-1967), the circuit adopted a Shaughnessy playoff system (first place ''vs.'' third place and second place ''vs.'' fourth place) in which the paired teams played in a [[playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-four-of-seven-games series]] with the winners advancing to the [[Stanley Cup|Stanley Cup championship]] round. A Shaughnessy-style format is used in today's NHL in an entirely different context—since [[61st National Hockey League All-Star Game|2016]], the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] has been contested as a four-team knockout tournament, with each team drawn exclusively from one of the league's four divisions. Each "game" is played in a three-on-three format (i.e., three skaters and one goaltender, unless affected by penalties) over a single 20-minute period (the same length of a period in a regular NHL game).

Since its first season in [[2013 National Women's Soccer League season|2013]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]] has used a Shaughnessy playoff (using 1–4 and 2–3 semifinal pairings)  to determine its champion.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball]], one [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conference uses a Shaughnessy playoff for its postseason tournaments for men and women. The [[Ivy League]] launched postseason tournaments for both sexes in the 2016–17 season; the top four teams in the regular-season conference standings advance to a Shaughnessy tournament (also using 1–4 and 2–3 semifinal pairings) at a predetermined site. The winners receive the Ivies' automatic berths in the NCAA [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|men's]] and [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|women's]] tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |title=The Ivy League Adds Men's, Women's Basketball Tournaments Beginning in 2017 |publisher=Ivy League |date=March 10, 2016 |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311041901/http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |archivedate=March 11, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
More recently, the Shaughnessy playoff system has been adopted outside of North America. In [[Rugby union in England|English]] [[rugby union]], the format is currently used to determine the winner of the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/premiership/competitions/aviva_premiership_rugby.php#.UaOZOmTcrC4 |title=Aviva Premiership Rugby |publisher=Premiership Rugby Limited |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[2012–13 RFU Championship|2012–13]] through to [[2016–17 RFU Championship|2016–17]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/news/play-off-system-removed-from-greene-king-ipa-championship-from-next-season/ |title=Play-off system removed from Greene King IPA Championship from next season |publisher=Premiership Rugby Limited |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also used in the second-level [[RFU Championship]] to determine the team to be promoted to the Premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/18102034 |title=Championship: RFU to abolish play-off pool stages |publisher=''BBC Sport'' |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Premiership and Championship formats differ only in the number of games contested—the Premiership playoff uses one-off matches, while all matches in the Championship playoff were two-legged. The [[Premier 15s]], launched in autumn 2017 as the new top flight of English women's rugby, uses the same playoff format as the Premiership. The Celtic League in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], now known as [[Pro14]], adopted a system identical to that of the Premiership starting in [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10]], the season before that league expanded to include two teams from [[Italy]]. The Shaughnessy system was replaced by a six-team playoff when two [[South Africa]]n sides joined the league in [[2017–18 Pro14|2017–18]], bringing it to its current 14-team roster.

In [[National Rugby League (France)|French rugby union]], a Shaughnessy-style playoff was used to determine the second of two promotion spots in the second-tier [[Rugby Pro D2]] through the 2016–17 season, with the teams involved being the second- through fifth-placed teams, as the first-place team earned automatic promotion to the [[Top 14]]. This system has been abandoned for 2017–18 and beyond in favor of a six-team playoff system identical to that currently used in the Top 14, with only the Pro D2 champion earning automatic promotion and the runner-up advancing to a promotion/relegation playoff with the second-from-bottom Top 14 side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyworld.com/news/french-rugby-enjoys-a-popularity-boom-68018 |title=French rugby enjoys a popularity boom as it looks to the future |first=Gavin |last=Mortimer |publisher=''Rugby World'' |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the pure Shaughnessy system had been used to determine the Top 14 champion, but that league's playoffs expanded to six teams starting in [[2009–10 Top 14 season|2009–10]].

The [[Super League]] in [[rugby league]], made up primarily of English sides with one from France, adopted a Shaughnessy playoff beginning in 2015. This follows a 22-match home-and-away league season and [[Rugby League Super 8s|a single round-robin mini-league]] involving the top eight clubs from the home-and-away season. In addition, the second-level [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] adopted a Shaughnessy playoff for its Championship Shield, and the third-level [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] adopted a Shaughnessy-style promotion playoff similar to that formerly used by Rugby Pro D2. In the Championship, the bottom eight teams at the end of the league season enter their own single round-robin mini-league, with the top four teams at the end of that phase entering a Shaughnessy playoff for the Shield. In League 1, the top team at the end of the league season is automatically promoted to the following season's Championship. The second- through fifth-place teams then enter a Shaughnessy-style playoff for the second promotion place.

Some [[association football]] leagues use Shaughnessy-style playoffs for promotion purposes. Among the countries using such a system are:
* [[Football in England|England]]:
** [[EFL Championship]]: Top two teams automatically promoted to the [[Premier League]]; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[EFL League One]]: Top two teams automatically promoted to the Championship; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[EFL League Two]]: Top three teams automatically promoted to League One; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[National League (division)|National League]]: Champion automatically promoted to League Two; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[National League North]] and [[National League South]]: Each champion automatically promoted to the National League; next four teams in each division play off for that division's second promotion place.
* [[Football in Spain|Spain]]:
** [[Segunda División]]: Top two teams automatically promoted to [[La Liga]]; next four teams play off for the final promotion place. Reserve teams of La Liga clubs are barred from promotion; if any such side occupies a promotion or playoff spot, it is excluded and its place is taken by the next-best team in the standings that is not barred. The same scenario also applies if a reserve team's parent club is relegated from La Liga (with the reserve team being relegated to [[Segunda División B]] in this case).

===Southern Hemisphere===
In rugby union, the Shaughnessy system has been widely used throughout the [[SANZAAR]] countries of South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina.

The [[Super Rugby]] competition, initially featuring teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, used the Shaughnessy format throughout its history as the Super 12 and Super 14, ending in 2010. The competition's expansion to 15 teams as Super Rugby in 2011 saw the playoffs expand to six teams, with three conference champions and three "wild cards" advancing. With the addition of three more teams in 2016 (with two of the new entries in Argentina and Japan), the playoffs now involve eight teams, with four conference champions and four "wild cards". The format was discontinued in the Super Rugby competition for the 2017 season.

In South Africa, the [[Currie Cup]] uses a Shaughnessy playoff to determine the champions of both of its divisions (Premier and First).

In New Zealand, the professional [[Mitre 10 Cup]] (formerly Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) adopted the Shaughnessy format in 2009, after having used an eight-team playoff bracket in its first two seasons in 2007 and 2008. In 2011, the then-ITM Cup split into two divisions, effectively re-creating the three-division system that existed in the [[National Provincial Championship]] era. The playoffs in both the Premiership and Championship divisions use the Shaughnessy system except in [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] years, in which only the top two teams contest a final. Since its inception in 2007, the amateur [[Heartland Championship]] has used the Shaughnessy system, implemented at the last group stage, to determine the winners of both of its trophies, the [[Meads Cup|Meads]] and Lochore Cups.

Australia's [[National Rugby Championship]], which began play in 2014, uses a Shaughnessy playoff. The country's previous attempt to establish a national league, the [[Australian Rugby Championship]], also used a Shaughnessy playoff, but was scrapped after its only season in 2007.

===Philippines===
A modified Shaughnessy system has been used by the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] for its basketball tournaments since 1993. In the semifinals with a #1 vs. #4 and #2 vs. #3 match-ups, the top two seeds possessing the [[Playoff format#Twice to beat advantage|twice to beat advantage]], a variant of the [[Playoff format#Best-of-three playoff|best of three series]] where the higher seed has 1–0 series lead. The winners advance to the best of three finals; it has never been referred to as the "Shaughnessy system" in the country. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) adopted it for their basketball tournaments starting in 1998. It has since been adopted to other sports by other collegiate leagues, and in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], since then

Social identity theory is described as a theory that predicts certain intergroup behaviours on the basis of perceived group [[social status|status]] differences, the perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and stability of those status differences, and the perceived ability to move from one group to another.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt; This contrasts with occasions where the term "social identity theory" is used to refer to general theorizing about human [[Collective identity|social selves]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al., (2010a)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = S.

==Aspects==
[[Image:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|Henri Tajfel suggests that soldiers of opposing armies, fighting outside of view, is an illustrative example of behaviour at the extreme intergroup end of the intergroup-interpersonal continuum.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1978)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tajfel | first1 = H. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1978 | title = Interindividual and intergroup behaviour | journal = Differentiation between groups: Studies in the social psychology of intergroup relations | pages = 27–60 | location = London | publisher = Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===The interpersonal-intergroup continuum===
Social identity theory states that social behavior will vary along a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]] between [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] behavior and intergroup behaviour. Completely interpersonal behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the individual characteristics and interpersonal relationships that exists between only two people. Completely intergroup behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the social category memberships that apply to more than two people.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;

The authors of social identity theory state that purely interpersonal or purely intergroup behaviour is unlikely to be found in realistic social situations. Rather, behaviour is expected to be driven by a compromise between the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1978)"/&gt; The [[Cognition|cognitive]] nature of personal vs. social identities, and the relationship between them, is more fully developed in self-categorization theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2010)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Oakes | first1 = Penny | last2 = Haslam | first2 = Alex | last3 = Turner | first3 = John | title = Stereotyping and social reality | year = 1994 | publisher = Oxford | location = Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J.

S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;

===Positive distinctiveness===
A key assumption in social identity theory is that individuals are intrinsically [[motivation|motivated]] to achieve positive distinctiveness. That is, individuals "strive for a positive self-concept".&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; As individuals to varying degrees may be defined and informed by their respective social identities (as per the interpersonal-intergroup continuum) it is further derived in social identity theory that "individuals strive to achieve or to maintain positive social identity".&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt; It should be noted that the precise nature of this strive for positive self-concept is a matter of debate (see [[Social identity theory#The self-esteem hypothesis|the self-esteem hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Long &amp; Spears (1997)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | last3 = Jetten | first3 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Low status groups show in-group favoritism to compensate for their low status and to compete for higher status | url = | journal = Group Processes and Intergroup Relations | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 563–576 | doi = 10.1177/1368430213514122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the interpersonal-intergroup continuum and the assumption of positive distinctiveness motivation arose as outcomes of the findings of [[minimal group paradigm|minimal group studies]].&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2010)."/&gt; In particular, it was found that under certain conditions individuals would endorse resource distributions that would maximize the positive distinctiveness of an ingroup in contrast to an outgroup at the expense of personal self-interest.&lt;ref name="Turner (1978)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Turner|first1= J.

[[File:LaurynHill cropped.jpg|thumb|The "black is beautiful" movement and the associated [[African American]] embrace of [[African culture|African]] hairdos (like [[afro]]s), culture, traditions, and music was provided by Tajfel and colleagues as an example of the cognitive creativity of low-status groups in the face of stable intergroup relations.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1978a)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tajfel| first1=H.| editor-last=Tajfel| editor-first=H.| year=1978| title=The achievement of group differentiation| journal=Differentiation between groups: Studies in the social psychology of intergroup relations| pages=77–100| location=London| publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1974)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tajfel|first=H.|title=Social identity and intergroup behavior|journal=Social Science Information|year=1974|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–93|doi=10.1177/053901847401300204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller (1983)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=D.|title=Children and race|year=1983|publisher=Sage publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Positive distinctiveness strategies===
Building on the above components, social identity theory details a variety of strategies that may be invoked in order to achieve positive distinctiveness. The individual's choice of behaviour is posited to be dictated largely by the perceived intergroup relationship. In particular the choice of strategy is an outcome of the perceived permeability of group boundaries (e.g., whether a group member may pass from a low status group into a high status group), as well as the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; The self-enhancing strategies detailed in social identity theory are detailed below. Importantly, although these are viewed from the perspective of a low status group member, comparable behaviours may also be adopted by high status group members.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt;

====Individual mobility====
It is predicted that under conditions where the group boundaries are considered permeable individuals are more likely to engage in [[Social mobility|individual mobility]] strategies.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt; That is, individuals "disassociate from the group and pursue individual goals designed to improve their personal lot rather than that of their ingroup".&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p. 38."&gt;Haslam, A. S. (2001). Psychology in Organizations. London, SAGE Publications. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social creativity====
Where group boundaries are considered impermeable, and where status relations are considered reasonably stable, individuals are predicted to engage in social creativity behaviours. Here, low-status ingroup members are still able to increase their positive distinctiveness without necessarily changing the objective resources of the ingroup or the outgroup. This may be achieved by comparing the ingroup to the outgroup on some new dimension, changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, and choosing an alternative outgroup by which to compare the ingroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001). p 26-57"/&gt;

====Social competition====
Here an ingroup seeks positive distinctiveness via direct competition with the outgroup in the form of [[Social identity theory#Ingroup favoritism|ingroup favoritism]]. It is considered competitive in that in this case favoritism for the ingroup occurs on a value dimension that is shared by all relevant social groups (in contrast to social creativity scenarios). Social competition is predicted to occur when group boundaries are considered impermeable, and when status relations are considered to be reasonably unstable.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A.

===Historical background===
The term 'social identity theory' achieved academic currency only in the late 1970s, but the basic underlying concepts associated with it had emerged by the early twentieth century.  [[William G. Sumner]], writing in 1906, captures the primary dynamics in this excerpt from his influential work ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals'':   

:"Loyalty to the group, sacrifice for it, hatred and contempt for outsiders, brotherhood within, warlikeness without,—all grow together, common products of the same situation. [...] Men of an others-group are outsiders with whose ancestors the ancestors of the we-group waged war. [...]  Each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exalts its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders. Each group thinks its own folkways the only right ones, and if it observes that other groups have other folkways, these excite its scorn." &lt;ref&gt;Sumner, W. G. ''Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. New York: Ginn, 1906. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1920s the [[Collectivism|collectivist]] perspective had all but disappeared from mainstream [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="Hogg 81–97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|author2=Williams, Kipling D. |title=From I to we: Social identity and the collective self|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice|date=1 January 2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=81–97|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.4.1.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over fifty years later, around the time of the first formal use of the term 'social identity theory,' Tajfel wrote this on the state of social psychology:

:"Thus, social categorization is still conceived as a haphazardly floating '[[independent variable]]' which strikes at random as the spirit moves it. No links are made or attempted, between the conditions determining its presence and mode of operation, and its outcomes in widely diffused commonalities of social behaviour. Why, when and how is social categorisation salient or not salient? What kind of shared constructions of social reality, mediated through social categorization, lead to a social climate in which large masses of people feel they are in long-term conflict with other masses? What, for example, are the ''psychological'' transitions from a stable to an unstable social system?" (Original emphasis, p. 188)&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1979)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tajfel|first1= H.| year= 1979 |title= Individuals and groups in social psychology| journal= British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology| volume = 18| pages= 183–190 |doi= 10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00324.x |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, social identity theory in part reflects a desire to reestablish a more collectivist approach to social psychology of the self and social groups.&lt;ref name="Hogg 81–97"/&gt;

==Implications==

===Ingroup favoritism===
{{Main|In-group favoritism}}
In-group favoritism (also known as "ingroup bias", despite Turner's objections to the term&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;) is an effect where people give preferential treatment to others when they are perceived to be in the same ingroup. Social identity attributes the cause of ingroup favoritism to a psychological need for positive distinctiveness and describes the situations where ingroup favoritism is likely to occur (as a function of perceived group status, legitimacy, stability, and permeability).&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellemers &amp; Barreto (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellemers | first1 = N. | last2 = Barreto | first2 = M. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = S. L. | editor2-last = Gaertner | year = 2001 | title = The impact of relative group status: affective, perceptual and behavioural consequences | journal = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup processes | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 324–343 | doi=10.1002/9780470693421.ch16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown via the minimal group studies that ingroup favoritism may occur for both arbitrary ingroups (e.g. a coin toss may split participants into a 'heads' group and a 'tails' group) as well as non-arbitrary ingroups (e.g. ingroups based on cultures, [[gender identity|genders]], [[sexual orientation]], and first languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Marilynn B. |title=Ingroup bias in the minimal intergroup situations: A cognitive motivational analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1979|volume=86|issue=2|pages=307–324|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.2.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hog &amp; Turner, (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogg|first1=M.A.|last2=Turner|first2=J.C.|year = 1987| title=Intergroup behaviour, self-stereotyping and the salience of social categories|journal= British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=26| pages=325–340|publisher= The British Psychological Society|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1987.tb00795.x|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued study into the relationship between social categorization and ingroup favoritism has explored the relative prevalences of the ingroup favoritism vs. outgroup discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Ali M.|title=Group identity, social distance and intergroup bias|journal=Journal of Economic Psychology|date=1 June 2007|volume=28|issue=3|pages=324–337|doi=10.1016/j.joep.2007.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored different manifestations of ingroup favoritism,&lt;ref name="Ellemers &amp; Barreto (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumm |first= Angela J. |author2=Corning, Alexandra F. |title=Who Believes Us When We Try to Conceal Our Prejudices?

=== Reluctance to bet against identity-relevant outcomes ===
Social identities are a valued aspect of the self, and people will sacrifice their pecuniary self-interest to maintain the self-perception that they belong to a given social group. Political partisans and fans of sports teams (e.g., Republicans and Democrats, or MLB, NFL, NCAA fans) are reluctant to bet against the success of their party or team because of the diagnostic cost such a bet would incur to their identification with it. As a result, partisans and fans will reject even very favorable bets against identity-relevant desired outcomes. More than 45% of N.C.A.A. basketball and hockey fans, for example, turned down a free, real chance to earn $5 if their team lost its upcoming game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Tang|first2=Simone|last3=Larrick|first3=Richard P.|date=2016-10-12|title=Betting Your Favorite to Win: Costly Reluctance to Hedge Desired Outcomes|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|journal=Management Science|doi=10.1287/mnsc.2016.2656|issn=0025-1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Self-esteem hypothesis===
Social identity theory proposes that people are motivated to achieve and maintain positive concepts of themselves. Some researchers, including [[Michael Hogg]] and [[Dominic Abrams]], thus propose a fairly direct relationship between positive social identity and [[self-esteem]]. In what has become known as the "self-esteem hypothesis", self-esteem is predicted to relate to in-group bias in two ways. Firstly, successful intergroup discrimination elevates self-esteem. Secondly, depressed or threatened self-esteem promotes intergroup discrimination.&lt;ref name="Hogg &amp; Abrams (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = M. A. | authorlink1 = | last2 = Abrams | first2 = D. | editor1-last = Abrams | editor1-first = D. | editor2-last = Hogg | editor2-first = M. A | year = 1990 | title = Social motivation, self-esteem, and social identity | journal = Social identity theory.

Some social identity theorists, including John Turner, consider the self-esteem hypothesis as not canonical to social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Long &amp; Spears (1997)"/&gt; In fact, the self-esteem hypothesis is argued to be conflictual with the tenets of the theory.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | editor1-last = McGarty | editor1-first = C. | editor2-last = Haslam | editor2-first = S. A. | year = 1997  | title = The socially structured mind | journal = The message of social psychology | pages = 355–373 | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the self-esteem hypothesis misunderstands the distinction between a social identity and a personal identity. Along those lines, John Turner and [[Penny Oakes]] argue against an interpretation of positive distinctiveness as a straightforward need for self-esteem or "quasi-biological drive toward prejudice".&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"/&gt; They instead favour a somewhat more complex conception of positive self-concept as a reflection of the ideologies and social values of the perceiver. Additionally, it is argued that the self-esteem hypothesis neglects the alternative strategies to maintaining a positive self-concept that are articulated in social identity theory (i.e., individual mobility and social creativity).&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellemers &amp; Barreto (2001)"/&gt;

===Positive-negative asymmetry===
In what has been dubbed the Positive-Negative Asymmetry Phenomenon, researchers have shown that punishing the out-group benefits self-esteem less than rewarding the in-group.&lt;ref name="Bourhis &amp; Gagnon (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourhis | first1 = R. Y. | last2 = Gagnon | first2 = A. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = S. L. | editor2-last = Gaertner | year = 2001 | title = Social Orientations in the Minimal Group Paradigm | journal = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup processes | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 133–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this finding it has been extrapolated that social identity theory is therefore unable to deal with bias on negative dimensions. Social identity theorists, however, point out that for ingroup favouritism to occur a social identity "must be psychologically salient", and that negative dimensions may be experienced as a "less fitting basis for self-definition".&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2010). p142"&gt;Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010). The story of social identity. In T. Postmes &amp; N. Branscombe (Eds). Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press. p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; This important qualification is subtly present in social identity theory, but is further developed in self-categorization theory. Empirical support for this perspective exist. It has been shown that when experiment participants can self-select negative dimensions that define the ingroup no positive–negative asymmetry is found.&lt;ref name="Reynolds et al. (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Turner | first2 = J. C. |  last3 = Haslam | first3 = S. A. | last4 = Ryan | first4 = M.

===Intergroup similarity===
It has been posited that social identity theory suggests that similar groups should have an increased motivation to differentiate themselves from each other.&lt;ref name="brown2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown (1984)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = R. J. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1984 | title = The role of similarity in intergroup relations | journal = The social dimension | volume = 2 | pages = 603–623 | location = Cambridge | publisher = University Press | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511759154.012 | isbn = 9780511759154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, empirical findings where similar groups are shown to possess increased levels of intergroup attraction and decreased levels of in-group bias have been interpreted as problematic for the theory.&lt;ref name="brown2000"/&gt; Elsewhere it has been suggested that this apparent inconsistency may be resolved by attending to social identity theory's emphasis on the importance of the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Brown (1984)"/&gt;

===Predictive power===
Social identity theory has been criticised for having far greater [[explanatory power]] than [[predictive power]].&lt;ref name="Miller (1983)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogg 81–97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duckitt (1992)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duckitt|first=John|title=The social psychology of prejudice|year=1992|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=London|pages=84–90|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, while the relationship between independent variables and the resulting intergroup behaviour may be consistent with the theory in retrospect, that particular outcome is often not that which was predicted at the outset. A rebuttal to this charge is that the theory was never advertised as the definitive answer to understanding intergroup relationships. Instead it is stated that social identity theory must go hand in hand with sufficient understanding of the specific social context under consideration.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1984)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tajfel | first1 = H. | editor-last = Tajfel | editor-first = H. | year = 1984 | title = Intergroup relations, social myths and social justice in social psychology | journal = The social dimension | volume = 2 | pages = 695–715 | location = Cambridge | publisher = University Press | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511759154.016 | isbn = 9780511759154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter argument is consistent with the explicit importance that the authors of social identity theory placed on the role of "objective" factors, stating that in any particular situation "the effects of [social identity theory] variables are powerfully determined by the previous social, economic, and political processes".&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."/&gt;

{{citation style|date=October 2010}}
A '''speech code''' is any rule or regulation that limits, restricts, or bans speech beyond the strict legal limitations upon [[freedom of speech]] or [[freedom of the press|press]] found in the legal definitions of [[harassment]], [[slander]], [[libel]], and [[fighting words]].  Such codes are common in the workplace, in universities,&lt;ref name=uelman&gt;Uelmen, Gerald (1992). The Price of Free Speech: Campus Hate Speech Codes. *Issues in Ethics - V. 5, N. 2, Summer 1992. Murkkula Center For Applied Ethics.[http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v5n2/codes.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and in private organizations. The term may be applied to regulations that do not explicitly prohibit particular words or sentences.  Speech codes are often applied for the purpose of suppressing [[hate speech]] or forms of social discourse thought to be disagreeable to the implementers.

Use of the term is in many cases valuative; those opposing a particular regulation may refer to it as a speech code, while supporters will prefer to describe it as, for example and depending on the circumstances, a harassment policy. This is particularly the case in [[academia|academic]] contexts.  The difference may be ascertained by determining if the harassment policy bans more than what is legally defined as harassment; one that does is almost certainly a speech code. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Banned word ==
A '''banned word''' is one whose use is prohibited by law or culture or organization policy. An example would be the [[Ban Bossy]] campaign. [[Lake Superior State University]] publishes an annual list of words that are banned because of misuse. Some companies, such as [[Instagram]], allow users to decide for themselves what words to ban from being used on their pages (e.g. in [[comments section]]s).

== At United States universities ==
In the [[United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has not issued a direct ruling on whether speech codes at [[public university|public universities]] are unconstitutional. However, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] has struck down a speech code at the [[University of Michigan]], indicating that broad speech codes seeking to prohibit [[hate speech]] probably violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (''[[Doe v. University of Michigan]],'' 1989).  Subsequent challenges against such language as part of harassment policies, [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] mandates, and so forth instead of being self-identified as speech codes have generally succeeded to date.

One web site describes behavior that speech codes are meant to prevent:

:Discriminatory harassment includes conduct (oral, written, graphic or physical) directed against any person or, group of persons because of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, or veteran's status and that has the purpose or reasonably foreseeable effect of creating an offensive, demeaning, intimidating, or hostile environment for that person or group of persons.&lt;ref name=uelman/&gt;

Today, most talk of speech codes is within institutional contexts and refer to colleges and refers to official lists and rules established by authorities, where speech codes are occasionally used by colleges and universities to suppress speech that others find offensive. [[Alan Charles Kors]] and [[Harvey Silverglate]], in their work ''The Shadow University'', published in 1998, refer to a number of cases in which speech codes have been used by public and private universities to suppress [[academic freedom]], as well as the [[freedom of speech]], and deny [[due process]] of law (for public institutions), or violate explicit and implicit guarantees of fairness declared or implied in a student's [[contract]] of enrollment or a faculty member's contract of employment with the institution of higher education in question (at private institutions&lt;ref&gt;For example, if a private institution declares or implies that their code of conduct will treat those subject to it fairly, then a court will require an institution to uphold their promises of fairness, under the [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]], even if the institution disclaims that it is a contract. Contrary to this, if an institution openly, willingly, and publicly declares their code of conduct is completely arbitrary and capricious, and discipline is carried out at the slightest whim of higher authorities, then no court will inquire as to how they conduct their business.&lt;/ref&gt;).

One particular case, the University of Pennsylvania [[Water buffalo incident|"Water Buffalo" case]], highlighted reasons for and against speech codes and is typical of such cases. In the [[University of Pennsylvania]] case, a freshman faced expulsion from that private school when he called African-American sorority members who were making substantial amounts of noise and disturbing his sleep during the middle of the night "water buffalo" (the charged student claimed not to intend discrimination, as the individual in question spoke the modern [[Hebrew language]], and the term "water buffalo", or "behema", in modern Hebrew, is slang for a rude or an insulting person; moreover, water buffalo are native to Asia rather than Africa). Some saw the statement as racist while others simply saw it as a general insult. Questions were raised about how far was too far when interpreting and punishing statements like the one in question. The college eventually dropped the charges amid national criticism (Downs, 1993), (Kors &amp; Silverglate, 1998).

== Purposes ==
{{Update|date=August 2009}}
There are two distinct reasons given for the implementation of speech codes, most often given in the context of higher education institutions. The first is as follows, "First, to protect vulnerable students from threatening, truly harassing speech that amounts to 'fighting words,' which are not protected by the First Amendment" (Downs, 1993).

The second reason is more abstract, leaving room for argument both for and against the reason. One author states, "Second, [speech codes] are linked to a broader ideological agenda designed to foster an egalitarian vision of social justice" (Downs, 1993). Because many institutions hold such a view in their mission statements, the justification for a policy in line with the views of the institution comes quite naturally. However, opponents of speech codes often maintain that any restriction on speech is a violation of the First Amendment. Because words and phrases typically belonging in the hate speech category could also be used in literature, quoted for socially acceptable purposes or used out loud as examples of what not to say in certain situations, it can be argued that the words and phrases have practical, intrinsic value and therefore should not be banned.

According to one scholar, hate speech complaints are up on campuses everywhere, pressuring universities to create speech codes of their own. He states:

:There were approximately 75 hate speech codes in place at U.S. colleges and universities in 1990; by 1991, the number grew to over 300. School administrators institute codes primarily to foster productive learning environments in the face of rising racially motivated and other offensive incidents on many campuses. According to a recent study, reports of campus harassment increased 400 percent between 1985 and 1990. Moreover, 80 percent of campus harassment incidents go unreported.&lt;ref name=uelman/&gt;&lt;Needs Citation&gt;

Critics of speech codes such as the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] (FIRE) allege that speech codes are often not enforced impartially, but serve as a form of unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, punishing those "whose speech does not meet their subjective standards of 'political correctness'",&lt;ref&gt;http://thefire.org/article/10586.html&lt;/ref&gt; and feel that "Progress [towards free speech rights] is endangered when schools attempt to use a charge of disruption as a pretext for censoring speech." &lt;ref&gt;http://thefire.org/index.php/article/152.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of speech regulated under speech codes ==
Examples of communication regulated under speech codes include [[Holocaust denial]] and [[racist]] or [[sexist]] speech. The most stringent of such policies may include a ban on anything deemed offensive, such as ridicule against another person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9806">[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the syntactic entities which may be constructed from [[formal language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syntax Dictionary Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language is identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]

In [[logic]], '''syntax''' is anything having to do with [[formal language]]s or [[formal system]]s without regard to any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] given to them. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] of a language which is concerned with its meaning.

The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]], [[well-formed formula|formulas]], [[formal system|system]]s, [[theorem]]s, [[formal proof|proofs]], and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] expressed in formal languages are syntactic entities whose properties may be studied without regard to any meaning they may be given, and, in fact, need not be given any.

Syntax is usually associated with the rules (or grammar) governing the composition of texts in a formal language that constitute the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal system.

In [[computer science]], the term ''[[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]'' refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] in a [[programming language]]. As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.

== Syntactic entities ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A symbol is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[Type-token distinction|tokens]] of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are [[logical constant]]s which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if the formulation is consistent with the formation rules of the language. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.

=== Formal language ===
{{Main|Formal language}}

A ''formal language'' is a syntactic entity which consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s which are its words (usually called its [[well-formed formula]]s). Which strings of symbols are words is determined by the creator of the language, usually by specifying a set of [[formation rule]]s. Such a language can be defined without [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning.

=== Formation rules ===
{{main|Formation rule}}

''Formation rules'' are a precise description of which [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s are the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of [[String (computer science)|strings]] over the [[alphabet]] of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e. what they mean).

=== Propositions ===
{{main|Proposition}}

A '''proposition''' is a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] expressing something [[truth|true]] or [[falsity|false]]. A proposition is identified [[ontology|ontologically]] as an [[idea]], [[concept]] or [[abstraction]] whose [[type-token distinction|token instances]] are patterns of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]], marks, sounds, or [[string (computer science)|strings]] of words.&lt;ref&gt;Metalogic, [[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]]&lt;/ref&gt; Propositions are considered to be syntactic entities and also [[truthbearer]]s.

=== Formal theories ===
{{main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A '''formal theory''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

=== Formal systems ===
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Formal systems, like other syntactic entities may be defined without any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] given to it (as being, for instance, a system of arithmetic).

==== Syntactic consequence within a formal system ====

A formula A is a '''syntactic consequence'''&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Frege: Philosophy of Language|author=Dummett, M.|date=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674319318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYP7uCZIRQYC|page=82|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle and Logical Theory|author=Lear, J.|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521311786|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXI7AAAAIAAJ|page=1|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Carnap|author1=Creath, R.|author2=Friedman, M.|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521840156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87BcFLgJmxMC|page=189|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uniba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+consequence|title=syntactic consequence from FOLDOC|publisher=swif.uniba.it|accessdate=2014-10-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403201417/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+consequence|archivedate=2013-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within some formal system &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; of a set Г of formulas if there is a [[Formal proof|derivation]] in [[formal system]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; of A from the set Г.

==== Syntactic completeness of a formal system ====
{{Main|Completeness (logic)}}

A formal system &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is ''syntactically complete''&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jigpal.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/5/513.pdf|title=A Note on Interaction and Incompleteness|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=504575|title=Normal forms and syntactic completeness proofs for functional independencies|publisher=portal.acm.org|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Mathematical Logic|author=Barwise, J.|authorlink=Jon Barwise|date=1982|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080933641|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0Fvrw9tBcMC|page=236|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uniba2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+completeness|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010502223539/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?syntactic+completeness|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2001-05-02|title=syntactic completeness from FOLDOC|publisher=swif.uniba.it|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also ''deductively complete'', ''maximally complete'', ''negation complete'' or simply ''complete'') iff for each formula A of the language of the system either A or ¬A is a theorem of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete iff no unprovable axiom can be added to it as an axiom without introducing an [[consistency|inconsistency]]. Truth-functional [[propositional logic]] and first-order [[predicate logic]] are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single variable "a" is not a theorem, and neither is its negation, but these are not [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]). [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no [[recursive system]] that is sufficiently powerful, such as the [[Peano axioms]], can be both consistent and complete.

=== Interpretations ===
{{main|Formal semantics (logic)|Interpretation (logic)}}

An ''interpretation'' of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and [[truth value]]s to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. ''Giving an interpretation'' is synonymous with ''constructing a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|model]]''. An interpretation is expressed in a [[metalanguage]], which may itself be a formal language, and as such itself is a syntactic entity.

'''Taylor diagrams''' are [[mathematical diagram]]s designed to graphically indicate which of several approximate representations (or models) of a system, process, or phenomenon is most realistic.  This diagram, invented by Karl E. Taylor in 1994 (published in 2001&lt;ref name=Taylor2001&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) facilitates the comparative assessment of different models.  It is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modeled and observed behavior in terms of three statistics:  the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]], the [[root mean square deviation|root-mean-square error]] (RMSE) error, and the [[standard deviation]].

Although Taylor diagrams have primarily been used to evaluate models designed to study climate and other aspects of Earth’s environment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;hl=en&amp;cites=18409945057930060704&amp;as_sdt=5 In the period 2012-2015, Google Scholar lists more than 1000 citations of Taylor (2001), the first scholarly article describing the Taylor diagram.]&lt;/ref&gt; they can be used for purposes unrelated to environmental science (e.g., to quantify and visually display how well fusion energy models represent reality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Taylor diagrams can be constructed with a number of different open source and commercial software packages, including:  GrADS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bguan.bol.ucla.edu/bGASL/taylor_calc.gs Calculate statistics used in Taylor diagram in GrADS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bguan.bol.ucla.edu/bGASL/taylor.gs Plot Taylor diagram in GrADS]&lt;/ref&gt; IDL,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlcoyote.com/cg_tips/taylordiagram.php Coyote’s Guide to IDL Programming: Creating a Taylor Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt; MATLAB,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20559-taylor-diagram MathWorks File Exchange: Taylor Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52943-skill-metrics-toolbox MathWorks File Exchange: Skill Metrics Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/PeterRochford/SkillMetricsToolbox GitHub: SkillMetricsToolbox]&lt;/ref&gt; NCL,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/taylor.shtml NCL Special Topics: Taylor Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt; Python,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/PeterRochford/SkillMetrics GitHub: SkillMetrics]&lt;/ref&gt; R,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/plotrix/docs/taylor.diagram inside-R: taylor.diagram {plotrix}]&lt;/ref&gt; and UV-CDAT.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uv-cdat.github.io/cdat-site/taylordiag.html CDAT: Taylor Diagrams]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample diagram==
The sample Taylor diagram shown in Figure 1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/about/staff/Taylor/CV/Taylor_diagram_primer.pdf Taylor diagram primer (2005), K.E. Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the relative skill with which several global climate models simulate the spatial pattern of annual mean precipitation.  Eight models, each represented by a different letter on the diagram, are compared, and the distance between each model and the point labeled “observed” is a measure of how realistically each model reproduces observations.  For each model, three statistics are plotted: the Pearson correlation coefficient (gauging similarity in pattern between the simulated and observed fields) is related to the azimuthal angle (blue contours); the centered RMS error in the simulated field is proportional to the distance from the point on the x-axis identified as “observed” (green contours); and the standard deviation of the simulated pattern is proportional to the radial distance from the origin (black contours).  It is evident from this diagram, for example, that for Model F the correlation coefficient is about 0.65, the RMS error is about 2.6&amp;nbsp;mm/day and the standard deviation is about 3.3&amp;nbsp;mm/day.  Model F’s standard deviation is clearly greater than the standard deviation of the observed field (indicated by the dashed contour at radial distance 2.9&amp;nbsp;mm/day). 
[[File:Primer fig1a.svg|400px|center|thumb|Fig. 1: Sample Taylor diagram displaying a statistical comparison with observations of eight model estimates of the global pattern of annual mean precipitation.]]

The relative merits of various models can be inferred from Figure 1. Simulated patterns that agree well with observations will lie nearest the point marked "observed" on the x-axis. These models have relatively high correlation and low RMS errors. Models lying on the dashed arc have the correct standard deviation (which indicates that the pattern variations are of the right amplitude). In Figure 1 it can be seen that models A and C generally agree best with observations, each with about the same RMS error. Model A, however, has a slightly higher correlation with observations and has the same standard deviation as the observed, whereas model C has too little spatial variability (with a standard deviation of 2.3&amp;nbsp;mm/day compared to the observed value of 2.9&amp;nbsp;mm/day). Of the poorer performing models, model E has a low pattern correlation, while model D has variations that are much larger than observed, in both cases resulting in a relatively large (~3&amp;nbsp;mm/day) centered RMS error in the precipitation fields. Note also that although models D and B have about the same correlation with observations, model B simulates the amplitude of the variations (i.e., the standard deviation) much better than model D, resulting in a smaller RMS error.

==Theoretical basis==
Taylor diagrams display statistics useful for assessing the similarity of a variable simulated by a model (more generally, the “test” field) to its observed counterpart (more generally, the “reference” field).  Mathematically, the three statistics displayed on a Taylor diagram are related by the following formula (which can be derived directly from the definition of the statistics appearing in it):

 &lt;math&gt;E^{\prime2} = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_t^2 - 2 \sigma_r \sigma_t \rho &lt;/math&gt;,

 where ''ρ'' is the correlation coefficient between the test and reference fields, ''E''′ is the centered RMS difference between the fields (with any difference in the means first removed), and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; are the variances of the reference and test fields, respectively.  The [[law of cosines]] &lt;math&gt;(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\phi,&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are the length of the sides of the triangle, and ''φ'' is the angle between sides ''a'' and ''b'') provides the key to forming the geometrical relationship between the four quantities that underlie the Taylor diagram (shown in Figure 2).[[File:Taylor diagram fig2.png|300px|right|thumb|Fig. 2: Geometrical relationship between statistics plotted on Taylor diagrams according to the law of cosines.]]  The standard deviation of the observed field &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_r)&lt;/math&gt; is side ''a''.  The [[standard deviation]] of the simulated field &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_t)&lt;/math&gt; is side ''b'', the centered [[root mean square deviation|RMS difference]] between the two fields (''E''′) is side ''c'', and the cosine of the angle between sides ''a'' and ''b'' is the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] (''ρ'').

Note that the means of the fields are subtracted out before computing their second-order statistics, so the diagram does not provide information about overall biases, but solely characterizes the centered pattern error.

==Taylor diagram variants==
Among the several minor variations on the diagram that have been suggested are (see, Taylor, 2001&lt;ref name=Taylor2001/&gt;):

* extension to a second "quadrant" (to the left of the quadrant shown in Figure 1) to accommodate negative correlations;
* normalization of dimensional quantities (dividing both the RMS difference and the standard deviation of the "test" field by the standard deviation of the observations) so that the "observed" point is plotted at unit distance from the origin along the x-axis, and statistics for different fields (with different units) can be shown in a single plot;
* omission of the isolines on the diagram to make it easier to see the plotted points;
* use of an arrow to connect two related points on the diagram.  For example, an arrow can be drawn from the point representing an older version of a model to a newer version, which makes it easier to indicate more clearly whether or not the model is moving toward "truth," as defined by observations.

"'''The Unparalleled Invasion'''" is a [[science fiction]] story written by [[Jack London]]. It was first published in ''[[McClure's]]'' in July 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=80308|title=The Unparalleled Invasion}}, retrieved 2015-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Under the influence of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], China modernizes and undergoes its own version of the [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji Reforms]] in the 1910s. In 1922, China breaks away from Japan and fights a brief war that culminates in the Chinese annexation of the Japanese possessions of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Formosa]], and [[Manchuria]]. Over the next half century, China's population steadily grows, and eventually migration overwhelms European colonies in Asia. The United States and the other Western powers launch a [[biological warfare]] campaign against China, resulting in the destruction of China's population, the few survivors of the plague being killed out of hand by European and American troops. China is then colonized by the Western powers. This opens the way to a joyous epoch of "splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output". In the 1980s war clouds once more gather between Germany and France, and the story ends with the nations of the world solemnly pledging not to use the same techniques they had against China.

== Background and context ==
"The Unparalleled Invasion" was included in ''The Strength of the Strong'', a collection of stories by London published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html ''The Strength of the Strong''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527044818/http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html |date=2015-05-27 }} The World of Jack London, retrieved 2015-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; which also included "[[The Dream of Debs]]", a critique of [[capitalism|capitalist society]] in the US, and "The Strength of the Strong", which used a primitive background as metaphor of [[social injustice]] among men. 

"The Unparalleled Invasion" has been controversial for its depiction of [[genocide]] and has been cited&lt;ref name="slate review" /&gt; as evidence of London's [[racism]]. The genocide is described in considerable detail and nowhere is any objection made to it. The terms "yellow life" and "yellow populace" appear in the story. It ends with the "sanitation of China" and its re-settlement by Westerners.

'''Top-down''' and '''bottom-up''' are both strategies of [[information processing]] and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see [[systemics]]), and management and organization. In practice, they can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership.

A '''top-down''' approach (also known as ''stepwise design'' and in some cases used as a synonym of ''decomposition'') is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bactra.org/weblog/950.html |title=Top-Down Design (Introduction to Statistical Computing) |publisher=bactra.org |date=September 24, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bottom-up''' approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. Bottom-up processing is a type of [[information processing]] based on incoming data from the environment to form a [[perception]]. From a cognitive psychology perspective, information enters the eyes in one direction (sensory input, or the "bottom"), and is then turned into an image by the brain that can be interpreted and recognized as a perception (output that is "built up" from processing to final cognition). In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. However, "organic strategies" may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems, developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose.

==Product design and development==
{{Main article|New product development}}
During the design and development of new products, designers and engineers rely on both a bottom-up and top-down approach. The bottom-up approach is being utilized when off-the-shelf or existing components are selected and integrated into the product. An example would include selecting a particular fastener, such as a bolt, and designing the receiving components such that the fastener will fit properly. In a top-down approach, a custom fastener would be designed such that it would fit properly in the receiving components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10869-009-9090-8 |title=Cognitive Lie Detection: Response Time and Consistency of Answers as Cues to Deception - Springer |date=January 9, 1997 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |doi=10.1007/s10869-009-9090-8 |volume=24 |journal=Journal of Business and Psychology |pages=33–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For perspective, for a product with more restrictive requirements (such as weight, geometry, safety, environment, etc.), such as a space-suit, a more top-down approach is taken and almost everything is custom designed. However, when it's more important to minimize cost and increase component availability, such as with manufacturing equipment, a more bottom-up approach would be taken, and as many off-the-shelf components (bolts, gears, bearings, etc.) would be selected as possible. In the latter case, the receiving housings would be designed around the selected components.

==Computer science==

===Software development===
:''Part of this section is from the [[Perl Design Patterns Book]]''.

In the [[software development process]], the '''top-down''' and '''bottom-up''' approaches play a key role.

Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system. Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. This, however, delays testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete. Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified. This approach, however, runs the risk that modules may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link to other parts of the system, and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought. [[Code reuse|Re-usability of code]] is one of the main benefits of the bottom-up approach.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://step.psy.cmu.edu/scripts/Attention/Treisman1980.html |title=STEP: Scripts: Attention: Treisman and Gelade 1980 |publisher=Step.psy.cmu.edu |date=March 13, 2003 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914130951/http://step.psy.cmu.edu/scripts/Attention/Treisman1980.html |archivedate=September 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Top-down design was promoted in the 1970s by [[IBM]] researchers [[Harlan Mills]] and [[Niklaus Wirth]]. Mills developed [[structured programming]] concepts for practical use and tested them in a 1969 project to automate the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' morgue index. The engineering and management success of this project led to the spread of the top-down approach through IBM and the rest of the computer industry. Among other achievements, Niklaus Wirth, the developer of [[Pascal programming language]], wrote the influential paper ''Program Development by '''Stepwise Refinement'''''. Since Niklaus Wirth went on to develop languages such as [[Modula]] and [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (where one could define a module before knowing about the entire program specification), one can infer that top-down programming was not strictly what he promoted. Top-down methods were favored in [[software engineering]] until the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and [[object-oriented programming]] assisted in demonstrating the idea that both aspects of top-down and bottom-up programming could be utilized.

Modern software design approaches usually combine both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Although an understanding of the complete system is usually considered necessary for good design, leading theoretically to a top-down approach, most software projects attempt to make use of existing code to some degree. Pre-existing modules give designs a bottom-up flavor. Some design approaches also use an approach where a partially functional system is designed and coded to completion, and this system is then expanded to fulfill all the requirements for the project

===Programming===
[[File:Lego Chicago City View 2001.jpg|thumb|left|Building blocks are an example of bottom-up design because the parts are first created and then assembled without regard to how the parts will work in the assembly.]]

Top-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. The technique for writing a program using top–down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need. Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized sub-routines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded. When all the various sub-routines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower level work can be self-contained. By defining how the lower level abstractions are expected to integrate into higher level ones, interfaces become clearly defined.

In a bottom-up approach, the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small, but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. In mechanical engineering with software programs such as Pro/ENGINEER, Solidworks, and Autodesk Inventor users can design products as pieces not part of the whole and later add those pieces together to form assemblies like building with [[Lego]]. Engineers call this piece part design.

In a bottom-up approach, good intuition is necessary to decide the functionality that is to be provided by the module. If a system is to be built from an existing system, this approach is more suitable as it starts from some existing modules.

=== Parsing ===

[[Parsing]] is the process of analyzing an input sequence (such as that read from a file or a keyboard) in order to determine its grammatical structure. This method is used in the analysis of both [[natural language]]s and [[computer language]]s, as in a [[compiler]].

Bottom-up parsing is a strategy for analyzing unknown data relationships that attempts to identify the most fundamental units first, and then to infer higher-order structures from them. Top-down parsers, on the other hand, hypothesize general [[parse tree]] structures and then consider whether the known fundamental structures are compatible with the hypothesis. See [[Top-down parsing]] and [[Bottom-up parsing]].

== Nanotechnology ==
{{Main article|Nanotechnology}}

'''Top-down''' and '''bottom-up''' are two approaches for the manufacture of products. These terms were first applied to the field of nanotechnology by the [[Foresight Institute]] in 1989 in order to distinguish between molecular manufacturing (to mass-produce large atomically precise objects) and conventional manufacturing (which can mass-produce large objects that are not atomically precise). Bottom-up approaches seek to have smaller (usually [[Molecule|molecular]]) components built up into more complex assemblies, while top-down approaches seek to create nanoscale devices by using larger, externally controlled ones to direct their assembly. Certain valuable nanostructures, such as [[Silicon nanowire#Synthesis|Silicon nanowires]], can be fabricated using either approach, with processing methods selected on the basis of targeted applications.

The top-down approach often uses the traditional workshop or microfabrication methods where externally controlled tools are used to cut, mill, and shape materials into the desired shape and order. [[Micropatterning]] techniques, such as [[photolithography]] and [[inkjet printing]] belong to this category. Vapor treatment can be regarded as a  new top-down secondary approaches to engineer nanostructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghaei|first1=Jaber|last2=Fallahzadeh|first2=Ali|last3=Saghaei|first3=Tayebeh|title=Vapor treatment as a new method for photocurrent enhancement of UV photodetectors based on ZnO nanorods|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|date=June 2016|volume=247|pages=150–155|doi=10.1016/j.sna.2016.05.050|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424716302849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the [[chemistry|chemical]] properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to (a) self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or (b) rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize the concepts of [[molecular self-assembly]] and/or [[molecular recognition]]. See also [[Supramolecular chemistry]]. Such bottom-up approaches should, broadly speaking, be able to produce devices in parallel and much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases.

== Neuroscience and psychology ==
[[Image:TheCat.png|thumb|right|An example of top-down processing: Even though the second letter in each word is ambiguous, top-down processing allows for easy disambiguation based on the context.]]

These terms are also employed in [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]] to discuss the flow of information in processing.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1981).{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}} Typically [[Sensory system|sensory]] input is considered "bottom-up", and [[Executive functions|higher cognitive processes]], which have more information from other sources, are considered "top-down". A bottom-up process is characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing, whereas a top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition, such as goals or targets (Beiderman, 19).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

According to college teaching notes written by Charles Ramskov,{{who|date=March 2017}} Rock, Neiser, and Gregory claim that top-down approach involves perception that is an active and constructive process.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008), p. 67.{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} Additionally, it is an approach not directly given by stimulus input, but is the result of stimulus, internal hypotheses, and expectation interactions. According to Theoretical Synthesis, "when a stimulus is presented short and clarity is uncertain that gives a vague stimulus, perception becomes a top-down approach."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1935"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychclassics.asu.edu/Stroop/ |title=Classics in the History of Psychology - Stroop (1935) |publisher=Psychclassics.asu.edu |date=August 15, 1934 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119172853/http://psychclassics.asu.edu/Stroop/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, psychology defines bottom-up processing as an approach wherein there is a progression from the individual elements to the whole. According to Ramskov, one proponent of bottom-up approach, Gibson, claims that it is a process that includes visual perception that needs information available from proximal stimulus produced by the distal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008).{{page needed|date=March 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Solso (1998), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical Synthesis also claims that bottom-up processing occurs "when a stimulus is presented long and clearly enough."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1935"/&gt;

Cognitively speaking, certain cognitive processes, such as fast reactions or quick visual identification, are considered bottom-up processes because they rely primarily on sensory information, whereas processes such as [[motor system|motor]] control and [[Overt attention|directed attention]] are considered top-down because they are goal directed. Neurologically speaking, some areas of the brain, such as area [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex (V1)|V1]] mostly have bottom-up connections.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1935"/&gt; Other areas, such as the [[fusiform gyrus]] have inputs from higher brain areas and are considered to have top-down influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008), p. 81.{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}}

The study of [[Attention|visual attention]] provides an example. If your attention is drawn to a flower in a field, it may be because the color or shape of the flower are visually salient. The information that caused you to attend to the flower came to you in a bottom-up fashion—your attention was not contingent upon knowledge of the flower; the outside stimulus was sufficient on its own. Contrast this situation with one in which you are looking for a flower. You have a representation of what you are looking for. When you see the object you are looking for, it is salient. This is an example of the use of top-down information.

In cognitive terms, two thinking approaches are distinguished. "Top-down" (or "big chunk") is stereotypically the visionary, or the person who sees the larger picture and overview. Such people focus on the big picture and from that derive the details to support it. "Bottom-up" (or "small chunk") cognition is akin to focusing on the detail primarily, rather than the landscape. The expression "seeing the wood for the trees" references the two styles of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Biederman | first1 = I. | last2 = Glass | first2 = A. L. | last3 = Stacy | first3 = E. W. | year = 1973 | title = Searching for objects in real world scenes | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = | pages = 22–27 | doi=10.1037/h0033776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and organization ==
In the fields of management and organization, the terms "top-down" and "bottom-up" are used to describe how decisions are made and/or how change is implemented.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Greg L.|last2=Manges|first2=Kirstin A.|last3=Ward|first3=Marcia M.|title=Empowering Sustained Patient Safety|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00001786-201507000-00009|journal=Journal of Nursing Care Quality|volume=30|issue=3|pages=240–246|doi=10.1097/ncq.0000000000000103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "''top-down''" approach is where an executive decision maker or other top person makes the decisions of how something should be done. This approach is disseminated under their authority to lower levels in the hierarchy, who are, to a greater or lesser extent, bound by them. For example, when wanting to make an improvement in a hospital, a hospital administrator might decide that a major change (such as implementing a new program) is needed, and then the leader uses a planned approach to drive the changes down to the frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A "''bottom-up''" approach to changes is one that works from the [[grassroots]]—from a large number of people working together, causing a decision to arise from their joint involvement. A decision by a number of activists, students, or victims of some incident to take action is a "bottom-up" decision. A bottom-up approach can be thought of as "an incremental change approach that represents an emergent process cultivated and upheld primarily by frontline workers" (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;241).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Positive aspects of top-down approaches include their efficiency and superb overview of higher levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, external effects can be internalized. On the negative side, if reforms are perceived to be imposed 'from above', it can be difficult for lower levels to accept them (e.g. Bresser-Pereira, Maravall, and Przeworski 1993). Evidence suggests this to be true regardless of the content of reforms (e.g. Dubois 2002). A bottom-up approach allows for more experimentation and a better feeling for what is needed at the bottom. Other evidence suggests that there is a third combination approach to change (see Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Public health===

Both top-down and bottom-up approaches exist in [[public health]]. There are many examples of top-down programs, often run by governments or large [[inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs); many of these are disease-specific or issue-specific, such as [[HIV]] control or [[Smallpox]] [[Eradication of infectious diseases|Eradication]]. Examples of bottom-up programs include many small NGOs set up to improve local access to healthcare. However, a lot of programs seek to combine both approaches; for instance, [[guinea worm eradication]], a single-disease international program currently run by the [[Carter Center]] has involved the training of many local volunteers, boosting bottom-up capacity, as have international programs for hygiene, sanitation, and access to primary health-care.

== Architecture ==

Often, the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] school of design is said to have primarily promoted top-down design because it taught that an architectural design should begin with a [[parti pris|parti]], a basic plan drawing of the overall project.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

By contrast, the [[Bauhaus]] focused on bottom-up design. This method manifested itself in the study of translating small-scale organizational systems to a larger, more architectural scale (as with the woodpanel carving and furniture design).

== Ecology ==
In [[ecology]], top-down control refers to when a top predator controls the structure or population dynamics of the [[ecosystem]]. The classic example is of [[kelp forest]] ecosystems. In such ecosystems, [[sea otter]]s are a [[keystone species|keystone]] predator. They prey on [[Sea urchin|urchins]] which in turn eat [[kelp]]. When otters are removed, urchin populations grow and reduce the kelp forest creating [[urchin barren]]s. In other words, such ecosystems are not controlled by productivity of the kelp but rather a top predator.

Bottom-up control in ecosystems refers to ecosystems in which the nutrient supply and productivity and type of primary producers (plants and phytoplankton) control the ecosystem structure. An example would be how plankton populations are controlled by the availability of nutrients. Plankton populations tend to be higher and more complex in areas where upwelling brings nutrients to the surface.

There are many different examples of these concepts. It is common for populations to be influenced by both types of control.

A '''Toy drive''' is a charity event that collects toys or money for them to be distributed to poor children.

==Overview==
This is usually for the celebration of [[Christmas]]. Volunteers are brought together to sort through toys to wrap and sort for age appropriateness. Appeals are made in shopping centers, schools, and other places for the public to purchase toys and to meet certain goals. Many charities or organizations will orchestrate a seasonal effort on top of their usual practices. Many police departments, fire departments, and military groups are involved in these efforts. One of the most important and famous toy drives is [[Toys For Tots]] which is operated by the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=51PC6-670MkC&amp;pg=PT164&amp;dq=%22toy+drive%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4TAPT7qvLaHjiAKk7pDUDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ 365 ways to raise funds for your nonprofit], April.

'''Special rapporteur''', '''independent expert''', and '''working group member''' are titles given to individuals working on behalf of the [[United Nations]] (UN) within the scope of "special procedure" mechanisms who have a specific country or thematic mandate from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. The term "[[rapporteur]]" is a French-derived word for an investigator who reports to a deliberative body.
 
The mandate by the United Nations has been to "examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report" on human rights problems through  "activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities."&lt;ref name="special-procedures"&gt;"[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/index.htm#code Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council]". Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the manual ''Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods'' (25 June 2008) of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures simply calls these individuals mandate-holders. Other applications of the role include "special representative of the secretary-general" or "independent expert", or a [[working group]] usually composed of five members, one from each region of the planet.

==Appointment authority==
Appointed by the Human Rights Council of the UN, these mandate-holders act independently of governments and as such play an important role in monitoring sovereign nations and democratically elected governments and policies. The earliest such appointment was the 1980 Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances responding to Commission on Human Rights resolution 20&amp;nbsp;(XXXVI). The first Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions reporting to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1982/35 begun work in 1982.
		
They do not receive any financial compensation for their work from the United Nations, though they receive personnel and logistical support from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and are often backed by charities and corporations.

To mark [[Human Rights Day]] in 2006, the 37 special rapporteurs, special representatives and independent experts issued a joint statement on the importance of human rights in the fight against poverty.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/Bulletin3.pdf Human Rights Day 2006 (10 December)]". ''Special Procedures Bulletin''. Third issue. September&amp;nbsp;–December 2006. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role description==
Special Rapporteurs often conduct fact-finding missions to countries to investigate allegations of human rights violations. They can only visit countries that have agreed to invite them.

Aside from fact-finding missions, Rapporteurs regularly assess and verify complaints from alleged victims of [[human rights violations]]. Once a complaint is verified as legitimate, an urgent letter or appeal is sent to the government that has allegedly committed the violation. If no complaint has been made, Rapporteurs may intervene on behalf of individuals and groups of people of their own accord.

==Role application==
Thematic special rapporteurs are typically appointed to serve for three years, after which their mandate can be extended for another three years. Country special rapporteurs are appointed to serve for one year, and their term is renewed every year.

==Controversies==
In June 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights, extended the mandates of all special rapporteurs by one year to enable it to conduct a review of the mandates and seek ways of strengthening their roles. However, special rapporteurs for countries which did not approve a special rapporteur came under question and the mandates of the special rapporteurs for Cuba and Belarus were not renewed.

Other controversies between the special rapporteurs and the council include the introduction of a code of conduct which initially disallowed the special rapporteurs from addressing the media. However a compromise was reached and a code of conduct now exists for the special rapporteurs.&lt;ref name="special-procedures"/&gt;

==Current thematic and country mandates==

The HRC oversees 43 thematic and 14 specific country mandates for which it can assign special rapporteurs. Currently there are at least 38 Special Rapporteurs, Special Representatives and Independent Experts who serve under the following country and thematic mandates:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/ Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council] International Justice Resources Center, June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Introduction.aspx Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council], United National Human Rights Commission, September 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vehicle License of the People's Republic of China (Information Page).jpg|thumb|VIN is recorded in Vehicle License of China.]]

A '''vehicle identification number''' ('''VIN''') is a unique code, including a [[serial number]], used by the [[automotive industry]] to identify individual [[motor vehicle]]s, [[Trailer (vehicle)|towed vehicles]], [[motorcycle]]s, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]  and [[moped]]s, as defined in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).

VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/| title = Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) | access-date = 2011-07-24 | publisher = National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats.

In 1981, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] of the United States standardized the format.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"/&gt; It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters I (i), O (o), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 1 and 0).

There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been [[vehicle title branding|written off]]. See the [[Used car]] article for a list of countries where this service is available.

==Classification==
There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.
* [[FMVSS]] 115, Part 565: Used in United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=18b4d0415b77325b50963d4312e0a382&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt49.6.565&amp;rgn=div5 |title=eCFR – Code of Federal Regulations – Title 49: Transportation – PART 565—VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VIN) REQUIREMENTS |publisher=www.ecfr.gov |date= |access-date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard 3779: Used in Europe and many other parts of the world
* [[SAE International|SAE]] J853: Very similar to the ISO standard
* [[Australian Design Rules|ADR]] 61/2 used in Australia, referring to ISO 3779 and 3780&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/asmade/bytitle/AB342EFD35B8719ECA2570CF007BE90F?OpenDocument |title=ComLaw Legislative Instruments – Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 61/02 – Vehicle Marking) 2005 (ADR 61/02) |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |access-date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Modern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3779:2009 Road vehicles—Vehicle identification number (VIN)—Content and structure&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 3780,&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles—World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html |title=United States Federal VIN Requirements (Title 49, Chapter V, Part 565) |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |date= |access-date=2010-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527210905/http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html |archive-date=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World manufacturer identifier===
The first three characters uniquely identify the [[manufacturer]] of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.

The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the U.S. assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=ISO3780&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles – World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).

In the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.

===Vehicle descriptor section===
The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&amp;nbsp;L V8.

====North American check digits====
One element that is fairly consistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, and used fairly consistently elsewhere.

===Vehicle identifier section===
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.

====Model year encoding====
One consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.

The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as "A" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the "A" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that "Y" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as "A", "B", "C", etc.

On April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, "so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place for almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years", in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:
* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.
* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.
* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980–2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.

====Plant code====
Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the factory at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.

====Production number====
In the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.

==Check-digit calculation==
Check-digit validation is compulsory for all road vehicles sold in North America.

When trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs &lt;tt&gt;5GZCZ43D13S812715&lt;/tt&gt; (correct with leading five) and &lt;tt&gt;SGZCZ43D13S812715&lt;/tt&gt; (incorrect with leading character "S"). The VINs in the Porsche image, &lt;tt&gt;WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124&lt;/tt&gt;, and the GM-T body image, &lt;tt&gt;KLATF08Y1VB363636&lt;/tt&gt;, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.

===Transliterating the numbers===
Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.

{|class="wikitable"
|+Transliteration key:&amp;nbsp;values for VIN decoding
|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}
|-
|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9
|-
|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9
|}

''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.

===Weights used in calculation===
The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.

===Worked example===
Consider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.

{|class="wikitable" style="font-size:1.2em;font-family:monospace"
|-
!VIN
||1||M||8||G||D||M||9||A|| ||K||P||0||4||2||7||8||8
|-
!Value
||1||4||8||7||4||4||9||1||0||2||7||0||4||2||7||8||8
|-

|-
!Products
||8&amp;nbsp;||28||48||35||16||12||18||10||0&amp;nbsp;||18||56||0&amp;nbsp;||24||10||28||24||16
|}

# The VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.
# Copy the ''weights'' from the above weight factor table.
# The ''products'' row is the result of the multiplication of the vertical columns: ''Value'' and ''Weight.''
# The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, ''351''.
# Find the remainder after dividing by 11&lt;br/&gt;351 [[modulo operation|MOD]] 11 = 10&lt;br/&gt;351 ÷ 11 = 31 &lt;sup&gt;'''10'''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
# The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.

With a check digit of ''X'', the VIN &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A_KP042788&lt;/tt&gt; is written &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788&lt;/tt&gt;.

A VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.

===Example code===

;Java

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
private static int transliterate(char c) {
	return "0123456789.ABCDEFGH..JKLMN.P.R..STUVWXYZ".indexOf(c) % 10;
}

private static char getCheckDigit(String vin) {
	String map = "0123456789X";
	String weights = "8765432X098765432";
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 17; ++i) {
		sum += transliterate(vin.charAt(i)) * map.indexOf(weights.charAt(i));
	}
	return map.charAt(sum % 11);
}

private static boolean validate(String vin) {
    if(vin.length()!=17) return false;
	return getCheckDigit(vin) == vin.charAt(8);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!-- No more examples in your favourite language; one is plenty to understand the algorithm --&gt;

==VIN scanning==
VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via [[OBD-II]] in newer vehicles. There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.

==List of common WMI==

'''Video recall''' in [[psychology]] is a research procedure used to obtain an individual’s subjective understanding of their own interactions with others. The procedure involves recording the participants’ interaction with another person and then asking them to review the video while providing feedback about their own interactions, behaviors, and experiences. [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] understanding includes an individual’s affective and [[cognitive]] understandings of an interpersonal event.&lt;ref name = "Welsh"&gt;Welsh, P. W., &amp; Dickson, W.D. (2005). Video-recall procedures for examining subjective understanding in observational data. ''Journal of Family Psychology, 19'', 62-71&lt;/ref&gt; Often the participants’ ratings are contrasted with the ratings of trained coders and researchers who also observe the video.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

==History of video recall==
Video recall was first used in research studies over forty years ago. However, the procedure has only been widely used for the past twenty years due to significant advances in technology. Twenty years ago, [[analog device|analog]] videotape players were a big advancement in technology, allowing for video recall to become more popular.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; Even though they were better than the previous technology used, they had many disadvantages. Analog videotape players required a large amount of equipment, significant training, large amounts of space for storage, were slow, and were prone to malfunction.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; With the movement towards digital technology, these disadvantages soon disappeared, causing video recall techniques to be much more appealing to researchers and clinicians. Furthermore, changes in psychological theory have led to the increased use of video recall. For example, family psychologists now place an increased value on individuals’ meanings and emotional perspectives, causing video recall to be an extremely useful procedure.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

==Procedures==
All video-recall studies involve recording participants' conversations in either a clinical or research setting, and having the participant or participants review the footage in any number of ways. There are three primary types of video-recall procedures that vary in multiple ways.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; Different methods are better suited for different research questions, and a combination of the three types may be used.

===Continuous===
Continuous video-recall procedures provide consistent, quantifiable data and are often used in marital studies.&lt;ref name = "Gottman"&gt;Gottman, J. M., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1985). A valid procedure for obtaining self-report of affect in marital interaction. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 53'', 156–160.(1985)&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of study, participants review video footage and rate their conversations on a single affective dimension. This may be done with a computerized joystick or a rating dial and it allows for continuous feedback. This method provides a very brief segment length (often 10 seconds), and thus gives precise analyses of interactions within a conversation. While this method only allows participants to evaluate one dimension of affect, it takes the least time of the three methods because it does not require the footage to be repeatedly paused.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt;

===Semistructured===
When semistructured video-recall procedures are used, the footage is paused at short intervals (typically every 20–30 seconds&lt;ref&gt;Halford, W. K., &amp; Sanders, M. R. (1990). The relationship of cognition and behavior during marital interaction. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 9'', 489–510.&lt;/ref&gt;) during which time participants vocalize what they were thinking or feeling during the segment. These narrations are often recorded for later reference. An alternative method involves allowing the participant to pause the recording and reflect whenever they have input instead of at standardized intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J. A., Orina, M. M., &amp; Ickes, W. (2003). When accuracy hurts, and when it helps: A test of the empathic accuracy model in marital interactions. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85'', 881–893.&lt;/ref&gt; Semistructured procedures allow for more in-depth analysis of affect, but do not translate well for data analysis. They are, however, more useful in a clinical context than the other two procedures.

===Code-specific===
Code-specific video-recall procedures provide quantifiable data on multiple affective measures. Video footage is paused at set intervals (typically 15–30 seconds), at which time participants rate the interactions of themselves as well as their partners on a series of dimensions&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, S. L. (1996). Adolescent girls’ perceptions of conversations with mothers and friends. ''Journal of Adolescent Research, 11'', 325–346.&lt;/ref&gt; that are relevant to the research question at hand. This method allows for subjective measurement of many different perceived factors as well as examination of both oneself as well as one's partner or family members. However, code-specific procedures take more time than the other methods, as the video must be repeatedly paused for substantial periods of time.

==Potential Applications of Video Recall==
Video recall is used in a variety of psychological settings. No one procedure is universally appropriate or applicable, so it is important to match specific techniques to specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;Fukkink, Ruben G.. (2008) Video feedback in widescreen: A meta-analysis of family programs. ''Clinical Psychology Review, 28.'' 904-916&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Video recall is commonly used in [[psychotherapy]] for both counseling and instruction. A therapist will record an interview or conversation with a patient, and play it back to them through different procedural means. Sometimes the patient will narrate their inner thoughts or attribution, while other times they will fill out surveys or answer questions at different intervals. A [[meta-analysis|metanalysis]] of clinical technique of video recall suggested that this method is most effective for families with small children; parents learn successful rearing styles from their own mistakes caught on film. This analysis also suggested that video recall is more successful with skill-learning and instruction than coping mechanisms. However, a successful use of video recall in a [[therapeutic]] session is the recording of a conversation between two family members or friends; both will measure their responses while watching, and comparing answers can yield successful results.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

Video recall is also a tool that therapists use to understand their patients. The therapist will record a typical conversation either in the patient's day to day encounters or between the patient and the therapist, and the patient will narrate their understanding of the situation. This is a tool used to overcome cultural barriers.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

===Observation and Intervention===
Observational and interventional methods of video recall are most often used in experimental measures of attribution, emotion and social interaction.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt; Video recall is extremely useful because it can measure patterns in both everyday situations and experimental settings in a less intrusive way than a round table discussion. Video recall can be useful in both group and individual settings.Recall can also measure changes between gender, age, and other [[demographic]] factors, as it allows for specific time-stamping: it contains both quick reactions and long-term feelings. In Welsh's 2005 study of different techniques of video recall, he cites "social constructionism, attachment theory, cognitive–behavioral theories, and symbolic interactionism as theories that are commonly measured through video recall.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; Much can be inferred from the relationship between cognitive processes and actual events, as it allows for more personalized coding and measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea, Deborah J., Mathes, Sharon A., Hardin, Kelly. (1997) Video Recall for Analysis of Performance By Collegiate Female Tennis Players. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills, 85'' 1354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
Validity is an important aspect of video recall. It is crucial that the researcher provides clear instruction about what specific parts of the video the subject should measure. For example, if a researcher is studying attribution, they should make clear whether the subject should measure their feelings in the past or present, which perspective they should take, and when to measure certain parts.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt; Delay can be an issue in continuous settings, as subjects may react at different times due to a number of factors. However, Gottman's 1985 study on the use of continuous technique suggested that delay may not change overall effects.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt;

A way to ensure validity is to utilize inter and intra-rater reliability methods, including time-series analysis. This involves the use of multiple methods at a time. A commonly used method that works alongside video recall is various physiological measures, like heart rate, pulese, cortisol sampling, ACT and skin conductance &lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt; This ensures that rating is consistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7524">The '''Waelz process''' is a method of recovering [[zinc]] and other relatively low boiling point metals from metallurgical waste (typically EAF flue dust) and other recycled materials using a rotary kiln ('''''waelz kiln''''').

The zinc enriched product is referred to as '''''waelz oxide''''', and the reduced zinc by product as '''''waelz slag'''''.

==History and description==
The concept of using a [[rotary kiln]] for the recovery of Zinc by volatization dates to at least 1888.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|p=11}} A process was patented by Edward Dedolph in 1910. Subsequently, the Dedpolph patent was taken up and developed by [[Metallgesellschaft]] (Frankfurt) with [[Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron]] but without leading to a production scale ready process. In 1923 the [[Krupp Grusonwerk]] independently developed a process (1923), named the ''Waelz process'' (from the German ''Waelzen'', a reference to the motion of the materials in the kiln); the two German firms later collaborated and improved the process marketing under the name ''Waelz-Gemeinschaft'' (German for Waelz association).{{sfn|Harris|1936}}

The process consists of treating zinc containing material, in which zinc can be in the form [[zinc oxide]], [[zinc silicate (disambiguation)|zinc silicate]], [[zinc ferrite]], [[zinc sulphide]] together with a carbon containing reductant/fuel, within a rotary kiln at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|p=11}} The kiln feed material comprising zinc 'waste', fluxes and reductant (coke) is typically pelletized before addition to the kiln.&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; The chemical process involves the reduction of zinc compounds to elemental zinc (boiling point 907&amp;nbsp;°C) which volatalises, which oxidises in the vapour phase to zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is collected from the kiln outlet exhaust by filters/electrostatic precipitators/settling chambers etc.{{sfn|Clay|Schoonraad|1976|pp=11, 13}}&lt;ref name="z2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|Daley|Stephens|2000|loc = [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118788073.ch29/summary Recovery of Zinc Oxide from secondary raw materials : New developments of the Waelz Process]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiln size is typically {{convert|50|by|3.6|m}} long / internal diameter, with a rotation speed of around 1 rpm. The recovered dust (''Waelz oxide'') is enriched in zinc oxide and is a feed product for zinc smelters, the zinc reduced by-product is known as ''Waelz slag''. Sub-optimal features of the process are high energy consumption, and lack of iron recovery (and iron rich slag).&lt;ref name="z2000"/&gt; The process also captures other low boiling metals in the ''waelz oxide'' including lead, cadmium and silver.{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|p=118}} Halogen compounds are also present in the product oxide.{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|p=119}}

Increased use of [[galvanised]] steel has resulted in increased levels of zinc in steel scrap which in turn leads to higher levels of zinc in [[electric arc furnace]] flue dusts - as of 2000 the waelz process is considered to be a "[[best available technology]]" for flue dust zinc recovery, and the process is used at industrial scale worldwide.{{sfn|Stewart|Daley|Stephens|2000|loc = [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118788073.ch29/summary Recovery of Zinc Oxide from secondary raw materials : New developments of the Waelz Process]}}

As of 2014 the Waelz process is the preferred or most widely used process for zinc recovery of zinc from [[electric arc furnace]] dust (90%).{{sfn|Antrekowitsch|Steinlechner|Unger|Rösler|2014|pp=117-118, 119}}

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Signing of the EOA.jpg|thumb|280px|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signs the Poverty Bill (also known as the Economic Opportunity Act) while press and supporters of the bill look on, August 20, 1964]]
The '''War on Poverty''' is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his [[State of the Union address]] on Wednesday, January 8, 1964. This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national [[poverty]] rate of around nineteen percent.  The speech led the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which established the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty.

As a part of the [[Great Society]], Johnson believed in expanding the federal government's roles in education and health care as [[poverty reduction]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;These justifications and aspects of the war on poverty are discussed in Weisbrod, Burton, ed. ''The Economics of Poverty: An American Paradox'', Prentice-Hall, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies can also be seen as a continuation of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], which ran from 1933 to 1937, and the [[Four Freedoms]] of 1941. Johnson stated, "Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rector|first1=Robert|last2=Sheffield|first2=Rachel|title=The War on Poverty After 50 Years|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/09/the-war-on-poverty-after-50-years|accessdate=May 13, 2015|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the War on Poverty policy initiative remains in the continued existence of such federal programs as [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], [[Volunteers in Service to America]] (VISTA), [[TRIO (program)|TRiO]], and [[Job Corps]].

Deregulation, growing criticism of the [[welfare state]], and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996, which President [[Bill Clinton]] claimed, "ended welfare as we know it."

==Major initiatives==
* [[The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]] which created the [[Community Action Program]], [[Job Corps]] and [[AmeriCorps VISTA|Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)]], centerpiece of the "war on poverty" – August 20, 1964
* [[Food Stamp Act of 1964]] – August 31, 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/rules/Legislation/about.htm|title=A Short History of SNAP – Food and Nutrition Service|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] – April 11, 1965
* [[Social Security Amendments of 1965|Social Security Act 1965]] (Created Medicare and Medicaid) – July 19, 1965

The [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] was the agency responsible for administering most of the War on Poverty programs created during Johnson's Administration, including [[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]], [[Job Corps]], [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[legal aid|Legal Services]] and the [[Community Action Program]]. The OEO was established in 1964 and quickly became a target of both left-wing and right-wing critics of the War on Poverty. Directors of the OEO included [[Sargent Shriver]], [[Bertrand Harding]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]].

The OEO launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965.  The project was designed to help end poverty by providing preschool children from low-income families with a program that would meet emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.  Head Start was then transferred to the [[Office of Child Development]] in the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (later the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]) by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1969.

President Johnson also announced a second project to follow children from the Head Start program. This was implemented in 1967 with [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational experiment ever conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, M. (1998). Teach Your Children Well. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy trains disadvantaged and at-risk youth and has provided more than 2 million disadvantaged young people with the integrated academic, vocational, and social skills training they need to gain independence and get quality, long-term jobs or further their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fattah.house.gov/national-job-resources/|title=Congressman Chaka Fattah: National Job Resources |website=house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job Corps continues to help 70,000 youths annually at 122 Job Corps centers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-corp.org/Partners/partnerships.html|title=Partnerships – Partners|website=new-corp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides vocational training, many Job Corps also offer [[GED]] programs as well as [[high school]] diplomas and programs to get students into [[college]].

[[File:Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate 1959 to 2011. United States..PNG|thumb|400px|Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate: 1959 to 2015. United States.]]
In the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty, poverty rates in the U.S. dropped to their lowest level since comprehensive records began in 1958: from  17.3% in the year the Economic Opportunity Act was implemented to 11.1% in 1973. They have remained between 11 and 15.2% ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf Table B-1 page 56]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that the steep decline in poverty rates began in 1959, 5 years before the introduction of the war on poverty (see figure 4 below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html|title=Poverty|website=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'absolute poverty line' is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health. Poverty among Americans between ages 18–64 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 down to less than 17%, although it has risen again to 20% in 2009.&lt;ref name="Data Across States"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Trend.aspx?order=a&amp;loc=1&amp;ind=43&amp;dtm=322&amp;tf=11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c35%2c38 |title=Children in poverty – Data Across States |publisher=KIDS COUNT Data Center, [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]] |location=Baltimore |date=September 2011 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.

In 2004, more than 35.9 million, or 12% of Americans including 12.1 million children, were considered to be living in poverty with an average growth of almost 1 million per year. According to the [[Cato Institute]], a libertarian think tank, since the Johnson Administration, almost $15 trillion has been spent on welfare, with poverty rates being about the same as during the Johnson Administration.&lt;ref name="Matt Cover"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cnsnews.com/news/article/study-more-half-trillion-dollars-spent-welfare-poverty-levels-unaffected |title=Study: More Than Half a Trillion Dollars Spent on Welfare But Poverty Levels Unaffected |first=Matt |last=Cover |website=[[Cybercast News Service|CNSNews.com]] |publisher=[[Media Research Center]] |location=Alexandria, VA |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study published by [[Columbia University]] asserts that without the [[social safety net]], the poverty rate would have been 29% for 2012, instead of 16%.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary A. Goldfarb (December 9, 2013).

''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved January 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OECD]] data from 2012, the poverty rate before taxes and [[Transfer payment|transfers]] was 28.3%, while the poverty rate after taxes and transfers fell to 17.4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compareyourcountry.org/inequality?cr=usa&amp;cr1=oecd&amp;lg=en&amp;page=1 Compare your country: Income distribution and poverty]. [[OECD]]. Retrieved January 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OEO was dismantled by President Nixon in 1973, though many of the agency's programs were transferred to other government agencies.

According to the ''Readers' Companion to U.S. Women's History'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many observers point out that the War on Poverty's attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mankiller"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mankiller|editor1-first=Wilma|editor2-last=Mink|editor2-first=Gwendolyn|editor3-last=Navarro|editor3-first=Marysa|editor4-last=Smith|editor4-first=Barbara|editor5-last=Steinem|editor5-first=Gloria|title=The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/5867648/|accessdate=6 May 2009|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780395671733|page=720|chapter=Great Society/War on Poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Joseph A. Califano, Jr.]] wrote in 1999 in an issue of the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' that:&lt;ref name="Califano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |title=What Was Really Great About The Great Society: The truth behind the conservative myths |first=Joseph A., Jr. |last=Califano |website=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=October 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326175845/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In waging the war on poverty, congressional opposition was too strong to pass an income maintenance law. So LBJ took advantage of the biggest automatic cash machine around: Social Security. He proposed, and Congress enacted, whopping increases in the minimum benefits that lifted some two million Americans 65 and older above the poverty line. In 1996, thanks to those increased minimum benefits, Social Security lifted 12 million senior citizens above the poverty line&amp;nbsp;... No Great Society undertaking has been subjected to more withering conservative attacks than the Office of Economic Opportunity. Yet, the War on Poverty was founded on the most conservative principle: Put the power in the local community, not in Washington; give people at the grassroots the ability to stand tall on their own two feet. Conservative claims that the OEO poverty programs were nothing but a waste of money are preposterous&amp;nbsp;... Eleven of the 12 programs that OEO launched in the mid-'60s are alive, well and funded at an annual rate exceeding $10 billion; apparently legislators believe they're still working.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and critique==
{{See also|Criticisms of welfare}}

President Johnson's "War on Poverty" speech was delivered at a time of recovery (the poverty level had fallen from 22.4% in 1959 to 19% in 1964 when the War on Poverty was announced) and it was viewed by critics as an effort to get the United States Congress to authorize [[social welfare]] programs.&lt;ref name="NASWDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naswdc.org/pubs/news/2011/01/poverty-imperative.asp |title=Social Work's Poverty Imperative|website=NASWDC |first=Elizabeth J.|last=Clark|date=January 2011|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, including [[Milton Friedman]], have argued that Johnson's policies actually had a negative impact on the economy because of their interventionist nature, noting in a [[PBS]] interview that "the government sets out to eliminate poverty, it has a war on poverty, so-called "poverty" increases.

Prof. [[Tony Judt]], the late historian, said in reference to the earlier proposed title of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that "a more Orwellian title would be hard to conceive" and attributed the decline in the popularity of the [[Great Society]] as a policy to its success, as fewer people feared hunger, sickness, and ignorance. Additionally, fewer people were concerned with ensuring a minimum standard for all citizens and [[social liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Tony Judt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/dec/17/what-is-living-and-what-is-dead-in-social-democrac/?pagination=false |title=What Is Living and What Is Dead in Social Democracy? |website=[[The New York Review of Books]] |location=New York |first=Tony |last=Judt |authorlink=Tony Judt |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative]] Research Fellow at [[the Independent Institute]] James L. Payne followed this line of thinking when he wrote that "the war on poverty was a costly, tragic mistake [because]...abolishing poverty did not seem far-fetched to the activists&amp;nbsp;... [and] it was a perspective that led to intolerance&amp;nbsp;... The simple economic theory of poverty led to a single underlying principle for welfare programs&amp;nbsp;... In adopting the handout approach for their programs, the war-on-poverty activists failed to notice&amp;nbsp;– or failed to care&amp;nbsp;– that they were ignoring over a century of theory and experience in the social welfare field&amp;nbsp;... The war-on-poverty activists not only ignored the lessons of the past on the subject of handouts; they also ignored their own experience with the poor."&lt;ref name="FEE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/why-the-war-on-poverty-failed#axzz2TxBdA4VP |title=Why the War on Poverty Failed Handouts Provide the Wrong Incentives|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]] |first=James L.|last=Payne |date=January 1, 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] also criticized the War on Poverty's programs, writing "The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life."&lt;ref name=Sowell&gt;[https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2004/08/17/a-painful-anniversary-n1190382 A painful anniversary]. [[Thomas Sowell]], Townhall.com, 17 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Others took a different tack. In 1967, in his book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' [[Martin Luther King]] "criticized Johnson's War on Poverty for being too piecemeal", saying that  programs created under the "war on poverty" such as "housing programs, job training and family counseling" all had "a fatal disadvantage [because] the programs have never proceeded on a coordinated basis...[and noted that] at no time has a total, coordinated and fully adequate program been conceived."&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/dr-martin-luther-kings-economics-through-jobs-freedom |title=Dr. Martin Luther King's Economics: Through Jobs, Freedom |website=[[The Nation]] |first=Mark |last=Engler |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech on April 4, 1967 at Riverside Church in New City, King connected the war in Vietnam with the "war on poverty":

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor&amp;nbsp;–both black and white&amp;nbsp;– through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such. Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rev. Martin Luther King |title=Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/058.html|website=hartford-hwp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism was repeated in his speech at the same place later that month when he said that "and you may not know it, my friends, but it is estimated that we spend $500,000 to kill each enemy soldier, while we spend only fifty-three dollars for each person classified as poor, and much of that fifty-three dollars goes for salaries to people that are not poor. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor, and attack it as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet/riversidetranscript.html|title=Social Activism Sound Recording Project |publisher=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, King started the [[Poor People's Campaign]] to address the shortcomings of the "war on poverty" and to "demand a check" for suffering African-Americans which was carried on briefly after his death with the construction and maintenance of an encampment, Resurrection City, for over six weeks.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/race/ |title=The Two Nations of Black America|publisher=[[PBS]] |first=Henry Louis|last=Gates |date=February 10, 1998 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, a writer in ''The Nation'' remarked that "the war on poverty has too often been a war on the poor themselves," but that much can be done.&lt;ref name="MHP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172054/what-real-war-poverty-looks|title=What a Real 'War on Poverty' Looks Like|website=[[The Nation]] |first=James|last=Cersonsky |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the former executive officer of the Task Force on Poverty Hyman Bookbinder addressed such criticisms of the "war on poverty" in an op-ed in ''The New York Times''. He wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today, the ranks of the poor are again swelling&amp;nbsp;... These and other statistics have led careless observers to conclude that the war on poverty failed. No, it has achieved many good results. Society has failed. It tired of the war too soon, gave it inadequate resources and did not open up new fronts as required. Large-scale homelessness, an explosion of teen-age pregnancies and single-parent households, rampant illiteracy, drugs and crime – these have been both the results of and causes of persistent poverty. While it is thus inappropriate to celebrate an anniversary of the war on poverty, it is important to point up some of the big gains&amp;nbsp;... Did every program of the 60's work? Was every dollar used to its maximum potential? Should every Great Society program be reinstated or increased? Of course not&amp;nbsp;... First, we cannot afford not to resume the war. One way or another, the problem will remain expensive. Somehow, we will provide for the survival needs of the poorest: welfare, food stamps, beds and roofs for the homeless, Medicaid. The fewer poor there are, the fewer the relief problems. Getting people out of poverty is the most cost-effective public investment."&lt;ref name="task force"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/opinion/did-the-war-on-poverty-fail.html|title=Did the War on Poverty Fail?|work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Hyman|last=Bookbinder|date=August 20, 1989|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, [[Paul Ryan]] released his "[[The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later]]" report, asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful.&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/|title=The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later|publisher=Budget Committee of the House of Representatives|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs.&lt;ref name="WOP_report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|title=Rep. Paul Ryan calls for cuts in anti-poverty programs |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ryan-poverty-20140304,0,24042.story#ixzz2v8iTKEln|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 6, 2014|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the appendix titled "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements have "implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones."&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOP_report"/&gt; Several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/04/Economists-Say-Paul-Ryan-Misrepresented-Their-Research |title=Economists Say Paul Ryan Misrepresented Their Research |last1=Garver |first1=Rob |date=March 4, 2014 |website=The Fiscal Times |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''−1''' is the [[additive inverse]] of [[1 (number)|1]], that is, the number that when [[addition|added]] to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the [[negative number|negative]] [[integer]] greater than negative two (−2) and less than&amp;nbsp;[[0 (number)|0]].

Negative one bears relation to [[Euler's identity]] since ''e''{{sup|''i''{{pi}}}} = −1.

In [[software development]], '''−1''' is a common initial value for integers and is also used to show that [[Sentinel value|a variable contains no useful information]].

In [[programming languages]], '''−1''' can be used to [[array slicing|index]] the last (or 2nd last) item of an [[array data structure|array]], depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.

'''Negative one''' has some similar but slightly different properties to positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrh89dLWZqEC Mathematical analysis and applications]
 By Jayant V. Deshpande, {{ISBN|1-84265-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic properties ==
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=1\cdot x+(-1)\cdot x=(1+(-1))\cdot x=0 \cdot x=0&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot x=(0+0)\cdot x=0\cdot x+0\cdot x \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

so (−1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x'', or&amp;nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.

=== Square of −1 ===
The [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.

For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot 0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\cdot1+(-1)\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\cdot(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.

=== Square roots of −1 ===
Although there are no [[Real number| real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 has infinite solutions]].

== Exponentiation to negative integers ==
[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.

−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.

== Computer representation ==
{{Main|Signed number representations}}
Most computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring "11111111", or "FF" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string "11111111" above represents 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;255.

== Programming languages ==
In some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.
If the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.
If the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.
