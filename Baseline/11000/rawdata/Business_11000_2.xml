'''Alan Gibbs''' (born 1939) is a New Zealand-born businessman, entrepreneur and art collector. After a successful business career in New Zealand, which made him one of that country's wealthiest individuals, he relocated to London in 1999. He retains strong links to New Zealand through his development of [[Gibbs Farm]], one of the world's leading [[sculpture park]]s. He is the founder of '''Gibbs Amphibians''', based in Detroit, Michigan, [[Nuneaton]], UK, and [[Auckland]], New Zealand, which pioneers high-speed [[amphibious vehicle]] technologies.

==Early life==
Alan Gibbs was born in [[Christchurch]], the son of Theodore Nisbet Gibbs and Elsie Gibbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Goldsmith| first=Paul| title=TN Gibbs| year=2002| publisher=David Ling| location=Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an accountant, [[tax adviser]] and businessman. He was chairman of a 1951 Royal Commission on Taxation. The family moved to [[Wellington]] in 1947 and Alan attended [[Wadestown Primary School]], [[Wellesley College (New Zealand)|Wellesley College]] and [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]]. He undertook three out of four years of an engineering degree at [[Canterbury University]], before switching to economics, completing a BA in 1961. The following year he gained an MA in Economics from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].

==New Zealand business career==
Gibbs went to London in 1963 as Third Secretary in the [[High Commission of New Zealand, London|New Zealand High Commission]], returning to New Zealand in 1965 to work in the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Prime Minister's department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Goldsmith| first=Paul| title=Serious Fun: the life and times of Alan Gibbs| year=2012| publisher=[[Random House]]| location=Auckland| isbn=978-1-86979-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left soon after with a dream to build what he promoted as the first New Zealand car, the [[Anziel Nova]]. In New Zealand's then highly regulated economy he failed to gain the necessary import licences to build the cars, and abandoned the scheme in 1970 after a four-year battle. Gibbs then moved to Sydney for two years, where he worked as a [[merchant bank]]er, returning to set up the [[Chase (bank)|Chase]]-[[National Australia Bank|NAB]] merchant bank in Auckland in 1972. After an early retirement in 1975, he established Gibbs, Saint and Co. in 1977, specialising in corporate advisory work. This later became Gibbs Securities Ltd. 
 
Gibbs' career took off in 1979 when, with three other investors, he purchased Tappenden Motors Ltd. They [[liquidated]] it profitably over the next few years. Gibbs then gained stakes in Atlas Majestic Industries, Bendon and [[Ceramco]], three prominent New Zealand public companies which he merged in 1986 and 1987 and that was liquidated in 1989. Meantime, in 1985 he and Trevor Farmer made a successful $114 million takeover bid for the publicly listed transport and security company Freightways Ltd. In early 1990 the [[Fourth Labour Government]] confirmed it would sell the [[Telecom Corporation of New Zealand]]. Together with merchant banker [[David Richwhite]], Gibbs brokered the $4.25 billion winning bid for the company, which when subsequently floated became the largest company on the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]]. As part of the deal, Gibbs became a director and he and Farmer took a 5 per cent holding in the company. Following a second round of restructuring, led by Gibbs, this holding proved very valuable.

Also in 1990 Gibbs and Farmer invested in and worked with [[Craig Heatley]] to develop [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky TV]], New Zealand's first [[pay television]] company. Gibbs sold most of his New Zealand assets in the late 1990s, retaining Gibbs Farm and an interest in Viaduct Harbour Holdings, the owner of a new waterfront precinct in downtown Auckland and a property portfolio in Wellington with Andrew Wall.

==Political activism==
Having been a member of the New Left Club at Canterbury University, Gibbs had converted to strongly-held [[free-market]] views by the late 1970s. He became a strong supporter of [[Roger Douglas]], the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] in the reforming Fourth Labour Government, 1984–90. Gibbs was appointed chairman of the NZ Forestry Corporation, which in 1987 corporatised the old [[New Zealand Forest Service]]. The loss-making department was restructured and transformed into a profitable [[Government-owned corporation#New Zealand|State Owned Enterprise]]. He was also appointed chairman of the Hospital and Related Services Taskforce, with a brief to recommend reforms for the underperforming public hospital service. Their suggestions, which focused on introducing an internal market into the system, were not taken up by the Labour government but were partially implemented by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|next National Government]].

Gibbs also founded the [[Centre for Independent Studies]] in New Zealand and was an active member of the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]]. He is a member of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], founded by the Austrian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Gibbs was active in the establishment of [[ACT New Zealand]], a [[libertarian political party]] that was formed in 1994. ACT won seven seats in the parliament after the first election under proportional representation in 1996, and has continued to be represented in Parliament since.

==Art and sculpture collection at Gibbs Farm==
Gibbs is one of New Zealand's leading [[art collector]]s, and since 1991 has been establishing a sprawling {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}} sculpture park at [[Gibbs Farm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gibbsfarm.org.nz/| title=Gibbs Farm official website| year=2010| accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://venturebees.com/sculpture-in-the-gibbs-farm/| title=Sculpture in the Gibbs Farm| publisher=VentureBees| date=4 August 2012| accessdate=20 September 2012| author=Haseeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is located on [[Kaipara Harbour]] on New Zealand's [[North Island]], {{convert|50|km}} north of Auckland in the [[Rodney District|Rodney district]].

Among the art works installed on The Farm are monumental pieces by contemporary artists including [[Daniel Buren]], [[Neil Dawson]], [[Marijke de Goey]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Anish Kapoor]], [[George Rickey]], [[Richard Serra]] and [[Bernar Venet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistedsifter.com/2012/07/the-sculptures-of-gibbs-farm-new-zealand/ The Incredible Sculptures of Gibbs Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robgarrettcfa.com/content/2009/06/01/the-farm-alan-gibbs "The Farm"] by Rob Garrett - retrieved 15 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==High speed amphibians==
[[File:UoC graduation April 2014 42.JPG|thumb|Gibbs receiving an honorary doctorate from [[University of Canterbury]] Chancellor [[John Wood (diplomat)|John Wood]] in April 2014]]
Frustrated by the extreme tidal nature of the [[Kaipara Harbour]], that forms the western boundary of his farm, Gibbs began experimenting with [[amphibious vehicle]]s in the early 1990s. In 1997 he began to develop the concept in Detroit. Gibbs relocated the project to the United Kingdom in 1999. He partnered with Neil Jenkins who became CEO and based the operation at Nuneaton. Over the next four years they developed the concept to the point that the [[Aquada]], the world's first road-legal, high-speed amphibian, was shown to the public in September 2003. In June 2004 [[Richard Branson]] drove an Aquada to break the record for an amphibious [[English Channel#Notable channel crossings|crossing of the English Channel]]. In 2007 a new division of the business was set up in Detroit. A major R &amp; D program has been undertaken in Auckland since 2004. Two new high-speed amphibians, the [[Humdinga]] and the [[Gibbs Phibian|Phibian]], were released in Washington in 2012, and a third, the [[Quadski]], arrived on the market in early 2013.

==Personal==
Gibbs was married to Jennifer Gore (now Dame [[Jenny Gibbs]]) for 33 years. They have three daughters, Amanda, Debbi and Emma, and one son, Thane.

'''As is''' is a [[legal]] term used to disclaim some [[implied warranty|implied warranties]] for an item being sold. Certain types of implied warranties must be specifically disclaimed, such as the implied warranty of title.  "As is" denotes that the seller is selling, and the buyer is buying an item in whatever condition it presently exists, and that the buyer is accepting the item "with all faults", whether or not immediately apparent. This is the classic "[[caveat emptor|buyer beware]]" situation, where the careful buyer should take the time to examine the item before accepting it, or obtain expert advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/as+is
 |title      = As Is
 |work    = TheFreeDictionary.com
 |accessdate = 2013-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the phrase "as is" does not disclaim express warranties, such as those created by the seller's description of an item. In other words, the item may be sold "as is," but if the item does not conform to the seller's description, the buyer has a right to reject it.

For example, a seller of a used [[automobile]] sells his car to a buyer, and puts into the [[contract of sale]] the statement: "The buyer accepts the automobile AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS." Two minutes after the buyer drives off with it, the [[engine]] seizes, and the car stalls. Unless the buyer can show that there was some [[fraud]] involved, or the seller breached an express warranty, the buyer is not entitled to a refund. This would be a specific example where [[fraud in the inducement]] could outweigh anything in the contract, express or implied: it simply doesn't matter what disclaimer or limitations may be found in the contract, if the contract is void (or voidable) for any reason.

Disgruntled buyers of [[real estate]], and their respective improvements, may be faced with other complicated [[property law]] issues if a [[deed]] is conveyed as a result of a contract with an "as is" clause. In real estate, these are the larger potential problems than issues with the structure itself, which can be drawn out with an inspector.  Searching public records is often difficult, and often done lazily by the seller; this means that the buyer may be burdened with [[liens]] on the home, and face various fees related to things such as public utilities.

In many jurisdictions disclaimer of various implied warranties is void. For instance, laws on [[consumer protection]], and [[unfair contract terms]] may limit the ability of a manufacturer or seller to limit or exclude liability for various types of damage. See, for instance, the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] and [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]].

The '''Association des industries d'Haïti''' (ADIH), founded in 1980, is an association of around 100 manufacturers in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adih.ht|title=Association des industries d'Haïti|language=French|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is currently headed by president George B. Sassine. It is best known internationally for its work promoting assembly plants in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;

== Chronology ==
In early 1986, during a period of social upheaval, the ADIH called on the government of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] to exercise "tolerance and moderation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ceïbe|first1=Cathy|title=Le 7 février 1986.

In 1989, it began lobbying efforts on the issue of textile quotas for Haiti.&lt;ref name="AAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; After the [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide#1991 coup d'état|1991 coup d'état]] which brought general [[Raoul Cédras]] to power, the association managed escrow accounts for tax collection from foreign corporate entities in Haiti until 1994.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;  In 2004, the association stated that they viewed the second overthrow of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] as a positive development.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; In coordination with [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref name="KQ_Haiti"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Katz |first1=Jonathan |title=The King and Queen of Haiti |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/clinton-foundation-haiti-117368 |website=Politico |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |date=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; they successfully lobbied the US government from 2003 to 2006 to ensure that textiles coming from Haiti would no longer be subject to import tariffs.  (Cf.  [[Economy of Haiti|HOPE &amp; HELP]])&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stefan Viard (trans.)|author2=Patrick Saint Pré|author3=Juno Jean Baptiste|title=The ADIH fully supports the renewal of HOPE|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/139536/The-ADIH-fully-supports-the-renewal-of-HOPE|website=Le Nouvelliste|accessdate=October 24, 2016|language=English|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, they opposed the parliamentary vote to raise the minimum wage in Haiti to 200 gourdes an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michel|first1=Carlin|title=L'ADIH rejette le salaire minimum|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/70215/LADIH-rejette-le-salaire-minimum|website=Le Nouvelliste|language=French|accessdate=October 24, 2016|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 the association again lobbied against a minimum wage increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ADIH|title=Le cri de l'ADIH|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/124555/Le-cri-de-lADIH|language=French|website=Le Nouvelliste|accessdate=October 24, 2016|date=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that strikes would damage the Haitian garment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lall|first1=Rashmee Roshan|title=Haiti minimum wage increase ignites competition row in textile industry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/31/haiti-minimum-wage-increase-ignites-row-textile-industry|website=The Guardian|accessdate=November 5, 2016|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They likewise argued against a minimum wage increase in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberson|first1=Alphonse|title=Salaire minimum : le CSS tranche, l’ADIH inconfortable, l’exécutif joue le temps…|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/158630/Salaire-minimum-le-CSS-tranche-lADIH-inconfortable-lexecutif-joue-le-temps|website=Le Nouvelliste|language=French|accessdate=October 24, 2016|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bank payment obligation''' ('''BPO''') is a class of settlement solution in international [[supply chain]] finance.

The solution is championed by [[SWIFT]] and the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) Banking Commission as a means to move away from [[letter of credit]] schemes toward "support[ing] the development of a globally accepted standardised environment and establishment of the BPO as a neutral industry-wide practice".

==History==
The ''[[International Chamber of Commerce]] (Banking Commission) Bank Payments Obligation Working Group'' (ICC-BPO) held its first meeting in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in March 2011 with the participation of nine banks. The ICC Banking Commission and SWIFT developed the ''Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligations'' (URBPO), which were launched on 24 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Articles/2013/Dubai-Chamber-and-ICC-regional-launch-of-BPO-rules/ | title=Dubai Chamber and ICC regional launch of BPO rules | date =24 June 2013 | publisher  =ICC | accessdate =10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7581">A '''business interoperability interface''' (BII) is an interface that enables business interoperability between organizational systems. The term was coined by the [[European Commission]] in the European Interoperability Framework&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2004): [http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=19529 European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment Services – Version 1.0.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614155829/http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=19529 |date=June 14, 2009 }} Retrieved 2010-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; where such interfaces are recommended to improve the interoperability of public administrations that internally use different standards.

Though the BII description of the European Commission remains vague, the following requirements are described: The BII should describe entry and exit points to the internal [[business process]]es of an organization and it should describe the contribution and commitments the collaboration partners require from each other in a formal way. Furthermore, the BII should enable the enactment of collaborative business processes and interconnect the business processes of different organizations. This description implies that the main objective of the BII is to describe to collaboration partners how they can interact with an organization.

== Interface ==
An [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interface interface] represents the point of interconnection between two systems or subsystems.  Since collaborative business always comprises interactions between organizational systems (e. g. enterprises or departments), interfaces are an essential element in the development of collaborative business processes. In the context of organizations working together, interface descriptions should describe those characteristics of a system that are relevant for adjacent systems. 
While interfaces in [[information system]]s formerly concentrated on technical aspects, e.g. by describing [[Application Programming Interfaces]], recent developments like [[Service-oriented architecture|Service-oriented Architecture]] shifted the attention to conceptual interfaces aiming at a business-level description of services and organizational boundaries.

== Business interoperability ==
In a similar vein it was argued, that previous interoperability definitions focused too much on technical aspects. In consequence, the term Business Interoperability was proposed, for example defined as "''the organizational and operational ability of an enterprise to cooperate with its business partners and to efficiently establish, conduct and develop IT-supported business relationships with the objective to create value''".&lt;ref&gt;Legner, Christine; Wende, Kristin (2006): [http://www.bledconference.org/proceedings.nsf/0/978ff10dff1d440bc125718000316bbe/$FILE/18_Legner.pdf Towards an Excellence Framework for Business Interoperability]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725084655/http://www.bledconference.org/proceedings.nsf/0/978ff10dff1d440bc125718000316bbe/%24FILE/18_Legner.pdf |date=July 25, 2011 }}. Proceedings of the 19th Bled eConference eValues. Bled, Slovenia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interoperability]] is usually understood as the capability of autonomous systems "to exchange information and be able to use it",&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY: 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply put: the capability of autonomous system to work together or to [[Collaboration|collaborate]]. Since "working together" of autonomous organizations means that they execute a collaborative business process, Business Interoperability can also be defined as &lt;br /&gt; ''... the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them''.&lt;ref&gt;Ziemann (2010): Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - An enterprise Model-based Approach for Describing and Enacting Collaborative Business Processes. Logos, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Based on the definitions of business interoperability and interface the term BII can be defined as follows:

''The Business Interoperability Interface of an organization comprises all information that is relevant for partner organizations in order to enact a collaborative business process with the organization. The interface comprises those elements of a collaborative business process, which are provided by the organization itself as well as the elements, the organization expects from partner organizations.''&lt;ref&gt;Ziemann, Joerg; Loos, Peter (2009): Transforming cross-organizational processes between European Administrations – Towards a comprehensive Business Interoperability Interface. In: Weerakkody, V.; Janssen, M.; Dwivedi, Y. (Eds.): Handbook of Research on ICT-Enabled Transformational Government: A Global Perspective.{{ISBN|978-1-60566-390-6}}, pp. 93–116&lt;/ref&gt;

The BII contents are not restricted to process descriptions: in order to enact a collaborative business process, the collaboration partners do not only need to know the sequence in which activities are executed but also require complementary information like organizational roles, specifics of individual activities or document types. Likewise, the description of the BII should cover different levels of technical granularity since the systematic enactment of collaborative business processes requires models on both the business and the technical level.

== Implementations ==
An EU-research project, aiming at improving interoperability between European public administrations, delivered a proposal for designing and implementing a Business Interoperability Interface, which was later refined in scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;R4eGov IOP Architecture and IOP Lifecycle (Version 1). Deliverable WP4-D7, 2008. R4eGov – Towards e-Administration in the large, project number IST-2004-026650.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illustration summarizes the idea of this BII implementation: Organization A and B each has an internal/private view on its information system. From this internal model, they derive a view for their collaboration partner. For example, in the public process of Organization A, only those activities of the private process from Organization A are comprised which are relevant for the collaboration partner (i.e. Organization B). All these public elements are then bundled in the BII where a collaboration partner can read them. If the elements of adjacent BII-elements fit together and all collaboration partners agreed on how to interpret them, they are also called global elements.

[[File:Business Interoperability Interface.jpg|thumb|right|Concept for a Business Interoperability Interface]]

The BII described there tackles four enterprise dimensions: In the organization dimension, roles, units and other organization elements relevant for the collaboration are described and related to internal elements. This ensures for example, that the collaboration partners have a common understanding of the interacting roles. In the data dimension, document types used in the collaboration are defined and related to internally used document types. In the function dimension, business functions and services offered in the collaboration are described. In the process dimension, the processes that each organization offers are described as well as how these public processes are related to adjacent processes of partner organizations.

In 2006, no charges were filed after Los Angeles police found a collection of twelve rifles and four handguns at Freer's home in an investigation that led to his arrest on suspicion of impersonating a San Gabriel Valley Transit Authority police officer to buy a .44 Magnum handgun. Authorities dropped the investigation after Freer established that he did not impersonate a police officer and showed a valid gun permit.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/27/local/me-ferrari27 |title=2nd Arrest Made in Ferrari Case |author=Richard Winton |author2=David Pierson |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-04-27 |accessdate=2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the law firm [[Patton Boggs]] on behalf of clients David Warnock and Simon Davies, filed an action alleging violations of the civil [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO Act]] against GetFugu, Carl Freer, and other officers and directors of GetFugu.&lt;ref name="Law360Getfugu"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Lessons From Patton Boggs Defamation Case | newspaper =Law360 | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =26 November 2013 | url =http://www.law360.com/articles/489588 | accessdate =14 January 2014 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm followed the lawsuit with a press release that falsely claimed that GetFugu and Carl Freer were being investigated by the FBI.&lt;ref name = thehill&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/205468-patton-boggs-settles-with-chevron-for-15m | title = Patton Boggs Settles with Chevron| publisher = The Hill | accessdate = 30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, on a motion by GetFugu, District Court Judge [[George H.

Patton Boggs filed a special motion to strike the defamation claim, contending that the press release regarding the alleged FBI investigation, even if false, was protected by litigation [[Privilege (evidence)|privilege]],&lt;ref name="Law360Getfugu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllegedlyFalseLexology"/&gt; but the California Court of Appeals disagreed, allowing Freer and GetFugu to proceed with the $500 million lawsuit against Patton Boggs.&lt;ref name="AllegedlyFalseLexology"/&gt; Patton Boggs' special motion to strike the malicious prosecution claim was also denied, holding that Patton Boggs did not have probable cause to prosecute the RICO claims.&lt;ref name="Law360Getfugu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllegedlyFalseLexology"/&gt;

In October 2015, Carl Freer unsuccessfully sued Danish Television Channel [[DR3]] to have his name removed from a documentary on the [[Stein Bagger]] IT Factory fraud case prior to broadcast.&lt;ref name="DR3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nielsen |first=Silas Bay |title=Byret giver DR3 grønt lys til at sende Stein Bagger-dokumentar |publisher=DR.dk |language=Danish |trans-title=City Court gives DR3 green light to broadcast Stein Bagger documentary |url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kultur/medier/byret-giver-dr3-groent-lys-til-sende-stein-bagger-dokumentar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the documentary broadcast, he filed defamation claims against 5 employees of DR.&lt;ref name="DR-employees"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lohse |first=Gregers |title=Fem DR-medarbejdere stævnet for Stein Bagger-serie |publisher=DR.dk |language=Danish |trans-title=Five DR-employees sued for Stein Bagger Series |url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kultur/medier/fem-dr-medarbejdere-staevnet-stein-bagger-serie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centro''' is the [[Central Business District|inner city]] ''[[barrio]]'' (neighbourhood or district) of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. Its main avenue is 18 de Julio Avenue. It is delimited by La Paz Str. to the North, Florida Str. (North of 18 de julio Av.) and Andes Str. (South of 18 de Julio Av.) to the West, Canelones Str. to the South and Barrios Amorin Str. to the East. It used to be the main commercial venue of the city, but after the opening of the first malls, many small stores started closing down. Now,{{When?|date=November 2018}} that process is being reverted and the area is coming back to life.{{Vague|date=November 2018}}

==History==
[[File:Centro-old-map.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1829 map of the proposed extension of the Ciudad Vieja]]
Because of the military origins of Montevideo, it had been forbidden to build anything permanent in the area outside the walls of the city up to the time that Uruguay gained Independence. That area was called Campo de Marte or ''ejido'' (common). Around 1750, the colonial ''Gobernación Política y Militar de Montevideo'' traced the limits of the forbidden area at "a canonball's reach" from the city's fortifications by a line or "''cordón''". Eventually, [[Cordón]] became the name of the area outside the Campo de Marte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/historia/barrios/el-cordon |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024555/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/historia/barrios/el-cordon |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, four years after the declaration of Independence, the National Assembly decided to pull down the fortifications of the Ciudad Vieja and extend the city to form the "Ciudad Nueva". At the time, the population of Montevideo was around 14,000. The plans for some additional 160 city blocks were drawn by military engineer Don José María Reyes. That extension is the actual barrio of Centro. The plans included a new square, which in 1840 took on the name [[Plaza Cagancha]], while the names of the streets were given by Andrés Lamas from 1843 on. The development of this area was very slow due to the [[Uruguayan Civil War|"Guerra Grande"]] of  1839-1852. In 1867 a pillar with the statue of Peace (La Paz) was erected in the centre of  Plaza Cagancha.

==Squares and buildings==
Along 18 de Julio Avenue there are two central and frequented squares: [[Plaza Fabini]], commonly called Plaza del Entrevero because of the sculpture of its main fountain, called "The Entrevero", by [[José Belloni]], and [[Plaza Cagancha]], commonly called Plaza Libertad. The former is mostly used as a relaxation area and the latter is mostly a place where craftsmen and other small vendors exhibit their work and products for sale.

One of the most architecturally notable buildings of the Centro, is the Palacio Lapido, designed by Juan Aubriot and built in 1933, a National Heritage Site since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/arquitectura/edificios-y-espacios-calificados/edificio-lapido |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604160150/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/arquitectura/edificios-y-espacios-calificados/edificio-lapido |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other National Heritage Sites of the Centro are the Jockey Club, the Sala Zitarrosa on Plaza Fabini, the Ateneo de Montevideo and the Palacio Piria (seat of the Supreme Court) on Plaza Cagancha, the [[Palacio Santos]] (seat of the [[Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]) and the Mercado de la Ambundancia. The Centro is also home to the Palacio Municipal, the building of the City Hall, with a wide public area in front of it featuring an impressive copy of Michaelangelo's [[David (Michelangelo)|David]].

==Places of worship==
Several temples have been built in this important neighbourhood.

==Chelsea Football Club==
Townsend is confirmed to take over the role of commercial director of [[Chelsea F.C.]] following the departure of [[Christian Purslow]].&lt;ref&gt;http://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2017/2/22/14702114/chelsea-tap-former-sky-sports-and-london-2012-commercial-director-as-new-marketing-chief/&lt;/ref&gt; The news was confirmed by Secretary of State for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport [[Karen Bradley]] who praised Townsend for growing the UK's broadband coverage to over 93% in the three years he was CEO of BDUK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2017/02/ceo-governments-broadband-delivery-uk-project-bids-farewell.html&lt;/ref&gt; Head of the [[British Civil Service]] [[Jeremy Heywood]] thanked Townsend for his leadership and described his work as "commercial expertise at its best".&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/HeadUKCivServ/status/834451954650710017?s=03&lt;/ref&gt; As commercial director, Townsend would be responsible for all of Chelsea's commercial programmes, including global sponsorship, ticketing, licensing and merchandise.

A '''Councillor''' is a member of a [[local government]] council.

==United Kingdom==
All [[local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities in the United Kingdom]] are overseen by elected councillors. These include:

#[[unitary authority|unitary authorities]]
#[[county council]]s and [[districts of England|district]] councils
#[[civil parish|parish]], [[town council|town]] and [[community council|community]] councils
#The [[Common Council of the City of London]] (in which councillors are known as aldermen and councilmen)

According to ''Debrett's Correct Form'' the English title "Councillor" (often shortened to ‘Cllr’) applies only to elected members of city, borough or district councils.&lt;ref name=debretts&gt;''Debrett's Correct Form'', pg 193, Headline Book Publishing 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no legal basis for this restriction and in practice the title is applied to all councillors at all levels of local government. Where necessary, parish and county councillors are differentiated by the use of a fuller title such as "town councillor" or "county councillor". The title precedes the holder's rank or other title, as in  Cllr Dr Jenny Smith or Cllr Sir Ricky Taing, and for women it precedes their title of marital status, as in Cllr Mrs Joan Smith.&lt;ref name=debretts/&gt; Youth councillors are solely known as Youth Councillors.

Councillors are typically elected as members of [[political parties]] or alternatively as independents. Councils may also co-opt unelected councillors to fill vacancies on a council where insufficient candidates have stood for election, although in practice this is rare outside parish councils. Once elected, they are meant to represent all the residents under the whole authority, not just those who voted for them or just those in the district or ward they were elected in. They are bound by a code of conduct enforced by standards boards.

In 2007 the age limit for councillors fell to 18, leading to younger people standing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Youth Councillors are also elected in local areas such as the British Youth Council, a youth council on a national scale to the Dartford Youth Council, a youth council for a specific borough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartfordyouthcouncil.org|title=Dartford Youth Council website|last=|first=|date=|website=Dartford Youth Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remuneration===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Most councillors are not full-time professionals.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland most larger borough, unitary authority or county councils do pay them basic allowances and [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. In addition, special responsibility allowances are paid to councillors who carry out more senior duties. The basic allowances and special responsibility allowances are theoretically paid to compensate councillors for time spent on council duties and are classed as salaries for tax purposes. Parish, town or community councillors may, since the [[Local Government Act 2000]], be paid for their services, but most do it voluntarily.

In Scotland, since 2007, councillors have received a salary of £15,000, as opposed to a series of allowances. These are often topped up by special responsibility allowances.

===Regional government===

The [[London Assembly]] is regarded, not as a local authority, but as a regional [[devolved government|devolved]] [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] and its members are referred to as Assembly Members, not councillors.

==United States==
'''Council member''', '''councilman/councilwoman''', '''councilor''', or '''councillor''' is a title for a member of a council used in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In particular, the title is used in the following cases:
*[[City council]]s or [[town council]]s that do not use the title of [[alderman]]
*[[Council of the District of Columbia]]

==The Philippines==
Under the Philippine Republic Act No. 7160 (otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991), a '''councilor''' is a member of a local council that is the legislative body of the local government unit. They are commonly referred to as "Sanggunian Member" because the official designation of municipal, city and provincial councils is the equivalent term in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (used even when speaking or writing in English): Sanggunian Bayan, Sanggunian Panglunsod and Sanggunian Panlalawigan, respectively.[http://www.csc.gov.ph/sanggunian-member-eligibility]

==Finland==
''This is about honorary rank, not elected officials.''

In [[Finland]] councillor (''neuvos'') is the highest possible title of honour which can be granted by the [[President of Finland]]. There are several ranks of councillors and they have existed since the Russian Regime. Some examples of different councillors in Finland are as follows:

*'''[[Valtioneuvos|Councillor of State]]''': the highest class of the titles of honour; granted to successful [[wikt:statesman|statesmen]]
*'''[[Vuorineuvos|Mining Councillor]]/Trade Councillor/Industry Councillor/Economy Councillor''': granted to leading industry figures in different fields of the economy
*'''Councillor of Parliament''': granted to successful statesmen
*'''Office Councillor''': granted to leading university figures
*'''Councillor of Culture/Theatre Councillor/Film Councillor''': granted to leading cultural figures
*'''Chamber Councillor''': granted for successful officials in the field of local government

==Turkey==
Two types of councillor are elected in local elections held every five years in Turkey. These include 1,251 provincial councillors and 20,500 municipal councillors. Municipal councillors serve on the council of the 1,351 district and 30 metropolitan municipalities of Turkey, while provincial councillors serve on the provincial general council ''(İl Genel Meclisi)''.

== Canada ==
{{Main|Municipal government in Canada}}
Due to the control that the provinces have over their municipal governments, terms that councillors serve vary from province to province. Unlike most provincial elections, municipal elections are usually held on a fixed date.

==Other countries==
In [[Australia]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and other parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], as well as in the [[Republic of Ireland]], a '''councillor''' or '''councilor''' is an elected representative on a [[local government]] council.

In the [[Netherlands]], a member of the [[City Council (the Netherlands)|municipal council]] is called a ''gemeenteraadslid'' or ''raadslid''. Someone out of this group who is elected to serve on the municipal executive is called a ''[[wethouder]]'', which is usually translated as ‘alderman’ or ‘councillor’. The Dutch word for mayor is ''burgemeester''. This is expressed in English as "mayor" or "''[[burgomaster]]''". The municipal executive is referred to collectively as the ''[[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders]]''.

In [[Belgium]], a member of the municipal council is called a ''gemeenteraadslid'' in Dutch, and ''Conseiller Communal'' in French. Someone out of this group who is elected to serve on the municipal executive is called a ''[[schepen]]'' in Dutch or ''[[Échevin (disambiguation)|échevin]]''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; in French. This is usually translated as "alderman" or "councillor" in English. The municipal executive is referred to collectively as the ''College van Burgemeester en Schepenen'' ou ''Collège du Bourgmestre et Echevins''.

In [[Luxembourg]], an ''[[échevin (Luxembourg)|échevin]]'' ({{lang-lb|Schäffe}}, {{lang-de|Schöffe}}) is a member of the administration of a [[Luxembourg]]ian [[Communes of Luxembourg|commune]].

In [[Hong Kong]], members of district councils are also referred to as councillors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com%2Fnews/hong-kong/article/1246797/district-councillors-may-get-20pc-more-rent-subsidy {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121121641/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1246797/district-councillors-may-get-20pc-more-rent-subsidy |date=21 January 2015 }} and http://www.news.gov.hk/en/categories/health/html/2014/10/20141010_143215.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1999 the [[District Councils of Hong Kong|district council]]s were known as district boards, upon the abolition of the municipal councils (the [[UrbCo]] and the [[RegCo]]) in December that year. In addition, members of the legislative council are also referred to as councillors. From 1996 to 1998 the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] were known as "Provisional Legislative Council", upon the abolition of the [[Provisional Legislative Council|interim legislature]] in July 1998.

In [[Norway]], a member of the municipal council, ''kommunestyret'', is called a ''kommunestyrerepresentant'' in Norwegian. The Norwegian word for mayor is ''ordfører''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19953">{{Redirect|Dispatching|other uses|Dispatch (disambiguation){{!}}Dispatch}}
'''Dispatch''' is a procedure for assigning employees (workers) or vehicles to customers.  Industries that dispatch include [[taxicab]]s, [[courier]]s, [[emergency service]]s, as well as home and commercial services such as [[maid]] services, [[plumbing]], [[HVAC]], [[pest control]] and [[electricians]].

With vehicle dispatching, clients are matched to vehicles according to the order in which clients called and the proximity of vehicles to each client's pick-up location.  Telephone operators take calls from clients, then either enter the client's information into a [[computer]] or write it down and give it to a [[dispatcher]].  In some cases, calls may be assigned a priority by the call-taker.  Priority calls may jump the queue of pending calls. In the first scenario, a central computer then communicates with the [[mobile data terminal]] located in each vehicle (see [[computer assisted dispatch]]); in the second, the dispatcher communicates with the driver of each vehicle via two-way radio.

With home or commercial service dispatching, customers usually schedule services in advance and the dispatching occurs the morning of the scheduled service.  Depending on the type of service, workers are dispatched individually or in teams of two or more.  Dispatchers have to coordinate worker availability, skill, travel time and availability of parts.  The skills required of a dispatcher are greatly enhanced with the use of computer dispatching software (see [[computer aided call handling]]).

==Manual dispatch systems==

The following are examples of manual systems used to track the status of resources in a dispatched fleet.

===Cards===
Card systems employ a set of shelves with a slot for each unit in the dispatch fleet. Each vehicle or resource has a slot in the shelving system. In it, a card, like a time card used to track an employee's work hours, is stored. A time clock, similar to the one that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp event times on each card. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier or other information is handwritten on the card. Each time the resource's status changes, the card is punched in the time clock and a new status entry is handwritten on the card. The card collects a series of entries through the work shift.

In a tow truck example, the card might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, "Downtown 6" and may be labeled with the vehicle number or data about the capabilities of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit "available" and time stamp the card. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on the card and the card might be stamped at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The string of notes and time stamps allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet.

Some systems use shelving with red and green lights and a switch at the back of the card slot. If the resource's card is pushed all the way into the card slot, the switch is actuated and an indicator lamp turns red. This identifies the tow car whose card occupies that slot as not available, or assigned to a call. Leaving the card pulled partway out leaves the indicator green, showing the dispatcher that unit is available. Is anyone available? The lights are supposed to give the dispatch staff a snapshot of their resource situation.

A major flaw of this system is that cards are inside shelves and trying to look at an entire set of cards to evaluate the overall situation requires the dispatcher to pull out every card, one at a time, and read it. If two or more resources are sent to the same call, the dispatcher has a lot of writing to do.

===Punched tags===
Punched tag systems employ a set of pegs with each peg holding tags for one unit in the dispatch fleet. Each vehicle working the current shift has a peg with a tag describing the unit's current status. A time clock, similar to the one that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp times on each tag. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier may be posted above the peg. The unit's start time is stamped and their status is written on the tag. Each time the resource's status changes, a new tag is written and the tag is time stamped in order to log the time the unit's status changed. The peg collects a stack of tags through the work shift.

In a tow truck example, the peg might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, "Downtown 6" and may be labeled with the vehicle number or data about the capabilities of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the tow car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit "available" and time stamp a tag, then hang it on that unit's peg. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on another tag and the tag might be stamped at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The tag would then be hung on that unit's peg. The stack of tags allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet.

Some systems use colored tags to show general categories of events such as "available". For example, each unit that is available might have the fact noted on an orange tag. Is anyone available? A glance at the pegboard shows anybody whose tag is "orange" is available. An repossession might use a yellow tag to identify a service call with a safety issue where the police should be called in the event the tow car crew doesn't check in by radio within five minutes. A blue tag might show a resource is taking a dinner or lunch break.

A major flaw of this system is that tags can easily be posted on the wrong peg, causing confusion. This can be countered by writing unit identifiers on every tag: a lot of work. In colored-tag systems, it is always possible to run out of certain colors of tags, messing up the system. If two or more resources are sent to the same call, the dispatcher has a lot of writing to do.

===Plastic icons===
In a plastic icon system, the blank panel on the communications console or a nearby wall is fitted with a sheet of [[Velcro]]. The material has vertical stripes painted on it, making a column for each of several possible status conditions. The simplest system is two columns: available and unavailable. Magnetized icons can be used in place of Velcro. The icons can be coloured or shaped to identify the type of unit or some other feature of the resource.

Each vehicle working the current shift has an icon placed in the column describing the unit's current status. A log book is used to track times, event details, and other information about calls for service. In a tow truck example, the icon might be labelled with the tow car's radio identifier, "Down town 6". During a shift, the icon would be moved by the dispatcher into whatever column describes the resource's current condition. Alternatively, there could be columns for some other condition such as the names of move-up or standby points where resources are sent to backfill for busy tow cars.

A major flaw of this system is that icons can easily be misplaced or fall off of the status board. Magnetic objects can damage cathode ray tube displays if they get too close to the display face or housing.

== Airline dispatch ==

In [[airline]] operations in a few countries, a [[dispatcher]] shares legal responsibility for a flight's safety with its pilot, and may delay, divert or cancel a flight if there is reason to do so.  This [[checks and balances]] mechanism supposedly improves the safety of the dispatch system, although most countries do not use this system and there is no noticeable detriment to flight safety.  A dispatcher typically must be licensed by the aviation authority of a country.  The examination for the licence requires the candidate to demonstrate knowledge in meteorology and aviation comparable to that required to obtain an [[Airline Transport Pilot Licence]].

== Mobile dispatch ==

In a mobile system, wireless technology is provided for efficient job planning, assignment and efficient job planning through the use of mobile dispatch systems sent out through a [[mobile network]] on to a mobile device such as [[PDA]]. This allows for more flexible management of the workers out in the field as a job can be dispatched to multiple users to accept or reject the job. The benefits of a mobile system as it can then be integrated back into the other software systems used by an organization such as [[asset management]], rostering, and other financial systems.

== Trucking dispatch ==

[[Trucking]] dispatchers play a major role in transportation logistics.  Truck dispatchers orchestrate freight movement and equipment from one place to another while keeping close communication with truck drivers.  Some dispatching companies help truck drivers to negotiate and acquire loads and handle paperwork.  Dispatching trucks require a variety of skills like using a computer to find and track loads for drivers to speaking multiple languages depending on the region or number of trucks they manage.  Great customer service and good communication are vital for succeeding in this fast-paced environment.

==Capacity and metrics==
There is a limit to how many field units can be managed. This varies with circumstances. For example, a parcel delivery service [[dispatcher]] may encounter higher traffic around [[Christmas]]. Work is not evenly distributed across time: in any dispatch system there are traditional peaks or busy hours in requests for service. Some workplace cultures will allow longer wait times than others.

Systems may use a [[Radiotelephony procedure]] to reduce talking time, allowing interaction with a larger dispatch fleet. Air traffic control and towing are two examples. The use of abbreviations or standard phrases can reduce the length of a transaction. Capacity may be reduced by relaxed voice procedure such as a delivery dispatcher giving a lengthy description of a customer complaint over the radio.

It is generally accepted that giving field units computers connected with the computer-aided dispatch, or another enterprise system used for dispatch, unloads voice two-way radio channels and increases capacity. Users research information on their terminal or laptop instead of calling in with a request that the dispatcher do it.&lt;ref&gt;Suggested reading: "Congestion and Coverage Concerns," ''Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan'', ([[Fairfax, Virginia]]: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; One source suggests radio traffic drops by 30% when computers are available to mobile users.&lt;ref&gt;"4.5 Mobile Data Systems," ''San Rafael Police Radio Committee: Report to Mayor and City Council'', ([[San Rafael, California]]: City of San Rafael, 1995,) pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Measurements of communications may reflect dispatch capacity. A partial definition of capacity comes from the number of communications channels required to support a dispatch fleet. Two metrics of channel capacity may be: 1) the number of field units or ''resources'' dispatched, and; 2)number of push-to-talk presses per day.&lt;ref&gt;Some touch screen radio dispatch consoles can keep a tally of [[push-to-talk]] presses.&lt;/ref&gt; A resource may refer to a fire engine, tow truck, taxi, or refuse truck, regardless of how many walkie-talkies, mobile radios, or persons were fielded along with each resource.

One suggestion is that 100 to 150 mobiles is the maximum practical on one channel.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Section I: General," ''The [[California Highway Patrol]] Communications Technology Research Project on 800 MHz'', 80-C477, ([[Sacramento, California]]: Department of General Services, Communications Technology Division, 1982,) pp. I-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggests 60-70 units as a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;Suggested reading: "Congestion and Coverage Concerns," ''Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan'', ([[Fairfax, Virginia]]: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in these two ranges probably reflects the wording. For example, 120 ''mobiles'' may mean radios: 60 units each containing a mobile radio and an officer with a walkie talkie.&lt;ref&gt;It may also reflect differences in operational styles between the Contra Costa Sheriffs Department and Highway Patrol. It might be that the average Highway Patrol officer interacts less often with their dispatcher.&lt;/ref&gt; For dispatch systems like take-out food delivery, where life safety is not an issue, delays may be acceptable. Delays increase capacity.

Another possible measure of capacity is system push-to-talk presses. A 187-day study of four [[Contra Costa County, California]] Sheriffs Department conventional two-way radio dispatch channels showed an average of around 2,500 push-to-talk presses per day. The count was within +/-350 a day across all four primary dispatch channels.&lt;ref&gt;Data were supplied by the Sheriffs Department. Suggested reading: "Congestion and Coverage Concerns," ''Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan'', ([[Fairfax, Virginia]]: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--*Can you find more?*--&gt;

===Telephone===
[[File:18butt~1.png|right|200px|thumb|Multi-line phones are seen in many dispatching facilities. Rotary dials are rare.]]A method used for telephone traffic analysis may fit some circumstances. One evaluation looked at 1) peak of busy hour usage, 2) average hourly usage, 3) message length in seconds, 4) maximum delay or wait time desirable, and; 5) maximum percent of users being delayed. [[Traffic analysis]] can be applied to radio or telephone communications.&lt;ref&gt;For one example, see: "3.2.10.1 Current System Problems," ''Trunked Radio System: Request For Proposals'', (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: Oklahoma City Municipal Facilities Authority, Public Safety Capital Projects Office, 2000) pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most office telephone systems have some facility for recording calling volumes, and incoming call timing. Dispatch centers use [[Automatic call distribution|Automatic call distribution (ACD)]] groups which can be evaluated for metrics such as average wait time, abandoned calls, and calls per hour. These numeric data can be entered into spreadsheets for analysis of trends.

In dispatching, US emergency medical services literature suggests that telephone calls to a dispatching facility should be answered in the first few rings. One document suggests emergency calls to dispatch should result in busy signals once per 100 calls during the busiest hour.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: EMS Communications," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Regional-level Planning Guide'', (Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1995) pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In business call centers, similar standards are suggested by consultants in order to provide an ideal customer experience and to outperform competing services.&lt;ref&gt;See InTelegy customer service web site (ibid) for more information on call metrics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient staffing should be in place so that 90% of emergency calls are, "...answered within 10 seconds, or with no greater than three rings, during the average busy hour," according to one source.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: EMS Communications," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Regional-level Planning Guide'', (Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1995) pp. 11. For a discussion of telephone traffic statistics and ''busy hours'', see: American Telephone and Telegraph Company, ''Basic Traffic Analysis'', {{ISBN|0-13-335407-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerable wait times vary from one culture and region to another: some cultures expect immediate service; others will tolerate waits for some services. Regardless of sector or industry, almost all dispatchers will spend virtually their entire work day on the phone, answering as many as a thousand calls in a single shift while multi tasking other aspects of the job. In many ways, being a dispatcher is really one person doing the work of three or four people. It consistently ranks as among the most stressful jobs in the industrialized world, with high blood pressure, fatigue, obesity, heart disease, and other stress/sedentary related health concerns existing at rates up to ten times the norm of any other occupation.

==Zone system to assign service calls==

[[File:TRANSIT cad.png|thumb|right|500px|Dispatch consoles used by [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] RTD, a transit service provider in a US city. Drawing at right illustrates the controls associated with a single channel on the console. Photos courtesy of US Department of Transportation.]]One method for organizing assignments in a manual dispatch system is to use a zone map system. Consider a community with four fire stations and two ambulance service providers. A grid is overlaid on a community map. Saint Proximal Medical Center ambulance is identified by the notation ''P'' while Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad is noted with a ''D''.

Each zone of the grid is identified with a progression of ambulance zones and fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;This would work for any system including taxis or parcel pick up.&lt;/ref&gt; One zone might be labeled: DP241. This means fire station 2, then 4, then 1, then 3 would respond to a fire call occurring inside this zone. If fire stations 2, 4, and 1 were assigned to calls, Station 3 would be sent to this zone. Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad would be first-up for an ambulance call occurring inside zone DP241.

The predefined order is created by persons with expertise in the service being provided, local geography, traffic, and patterns in calls for service. In assigning resources to a zone, decision-makers may consider that responding units must drive around freeways, lakes, or terrain obstructions in order to reach a zone. Zone boundaries and designations will periodically change as communities grow or lessons are learned during day-to-day operations. Consider a zone with an irrigation canal defining one boundary. If a car crashes into the canal, which zone is it in?

Zone systems may include standby, move-up, or backfill points. For example, taxi drivers working in a certain zone in the evening hours may expect night club patrons to need a ride. Consider a standby point at Main Street and Railroad Avenue named ''N''. Some fares will come from radio calls to dispatch. A taxi driver, Car 4, may go to predefined standby location ''N''. In some dispatching systems, the driver will call the dispatcher and report they are available and located at standby point ''N''. The dispatcher may respond by reporting the driver's position in the queue, "Car 4, second N." The first call in this district would go to the driver ahead of Car 4. Car 4 would be assigned the second call.

If [[automatic vehicle location]] is available, it would display service vehicle locations on a map. The closest unit would be interpreted by the dispatcher looking at vehicle locations projected on the map.

'''''Dragons' Den''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television [[reality show]] based on the internationally franchised ''[[Dragons' Den]]'' format which began in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, Kevin (2012). ''Cold Hard Truth on Business, Money &amp; Life'', Random House,  page 8,  {{ISBN|9780385671767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W. Brett (2012). ''Redefining Success: Still Making Mistakes'',  Penguin Books, page 122, {{ISBN|9780670066940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted on October 3, 2006 on [[CBC Television]], and is hosted by [[Dianne Buckner]]. Aspiring Canadian [[entrepreneurs]] pitch business and investment ideas to a panel of [[venture capitalist]]s (termed "Dragons") in the hope of securing business financing and partnerships.

Auditions for the 13th season began on February 10 in Toronto, Ontario and ended on April 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/auditions|title=Auditions 2018 - Dragons' Den|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 5, 2018, 216 episodes of Dragons' Den have aired.

Dragons' Den was added to [[Netflix]] on June 3, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MaFt.co.uk|title=Dragons' Den (2016) on Canadian Netflix :: New On Netflix Canada|url=https://can.newonnetflix.info/info/70225706/s|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Each typical episode features approximately eight pitches, along with a brief synopsis of a further three pitches which usually were rejected by the Dragons.

Each pitch begins with the entrepreneur specifying the amount they are seeking as an investment and the percentage of their business which they are offering in exchange. The entrepreneurs generally describe their business and provide financial details in respect of their costs, sales, and profit margins. Pitches range from those at the conceptual stage to full-fledged long-term businesses. The Dragons ask the entrepreneur questions in order to assess whether their business is one which they would consider investing in. Each Dragon ultimately will either make an offer to invest or will declare that they are "out", meaning they are not interested in the business. Once all five Dragons are "out", the pitch ends.

While some entrepreneurs are made offers of exactly what they are seeking, most of the offers the Dragons make either seek a greater percentage of the business (equity) or seek a royalty on the sales of the business (this has become more prevalent in later seasons). The entrepreneurs and Dragons may then engage in negotiations until the available offers are either accepted (and a "deal" is made) or rejected.

While Dragons often partner up and make joint offers, they just as often make competing offers. Each of the Dragons has a unique set of skills and connections which sometimes results in the entrepreneur being forced to choose between offers (which might be offering the same or different economic terms) based on the "added" value the specific Dragon would bring to the business.

The main "rule" as set out at the start of every episode is that the entrepreneur is not permitted to accept an offer or multiple offers unless they would receive a total investment of ''at least'' the amount that they initially sought. The main ramification of this restriction is that entrepreneurs are often criticised for over-valuing their businesses. This is because the amount sought by the entrepreneur may be more than 50% of the value of their business as perceived by the Dragons (the Dragons rarely make deals for greater than 50%) and sometimes more than the entire value of the business as perceived by the Dragons. The restriction means the Dragons cannot offer a lesser amount that is more in line with their perceived value of the business.

Notwithstanding the acceptance of offers on the show, and the handshake agreements, the offers on the show are generally subject to [[due diligence]] by both parties and many "deals" made on the show do not ultimately close or close at different terms than originally expected. The show sometimes offers updates on both deals which were made and entrepreneurs who were rejected, including certain special episodes focusing exclusively on updates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3757">A '''fixed-term contract''' is a contractual relationship between an employee and an employer that lasts for a specified period. These contracts are usually regulated by different countries' [[labour laws]], to ensure that employers still fulfill basic labour rights regardless of a contract's form, particularly [[unjust dismissal]]. Generally, fixed-term contracts will automatically be deemed to have created a permanent contract, subject to the employer's right to terminate employment on reasonable notice for a good reason. In the European Union the incidence of fixed-term contracts ranges from 6% in the UK to 23% in Spain, with Germany, Italy and France between 13% and 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00073&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
Due to the potential [[job insecurity]] that multiple fixed-term contracts may cause, employment laws in many countries limit the circumstances and the way these contracts may be used. In countries where labour law is more restrictive (compensation/indemnity for dismissal), the differentiation between fixed-term and permanent contracts tends to be clearly set out in law. Where employment legislation is less protective for the employee there tends to be a lesser degree of differentiation between fixed and permanent contracts.

===Belgium===
There are two possibilities to contract successive fixed-term contracts:

# Successive employment contracts with a maximum term of two years: A maximum of four successive fixed-term employment contracts, where the minimum duration of each contract is three months and the total duration of all the successive contracts is not longer than two years. 
# Successive employment contracts with a maximum term of three years: With the prior authorisation of the [[Federal Public Service Employment|Belgian Federal Public Service Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue]], successive fixed-term contracts can be concluded with a minimum duration of six months if the total duration of all the successive contracts do not exceed three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emploi.belgique.be/defaultTab.aspx?id=41992#|title=Contrat de travail conclu pour une durée déterminée (CDD)|work=emploi.belgique.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The maximum term is twenty four months and may be extended once only&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F38.xhtml#N100B9|title=Conditions de renouvellement d'un contrat de travail à durée déterminée (CDD)|work=service-public.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Fixed-term contracts may not be extended more than three times with a maximum total period of two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arbeitsratgeber.com/befristete-arbeitsvertraege/|title=Befristeter Arbeitsvertrag oder Zeitvertrag|work=ArbeitsRatgeber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
India allows fixed term employment since 2018. Fixed term employees are entitled to wage and benefits on par with permanent employees.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/the-good-and-bad-side-of-fixed-term-employment-amendment-2532947.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Any employee on fixed-term contracts for four or more years will automatically become a permanent employee, unless the employer can show there is a good business reason not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/fixed-term-contracts/renewing-or-ending-a-fixedterm-contract|title=Fixed-term employment contracts|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">In the [[United States]], The Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses [Holder in Due Course Rule], formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses," protects consumers when merchants sell a consumer's credit contracts to other lenders. Specifically, it preserves consumers' right to assert the same legal claims and defenses against anyone who purchases the credit contract, as they would have against the seller who originally provided the credit.  [16 Code of Federal Regulations Part 433]

==Rights of a HDC are superior to other contract rights==
The rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:
* The rights to payment are not subject to [[set-off (law)|set-off]], and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque).
* No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument "counts" as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. §3-602(b)]
* Transfer free of equities—the holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course)
* Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be affected by endorsement and delivery (order instruments), or by delivery alone (bearer instruments). In addition, the rights and obligations accruing to the transferee can be affected by the rule of derivative title, which does not allow a property owner to transfer rights in a piece of property greater than his own.

== Limitations ==
The rule can be considered inequitable to consumers. As a response to this, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the FTC reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule].

'''''Hotel Tycoon Resort''''' is a [[Business simulation game]] created and developed by German studio [[Claw Design Software]], 
published 2010 by [[eFUSION X]].

== Game Storyline ==
The protagonist is in love with the beautiful daughter of a successful but rigorous hotel magnate.
He won't allow them to be together unless the player proves worthy and can show that he is able to manage the 
big hotel business.

== Gameplay ==

The game takes place on several islands. The player can freely create and place pools, 
restaurants and other buildings, palm trees and a variety of decorations.
He can choose to play the story mode consisting of 8 missions or to play the endless mode.
The story mode starts with a small mission map and easy tasks introducing the controls and game mechanics.
As the missions proceed the tasks become more and more challenging.
 
Hotel guests and their needs are simulated on the maps. Hungry guests start searching for a restaurant for example
and will only be satisfied if they are able to find it soon.
Thus it's important to plan roads carefully and create buildings to satisfy guests' needs in time.
Otherwise guests won't come back.
On their route through the hotel park, guests will drop dirt occasionally. Buildings will decay over the time.
The player can choose to hire employees to take care of time consuming tasks such as picking up garbage or 
maintaining and servicing buildings.
Additionally he can collect coins that appear randomly on the map.

== Content ==
The game consists of 8 missions and an endless game mode.
The player can choose between approximately 30 different buildings and decoration objects, which become available as the 
game proceeds and can be created and placed freely.
There are 3 upgrade-levels per building.

==Reception==
Hotel Tycoon Resort was rated 8.5 out of 10 by Gamemobile &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamemobile.co.uk/hoteltycoonresort.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and 6.0 out of 11 (0-10) by Pocketgamer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Hotel+Tycoon+Resort/review.asp?c=20564&lt;/ref&gt;
It is currently the second most popular paid game on BlackBerry AppWorld.&lt;ref&gt;http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/category/1?licenseType=2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IOFML''' is an offshoot of a number of acquisitions. Firstly, that of Kakawa Asset Management Limited in 2013, KAML was a former subsidiary of Kakawa Discount House and was registered by SEC as a corporate investment adviser and fund manager, this acquisition brought Kakawa Guaranteed Income Fund into the portfolio of Investment One. Secondly, the acquisition of a balanced fund, the Nigerian International Growth Fund (NIGFUND) from Fidelity Bank in 2013 further strengthened the subsidiary. These funds have since been renamed and rebranded to reflect the group.

'''John Christopher Bartholomew''' (or '''J.C. Bartholomew''') (15 January 1923 – 16 January 2008) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[cartography|cartographer]] and [[geography|geographer]].

==Life==

Bartholomew was the son of Marie Antoinette Sarolea, daughter of [[Charles Sarolea]] and [[John (Ian) Bartholomew]] (1890–1962). &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/john-bartholomew-1-1074884|title=John Bartholomew|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the great-great-grandson of the founder of [[John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.]]

He studied at [[Edinburgh Academy]] and [[Gordonstoun]] before taking a degree in geography at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

He took over directorship of [[John Bartholomew &amp; Co.]] from his father in 1951. At this stage Peter Bartholomew (1924-1987) was Chairman and Robert Bartholomew (b.1927) was production manager. The company's most memorable production during their control was the ''Times Atlas'' (five volumes but also available in a 'concise' version). It also published the first metric versions of the large scale [[Ordnance Survey]] maps of the UK, aimed at hikers and travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/family/|title=Bartholomew Family and Firm|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartholomew served as president of the [[British Cartographic Society]] in 1970–71. He was also a vice-president of the [[International Cartographic Association]], 1972–80, and from 1987 to 1993, he was president of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]]. He was  active on the committee of the Scottish Rights of Way Society (now ScotWays), and was made its honorary president.

On his death he left monies to pay for view indicators on the summits of both [[Berwick Law]] and the [[Braid Hills]].

He is buried against the north wall of the 20th century extension to [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]] at the memorial to his grandfather, [[John George Bartholomew]]. His father Ian, and uncle Hugh lie with him.

==Family==

He married Ginette Achard-James. They had five sons: John Eric, Philip, Christopher, Patrick and Ivon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''LaSalle Street''' is a major north-south street in [[Chicago]] named for [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de La Salle]], an early explorer of [[Illinois]].  The portion that runs through the [[Chicago Loop]] is considered to be Chicago's financial district.

==South Side==
South of the Financial District, LaSalle Street gets cut off for a while by the Amtrak/Metra Rail yard from Taylor St to 1600 South. It runs parallel to the [[Rock Island District]] Metra line. South of 26th Street, it serves as a frontage road for the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] until 47th street, where it merges with Wentworth Avenue. South of 47th, it starts and stops as a local street until it finally terminates at West 147th Street in [[Riverdale, Illinois|Riverdale]].

[[File:Chicago Board of Trade center, Continental Illinois Bank left, Federal Reserve Band right.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]] (center), the [[Continental Illinois|Continental Illinois Building]] (left) and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] (right)]]

==In the Loop==
The stretch of LaSalle Street and its adjacent buildings in the Loop is recognized as the [[West Loop&amp;ndash;LaSalle Street Historic District]]. The south end of LaSalle Street terminates at the [[art-deco]] [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], a [[Chicago Landmark]] and [[National Historic Landmark]].  The [[LaSalle Street Station]] commuter terminal is located directly south of the Board of Trade.  An [[art deco]] skyscraper at 135 S. LaSalle and a modern skyscraper 190 S. LaSalle line the street.  [[One North LaSalle]], the former [[Field Building (Chicago)|Field Building]], [[Chicago City Hall]] and the [[James R. Thompson Center]] are located within the Loop on LaSalle Street.

The street was nicknamed "The Canyon" due to the tall, steep buildings that lie on both ends of the relatively narrow street, with the Chicago Board of Trade Building as the abrupt end of the apparent [[Canyon|box canyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasallestreetcouncil.com/|title=LaSalle Street Council &amp; LaSalle Street Foundation - Home|work=lasallestreetcouncil.com|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rookery Building]] is a historic [[landmark]] located at 219 South LaSalle Street.  Completed by [[John Wellborn Root]] and [[Daniel Burnham]] of [[Burnham and Root]] in 1888, it is considered one of their masterpiece buildings. It measures {{convert|181|ft|m}}, is twelve stories tall and is one of the oldest standing [[high-rise]]s in Chicago.  It has a unique style with exterior load-bearing walls and an interior steel frame.

LaSalle was one of three streets in Chicago to have a [[tunnel]] under the [[Chicago River]], the other two being W. Washington St. and W. Van Buren St.  Constructed in 1869-71, the 2000 foot long tunnel alleviated interruptions from bridge openings due to heavy river traffic and served as an escape route during the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.  Originally open to only pedestrians and private vehicles, the LaSalle tunnel was turned over to [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] companies in the 1880s, since it was impossible for cable car systems to span the movable bridges.  Closed in 1906, the tunnel was deepened and reopened to electric [[Tram|street car]] traffic in 1911-12.  The tunnel was closed permanently in 1939 to make way for [[Rapid transit|subway]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = McClendon | first = Dennis | title = Tunnels | work = The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago | publisher = Chicago Historical Society | url = http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1275.html | accessdate = April 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20070509 Rock 26 Roll McDonalds from 7th fl of Sports Authority.jpg|thumb|right|225px|North LaSalle runs past the [[Rock N Roll McDonald's]]]]

==North of the river==
Moving north from the Loop, the street crosses the [[Chicago River]] using the [[La Salle Street Bridge (Chicago, Illinois)|La Salle Street Bridge]]. In the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[300 North LaSalle]] is located on the north banks of the [[Chicago River]], one block east of the [[Merchandise Mart]]. On the corner at [[Chicago Avenue]], LaSalle is adjacent to the entrance of [[Moody Bible Institute]]. The street ends 10-blocks north, in [[Lincoln Park]], just past its intersection with [[North Avenue (Chicago)|North Avenue]], where [[Moody Church]] stands on the east side of LaSalle. North of the river, the city's signage refers to, "LaSalle Boulevard," between the river and North Avenue. Between North Avenue (where it picks up [[Illinois Route 64]] until its north end) and Lake Shore Drive, the signage refers to, "LaSalle Drive."

==In popular culture==
The street, Chicago Board of Trade Building, and 200 North LaSalle were used in the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/locations|title=Filming Location for Batman Begins|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/Features/BatmanBegins/200NorthLaSalle.php|title=The Buildings of Batman|accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the 1999 movie ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Payback (1999) - Filming Locations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120784/locations|website=IMDB|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view facing south down the canyon has been used in the movies ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Public Enemies (2009 film)|Public Enemies]]'', ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' and ''[[Road to Perdition]]''.

In 2009, Melco opened its casino resort City of Dreams Macau. In February 2015, Melco opened its first overseas integrated resort, City of Dreams Manila, in the Philippines.

[[File:Leiden Bio Science Park.JPG|thumb|Leiden Bio Science Park]]

The '''Leiden Bio Science park''' (LBSP) ranks in the top five of the most successful [[Business park|science parks]]  in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Euraxess |url = http://www.euraxess.nl/newsletter/archive/may-2013/science-hubs-leiden-bio-science-park |title = Science hubs Leiden Bio Science Park  |accessdate=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of  [[Leiden]] and [[Oegstgeest]] and focuses on companies and Universities in the [[Biotechnology]] sector.

The park comprises 110 hectares (272 acres) with over 60 companies and knowledge-based institutions. The park is located mostly in Leiden and lies between Wassenaarseweg on the north and the Plesmanlaan on the south.

The park focuses mostly on the use of biotechnology for medical and biopharmaceutical applications.

== History ==
[[File:Leiden398.JPG|thumb|Leiden University Medical Centre]]
The LBSP was founded in 1984 in the Leeuwenhoek area west of [[Leiden Centraal railway station|Leiden Central Station]], between the Faculty of Science of the [[Leiden University]] and the former Academic Medical Hospital, known as the [[Leiden University Medical Center|LUMC]]. The municipality decided that this area should primarily be focused on biotechnology.

In 2005 the foundation'' Leiden Life meets Science'' was founded by the Leiden University, the municipality, the LUMC, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center|Naturalis]], [[Kamer van Koophandel|Chamber of Commerce]], the province [[South Holland]], [[University of Applied Sciences Leiden|University of Applied Sciences,]] and the ROC Leiden, with the purpose of growth the park in size and quality.

'''Lim Chin Tsong''' ({{zh|c=林振宗|p=Lín Zhènzōng|poj=Lîm Chín-chong}}; {{lang-my|လင်းချင်းချောင်း}}) was a [[Burmese Chinese]] tycoon and merchant, with business interests ranging from rice to oil. Throughout his career, he served as the sole partner of Lim Soo Hean &amp; Company, originally established by his father, a Chinese emigre to Burma.

During his own lifetime he was known as the most successful Chinese merchant in Rangoon. He entertained the social elite of the city in lavish parties hosted at his residence, Chin Tsong Palace, and gave generously to charities, including a hospital, a temple, and several schools. In modern Yangon, he is mostly remembered for the sudden and mysterious circumstances of his bankruptcy and death.

==Life==

===Background===
Lim was born on October 28, 1867 to Lim Soo Hean (林仕興), a Chinese man of [[Hokkien]] origin who migrated from [[Xiamen]] to Burma in 1861,&lt;ref&gt;''The Straits Times'' 1923&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after the family arrived in Burma from China.&lt;ref name="Latham98"&gt;Latham 98&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving from China, his father apprenticed for a Chinese milling firm before beginning his own business, originally importing goods from China and the [[Straits Settlements]].&lt;ref name="Wright307"&gt;Wright 307&lt;/ref&gt; He later established a rice trading firm, "Lim Soo Hean" (林仕興商行).&lt;ref name="sury"&gt;Suryadinata 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, Lim's father also began marketing oil, with Lim working as his assistant.&lt;ref name="TBW2"&gt;''The Bull Wheel 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim's father, believing that his own poor English ability was hampering his ability to do business, sent Lim to the best English-language schools in Yangon. Lim attended [[Rangoon College]] and [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St. Paul's School]] (now BEHS No. 6 Botataung).&lt;ref name="Wright307"/&gt; He also spoke Chinese, but was not [[literate]] in the language.&lt;ref name="TBW2"/&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Lim Chin Tsong Palace entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Lim Chin Tsong Palace in 1945.]]

In 1888 Lim's father died. Lim took over his father's company and expanded from the rice trade to petroleum.&lt;ref name="Latham98"/&gt; In 1891, he became the exclusive local agent of the [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]], handling the internal distribution of oil throughout Burma. After acquiring a fleet of steamships he also began exporting oil to [[Penang]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shantou]] and [[Xiamen]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Lim played a prominent role in negotiating the oil company's rights to extract oil from properties in Upper Burma, and was rewarded with a small commission from every barrel produced from those wells.&lt;ref name="TBW5"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim diversified his business interests into [[rubber plantation]]s, [[cotton gin]]s, peanut mills, and into earth metal extraction, including tin, copper, lead, wolfram and gold.&lt;ref name="latham99"&gt;Latham 99&lt;/ref&gt; Besides exporting oil, his steamships carried passengers, especially labourers from [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="Wright309"&gt;Wright 309&lt;/ref&gt; Lim owned a match factory whose matches were favored by the viceroy of India, [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1900s, in which Lin was one of the most prominent merchants in Rangoon, he donated generously to schools and hospitals.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; Before 1910 a biographer noted that he led the local the Chinese community to contribute generously to the upkeep of a maternity hospital.&lt;ref name="Wright309"/&gt; In 1897 he donated the resources of his steamship company to have materials for [[Guanyin Gumiao Temple|Rangoon's Guanyin temple]] shipped from China.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 64&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Lim and his partners established Anglo-Chinese Boys' and Girls' Schools in Rangoon (中華義學). In 1907, Lim founded the Lim Chin Tsong School (林振宗中西學校).&lt;ref name="sury"/&gt; Lim's schools employed teachers hired from England, and the quality of education was good enough that some families from Hong Kong and Macau sent their children to be educated there.&lt;ref name="Zaw"&gt;Zaw&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of Lim's schools, by teaching Chinese students in English, was to increase the competitiveness of Chinese businessmen and professionals abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim Chin Tsong maintained good relations with the social and economic elite of colonial Burma. He was made an honorary magistrate, sat on the Rangoon Municipal Committee,&lt;ref name="Wright309"/&gt; and served as a member of the [[Legislative Council of Burma]].&lt;ref name="TBW2"/&gt; In 1919, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] for his fundraising efforts during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; The funds raised by Lim included his donation of a steamship, which entered service as the HMAT A49 ''Seang Choon''. The ship transported a regiment of [[Australian light horse]] to the battlefields of WWI in 1916. It was later sunk by a torpedo off the coast of Ireland on July 10, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Light Horse Studies Center''&lt;/ref&gt; Lim owned the Rangoon Turf Club, a racing stable.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt;

===Decline and fall===
Lim's financial fortunes declined drastically following WWI. He had been in heavy debt since at least 1911, and by 1914 all of his properties and businesses were mortgaged. In 1915 he won a civil suit over the cancellation of a steam ship charter, but he used the money to import a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]] from England. In 1919 his lack of ability to repay what he owed to the Burmah Oil Company led the company to cease employing him as an agent. He also lost enough money through gambling and by making bad loans for his business associates to criticize him for it. Later in 1919, Lim took his family, relatives, and friends on a five-month vacation to England, where they lived and spent lavishly. Lim hoped that the value of the freight he carried back from England would be sufficient to clear his debts, but his hopes were not fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim attempted to corner the local rice market in 1921. His resulting monopoly led to a sharp increase in the price of rice, which led the British government to ban the exportation of rice outside of India (which Burma was then a part of). Because of this ban, the rice market in Burma collapsed.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; By 1922 he was on the verge of bankruptcy. By 1923 he was evading arrest, never appearing in public while refusing to answer the door or answer phone calls. There was an application to the High Court of Burma asking that he be judged insolvent, the proceedings of which Lim did not attend. The court agreed to temporarily halt the trial and to renew efforts to arrest Lim, when he died suddenly in November 2, 1923.&lt;ref name="TBW6"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim died in his sleep, possibly of a heart attack.&lt;ref name="lath"&gt;Latham &amp; Heite 135&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death he had been suffering from [[influenza]] and fever. Before his death he had been notified that the telephone company had threatened to cut his phone service due to non-payment of fees, and his resulting distress may have contributed to his death.&lt;ref name="TBW7"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 7&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the timing of his death, some people speculated that he had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Roberts42"&gt;Roberts 42&lt;/ref&gt; His estate was declared insolvent on June 10, 1924, shortly following his death.&lt;ref name="lath"/&gt;

==Chin Tsong Palace==
[[File:Lim Chin Tsong Palace.jpg|thumb|Lim Chin Tsong Palace in 1920]]

Between 1915 and 1918,&lt;ref name="Roberts42"/&gt; Lim built a lavish residence in the Golden Valley area of Rangoon at a cost of over 2,000,000 rupees. The building includes a mixture of Eastern and Western architectural styles, and its five-story tower was built to resemble the Fu Xing Pavilion in the [[Summer Palace]], in [[Beijing]]. Building material was imported from both China and Italy, and foreign artists were employed to decorate its interior. The most notable artists to work on the building included the English painters [[Dod Procter|Dod]] and [[Ernest Procter]].&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt; The fusion of Chinese and Western architectural elements was not unusual in other British colonies with strong Chinese communities (such as [[Penang]] and [[Melaka]]), but was unique in Rangoon.&lt;ref name="Roberts42"/&gt;

The original name of the property was "Mount Pleasant",&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw&lt;/ref&gt; but after it construction the property became popularly known as "Chin Tsong Palace".&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; After the construction of Chin Tsong Palace, Lim and his wife regularly threw lavish parties and entertained the social elite of Rangoon.&lt;ref name="TBW6"/&gt; The most notable guest entertained by Lim at the residence was [[Georges Clemenceau]], who visited Burma in 1920.&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]], from 1941–45, the house was the headquarters for a Japanese radio station that broadcast propaganda, the "All Burma Broadcasting Station". Following Japan's defeat the house was owned by an Indian businessman, before being nationalized by the newly-independent Burmese government in 1950. After the Burmese government took ownership of the house, they turned it into a guesthouse and changed its official name to "Kanbawza Yeiktha". In the late 1960s the building was converted into a hostel for female students attending the Institute of Economics and the [[University of Yangon|Rangoon Arts and Science University]], which were nearby. Today, the house is used as an office and arts school by the Fine Arts Department of [[Ministry of Culture (Myanmar)|Myanmar's Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt;

In 2015 the Chin Tsong Palace was designated a heritage site by Myanmar's Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt; It is undergoing renovations and, as of 2017, remains open to the public. The renovations are scheduled to be completed in 2018, on the 100th anniversary of its construction.&lt;ref name="Downing"&gt;Downing&lt;/ref&gt; After the renovations, the Ministry of Culture plans to open the space as a cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;Than&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Lim was married to Tan Guat Tean (Po U in Burmese). She was illiterate, required an assistant to write and read for her, and signed her name with an "X".&lt;ref name="TBW7"/&gt; The couple had 8 children, including Lim Kar Chang, Lim Kar Hin, Lim Kar Kim, Lim Kar Taik, Lim Kar Tye, and Lim Gaik Kee. His second eldest son, Lim Kar Hin, died on 11 November 1916, preceding his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Straits Times'' 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

He sent his sons to be educated in England.&lt;ref name="TBW5"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 5&lt;/ref&gt; After Lim's death, many of his children left Burma, and his descendants now live in various [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim and his family were generally popular during his later life. When his eldest son was married (in the newly-completed Chin Tsong Palace), all of the notable European and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] residents of Rangoon attended. The day after the wedding, another wedding party was held in which all of the notable Burmese residents of Rangoon attended. Two days after the initial wedding, another party was held in which the notable Muslim members of the city attended. Finally, three days after the wedding, another party was held in which all of the notable Chinese people in Rangoon attended.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lim Chin Tsong's death, Lim Kar Chang, Lim's eldest son, took over the management of his company. Lim Kar Chang attempted to ameliorate his father's debts partially through repossession of property and businesses and partially through applying to have them written off.&lt;ref name="TBW7"/&gt; Despite Lim's efforts, the legal ownership of his properties was still in the process of litigation by at least 1929.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Lim's bank, Xie De Yuan (協德園), was acquired by [[Nam Hwa Bank]], a Japanese-owned firm, after it went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="sury"/&gt;

In 1938, executives at the Burmah Oil Company discovered that Lim's widow, Tan Guat Tean, though still living in Chin Tsong Palace, was destitute. Reminded of the long association that had existed between Lim and the company in its early years, they arranged for a modest payment to be made to provide for her well-being, which she received in January 1938.&lt;ref name="TBW7"/&gt;

==Legacy==
During his lifetime Lim was known for kindness and generosity among the Chinese community in Rangoon, and he donated a percentage of his commissions to maintaining schools for Chinese students.&lt;ref name="TBW5"/&gt; Today, Lim is not well known in Myanmar, and those who do know him mostly know that he was very wealthy, but that he died in ignominious circumstances. Among the [[Chinese people in Myanmar|Sino-Burmese]] community of Yangon, Lim is remembered as a man whose fall was partially caused by his hubris: in China, an [[Bagua|octagonal tower]] was only constructed by those with claims to imperial authority; by building his home in such a shape, believers in [[Feng shui|Chinese geomancy]] claim that he overstepped his place in the world and unwittingly caused his own demise. As a wealthy Chinese man from a colonial era, most modern Burmese people feel they have little connection to Lim.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 45&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lim's death, many stories circulated orally among the residents of Yangon concerning the sudden circumstances of his financial ruin and death. According to popular lore, Lim ran a counterfeiting operation from a secret chamber under his estate, and the construction of his residence included a network of secret tunnels leading to [[Inya Lake]], which were used to dispose of bodies. In popular legends, his sudden financial ruin is explained as being the result of a betrayal by a foreign wife employed by a [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|police special branch]], who uncovered his counterfeiting operation and reported him to the British authorities.&lt;ref name="Downing"/&gt;

Possibly corroborating these stories, a jockey living on Lim's estate, Thein Pe, claimed to have discovered Lim's counterfeiting operation shortly before his financial difficulties became acute, forcing Thein Pe to quickly pack his belongings and "flee".&lt;ref&gt;Win&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Lim's death, there was a foreign woman living on his estate who may have been close to him ("Miss Hannah Boudeville"). She went to court to challenge Lim's creditors' legal right to repossess her home, claiming that Lim had given the house to her as a gift.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt;

The '''National Business Education Accreditation Council (NBEAC)''' is a professional body under the administrative control of [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hec.gov.pk/english/services/universities/QAA/externalQA/PLA/Pages/By-Accreditation-Councils.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; NBEAC accredits [[Business Administration]], [[Public Administration]] and [[Management Sciences]] degree programs of Pakistan's educational institutes.

NBEAC function at the national level as an accreditation authority within its scope to facilitate enhancing the quality of business education in Pakistan. Since its inception, it has laid out systems, procedures, networks and programs to ensure that all degree awarding institutions in Pakistan are invited to achieve standards that are comparable with global standards and thus gain NBEAC accreditation. In future this accreditation could be used as a mechanism to introduce business school rankings to encourage competitiveness, quality, continuous improvement and sustainability in the Pakistan business education market.

NBEAC accreditation acts both as a status and a process.  Accreditation as status provides public notification that the accredited program meets standards of quality set forth by the NBEAC. As a process, accreditation reflects the fact that in achieving recognition by NBEAC, the institution and the program is committed to not only to meet standards but to continuously seek ways in which to enhance the quality of education in that program. Programmatic accreditation is an independent peer review process that validates that established standards of excellence set by the NBEAC are well met. NBEAC has designed these standards to assure that the graduates receive the quality of education in that program necessary for success in industry.

He has been accused of ordering military officers serving as his assistants to carry out attacks on business rivals, and even top generals are said to be wary of displeasing him.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=20396|title=Than Shwe's Son-in-law Named Ambassador to China|date=23 December 2010|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|access-date=|author=Wai Moe|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Nay Shwe Thway Aung has plan to buying one of the world's most popular football clubs, [[Manchester United]] football team for US $1 billion, according to US diplomatic cables revealed by [[WikiLeaks]], but he reportedly abandoned the plan, because such an investment only months after nearly 150,000 people were killed by [[Cyclone Nargis]], was deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/06/wikileaks-burma-manchester-united-takeover|title=WikiLeaks cables: Burma general considered Manchester United buyout|date=6 December 2010|work=The Guardian News|access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/03/21/soccer.wikileaks.manchester.myanmar/index.html|title=Soccerleaks: The football files|date=21 March 2011|publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dictator post==

In his 20th Birthday, Nay Shwe Thway Aung said "I will not succeed ruling authority from my grandfather [[Than Shwe]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://burma.irrawaddy.com/news/2011/11/16/2395.html |title=နေရွှေသွေးအောင် အကြောင်း|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=16 November 2011|accessdate=30 April 2018|language=my}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Than Shwe officially stepped down as head of state in favour of his hand-picked successor, [[Thein Sein]] to [[President of Burma]].

A '''Public Lending Right (PLR)''' programme, is a programme intended to either compensate authors for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in [[public library|public libraries]], or as a governmental support of the arts, through support of works available in public libraries, such as books, music and artwork.

Twenty-eight countries have a PLR programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.plrinternational.com/faqs/faqs.htm#recognise |title="Public Lending Right (PLR) International Network website." |access-date=2009-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228224731/http://www.plrinternational.com/faqs/faqs.htm#recognise#recognise |archive-date=2014-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are considering adopting one.  [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] currently have PLR programmes.  There is ongoing debate in [[France]] about implementing one.  There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the [[European Union]].

The first PLR programme was initiated in [[Denmark]] in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations' PLR programs are quite recent developments.

==National variations==
PLR programmes vary from country to country.  Some, like Germany and the Netherlands, have linked PLR to [[copyright]] legislation and have made libraries liable to pay authors for every [[book]] in their collection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Other countries do not connect PLR to copyright. For a nation like Canada or Australia the majority of funds would be going to authors outside the country, much of it to the United States, which is unpalatable to those nations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In Denmark, the current programme is considered a type of governmental support of the arts, not reimbursement of potential lost sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekogmedier.dk/medieomraadet/biblioteksafgift-mv/biblioteksafgift-for-boeger/ Styrelsen for Bibliotek og Medier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912014140/http://www.bibliotekogmedier.dk/medieomraadet/biblioteksafgift-mv/biblioteksafgift-for-boeger/ |date=2009-09-12 }} (Danish) 2009-08-19&lt;/ref&gt; Types of works supported are books, music, and visual artworks, created and published in Denmark, and available in public and school libraries.

===Payments===
How amounts of payment are determined also varies from country to country.  Some pay based on how many times a book has been taken out of a library, others use a simpler system of payment based simply on whether a library owns a book or not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The amount of payments is also variable.  The amount any one author can receive is never very considerable.  In Canada for instance the payment is [[Canadian dollar|C$]]38.30 per book per library, with a maximum of C$2,681 (in 2008) for any one author in a year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} In the United Kingdom authors are paid on a per-loan basis calculated from a representative sample of libraries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The current rate is 7.82 [[Pound sterling|pence]] per individual loan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/bl/global/services/plr/pdfs/newsletters/2017newsletter.pdf PLR News 2017 (British Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eligibility criteria===
Different countries also have differing eligibility criteria.  In most nations only published works are accepted, government publications are rarely counted, nor are [[bibliography|bibliographies]] or [[dictionary|dictionaries]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Some PLR services are mandated solely to fund literary works of [[fiction]], and some such as [[Norway]], have a sliding scale paying far less to [[non-fiction]] works.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Many nations also exclude scholarly and academic texts.

==EU directive==
Within the [[European Union]], the public lending right is regulated since November 1992 by [[directive 92/100/EEC]] on rental right and lending right. A report in 2002 from the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu.int/cgi-bin/eur-lex/udl.pl?REQUEST=Seek-Deliver&amp;COLLECTION=com&amp;SERVICE=eurlex&amp;LANGUAGE=en&amp;DOCID=502PC0502&amp;FORMAT=pdf Report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the public lending right in the European Union]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF), 2002-09-16
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that many member countries had failed to implement this directive correctly.

The PLR directive  has met with resistance from the side of the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). The IFLA has stated that  the principles of 'lending right' can jeopardize free access to the services of publicly accessible libraries, which is the citizen's human right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifla.org/III/clm/p1/PublicLendingRigh.htm The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Position on PLR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010081153/http://www.ifla.org/III/clm/p1/PublicLendingRigh.htm |date=2006-10-10 }} (April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The PLR directive and its implementation in public libraries is rejected by a number of European authors, including Nobel Laureates [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nopago.org/ |title=Campagna europea contro l'introduzione del prestito a pagamento in biblioteca (in Italian) |publisher=Nopago.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, more than 3000 authors signed a petition opposing PLR cuts in 2010.

'''Risk and strategic consulting''' refers to the provision of information, [[analysis]] and associated services in the field of international [[politics]] and [[economics]], with the aim of providing a better understanding of the risks and opportunities facing businesses, [[government]]s and other groups. 

In contrast to [[management consulting]], which primarily concerns internal organization and performance, risk and strategic consulting aims to provide clients with an improved understanding of the political and economic climate in which they operate. Most such consultancy is focused on those developing countries and emerging markets in which political and business risks may be greater, harder to manage, or harder to assess. Risk and strategic consulting is sometimes carried out alongside other activities such as corporate investigation, [[forensic accounting]], employee screening or vetting, and the provision of security systems, training or procedures. Some of the largest groups in the industry include [[Kroll Inc.]] and [[Control Risks Group]], though the size and range of consultancies varies widely, with groups such as [[Black Cube]] and [[Hakluyt &amp; Company]] providing boutique services. 

Risk and strategic consultancy does not generally involve the operational 'risk assessment' carried out by many companies and consultancies. Risk assessment in this sense covers the identification and management of commercial, operational and technical risks within existing operations or known markets. Risk and strategic consultancy also concerns countries and concerns similar to those of interest to [[private military companies]], though the two industries are distinct. Risk and strategy consultancies should not be confused with international lobbying or advocacy groups, though there are occasional overlaps. Clients of risk and strategic consulting firms include companies, governments and government agencies, charities and non-government organizations, academic institutions and individuals.

'''Stephen Shiu''' ({{zh|c=蕭若元|j=siu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; joek&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; jyun&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|p=Xiāo Ruòyuán}}, born 22 July 1949) is a [[Hong Kong]]-based [[media personality]], [[businessperson]], [[film producer]], [[screenwriter]], [[news presenter]], and [[pundit]]. He founded [[Hong Kong Reporter]] in 2004, an internet radio station focused on live talk radio broadcasting. In 2013 he founded memehk.com, a multimedia news site, after Hong Kong Reporter was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1591000/internet-radio-takes-city | title=Internet radio takes off in the city | work=SCMP | date=15 September 2014 | accessdate=22 February 2017 | author=Yau, Elaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born to a middle-class family in Hong Kong, Shiu is the third of six children. His father Pak-yin Shiu was an [[overseas Chinese]] construction materials businessman. Shiu studied at [[St. Paul's College, Hong Kong]] and was classmates with [[Tsang Tak-sing]], former [[Secretary for Home Affairs]]. He read History at the [[University of Hong Kong]] following his [[A-level#Hong Kong|A-levels]]. He began studying for a master's degree in History but dropped out.

==Career==
In 1987, Shiu began collaborating with [[Wong Yuk-long]] in creating popular comics such as ''Zui Quan'' (醉拳) and ''Oriental Heroes'' (龍虎門), on which films [[Drunken Master]] and [[Dragon Tiger Gate]] were based, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dannyfish.idv.tw/news/news_P06-02.htm | title=龍虎天地轉載《壹週刊》82期封面故事 | accessdate=22 April 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810005549/http://www.dannyfish.idv.tw/news/news_P06-02.htm | archivedate=10 August 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Shiu acquired Rainbow International Ltd (彩虹國際) and changed its name to 變靚D控股 Ltd, a body slimming company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xpweekly.com/share/xpweekly/0341/finance/20050301finance0100/content.htm | title=蕭若慈腐朽變神奇 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded [[Hong Kong Reporter]] (香港人網) in 2004. In recent years, it became a podium for radical ideas and helped garner support for political party [[People Power]], including its protests and activities.&lt;ref name="scmp"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1210922/hes-back-rapid-return-radio-stephen-shiu | title=He's back: the rapid return of 'Radio Stephen Shiu' | work=SCMP | date=10 April 2013 | accessdate=22 April 2015 | author=Cheung, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiu is a screenwriter and film producer whose works include 1992 [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] winner ''[[To Be Number One (film)|To Be Number One]]''. After the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover]], Shiu was a co-host on a Metro Radio current affairs programme before starting up his own stations online.&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt;

In 2013 Shiu announced that he is to launch a new radio station, weeks after having closed one of Hong Kong's biggest pro-[[democracy]] radio stations.&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt; Memehk.com was inaugurated shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1592966/internet-radio-stations-are-taking-hong-kong | title=Internet radio stations are taking off in Hong Kong | work=SCMP | date=15 September 2014 | accessdate=22 February 2017 | author=Yau, Elaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Shiu is an outspoken supporter of the [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace]] group, a pro-democracy, civil rights advocacy group that organised the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt;

In May 2012 he announced that he would close [[Hong Kong Reporter]] if [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] failed to win at least 3 seats in the city's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]]. In an interview he stated that 'Hong Kong is in grave danger', and that the Council needed enough opposition voices to counter [[Chief Executive (Hong Kong)|Chief Executive]]-elect [[Leung Chun-ying]].&lt;ref name="am730"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.am730.com.hk/article.php?article=109250 | title=【專訪蕭若元參選】「梁振英當選 香港危急存亡」 蕭若元參選 抗威權政府 | work=AM730 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a People Power hustings in June 2012 he declared his candidacy for the [[Hong Kong Island]] [[geographical constituency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nso7y0V-_vU | title=人民力量決志大會 蕭若元段 Video 2012年6月24日 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2013 he announced in his own radio programme that Hong Kong Reporter would cease production, citing his 'disappointment' in many of his former political allies and partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20130322/51311569 | title=老蕭：香港人網月底「執笠」 | work=蘋果日報 | date=22 March 2013 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it clear that he has withdrawn support for People Power, and would not support any other political party from that day forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/news/20130323/00176_036.html | title=《香港人網》傳內訌月底停播 | work=東方日報 | date=23 March 2013 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the purportedly politically unaffiliated memehk.com as its replacement on 1 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1576116/house-news-closed-last-month-other-independent-sites-still | title=House News closed last month, but other independent sites still exist | work=SCMP | date=19 August 2014 | accessdate=22 February 2017 | author=Yau, Elaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2014, one day after delivering a speech to the crowd at the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], Shiu's vehicle was forcibly stopped by two cars, causing damage to his vehicle. He was not injured as a result of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20141125/bkn-20141125002337599-1125_00822_001.html | title=蕭若元北角遇襲　座駕被撞毀 | work=東方日報 | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed the attack was in retaliation to his comments and news reports by his own outlet memehk.com, stating 'only criminal gangs are capable of [such acts]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.mingpao.com/ins/%E8%95%AD%E8%8B%A5%E5%85%83%E5%BA%A7%E9%A7%95%E8%A2%AB%E6%AF%80%EF%BC%9A%E8%88%87%E8%A8%80%E8%AB%96%E6%9C%89%E9%97%9C-%E7%A8%B1%E4%B8%8D%E6%B6%89%E9%87%91%E9%8C%A2%E6%A1%83%E8%89%B2%20%E7%9F%9B%E9%A0%AD%E6%8C%87%E5%90%91%E9%BB%91%E5%B9%AB/web_tc/article/20141125/s00001/1416874807399 | title=蕭若元座駕被毀：與言論有關 | work=明報 | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2003 Shiu was alleged to have been involved in a [[pyramid scheme]]. The company he co-created was accused of selling electronic currency to its customers, who later discovered they were unable to purchase goods at market value with said currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=現金券無得換　電子金幣搵笨　蕭若元 | work=壹週刊 | date=6 September 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2011, Shiu announced his intention to acquire [[Hong Kong Golden Forum]], a popular internet forum, and to merge it with Hong Kong Reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weibo.com/1737720971/xgyEN2Czo | title=Sina Weibo | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with vocal opposition from the forum's users,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forum2.hkgolden.com/view.aspx?message=3151627 | title=HK Golden Forum | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom created a number of parodies with profanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7tqwR4Cp0o | title=Youtube | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npChKF49SU8 | title=Youtube | accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;. It is executed by strategic planners or [[strategist]]s, who involve many parties and research sources in their analysis of the organization and its relationship to the environment in which it competes.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"&gt;{{cite book

Strategy has many definitions, but generally involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). The senior leadership of an organization is generally tasked with determining strategy.  Strategy can be planned (intended) or can be observed as a pattern of activity (emergent) as the organization adapts to its environment or competes.

Strategy includes processes of formulation and implementation; strategic planning helps coordinate both.  However, strategic planning is analytical in nature (i.e., it involves "finding the dots"); strategy formation itself involves synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") via [[strategic thinking]]. As such, strategic planning occurs around the strategy formation activity.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Strategic Management Framework.png|thumb|300px|Strategic management processes and activities]]

===Overview===
Strategic planning is a process and thus has inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes. This process, like all processes, has constraints. It may be formal or informal and is typically iterative, with feedback loops throughout the process. Some elements of the process may be continuous and others may be executed as discrete projects with a definitive start and end during a period. Strategic planning provides inputs for [[strategic thinking]], which guides the actual strategy formation.  The end result is the organization's strategy, including a diagnosis of the environment and competitive situation, a guiding policy on what the organization intends to accomplish, and key initiatives or action plans for achieving the guiding policy.  &lt;ref name="Rumelt2011"&gt;{{cite book

Michael Porter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:
#Company strengths and weaknesses;
#Personal values of the key implementers (i.e., management and the board); 
#Industry opportunities and threats; and
#Broader societal expectations.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"&gt;{{cite book

| authorlink = Michael Porter
| year = 1980
| title = [[Competitive Strategy]] | publisher = Free Press
| isbn = 0-684-84148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment).&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;  These elements are considered throughout the strategic planning process.

===Inputs===
Data is gathered from a variety of sources, such as interviews with key executives, review of publicly available documents on the competition or market, primary research (e.g., visiting or observing competitor places of business or comparing prices), industry studies, etc.  This may be part of a [[competitive intelligence]] program. Inputs are gathered to help support an understanding of the competitive environment and its opportunities and risks. Other inputs include an understanding of the values of key stakeholders, such as the board, shareholders, and senior management. These values may be captured in an organization's [[vision statement|vision]] and [[mission statement|mission]] statements.

===Activities===
{{quote box|width = 300px|quote=The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment.|source=[[Michael Porter]]&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;}}
Strategic planning activities include meetings and other communication among the organization's leaders and personnel to develop a common understanding regarding the competitive environment and what the organization's response to that environment (its strategy) should be. A variety of strategic planning tools (described in the section below) may be completed as part of strategic planning activities.

The organization's leaders may have a series of questions they want answered in formulating the strategy and gathering inputs, such as: 
*What is the organization's business or interest?
*What is considered "value" to the customer or constituency?
*Which products and services should be included or excluded from the portfolio of offerings?
*What is the geographic scope of the organization?
*What differentiates the organization from its competitors in the eyes of customers and other stakeholders?
*Which skills and resources should be developed within the organization?&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drucker1954"&gt;{{cite book

| authorlink = Peter Drucker
| year = 1954
| title = The Practice of Management | publisher = Harper &amp; Row
| isbn = 0-06-091316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outputs===
The output of strategic planning includes documentation and communication describing the organization's strategy and how it should be implemented, sometimes referred to as the strategic plan. The strategy may include a diagnosis of the competitive situation, a guiding policy for achieving the organization's goals, and specific action plans to be implemented.&lt;ref name="Rumelt2011"/&gt;  A strategic plan may cover multiple years and be updated periodically.

The organization may use a variety of methods of measuring and monitoring progress towards the objectives and measures established, such as a [[balanced scorecard]] or [[strategy map]].  Companies may also plan their financial statements (i.e., balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows) for several years when developing their strategic plan, as part of the goal setting activity. The term operational [[budget]] is often used to describe the expected financial performance of an organization for the upcoming year. Capital budgets very often form the backbone of a strategic plan, especially as it increasingly relates to Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

===Outcomes===
Whilst the planning process produces outputs, as described above, [[strategy implementation]] or execution of the strategic plan produces Outcomes. These outcomes will invariably differ from the strategic goals. How close they are to the strategic goals and vision will determine the success or failure of the strategic plan. There will also arise unintended Outcomes, which need to be attended to and understood for strategy development and execution to be a true learning process.

== Tools and approaches ==
[[File:Wikimedia Strategic Plan.ogv|thumb|Video explaining the strategic plan of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]]]
[[File:WMF StrategicPlan2011 spreads.pdf|thumb|Wikimedia Movement Strategic Plan (PDF)]]

A variety of analytical tools and techniques are used in strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt; These were developed by companies and management consulting firms to help provide a framework for strategic planning. Such tools include:
* [[PEST analysis]], which covers the remote external environment elements such as political, economic, social and technological (PESTLE adds legal/regulatory and ecological/environmental); 
* [[Scenario planning]], which was originally used in the military and recently used by large corporations to analyze future scenarios;
* [[Porter five forces analysis]], which addresses industry attractiveness and rivalry through the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and the threat of substitute products and new market entrants;
* [[SWOT analysis]], which addresses internal strengths and weaknesses relative to the external opportunities and threats; 
* [[Growth-share matrix]], which involves portfolio decisions about which businesses to retain or divest; and
* [[Balanced Scorecard]]s and [[strategy maps]], which creates a systematic framework for measuring and controlling strategy.
*[[Responsive evaluation|Responsive Evaluation]], which uses a constructivist evaluation approach to identify the outcomes of objectives, which then supports future strategic planning exercises.

==Strategic planning vs. financial planning==
Simply extending financial statement projections into the future without consideration of the competitive environment is a form of financial planning or budgeting, not strategic planning. In business, the term "financial plan" is often used to describe the expected financial performance of an organization for future periods. The term "budget" is used for a financial plan for the upcoming year. A "forecast" is typically a combination of actual performance year-to-date plus expected performance for the remainder of the year, so is generally compared against plan or budget and prior performance. The financial plans accompanying a strategic plan may include 3–5 years of projected performance.

[[McKinsey &amp; Company]] developed a [[capability maturity model]] in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:
#Financial planning, which is primarily about annual budgets and a functional focus, with limited regard for the environment;
#Forecast-based planning, which includes multi-year financial plans and more robust capital allocation across business units;
#Externally oriented planning, where a thorough situation analysis and competitive assessment is performed; 
#Strategic management, where widespread [[strategic thinking]] occurs and a well-defined strategic framework is used.
Categories 3 and 4 are strategic planning, while the first two categories are non-strategic or essentially financial planning. Each stage builds on the previous stages; that is, a stage 4 organization completes activities in all four categories.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"&gt;{{cite book

For Michael C. Sekora, [[Project Socrates]] founder in the Reagan White House, during the [[cold war]] the economically challenged [[Soviet Union]] was able to keep on western military capabilities by using technology-based planning while the U.S. was slowed by finance-based planning, until the Reagan administration launched the Socrates Project, which should be revived to keep up with [[China as an emerging superpower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/defense/opinion-cold-war-budget-tool-could-save-pentagon |title= Opinion: The Cold War Budget Tool That Could Save The Pentagon |date= Feb 2, 2018 |author= Michael C. Sekora |work= [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Strategic planning vs. strategic thinking===
Strategic planning has been criticized for attempting to systematize [[strategic thinking]] and strategy formation, which [[Henry Mintzberg]] argues are inherently creative activities involving synthesis or "connecting the dots" which cannot be systematized.  Mintzberg argues that strategic planning can help coordinate planning efforts and measure progress on strategic goals, but that it occurs "around" the strategy formation process rather than within it. Further, strategic planning functions remote from the "front lines" or contact with the competitive environment (i.e., in business, facing the customer where the effect of competition is most clearly evident) may not be effective at supporting strategy efforts.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

A '''syndicated loan''' is one that is provided by a group of lenders and is structured, arranged, and administered by one or several [[commercial bank]]s or [[investment bank]]s known as [[lead arranger]]s.

The syndicated loan market is the dominant way for [[corporations]] in the U.S. and Europe to receive loans from [[bank]]s and other institutional [[financial capital]] providers. [[Financial law]] often regulates the industry. The U.S. market originated with the large [[leveraged buyout]] loans of the mid-1980s,&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title= The Handbook of Loan Syndications &amp; Trading |last= Taylor|first= Alison|authorlink= |author2=Sansone, Alicia |year= 2007|publisher= McGraw-Hill|location= New York|isbn= 0-07-146898-6|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} and Europe's market blossomed with the launch of the euro in 1999.

At the most basic level, arrangers serve the investment-banking role of raising investor funding for an issuer in need of capital. The issuer pays the arranger a fee for this service, and this fee increases with the complexity and risk factors of the loan. As a result, the most profitable loans are those to leveraged borrowers—issuers whose [[credit rating]]s are [[speculative grade]] and who are paying spreads (premiums or margins above the relevant [[LIBOR]] in the U.S. and UK, [[Euribor]] in Europe or another base rate) sufficient to attract the interest of non-bank term loan investors. Though, this threshold moves up and down depending on market conditions.

In the U.S., corporate borrowers and private equity sponsors fairly even-handedly drive debt issuance. Europe, however, has far less corporate activity and its issuance is dominated by private equity sponsors, who, in turn, determine many of the standards and practices of loan syndication.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;{{rp|36}}

==Loan market overview==

The retail market for a syndicated loan consists of banks and in the case of leveraged transactions, [[financial institution|finance companies]] and [[institutional investors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Managing Credit Risk|last= Caouette|first= John B.|authorlink= |author2=Altman, Edward I. |year= 1998|publisher= Wiley|location= New York|isbn= 0-471-11189-9|page= 19|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of power among these different investor groups is different in the U.S. than in Europe. The U.S. has a capital market where pricing is linked to credit quality and institutional investor appetite. In Europe, although institutional investors have increased their market presence over the past decade, banks remain a key part of the market. Consequently, pricing is not fully driven by capital market forces.

In the U.S., market [[flex language]] drives initial pricing levels. Before formally launching a loan to these retail accounts, arrangers will often get a market read by informally polling select investors to gauge their appetite for the credit. After this market read, the arrangers will launch the deal at a spread and fee that it thinks will clear the market. Once the pricing, or the initial spread over a base rate (usually LIBOR), was set, it was largely fixed, except in the most extreme cases. If the loans were undersubscribed, the arrangers could very well be left above their desired hold level. Since the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] roiled the market, however, arrangers have adopted market-flex contractual language, which allows them to change the pricing of the loan based on investor demand—in some cases within a predetermined range—and to shift amounts between various [[tranche]]s of a loan. This is now a standard feature of syndicated loan commitment letters.

As a result of market flex, loan syndication functions as a [[book building|book-building]] exercise, in [[bond market|bond-market]] parlance. A loan is originally launched to market at a target spread or, as was increasingly common by 2008 with a range of spreads referred to as price talk (i.e., a target spread of, say, LIBOR+250 to LIBOR+275). Investors then will make commitments that in many cases are tiered by the spread. For example, an account may put in for $25 million at LIBOR+275 or $15 million at LIBOR+250. At the end of the process, the arranger will total up the commitments and then make a call on where to price the paper. Following the example above, if the paper is vastly oversubscribed at LIBOR+250, the arranger may slice the spread further. Conversely, if it is undersubscribed even at LIBOR+275, then the arranger will be forced to raise the spread to bring more money to the table.

In Europe, banks have historically dominated the debt markets because of the intrinsically regional nature of the arena. [[Regional bank]]s have traditionally funded local and regional enterprises because they are familiar with regional issuers and can fund the local currency. Since the [[Eurozone]] was formed in 1998, the growth of the European leveraged loan market has been fuelled by the efficiency provided by this single currency as well as an overall growth in [[merger]] &amp; acquisition (M&amp;A) activity, particularly leveraged buyouts due to private equity activity. Regional barriers (and sensitivities toward consolidation across borders) have fallen, economies have grown and the euro has helped to bridge currency gaps.

As a result, in Europe, more and more leveraged buyouts have occurred over the past decade and, more significantly, they have grown in size as arrangers have been able to raise bigger pools of capital to support larger, multi-national transactions. To fuel this growing market, a broader array of banks from multiple regions now fund these deals, along with European institutional investors and U.S. institutional investors, resulting in the creation of a loan market that crosses the Atlantic.

The European market has taken advantage of many of the lessons from the U.S. market, while maintaining its regional diversity. In Europe, the regional diversity allows banks to maintain a significant lending influence and fosters private equity’s dominance in the market.

==Types of syndications==
Globally, there are three types of [[underwriting]] for syndications: an underwritten deal, best-efforts syndication, and a [[club deal]]. The European leveraged syndicated loan market almost exclusively consists of underwritten deals, whereas the U.S. market contains mostly best-efforts.

===Underwritten deal===
An underwritten deal is one for which the arrangers guarantee the entire commitment, then syndicate the loan. If the arrangers cannot fully subscribe the loan, they are forced to absorb the difference, which they may later try to sell to investors. This is easy, of course, if market conditions, or the credit’s fundamentals, improve. If not, the arranger may be forced to sell at a discount and, potentially, even take a loss on the paper. Or the arranger may just be left above its desired hold level of the credit.

Arrangers underwrite loans for several reasons. First, offering an underwritten loan can be a competitive tool to win mandates. Second, underwritten loans usually require more lucrative fees because the agent is on the hook if potential lenders balk. Of course, with flex-language now common, underwriting a deal does not carry the same risk it once did when the pricing was set in stone prior to syndication.

===Best-efforts syndication===
A best-efforts syndication is one for which the arranger group commits to underwrite less than or equal to the entire amount of the loan, leaving the credit to the vicissitudes of the market. If the loan is undersubscribed, the credit may not close—or may need significant adjustments to its interest rate or credit rating to clear the market. Traditionally, best-efforts syndications were used for risky borrowers or for complex transactions. Since the late 1990s, however, the rapid acceptance of market-flex language has made best-efforts loans the rule even for investment-grade transactions.

===Club deal===
A club deal is a smaller loan—usually $25–100 million, but as high as $150 million—that is premarketed to a group of relationship lenders. The arranger is generally a first among equals, and each lender gets a full cut, or nearly a full cut, of the fees.

==The syndication process==
As a syndicated loan is a collection of bilateral loans between a borrower and several banks, the structure of the transaction is to isolate each bank's interest whilst maximising the collective efficiency of monitoring and enforcement of a single lender. The essence is to make loans on similar terms to make a bundle of loans into a single agreement. This draws upon [[Loan Market Association]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;Mugasha 'The Law of Multi-bank Financing' Chapters 1 and 3, (2007) OUP&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, three key actors operate within a syndicated lending:
*'''Arranger''' 
*'''Agent'''
*'''Trustee'''
These actors utilise two core legal concepts to overcome the difficulty of large-cap lending, those being Agency and Trusts. A single bank may not on its own be willing or able to advance the whole amount. The essence of syndication is that two or more banks agree to make loans to a borrower on common terms governed by a single agreement. This agreement not only regulates the relationship between the lenders and the borrower but importantly between lenders. Most loans are documented using LMA precedents, in England, this will not be on the lenders' 'written standard terms of business' for the purposes of UCTA 1977.&lt;ref&gt;African Export-Import Bank v Shebah Exploration (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction in the lending agreements, and use of the three aforementioned actors is primarily to avoid the creation of a partnership, avoid lenders from inadvertently acting as [[Guarantee|guarantors]] to one another - or to prevent [[Set-off (law)|Set-off]].&lt;ref&gt;Sempra Meals Ltd v IRC [2008] 1 AC 561, [74]-[100]&lt;/ref&gt; The borrower is sometimes given a ''"Yank the bank"'' power to force a transfer of a lenders interest in repayment (a chose in action) if the lender does not consent to a waiver or amendment. Lenders are traditionally limited in their decision-making by overlapping clauses requiring voting and collective decision-making. This acts as a disincentive for individual lenders to act in their own interests over the collective group. It has been suggested that the historical cooperation within the London loan market helped produce efficiency insolvency work-outs through the [[London Approach]].

===Lending Terms===
There are several common types of lending terms, including implied terms in syndicated lending that affect the operation and coordination of lending behaviour.
*Snooze-you-lose provision where lenders are required to submit their votes, these are contractual discretions which allow. These were found within several cases which regard terms relating to contractual discretions which must be exercised for the purposes which they are conferred.
*Good Faith

===Participants===
Within the banking sector, the role of setting up syndicated loans differ from deal to deal but generally a handful of key actors are consistent. These were the aforementioned key actors of the arranging bank, the agent, and the trustee.

====Arranging Bank====
The arranging bank acts as a salesman, and may be cannot exclude liability in its role of representing the agreement; either through misrepresentation, negligence, or breach of fiduciary duty. It may also be liable if it fails to do its best endeavours to acquire lending parties, these vary depending on the law of representation and fiduciary duty within national law.&lt;ref&gt;Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Bankque Bruxelles Lambert SA [1997] 1 Lloyds Rep 487; IFE Funds SA v Goldman Sachs International [2007] EWCA Civ 811; cf the extensive liability in Australian NatWest Australia Bank Ltd v Tricontinental Corp Ltd [1993] ATPR (Digest)&lt;/ref&gt; Syndication is generally initiated by the grant of a mandate by the borrower to the arranging bank(s) or 'lead managers' setting out the financial terms of the proposed loan. The financial terms are set out in a ''"term sheet"'''which states the amount, term of the loan, repayment schedule, interest margin, fees any special terms, and a general statement that the loan will contain representations and warranties. This might include terms which relate to when the loan is to finance a company acquisition or a large infrastructure project, conferring interests in the lenders. Often term sheets are made to be expressly non-binding. However, in ''Maple Leaf Macro Volatility Master Fund v Rouvroy (2009)'' a loan term sheet was held to create a contract.

====Agent====
The core function of the Agent is to act as a conduit between the borrowers and the lenders. The agent owes contractual duties both to the borrower AND to the lenders. In TORRE ASSET FUNDING v RBS (2013) the mezzanine lenders alleged it was the Agent’s duty to inform them of when an event of default occurred. The relationship of the agent tends not to be a fiduciary one.&lt;ref&gt;Mugasha 'The Law of Multi-bank Financing' Chapter 3, (2007) OUP&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of a fiduciary relationship is that they may be reasonably expected to subordinate their own commercial interests to that of their beneficiary, in English law, this is not representative of a banking relationship.
They are;
* Not fiduciaries
* No advisory duty as agent bank’s duties are ‘solely mechanical and administrative in nature’.
The agent bank’s express duty, is to provide information designed to enable lenders to consider how to exercise their right under various facility agreements in relation to accelerating the debt, not to assist with ‘exit’ or liability for misstatements.’ As set out in Torre, the agent is typically a conduit between borrowers and lenders. They are typically described as solely technical and owe no fiduciary. They hold no duty to advise and are not liable for negligence.

====Trustee====
Security will usually be held by a [[trustee]], as is common within [[Bond Issue|Bond]] issuances on behalf of the lenders. This makes taking security easier, since there is a single chargee which is unlikely to change through the duration of the loan (through the secondary market). In [[jurisdictions]] where the trust is not recognised, it is often addressed by parallel debt provisions stating that the amount outstanding is deemed to be owing to the security trustee but will be reduced by any amounts actually received by the syndicate members. 
* Duty to enforce security under an event of default, or instruction by lenders
* valuation and described as solely technical. They are fiduciary for lenders but not necessarily all lenders. 
Trustee duties cannot be fully excluded, core of that is fiduciary. Some discretion and good faith is sufficient. Statutory regulation is not desired, as doing so will likely limit the number willing trustees.

===Sub-participation===

There are normally no express restrictions on sub-participations. Banks usually exclude the requirement for consent if there has been an event of default to enable the bank to sell a defaulted loan without consent from the borrower. Similarly the requirement for consent is often excluded if the assignment is to an affiliate of an existing lender. Bank which has been a loan and not been repaid holds an asset comprising the debt of the borrower. Lead bank to engage in such asset sales relate inter alia to over exposure, regulatory capital requirements, liquidity, and arbitrage. {{Quote|Transfer provisions in syndicated loan agreement set up procedures under which all the parties to the loan agreement agree that if a lender and a transferee (i) agree upon a transfer of all or part of the lender’s interest (ii) record the agreement but not the price or other ancillary matters which are to be dealt with separately and (iii) deliver this to the agent bank, the transfer will take effect. The effect of the transfer is that the transferee becomes a party to the agreement with rights and obligations which are the same - the identity of the parties expected - as those the ‘transferor’ had before the transfer. […] can be structured to give the borrower total or partial control over the type or identity of specific transferees or classes}}&lt;ref&gt;Mugasha 'The Law of Multi-bank Financing' Chapter 1, 40 (2007) OUP&lt;/ref&gt;

Assignments may be permitted to assignees who satisfy stipulated criteria or who are included on a list of permitted assignees (a so-called 'white list') or are not on a list of prohibited assignees (a 'black list’). The borrower's liabilities are not to be increased as a result of an assignment or change of lending office: under the tax grossing-up or increased cost clauses.

Syndicated credits generally contain a provision whereby a bank may novate its rights and obligations to another bank. The object of the novation is to ensure a transfer of obligations of the bank to lend; without this transfer releasing the original bank, the original bank may have a continuing credit exposure to the transferee bank if the transferee bank fails to make a new loan to the borrower when required by the loan agreement and this exposure may attract a capital adequacy requirement.
Novation may amount to a complete substitution of the new bank or rather as an assignment of the rights of the old bank and the assumption by the new bank of obligations under the loan agreement plus the release of the old bank. The difference between the two is that a novation cancels old loans completely (which might have adverse effects on any security for the loan unless held by a trustee for the banks) whereas an assignment and assumption preserves the old loans and their security.
Other obligations of a bank which may be transferred in this way are obligations to indemnify the agent and obligations under a pro rata sharing clause. In the case of assignments of rights, it may be a requirement that the assignee assumes these obligations to the existing banks.

The contractual mechanics of the novation are that the agent bank is authorised by the borrower and the banks in the credit agreement to sign the scheduled novation certificates on behalf of the borrower and the banks so that all parties are bound.&lt;ref&gt;Habibsons Bank Ltd v Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) [2010] EWCA Civ 1335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between Lenders===
Four reasons can cause conflicts between lenders:

====Co-ordination====
Decision making requires coordination. Bonds are widely dispersed and the holder’s identity is often unknown to the issuer or other bond holders due to the intermediate holding of securities. Scheme of arrangement require majority in number (head-count test) whereas if bonds are issued on a global note there is only one true creditor with sub participation through trusts. The solution to this problem is to develop inter-creditor agreements. To overcome the head-count test issues in bonds: bondholders can be given definite notes (although costly) or on the basis of this right be perceived as contingent-creditors.

====Tragedy of the Commons====
Hardin writes that Individual management and enforcement of the loans/bond increases individual monitoring costs, enforcement costs and facilities wealth destruction due to premature acceleration of loan/bond and enforcement of security. Collective issues can be addressed again by the inter-creditor agreements. Management and enforcement is in principle vested in a single individual in order to reduce monitoring costs and value distraction. This is a crucial concept within insolvency, which is primarily concerned with 
# BONDS: Individual action by bond holders is not allowed. This is personified by a no-action clause unless the trustee fails to enforce within a reasonable time of instruction. No-action clauses can be seen as a contractual variant of Vanderpitte procedure( a beneficiary can force a party to bring an action by bringing an action against the trustee).  A bond trustee is obliged to enforce if; 
* event of default
*certification of material prejudice
*instruction from bond holders; and
*satisfactory indemnity 
# SYNDICATED; Security trustees within these situations are obliged to enforce upon an event of default AND majority instructions. Individual action by a lender is possible because their rights are several and not joint. However, they do not have the benefit of security as it is vested in the strictly trustee. The result is that the realisation of the security to pay off the called debt (if not all parties are calling the debt) is shared severally pro rata. This discourages parties from realising the debt. This is found within a ‘pro-rata sharing clause’ by forcing individual lenders to share individual recoveries which reduces incentive to cut-the-line behaviour.

====Tragedy of the anti-commons====
As we  have outlined above, veto-rights of individual bond holders/lenders can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. For example, a proper restructuring benefitting everyone is blocked. A solution to this problem is restrictions on agreements based on majorities. Majority can bind a minority, with the exception of some ‘all lenders matters’. In case of loans, majority lenders typically defined as 50% or 75% of value based on commitments. Non-consenting banks can sometimes be forced to transfer. This was observed in the Yank-the-bank clause outlined above.

====Minority oppression &amp; Prisoners dilemma====
Majority might oppress minority bond holders/lenders. Coordination problems lead to lenders to prefer sub-optimal options, because it is the safest option but not necessarily the best. Two forms of protections exist to prevent minority oppression. Several concepts have been outlined above and below, but it will be useful to be summarised here in order to appreciate the two primary methods of lenders within minority positions. 
# Transfer:
Minority lenders who feel oppressed may choose to transfer their debts to other, although conflict might limit amount of willing buyers to reduce price of the loan/bonds
# Implied term:
It is an implied term in loan and bond agreements that the majority must act in good faith and for the purpose of benefiting the class as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Redwood Master Fund Ltd v TD Bank Europe Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to the express terms of contract. Where there are different classes, there is no need to vote in interests of the creditor as a whole. Therefore, in last years exam, the subordinated nature of the second lender meant that there was a different class and the first group could call the debt without consequence of the second group being hesitant.

==Leveraged Transaction==
Leveraged transactions fund a number of purposes. They provide support for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, and expansion. They refinance the existing capital structure or support a full recapitalization including, not infrequently, the payment of a dividend to the equity holders. They provide funding to corporations undergoing restructurings, including bankruptcy, in the form of super senior loans also known as [[debtor in possession]] (DIP) loans. Their primary purpose, however, is to fund M&amp;A activity, specifically leveraged buyouts, where the buyer uses the debt markets to acquire the acquisition target’s equity.

In the U.S., the core of leveraged lending comes from buyouts resulting from corporate activity, while, in Europe, private equity funds drive buyouts. In the U.S., all private equity related activities, including refinancings and recapitalizations, are called sponsored transactions; in Europe, they are referred to as LBOs.

A buyout transaction originates well before lenders see the transaction’s terms. In a buyout, the company is first put up for auction. With sponsored transactions, a company that is for the first time up for sale to private equity sponsors is a primary LBO; a secondary LBO is one that is going from one sponsor to another sponsor, and a tertiary is one that is going for the second time from sponsor to sponsor. A public-to-private transaction (P2P) occurs when a company is going from the public domain to a private equity sponsor.

As prospective acquirers are evaluating target companies, they are also lining up debt financing. A [[staple financing]] package may be on offer as part of the sale process. By the time the auction winner is announced, that acquirer usually has funds linked up via a financing package funded by its designated arranger, or, in Europe, [[mandated lead arranger]] (MLA).

Before awarding a mandate, an issuer might solicit bids from arrangers. The banks will outline their syndication strategy and qualifications, as well as their view on the way the loan will price in market. Once the mandate is awarded, the syndication process starts.

In Europe, where [[mezzanine capital]] funding is a market standard, issuers may choose to pursue a dual track approach to syndication whereby the MLAs handle the senior debt and a specialist mezzanine fund oversees placement of the subordinated mezzanine position.

The arranger will prepare an information memo (IM) describing the terms of the transactions. The IM typically will include an executive summary, investment considerations, a list of terms and conditions, an industry overview, and a [[financial model]]. Because loans are unregistered securities, this will be a confidential offering made only to qualified banks and [[accredited investor]]s. If the issuer is speculative grade and seeking capital from nonbank investors, the arranger will often prepare a “public” version of the IM. This version will be stripped of all confidential material such as management financial projections so that it can be viewed by accounts that operate on the public side of the wall or that want to preserve their ability to buy bonds or stock or other public securities of the particular issuer (see the Public Versus Private section below). Naturally, investors that view materially nonpublic information of a company are disqualified from buying the company’s public securities for some period of time. As the IM (or “bank book,” in traditional market lingo) is being prepared, the syndicate desk will solicit informal feedback from potential investors on what their appetite for the deal will be and at what price they are willing to invest. Once this intelligence has been gathered, the agent will formally market the deal to potential investors.

The executive summary will include a description of the issuer, an overview of the transaction and rationale, sources and uses, and key statistics on the financials. Investment considerations will be, basically, management’s sales “pitch” for the deal.

The list of terms and conditions will be a preliminary [[term sheet]] describing the pricing, structure, [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], covenants, and other terms of the credit (covenants are usually negotiated in detail after the arranger receives investor feedback).

The industry overview will be a description of the company’s industry and competitive position relative to its industry peers.

The [[financial model]] will be a detailed model of the issuer’s historical, [[pro forma]], and projected financials including management’s high, low, and base case for the issuer.

Most new acquisition-related loans are kicked off at a bank meeting at which potential lenders hear management and the [[private equity|sponsor group]] (if there is one) describe what the terms of the loan are and what transaction it backs. Management will provide its vision for the transaction and, most importantly, tell why and how the lenders will be repaid on or ahead of schedule. In addition, investors will be briefed regarding the multiple exit strategies, including second ways out via asset sales. (If it is a small deal or a [[refinancing]] instead of a formal meeting, there may be a series of calls or one-on-one meetings with potential investors.)

In Europe, the syndication process has multiple steps reflecting the complexities of selling down through regional banks and investors. The roles of each of the players in each of the phases are based on their relationships in the market and access to paper. On the arrangers’ side, the players are determined by how well they can access capital in the market and bring in lenders. On the lenders’ side, it is about getting access to as many deals as possible.

There are three primary phases of syndication in Europe. During the underwriting phase, the sponsor or corporate borrowers designate the MLA (or the group of MLAs) and the deal is initially underwritten. During the sub-underwriting phases, other arrangers are brought into the deal. In general syndication, the transaction is opened up to the institutional investor market, along with other banks that are interested in participating.

In the U.S. and in Europe, once the loan is closed, the final terms are then documented in detailed credit and [[security agreement]]s. Subsequently, liens are perfected and collateral is attached.

Loans, by their nature, are flexible documents that can be revised and amended from time to time after they have closed. These amendments require different levels of approval. Amendments can range from something as simple as a covenant waiver to something as complex as a change in the collateral package or allowing the issuer to stretch out its payments or make an acquisition.

==Loan market participants==
There are three primary-investor constituencies: banks, finance companies, and institutional investors; in Europe, only the banks and institutional investors are active.

In Europe, the banking segment is almost exclusively made up of commercial banks, while in the U.S. it is much more diverse and can involve commercial and investments banks, business development corporations or finance companies, and institutional investors such as asset managers, insurance companies and loan mutual funds and loan ETFs. As in Europe,  commercial banks in the U.S. provide the vast majority of   [[investment-grade]] loans. These are typically large [[revolving credit]]s that back [[commercial paper]] or are used for general corporate purposes or, in some cases, acquisitions.

For leveraged loans, considered non-investment grade risk, U.S. and European banks typically provide the revolving credits, [[letter of credit|letters of credit (L/Cs)]], and—although they are becoming increasingly less common—[[amortizing loan|fully amortizing term loans]] known as "Term Loan A" under a syndicated loan agreement while institutions provide the partially amortizing term loans known a  "Term Loan B".

Finance companies have consistently represented less than 10% of the leveraged loan market, and tend to play in smaller deals—$25–200 million. These investors often seek asset-based loans that carry wide spreads and that often feature time-intensive collateral monitoring.

Institutional investors in the loan market are principally [[structured investment vehicle|structured vehicles]] known as [[collateralized loan obligation]]s (CLO) and [[participation loan|loan participation]] [[mutual fund]]s (known as “prime funds” because they were originally pitched to investors as a [[Money market fund|money-market]]-like fund that would approximate the prime rate) also play a large role. Although U.S. prime funds do make allocations to the European loan market, there is no European version of prime funds because European regulatory bodies, such as the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) in the U.K., have not approved loans for retail investors.

In addition, [[hedge fund]]s, [[bond fund|high-yield bond funds]], [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance company|insurance companies]], and other proprietary investors do participate opportunistically in loans. Typically, however, they invest principally in wide-margin loans (referred to by some players as “high-octane” loans), with spreads of 500 basis points or higher over the base rate.

CLOs are [[special-purpose vehicles]] set up to hold and manage pools of leveraged loans. The special-purpose vehicle is financed with several tranches of debt (typically a ‘AAA’ rated tranche, a ‘AA’ tranche, a ‘BBB’ tranche, and a mezzanine tranche with a non-investment grade rating) that have rights to the collateral and payment stream in descending order. In addition, there is an [[Ownership equity|equity]] tranche, but the equity tranche is usually not rated. CLOs are created as [[arbitrage]] vehicles that generate equity returns through [[leverage (finance)|leverage]], by issuing debt 10 to 11 times their equity contribution. There are also market-value CLOs that are less leveraged—typically three to five times—and allow managers more flexibility than more tightly structured arbitrage deals. CLOs are usually rated by two of the three major ratings agencies and impose a series of covenant tests on collateral managers, including minimum rating, industry diversification, and maximum [[Default (finance)|default]] basket.

In U.S., before the financial crisis in 2007-2008, CLOs had become the dominant form of institutional investment in the leveraged loan market taking a commanding 60% of primary activity by institutional investors by 2007.  But when the structured finance market cratered in late 2007, CLO issuance tumbled and by mid-2008, the CLO share had fallen to 40%. In 2014 CLO issuance has demonstrated a full recovery with issuance of $90 billion by August, an amount that effectively equals the previous record set in 2007.   Projections on total issuance for 2014 are as high as $125 billion.

In Europe, over the past few years, other vehicles such as credit funds have begun to appear on the market. Credit funds are open-ended pools of debt investments. Unlike CLOs, however, they are not subject to ratings oversight or restrictions regarding industry or ratings diversification. They are generally lightly levered (two or three times), allow managers significant freedom in picking and choosing investments, and are subject to being marked to market.

In addition, in Europe, mezzanine funds play a significant role in the loan market. Mezzanine funds are also investment pools, which traditionally focused on the mezzanine market only. However, when second lien entered the market, it eroded the mezzanine market; consequently, mezzanine funds expanded their investment universe and began to commit to second lien as well as payment-in-kind (PIK) portions of transaction. As with credit funds, these pools are not subject to ratings oversight or diversification requirements, and allow managers significant freedom in picking and choosing investments. Mezzanine funds are, however, riskier than credit funds in that they carry both debt and equity characteristics.

[[financial market participants|Retail investors]] can access the loan market through prime funds.  Prime funds were first introduced in the late 1980s. Most of the original prime funds were continuously offered funds with quarterly tender periods. Managers then rolled true [[closed-end fund|closed-end]], exchange-traded funds in the early 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s that fund complexes introduced [[open-end fund|open-ended]] funds that were redeemable each day. While quarterly redemption funds and closed-end funds remained the standard because the secondary loan market does not offer the rich liquidity that is supportive of open-end funds, the open-end funds had sufficiently raised their profile that by mid-2008 they accounted for 15-20% of the loan assets held by mutual funds.

As the ranks of institutional investors have grown over the years, the loan markets have changed to support their growth. Institutional term loans have become commonplace in a credit structure. Secondary trading is a routine activity and mark-to-market pricing as well as [[S&amp;P Leveraged Loan Index|leveraged loan indexes]] have become portfolio management standards.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;{{rp|68}}

==Credit facilities==
Syndicated loans facilities (credit facilities) are basically financial assistance programs that are designed to help financial institutions and other institutional investors to draw notional amount as per the requirement.

There are four main types of syndicated loan facilities: a revolving credit; a term loan; an L/C; and an acquisition or equipment line (a delayed-draw term loan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= High-Yield Bonds|last= Fabozzi|first= Frank|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= McGraw-Hill|location= New York|isbn= 0-07-006786-4|page= 43|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revolving credit line allows borrowers to draw down, repay and reborrow as often as necessary. The facility acts much like a corporate credit card, except that borrowers are charged an annual commitment fee on unused amounts, which drives up the overall cost of borrowing (the facility fee). In the U.S., many revolvers to speculative-grade issuers are asset-based and thus tied to [[borrowing base|borrowing-base]] lending formulas that limit borrowers to a certain percentage of collateral, most often receivables and inventory. In Europe, revolvers are primarily designated to fund working capital or capital expenditures (capex).

A term loan is simply an installment loan, such as a loan one would use to buy a car. The borrower may draw on the loan during a short commitment period and repay it based on either a scheduled series of repayments or a one-time lump-sum payment at maturity (bullet payment). There are two principal types of term loans: an amortizing term loan and an institutional term loan.

An amortizing term loan (A-term loan or TLA) is a term loan with a progressive repayment schedule that typically runs six years or less. These loans are normally syndicated to banks along with revolving credits as part of a larger syndication. In the U.S., A-term loans have become increasingly rare over the years as issuers bypassed the bank market and tapped institutional investors for all or most of their funded loans.

An institutional term loan (B-term, C-term or D-term loan) is a term-loan facility with a portion carved out for nonbank, institutional investors. These loans became more common as the institutional loan investor base grew in the U.S. and Europe. These loans are priced higher than amortizing term loans because they have longer maturities and bullet repayment schedules. This institutional category also includes [[second lien loan|second-lien]] loans and [[cov-lite|covenant-lite]] loans.

==Regulatory compliance==
{{further|Shared National Credit Program}}
The [[Shared National Credit Program]] was established in 1977 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to provide an efficient and consistent review and classification of any large syndicated loan. As of January 1, 2018, the program covers any loan or loan complaint of at least $100 million that is shared by three or more supervised institutions. The agencies' review is conducted annually, reporting after third quarter examinations and reflecting data as of June 30.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20171221c.htm Agencies announce Shared National Credit definition change]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tullio Liblik made his first step into the business world in 1993 when he founded AS Ösel Foods in cooperation with Toivo Alt and Carl-Erik Sunblad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ap3.ee/?PublicationId=31503ED6-39D4-4163-9D98-74AA1E3959CE&amp;code=37504 "Saarlased teevad ilma mandril"] Äripäev, 10. veebruar 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; AS Ösel Foods specialized on the manufacturing of soft drinks.  For raw material supply they also founded AS Marjakasvatus which specialized in the growing of strawberries.  In 1997 Ösel Foods grew its business to Russia. In a factory owned by Ösel Food in Moscow, they started to produce ketchup. In 1999 they bought Paljassaare Fish Industry, from the Norwegians, which produced fish sticks. Tullio Liblik exited the food industry in 2001 when he sold his stocks of AS Ösel Foods to Carl-Erik Sunblad.

In the same year Tullio Liblik founded the company Saarte Investeering, that specializes in real estate development and business consultations. The biggest real estate developments of Saarte Investeering are Merikotka housing estate in Kuressaare,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saartehaal.ee/2006/12/12/kuressaares-jatkub-aktiivne-elamuehitus "Kuressaares jätkub aktiivne elamuehitus"] Saarte Hääl, 12.detsember 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hirvepargi housing estate in Sauga, Pärnu county&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwx.parnupostimees.ee/120607/parnuparnumaa/10075470.php "Saugas avati pidulikult Hirvepargi elamurajoon"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130620130521/http://wwx.parnupostimees.ee/120607/parnuparnumaa/10075470.php |date=2013-06-20 }} Pärnu Postimees, 12. juuni 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and four multistorey buildings in the city centre of  [[Tallinn]].
Saarte Investeering has led real estate developments in Saaremaa, Kuressaare,&lt;ref&gt;[http://majandus.delfi.ee/news/uudised/tullio-liblik-rajab-kuressaarde-villad.d?id=18756147 "Tullio Liblik rajab Kuressaarde villad] Delfi Majandus, 25.

Many other enterprises founded by Tullio Liblik, such as Saaremaa’s office of the real estate bureau OÜ A&amp;A Kinnisvara and OÜ Energiamaja Konsultatsioonid, are also operating in real estate developing.  In 2013 OÜ Energiamaja, that specializes in the construction of low-energy houses, started the housing development of 407 terraced houses in [[Peetri, Harju County|Peetri]] village in Rae parish, Harju county.

In 2001 Tullio Liblik founded OÜ Roheline Ring and participated in the founding of Estonia’s first [[wind farm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtsu.ee/artiklid/2002_10_11a.html "Virtsus alustab tööd Eesti esimene tuulepark"] www.virtsu.ee; [[Eesti Energia]] pressiteade, 11. oktoober 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a wind farm, consisting of three wind turbines, started to operate in [[Virtsu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtsu.ee/artiklid/2002_10_12b.html "Virtsu tuulikud annavad poole taastuvenergiast"] www.virtsu.ee; Postimees, 12. oktoober 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; with a total capacity of 1,8 MW of power. Two wind turbines out of three were owned by Roheline Ring and one by [[Eesti Energia]]. In 2005 Roheline Ring installed a wind farm of four wind turbines with a total capacity of 8 MW in [[Lääne County]], Rõuste.  Via the investment company Saarte Investeering, Tullio Liblik was also a stakeholder of [[Paldiski]] wind farm. Altogether, he has participated in the construction of five wind farms&lt;ref&gt;[http://uudised.err.ee/index.php?0572843 "Tullio Liblik rajab koos Mõisa ja Tamjärvega kolm tuuleparki"] ERR, 30. märts 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  that operate up to the present time.  In 2007 Tullio Liblik sold his shares of the wind farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saartehaal.ee/2008/03/26/tullio-liblik-ja-ants-ink-muusid-maha-virtsu-ja-rouste-tuulepargi/ "Tullio Liblik ja Ants Ink müüsid maha Virtsu ja Rõuste tuulepargi"] Saarte Hääl, 26. märts 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the investment company Saarte Investeering, owned by Tullio Liblik, acquired the lion’s share in E-Profiil, a company manufacturing large steel structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epl.ee/news/majandus/tullio-liblik-toodab-nafta-tootmise-seadmeid.d?id=51060662 "Tullio Liblik toodab nafta tootmise seadmeid"] Eesti Päevaleht, 18. oktoober 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Liblik sold his shares of the company E-Profiil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majandus.delfi.ee/news/uudised/tullio-liblik-muus-metallifirma-aripartnerile.d?id=59142866 "Tullio Liblik müüs metallifirma äripartnerile"] Delfi Majandus, 5. oktoober 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002 Tullio Liblik has been the member of the council of Kuressaare Regional Training Centre, and has also been voted for the chairman of the council. In 2007 Tullio Liblik became the member of the Estonian Association for Advancement of Vocational Education and has been active in informing the vocational education leaders about the expectations of entrepreneurs. As the chairman of the council of Kuressaare Regional Training Centre he has initiated various educational projects and has been developing the Training Centre’s international cooperation.

==Land Swap Case==
In 2005, motivated by an article that was published in Eesti Ekspress, an investigation of the entitlement and possible corruption factors concerning the swap of rural land properties under nature conservation protection was started. In 2009 the Office of the Prosecutor General brought charges to the partakers of the Land Swap Case. Tullio Liblik was accused of bribing. Besides Liblik two members of [[Riigikogu]], Villu Reiljan and Ester Tuiksoo, businessmen Toomas Annus, Einar Vettus and Tarmo Pedjasaar, also Kalev Kangur, the former Director General of Estonian Land Board, and corporate bodies AS Järvevana and AS E.L.L. Kinnisvara were accused.

In 2012, Harju County Court acquitted all the defendants of the Land Swap Case of&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.err.ee/Politics/0413fd4f-5a06-440a-9392-28e7fd56306a "All Defendants in Land Swap Case Acquitted "] ERR, June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered the state to pay court costs of the defendats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/110_112/riik-peab-lisaks-13-miljonile-huvitama-ka-tuhandete-eurode-eest-maadevahetuses-suudistatute-vabadusekaotuse.d?id=64564310 "Riik peab lisaks 1,3 miljonile hüvitama ka tuhandete eurode eest maadevahetuses süüdistatute vabadusekaotuse"] Delfi, 19. juuni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Argument with Sukles==
Saarte Investeering and MaxKinnisvara started their cooperation in 2004 in order to construct the Hirvepargi housing development in Sauga parish, Pärnu County. By the year 2007 twelve houses had been erected when the project needed additional financing to proceed with the construction. The owners of MaxKinnisvara didn’t want to add any more money to the initial investment of 20,000 euros and, as a consequence, disagreements arose between the partners.

Ongoing disagreements resulted in ordering a hit in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/eestiuudised/kahtlustus-palgamorvar-pidi-tapma-tullio-libliku.d?id=32804277 "Kahtlustus: palgamõrvar pidi tapma Tullio Libliku"] Eesti Ekspress, 27. august 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police managed to prevent the hit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/110_112/tullio-libliku-advokaat-politsei-hoidis-tapmise-ara.d?id=65498340 "Tullio Libliku advokaat: politsei hoidis tapmise ära"] Delfi, 7. jaanuar 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/palgamorvast-paasenud-liblik-meil-oli-raha-liiga-vahe.d?id=32901359 "Palgamõrvast pääsenud Liblik: meil oli raha liiga vähe!"] Delfi, 2. september 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrus Sukles was arrested.

Harju County Court found that Sukles wished to kill his former business partner and also made preparations to achieve that. However, Sukles was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.err.ee/cfbd3658-e036-44ea-8106-5c563e8114af " Businessman Had Intent to Kill, but Cleared of Attempting to Order Hit"] ERR, January 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls,''''' 413 [[Federal Supplement|F. Supp.]] 1281 (D. Wisc. 1976), is a 1976 [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin]] decision regarding a requested order from the [[United States government]] to seize and destroy a shipment of approximately 50,000 [[Clackers|clacker balls]] under the [[Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970|Federal Hazardous Substances Act]] because children could hit themselves with the balls.&lt;ref name= case&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls |vol=413 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1281 |pinpoint= |court=D. Wisc. |date=1976 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/413/1281/1660578/ |accessdate=2017-11-13 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clack /&gt;

The form of the styling of this case — the [[defendant]] being an object, rather than a [[legal person]] — is because this is a [[jurisdiction in rem|jurisdiction ''in rem'']] (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar ''[[in personam]]'' (over persons) case.

== Background ==
In 1974 in [[Mequon, Wisconsin]], the [[United States Marshals Service]] seized a shipment of [[clackers|clacker balls]]—toys comprising two hard acrylic balls connected by a piece of string—from a dock and published a public notice of the seizure in a local newspaper. Ace Novelty Company in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], declared an interest in the shipment and filed a complaint against forfeiture. The complaint was that the shipment was not a banned hazard as defined by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA).&lt;ref name=case /&gt;

== Litigation ==
[[File:Kliklak 01.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Clacker balls (not necessarily of the style of those in this case)]]
The claimant initially stated that the case was titled incorrectly as the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] had not been named on the caption. The court dismissed this as without merit, pointing out that Section 9 of the FHSA stated that all proceedings regarding enforcement would be done in the name of the United States.&lt;ref name=case /&gt;

The claimant then stated that the law had been applied unconstitutionally by breaching the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and the right of "due powers {{sic}}".&lt;ref name=case /&gt; The judge stated that he was unsure of the intent of this defense as it was not initially filed in the [[summary judgement]] and thus the court was unable to make a ruling on it.&lt;ref name=case /&gt;

The United States' counsel stated that clacker balls were hazardous under section 2 of FHSA, as clarified by regulations of the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 16 C.F.R. § 1500.18(a). The claimant argued that they were not hazardous under FHSA and that there was an exemption made for clacker balls under 16 C.F.R. § 1500.86(a)(5). The court then made the judgment that the United States had the right to seize the shipment under section 15 of FHSA as mechanical hazards and might cause a risk of injury if used by children, that 16 C.F.R. § 1500.86(a)(5) merely provided the opportunity to the claimant to prove that the toy was not hazardous (which was not done), and therefore the exemption from FHSA did not exist. The court then ruled that there was no legal issue and granted the United States the seizure and destruction order for the shipment.&lt;ref name=case /&gt;
