[[Image:Abckiria.jpg|right|thumb|The first page of ''Abckiria'']]
'''''Abckiria''''' (also sometimes spelled '''ABC-kiria''', and spelled "ABC-kirja" in modern Finnish), in English "The ABC book", is the first book that was published in the [[Finnish language]]. It was written by [[Mikael Agricola]], a bishop and [[Protestant Reformation|Lutheran Reformer]], and was first published in 1543. Agricola wrote the book while working on the first Finnish translation of the [[New Testament]] (which was eventually finished in 1548 as ''[[Se Wsi Testamenti]]'').

''Abckiria'' was a [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] meant to teach the basics of reading and writing. It contains the [[alphabet]], some spelling exercises, and [[catechism]]. The first edition had 16 pages. The second edition, which was written in 1551, had 24 pages. No complete copies of either are known to exist, but general contents of the book have been discerned from the existing material.

In 1966 further missing parts were discovered by a librarian and included a new (likely third) publishing date of 1559.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penttilä|first1=presented by Aarni|title=Näköispainos Mikael Agricolan ABCkirian eri painosten sälyneistä katkelmista|date=1998|publisher=Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura|location=[Helsinki]|isbn=951-717-303-2|pages=32|edition=reproduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The catechism includes the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Lord's Prayer]], the first part of the [[Hail Mary]], New Testament citations for sacraments of [[baptism]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]], and the [[Eucharist|Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ]]. It also includes [[Grace (prayer)|grace]] and the morning and evening prayers based on [[Luther's Small Catechism]] and three prayers during the ringing of the [[church bell]], apparently as a substitute to the [[Angelus]].

In modern days, the most famous part of the book is the opening poem:

&lt;poem&gt;
Oppe nyt wanha / ia noori /
joilla ombi Sydhen toori.
Jumalan keskyt / ia mielen /
iotca taidhat Somen kielen.
Laki / se Sielun hirmutta / 
mutt Cristus sen tas lodhutta. 
Lue sijs hyue Lapsi teste / 
Alcu oppi ilman este. 
Nijte muista Elemes aina / 
nin Jesus sinun Armons laina.
&lt;/poem&gt;

("Learn now, old and young, who have a fresh heart, God's commandments and the mind, so that you shall know the Finnish language. Law, it makes the soul fearful, but Christ soothes it again. So read from here good child, the beginning of learning without obstacles. Remember them all your life, so Jesus lends you his mercy.")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9541">The '''American Negro Theater''' (ANT) was formed in [[Harlem]] on June 5, 1940, by writer [[Abram Hill]] and actor [[Frederick O'Neal]]. The group was founded by the influence of the purposes of the Negro Unit of the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in Harlem. It produced 19 plays before closing in 1949. Designed as a community theater group, performances were held in Harlem's [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]].  In 1942, ANT began its Studio Theatre training program for beginning actors.  Graduates include [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Harry Belafonte]].

== History ==
Hill and O'Neal started the ANT by assembling several of their own theatre friends: [[Howard Augusta]], James Jackson, [[Virgil Richardson]], [[Claire Leyba]], [[Jefferson D. Davis]], [[Vivian Hall]], [[Austin Briggs-Hall]], [[Stanley Green]], [[Fanny McConnell]], and [[Kenneth Manigault]]. Collectively, they started the group with just 11 cents. In the beginning, Hill spent his time mailing out postcards to invite as many people as he could to meetings and within just a few weeks, the group grew to thirty people.

Hill approached librarians at the public library on 135th Street in Harlem, the Harlem Branch of the [[New York Public Library]], to start producing his plays. The librarians granted Hill and the ANT permission to use their basement stage. The basement theatre held 150 seats and Hill charged 49 cents a seat. The first show they produced, "Hits, Bits, and Skits," opened on July 17, 1940. The first major play that the ANT put into rehearsal was "On Strivers' Row" which Hill put into rehearsal after it had done so well with the [[Rose McClendon Players]] who also held performances in Harlem. "On Strivers' Row" ran for five months and in March 1941, Hill moved it to the [[Apollo Theatre]] as a musical with the lyrics of [[Don Burley]], the music of [[J.P. Johnson]], and the choreography of [[Leonard Harper]]. It ran at the [[Apollo Theatre]] for one week.

In 1944, the ANT applied to the General Education Board of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for a financial grant. The proposal they submitted asked for salaries to be paid to the company's officers. It also informed the Board on the following objectives of the ANT:

* 1) To Develop an Art
* 2) To Develop a Vital Theatre
* 3) To Develop Pride and Honor

The proposal resulted in a $22,000 grant-in-aid for the ANT. These objectives were also printed on programs for ANT productions.

Its most successful production, ''[[Anna Lucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]'', fundamentally transformed the ANT.  A white author, [[Phillip Yordan]], wrote the play about a Polish family in Pennsylvania whose daughter is a waterfront prostitute, but could not find a company to perform it. So he rewrote it to feature a black family.  It was performed by the ANT in 1944.  According to a notice in The Brooklyn Eagle on March 30, 1944, the sets for that initial production were designed by the American realist painter [[Michael Lenson]], but that has not been verified. Five weeks later the play opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Nine New York newspaper dailies reviewed the show. They all raved and producers instantly starting fighting over who would get the rights to the play.  Yordan agreed to sign a Dramatists Guild contract that would make Hill the coauthor of ''[[AnnaLucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]''. This gave Hill a five percent author's royalty.

The ANT itself received few royalties for ''[[Anna Lucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]'' and the next three ANT plays to appear on Broadway were not successful.  Despite this, following the success of ''[[Anna Lucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]'' the ANT became less community-centered.  From then on, the ANT only featured plays from established white playwrights, and young actors viewed the ANT as a means to break into Broadway productions.

== Goals ==
The ANT had four goals that they were governed by:
*1) To develop a permanent acting company trained in the arts and crafts of the theatre that also reflected the special gifts, talents, and attributes of African Americans.
*2) To produce plays that honestly and with integrity interpreted, illuminated, and criticized contemporary black life and the concerns of the black people.
*3) To maintain an affiliation with, and provide leadership for, other black theatre groups throughout the nation.
*4) To utilize its resources to develop racial pride in the theatre, rather than racial apathy.

== Constitution ==
When the ANT was first founded in 1940, the group created a 30-page constitution for themselves that reflected the ideals of the Federal Theater Project. The constitution also drew upon [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]'s belief that African-American theatre should be by, about, for, and near African-Americans.

The following is an excerpt from the constitution:

"A People's theatre is a very valuable institution. it provides the finest outlet for class emotions that can be organized. It serves as a spur to citizen ambition provides a partly self-supporting source of work and income, and a healthy kind of occupational therapy on a national scale for thousands.

Unhappily, we have been trained to think of the theatre mostly in terms of commercial enterprise that is too expensive when it is worthy, and too cheap and boring when it is not. We know it too frequently as an investment for gambling show men, or as a playground for dilettantes and escapists who are unable to withstand the hard realities of life.
We need a people's theatre which shall in effect be a national theatre. The people who want a theatre will have to organize it and pay a part of the expense for both its creation and support. Realizing the reluctance of the people to assume this responsibility, the essential burden of stimulating the development of such a project rests upon the shoulders of those individuals who are willing to assume this obligation, those who feel sincerely the call in a genuine quest for the content of theatre art, and by their talent, industry, and profound respect for a theatre they shall create."

(American Negro Theater Constitution, 1940)

== Notes ==
* The acronym ANT was popular as it was viewed as a metaphor for how hardworking and community-driven the group was.
*In a 1996 interview with [[Cornel West]], [[Harry Belafonte]] described how the American Negro Theater really opened his eyes to how "magical" theatre was. Belafonte said that he saw his first show in the ANT when he was given two tickets as a gratuity when he was working as a janitor's assistant for [[Clarice Taylor]], who was in the play that night.

'''''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary''''' is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English language. Translated by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by Tolkien's son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] and published posthumously in May 2014 by [[HarperCollins]].

In the poem, [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geats]] in Scandinavia, comes to the aid of [[Hroðgar]], the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose [[mead hall]] [[Heorot]] has been under attack by a monster known as [[Grendel]].  After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to [[Geatland]] in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats. After fifty years have passed, Beowulf defeats a [[dragon]], but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a [[tumulus]], a burial mound, in Geatland.

The translation is followed by a commentary on the poem that became the base for Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics]]".&lt;ref name="BBC 2014-03-20"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf translation to be published |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the book includes the previously unpublished "[[Sellic Spell]]" and two versions of "The Lay of ''Beowulf''". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf's biographical background while the latter is a poem on the ''Beowulf'' theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-544-44278-8 |title=Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary  |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{main article|Beowulf}}

Beowulf, a prince of the Geats, and his followers set out to help king Hroðgar of the Danes in his fight against the monster Grendel. Because Grendel hates music and noise he frequently attacks Hroðgar's mead hall [[Heorot]] killing the king's men in their sleep. While Beowulf cannot kill Grendel directly in their first encounter, he still wounds him fatally. Afterwards he has to face Grendel's mother who has come to avenge her son. Beowulf follows her to a cavern beneath a lake where he slays her with a magical sword. There he also finds the dying Grendel and decapitates him.

Beowulf returns home to become king of the Geats. After some 50 years, a dragon whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound begins to terrorize Geatland. Beowulf, now in his eighties, tries to fight the dragon but cannot succeed. He follows the dragon to his lair where Beowulf's young relative [[Wiglaf]] joins him in the fight. Eventually, Beowulf slays the dragon but is mortally wounded. In the end, his followers bury their king in a mound by the sea.

==Reception==
Tolkien's translation of ''Beowulf'' has been compared to [[Seamus Heaney]]'s translation from 2000. [[Joan Acocella]] writes that since Tolkien was not a professional poet like Heaney, he had to make compromises in translating the original Old English epic. According to Acocella, Heaney's focus on rhyme and [[alliteration]] makes him occasionally lose details from the original that remain in Tolkien's prose version.&lt;ref name=Acocella&gt;{{cite journal|title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's 'Beowulf' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all|first=Joan |last=Acocella |authorlink=Joan Acocella |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien's version stays closer to the details and rhythm of the original and also very close to the original sense of the poem, which has been attributed to Tolkien's scholarly knowledge of Old English, whereas Heaney, on the other hand, succeeded in producing a translation suited for the modern reader, more so than Tolkien's.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worall&gt;{{cite news|title=Tolkien's Beowulf: a 'great gift' |first=Patrick |last=Worrall |work=[[Channel 4]] |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/tolkiens-beowulf-a-great-gift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication also caused some controversy among scholars. ''Beowulf'' expert and University of Kentucky professor [[Kevin Kiernan]], called it a "travesty", and criticism was also offered by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor Daniel Donoghue.&lt;ref name="hwaet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/hwt-a-new-academic-spat-over-tolkien-9409559.html|title=Hwæt? a new academic spat over Tolkien|date=21 May 2014|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Business Insider]]'', Kiernan cites J. R. R. Tolkien himself who disliked his own translation. According to Kiernan, any prose translation of Beowulf will neglect the "poetic majesty" of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Tolkien Hated His Translation Of Beowulf |first=Kevin |last=Kiernan |authorlink=Kevin Kiernan |work=[[Business Insider]] |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/beowulf-is-so-hard-to-translate-even-jrr-tolkien-hated-his-version-2014-6 |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Birmingham]] lecturer Philippa Semper instead called the translation "captivating" and "a great gift to anyone interested in Beowulf or Tolkien."&lt;ref name=Worall/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Ethan Gilsdorf]] comments that Tolkien had been skeptical about putting ''Beowulf'' into modern English, and had written in his 1940 essay ''[[On Translating Beowulf]]'' that turning the poem "into 'plain prose' could be an 'abuse'."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilsdorf|first1=Ethan|authorlink=Ethan Gilsdorf|title=Waving His Wand at ‘Beowulf’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/books/jrr-tolkiens-translation-of-beowulf-is-published.html?_r=1|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2 December 2014|date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilsdorf continues, "But he did it anyway"; Tolkien remarking that the result "was 'hardly to my liking'."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Background and legacy==
J. R. R. Tolkien specialized in English [[philology]] at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as special subject. In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having read ''Beowulf'' earlier, he began a translation of the poem which he finished in 1926 but never published. Acocella writes that Tolkien may not have had the time to pursue a publication when he moved to [[Oxford]] and began to write his novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Tolkien's biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]] argues also that Tolkien was too much of a perfectionist to publish his translation.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

Ten years later, however, Tolkien drew upon this work when he gave a lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monster and the Critics]]". According to this lecture, the true theme of ''Beowulf'', namely death and defeat, was being neglected in favour of archaeological and philological disputes on how much of the poem was fictive or true.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

===Influences on ''The Hobbit''===
Tolkien described ''Beowulf'' as one of the "most valued sources" for ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref name=Letter25&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain descriptions in ''The Hobbit'' seem to have been lifted straight out of ''Beowulf'' with some minor rewording, such as when each dragon stretches out its neck to sniff for intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Faraci | first=Mary | editor-first=Jane | editor-last=Chance | title=Tolkien the Medievalist | publisher=Routledge |year=2002 | pages=58–59 | chapter='I wish to speak' (Tolkien's voice in his Beowulf essay) | isbn=0-415-28944-0 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNTI0WTNmw4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in ''Beowulf''. Other specific plot elements and features in ''The Hobbit'' that show similarities to ''Beowulf'' include the title ''thief'' as [[Bilbo Baggins]] is called by [[Gollum]] and later also by Smaug, and Smaug's personality which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien refines parts of ''Beowulf''{{'s}} plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purtill | first=Richard L. |authorlink=Richard Purtill | title=Lord of the Elves and Eldils | publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2006 |pages=53–55 | isbn=1-58617-084-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cbcuwO3bwfgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his naming his sword "[[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]]" one can see Bilbo's acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in ''Beowulf'', signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = R. Andrew | first2 = K. S. | last2 = Whetter | year = 2006 | title = 'In the hilt is fame': resonances of medieval swords and sword-lore in J. R. R.

As Tolkien wrote, "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of ''Beowulf'' would say much the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Big Chicken''' is a [[KFC]] restaurant in [[Marietta, Georgia]], which features a {{convert|56|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} steel-sided structure designed in the appearance of a [[chicken]] rising up from the top of the building. It is located at the city's biggest intersection of [[Cobb&amp;nbsp;Parkway]] ([[U.S. Route 41 in Georgia|U.S.&amp;nbsp;41]]/[[Georgia State Route 3|Georgia&amp;nbsp;3]]) and Roswell&amp;nbsp;Road ([[Georgia State Route 120|Georgia&amp;nbsp;120]]) and is a well-known [[landmark]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/leo-frank-jewish-man-lynching-marietta-georgia-unsettled-100-years/|title=A century after Jewish man's lynching, Georgia town unsettled|date=August 16, 2015|work=CBS News|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Constructed in 1956, it was rebuilt following storm damage in 1993 and underwent a $2 million renovation project in 2017.

==History==
[[File:The Big Chicken, Marietta, GA, US.jpg|thumb|right|"The Big Chicken" in 2016]]
[[File:The Big Chicken, Marietta, GA, US.ogv|thumb|The Big Chicken in action.]]
The restaurant was built in 1956 at 12 Cobb Parkway, on the newly constructed stretch of Highway 41, the first [[divided highway]] in Cobb County.  Taking advantage of the prime location on the new and quicker route for travelers on U.S. 41, Johnny Reb's Chick, Chuck and Shake owner S. R. "Tubby" Davis erected the 56-foot (17-meter) tall structure over his restaurant in 1963 as a method of [[advertising]].&lt;ref name = "marietta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marietta.com/attractions/the-big-chicken|title=The Big Chicken|work=marietta.com|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[novelty architecture]] was designed by Hubert Puckett, a [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] student of [[architecture]], and fabricated by [[Atlantic Steel]] in nearby [[Atlanta]] (of which Marietta is a [[suburb]]). Davis later sold it to his brother, and it became a [[franchising|franchise]] of [[KFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Jane|title=Cobb County At the Heart of Change|date=1991|publisher=Longstreet Press|location=Atlanta, Georgia|isbn=1-56352-000-1|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993, storm winds damaged the structure, and rather than tear it down KFC was forced by public outcry to re-erect the building.&lt;ref name = "marietta" /&gt; Among those who complained about the Big Chicken being torn down were pilots, who used the building as a reference point when approaching Atlanta and [[Dobbins Air Reserve Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbcountyga.gov/history/index.htm |title=Cobb County Government |publisher=Cobbcountyga.gov |date=1948-03-11 |accessdate=2009-12-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100120144658/http://www.cobbcountyga.gov/history/index.htm| archivedate= 20 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Big Chicken includes the original design of beak and eyes which move, although this time the vibrations which plagued the first structure (even to the point of breaking [[window]]s) have been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/7021|title=The Big Chicken, Marietta, Georgia|work=Roadside America|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pieces of the original structure were sold to collectors as [[souvenir]]s.  In early April 2006, the structure narrowly escaped a small eastward-moving nighttime [[tornado]], which overturned a [[tractor-trailer]] at a [[Kmart]] across the street, and damaged another building nearby.

The Big Chicken is commonly used as a landmark for driving directions.  Locals will often include "make a [turn] at the Big Chicken", or "it's about ''x'' miles past the Big Chicken".  This is referenced in [[music video game]] ''[[Rock Band 3]]'''s "Road Challenge Mode", when the player is told "Don't be alarmed if you're asking for directions in the bus and the locals tell you to 'turn left at the Big Chicken'".

It has also led to a small [[cottage industry]] of sorts, selling souvenirs emblazoned with the monument, including one sweatshirt showing [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] in [[London]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]], the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], and of course, the Big Chicken in Marietta.  A [[board game]] featuring the Big Chicken and other local landmarks was also produced.  There is a [[Barbershop music|barbershop-style]] singing group called the Big Chicken Chorus, formed in 1986, which gives concerts throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/news/events/other/things-do-cobb-december/npWM6/|title=Things to do in Cobb County|work=Access Atlanta|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigchickenchorus.org/home.html|title=About us|work=Big Chicken Chorus|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Chicken was also featured on a promotional card in ''[[Sim City: The Card Game]]''. The Big Chicken has also appeared in the comic strip ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'' as a part of artist Bill Griffith's fascination with roadside icons.

In early 2017 it was announced that The Big Chicken would undergo a twelve-week, $2 million renovation, incorporating the chain's newest design and a gift shop. The renovations began January 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/01/20/mariettas-big-chicken-restaurant-getting-2-million.html|title=Marietta's 'Big Chicken' restaurant getting $2 million renovation |website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant reopened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavitt|first1=Ross|title=Cobb County's 'Big Chicken' reopens after renovations|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-countys-big-chicken-reopens-after-renovations/521620366|website=wsbtv.com|accessdate=27 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127190359/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-countys-big-chicken-reopens-after-renovations/521620366|archivedate=27 January 2018|date=11 May 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guercino Return of the prodigal son.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Prodigal Son]]]]

The doctrine of [[sin]] is central to Christianity, since its [[The gospel|basic message]] is about [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] in [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Rahner, p. 1588&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]] [[hamartiology]] describes sin as an act of offence against [[God in Christianity|God]] by despising his [[Trinity|persons]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity|Christian biblical law]], and by injuring others.&lt;ref&gt;Sabourin, p. 696&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian views it is an [[evil]] human act, which violates the rational nature of man as well as [[Trinity|God's nature]] and his [[eternal law]]. According to the classical definition of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] sin is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Faustum Manichaeum'', 22,27; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 42,418; cf. [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Summa Theologica|STh]] I–II q71 a6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mc Guinness, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some scholars, sin is understood mostly as legal infraction or contract violation of non-binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of [[Christian ethics]], and so [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] tends to be viewed in legal terms.

Other Christian scholars understand sin to be fundamentally relational—a loss of love for the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and an elevation of [[self-love]] ("concupiscence", in this sense), as was later propounded by Augustine in his debate with the [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Grace and Free Will'' (see ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P.Holmes, vol. 5; 30–31 [14–15]).&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the legal definition of sin, this definition also affects the understanding of [[Grace in Christianity|Christian grace]] and salvation, which are thus viewed in relational terms.&lt;ref&gt;Christian grace is understood as God's love brought to the human soul by the [[God the Holy Spirit]] (Romans 5:5), and salvation is the establishment of that love relationship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical review of this understanding, see R.N.Frost, "Sin and Grace", in Paul L. Metzger, ''Trinitarian Soundings'', T&amp;T Clark, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sin in the Bible==

===Old Testament===
The first reference to "sin" as a noun is of "''sin'' is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it”&lt;ref name="JSB-17"&gt;c.f. "(..) Sin couches at the door; Its urge is toward you, Yet you can be its master." {{cite book|last1=Berlin|first1=Adele|last2=Brettler|first2=Marc Zvi|title=Jewish study bible|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0199978465|pages=17|edition=2 Rev ed.

Călinescu." – 2002 "Sin is personified as (an animal?) which "crouches" at the door of Cain (Gen 4:7). As [[Gerhard von Rad]] (Genesis, 105) remarks, 'The comparison of sin with a beast of prey lying before the door is strange, as is the purely decorative use"&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first use of the verb is God appears to [[Abimelech]] "in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from ''sinning'' against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”" in Genesis 20:3. Isaiah announced the consequences: "But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things" — a separation between God and man, and unrequited worshipping.{{Bibleref2c|Isaiah|59:2–3|NIV|Isaiah 59:2–3}}

&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine of humanity's state of [[sin]] resulting from the [[fall of man]], stemming from Adam's rebellion in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], namely the [[Forbidden fruit|sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil]].{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as [[total depravity]] or automatic guilt of all humans through [[Guilt (emotion)#Collective guilt|collective guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodd|first=Jefferey|title=World Religions|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|year=2003|location=Winona, MN|isbn=978-0-88489-725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by [[Irenaeus]], [[Bishop of Lyon]] in his controversy with certain [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. Other church fathers such as [[Augustine]] also developed the doctrine,{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} seeing it as based on the [[New Testament]] teaching of [[Paul the Apostle]] ({{bibleref2|Romans|5:12–21}} and {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:22}}) and the Old Testament verse of {{bibleref2|Psalm|51:5}}.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nathan – [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=227 The Original View of Original Sin] – Retrieved 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Porvaznik – [http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/num54.htm Original Sin Explained and Defended] Evangelical Catholic Apologetics – Retrieved 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nazarene.org/ministries/administration/visitorcenter/articles/ Preamble and Articles of Faith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020030856/http://nazarene.org/ministries/administration/visitorcenter/articles/ |date=2013-10-20 }} – V.

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[File:Thomas Aquinas in Stained Glass crop.jpg|thumb|right|Aquinas distinguished between [[Sin of omission|sins of omission]], and sins of commission&lt;ref name =Aquinas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Catholic Encyclopedia: Omission | url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11251b.htm | publisher= New Advent | accessdate = 28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Aquinas: Aquinas's Thoughts On Morality | url= http://library.thinkquest.org/18775/aquinas/moraq.htm | publisher=The Philosopher's Lighthouse | accessdate = 28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The way [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed sin and vices was radically different from later approaches, especially that of 17th-century [[moral theology]]. He presented sin and vices as contraries of [[virtue]]s. He discusses the subject in his [[Summa Theologica]] part Ia–IIae (''Prima secundae'') qq. 71–89.&lt;ref&gt;Pinckaers, pp. 220 and 225–6&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his definitions of sin Thomas quotes [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s description of sin as "a thought, words and deed against the Eternal Law."'&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Faustum'', 22, 27, [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 44,418:&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|
Now there are two rules of the human will: one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the human reason; the other is the first rule, viz. the eternal law, which is God's reason, so to speak  (quasi ratio Dei). Accordingly Augustine includes two things in the definition of sin; one, pertaining to the substance of a human act, and which is the matter, so to speak, of sin, when he says, word, deed, or desire; the other, pertaining to the nature of evil, and which is the form, as it were, of sin, when he says, contrary to the eternal law. (STh I–II q.71 a.6)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Aquinas [[Summa Theologica]] I–II q. 71 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0023/__P6F.HTM Of Vice and Sin Considered in Themselves]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To recognise the possibilities of sin in man is equal to acknowledge his human nature, his control and mastery of his own actions. Sin is a motion to the goal, it is judged by the object to which it is directed. The field of sin is the same as the field of virtue. There are three major fields: relationship with God, with oneself and with the neighbour. Thomas distinguished between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]]s. Mortal sin is when a person has irreparably destroyed the very principle of his/her order to the goal of life. Venial sin is when he/she has acted in a certain disordered way without destructing that principle:
{{quote|
Consequently it is a mortal sin generically, whether it be contrary to the love of God, e.g. blasphemy, perjury, and the like, or against the love of one's neighbour, e.g. murder, adultery, and such like: wherefore such sins are mortal by reason of their genus. Sometimes, however, the sinner's will is directed to a thing containing a certain inordinateness, but which is not contrary to the love of God and one's neighbour, e.g. an idle word, excessive laughter, and so forth: and such sins are venial by reason of their genus. (STh I–II q.72 a.5)}}

According to Aquinas the gravity of sin depends also on ''some disposition of the agent'' (cf. STh I–II q. 18, aa. 4, 6). Sin, venial by reason of its object, may become mortal. It happens when person fixes his/her ultimate happiness, the last end of his/her life (Lat. ''finis ultimus'') in the object of that venial sin. When venial sin is used as a way to provoke mortal sin it becomes mortal as well, e.g. when someone uses empty conversation or a chat to seduce someone to commit adultery. Also sin, mortal by reason of its object, may become venial because of the agent's disposition when his/her evil act does not have full moral capacity, i.e. is not deliberated by reason. That may happen for instance when sudden movements of unbelief arise in the mind. (Cf. STh I–II q.72 a.5).

The difference and gravity of sins may be discerned on the grounds of spirit and flesh, even mortal sins may differ in gravity. [[wikt:Carnal|Carnal]] sins like lust, adultery or fornication, gluttony and avarice, because the person who commits them is inordinately directed towards material goods that are a serious matter, are mortal sins. They may cause much shame and infamy. But spiritual sins like [[blasphemy|blaspheming]] of God or [[apostasy]] are, according to Thomas, still greater evil, as they have more of the aversion from God. They are directed against a greater object. The formal, essential element of sin is more at the centre in them. (cf. STh I–II q.72 a.2)&lt;ref name =Aquinas&gt;Cf. Thomas Aquinas [[Summa Theologica]] I–II q. 72 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0023/__P6G.HTM Of the Distinction of Sins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, pp. 255–272&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another formulation of the concept of sin in the ''Summa'', at the heart of sin is "the turning away from the immutable good", i.e. God, and "inordinate turning to mutable good", i.e. creatures. (STh I–IIae q.87 a.4) This cannot be understood as if in the concrete sinful deed the sinner commits two separate and independent acts. Both ''aversio'' and ''conversio'' constitute one single guilty action. At the root of the inordinate turning to the creatures is self-love which expresses itself in disordered desire (''cupiditas'') and rebellion towards God (''superbia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Josef Pieper | authorlink = Josef Pieper | title = The Concept of Sin | year = 2001 | pages = 60–63}}; cf. Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' II–IIae q34 a2; I q94 a1; II–IIae q162 a6; I–IIae q72 a2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking about [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] (Lat. ''acedia'') Thomas points out that every deed which "by its very nature is contrary to charity is a mortal sin". An effect of such deed is the destruction of "spiritual life which is the effect of charity, whereby God dwells in us." Sin of a mortal character is always committed with the consent of reason: "Because the consummation of sin is in the consent of reason"'. (cf. STh II–IIae q.35 a.3) Venial and mortal sins can be compared to sickness and death. While venial sin impairs full healthy activity of a person, mortal sin destroys the principle of spiritual life in him/her.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catechism ===
[[Roman Catholic]] doctrine distinguishes between personal sin (also sometimes called "actual sin") and [[original sin]]. Personal sins are either mortal or venial.

[[Mortal sin]]s are sins of grave (serious) matter, where the sinner performs the act with full knowledge and deliberate consent. (cf. [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC 1857]])

The act of committing a mortal sin destroys charity, i. e. the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] in the heart of a Christian; it is in itself a rejection of God (CCC1855). If left un-reconciled, mortal sins may lead to eternal separation from God, traditionally called [[damnation]].

[[Venial sin]]s are sins which do not meet the conditions for mortal sins. The act of committing a venial sin does not cut off the sinner from God's grace, as the sinner has not rejected God. However, venial sins do injure the relationship between the sinner and God, and as such, must be reconciled to God, either through the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Reconciliation]] or receiving the Eucharist (after proper contrition fulfilled).

Both mortal and venial sins have a dual nature of punishment. They incur both guilt for the sin, yielding eternal punishment, and temporal punishment for the sin. Reconciliation is an act of God's mercy, and addresses the guilt and eternal punishment for sin. Purgatory and indulgences address the temporal punishment for sin, and exercise of God's justice.

Roman Catholic doctrine also sees sin as being twofold: Sin is, at once, any evil or immoral ''action'' which infracts God's law and the inevitable consequences, the ''state of being'' that comes about by committing the sinful action. Sin can and does alienate a person both from God and the community. Hence, the Catholic Church's insistence on reconciliation with both God and the Church itself.

The [[Roman Catholic]] view of sin has recently expanded. [[Monsignor]] [[Gianfranco Girotti]], [[Regent]] of the Catholic  [[Apostolic Penitentiary]], has said that "known sins increasingly manifest themselves as behavior that damages society as a whole,"&lt;ref name="cnnvat"&gt;{{cite news |title= Vatican lists new sinful behaviors |agency = Associated Press |year = 2008 |url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/10/vatican.updates.sins.ap/index.html| accessdate = 2008-03-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142051/http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/10/vatican.updates.sins.ap/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, for example:
* "certain violations of the fundamental rights of human nature, through genetic manipulations [or experiments],"
* "drug [abuse], which weakens the mind and obscures intelligence,"
* "[[environmental pollution]],"
* "abortion and pedophilia," and
* the widening social and economic differences between the rich and the poor, which "''cause an unbearable social injustice''" (accumulating excessive wealth, inflicting poverty). The revision was aimed at encouraging confession or the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Penance]].

Mortal sins, which are any severe and intentional actions that directly disobey God, are often confused with the [[seven deadly sins]], which are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. They are not, however, the same. The seven deadly sins are called "deadly" because they might lead another to commit other sins. Some forms of the seven deadly sins (i.e. debilitating one's health because of their love of food) can constitute as grave matter, while others may just be venal (i.e. over-eating).

Another group of four or five sins distinguished by the Church are the [[sins that cry to heaven]]: murder, sodomy, (oppression of a people,) oppression of the weak and defrauding the laborer.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' 1997: "1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are "sins that cry to heaven": the blood of Abel, the sin of the Sodomites, the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, the cry of the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, injustice to the wage earner."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Seven deadly sins}}

== Protestant views ==
Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] orientation teach that, due to [[original sin]], humanity has lost any and all capacity to move towards reconciliation with God (Romans 3:23;6:23; Ephesians 2:1–3); in fact, this inborn sin turns humans away from God and towards themselves and their own desires (Isaiah 53:6a). Thus, humans may be brought back into a relationship with God only by way of God's rescuing the sinner from his/her hopeless condition (Galatians 5:17–21; Ephesians 2:4–10) through Jesus' [[substitutionary atonement]] (Romans 5:6–8; Colossians 2:13–15; 1 Timothy 2:5–6). According to traditional Reformed theology and classical [[Lutheranism]], Salvation is ''[[sola fide]]'' (by faith alone); ''[[sola gratia]]'' (by grace alone); and is begun and completed by God alone through [[Christ Jesus|Jesus]] (Ephesians 2:8,9). This understanding of original sin (Romans 5:12–19), is most closely associated with Calvinist doctrine (see [[total depravity]]) and Lutheranism. Calvinism allows for the relative or nominal "goodness" of humanity through God's [[common grace]] upon both those [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] to salvation and those predestined to damnation, upon the [[regeneration (theology)#Calvinism and Reformed theology|regenerate]] and the unregenerate. [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Arminianism|Arminian]] theology adapts the concept by stating that humans, entirely sinful and totally depraved, can only "do good" through God's ''[[prevenient grace]]''.

This is in contrast to the Roman Catholic teaching that while sin has tarnished the original goodness of humanity prior to the Fall, it has not entirely extinguished that goodness, or at least the ''potential'' for goodness, allowing humans to reach towards God to share in the [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]] which Jesus Christ won for them. Some Protestants and Orthodox Christians hold similar views.

There is dispute about where sin originated. Some who interpret the king of Tyre in Ezekiel 28 as a symbol for [[Satan]] believe sin originated when Satan coveted the position that rightfully belongs to God. The origin of individual sins is discussed in James 1:14–15 – "&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death." ([[NIV]])

=== Defined types of sin ===
Within some branches of Protestantism, there are several defined types of sin (as in Roman Catholicism):

*[[Original sin]]—Most denominations of Christianity interpret the [[Garden of Eden]] account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in terms of the [[fall of man]]. Adam and Eve's disobedience was the first sin man ever committed, and their ''original sin'' (or the effects of the sin) is passed on to their descendants (or has become a part of their environment). See also: [[total depravity]].
*[[Concupiscence]]
*[[Venial sin]]
*[[Greed]]
*[[Lust]]
*[[Pride]]
*[[Mortal sin]]
*[[Eternal sin]]—Commonly called the Unforgivable sin (mentioned in {{bibleref|Matthew|12:31}}), this is perhaps the most controversial sin, whereby someone has become an [[apostate]], forever denying themselves a life of faith and experience of [[salvation]]; the precise nature of this sin is often disputed.

== Eastern Christian views ==
The ([[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] as well as the ([[miaphysitism|non-Chalcedonian]]) [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] use "sin" both to refer to humanity's fallen condition and to refer to individual sinful acts. In many ways the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Christian]] view of sin is similar to the Jewish, although neither form of Orthodoxy makes formal distinctions among "grades" of sins.

The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which derive their theology and spirituality from same sources as the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox, tend not to adhere to the Roman Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] taught by the [[Latin Church]]. Like the Orthodox Churches, however, the Eastern Catholic Churches do make a distinction between sins that are serious enough to bar one from [[Holy Communion]] (and must be [[Confession (religion)|confessed]] before receiving once again) and those which are not sufficiently serious to do so. In this respect, the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Tradition]] is similar to the [[Western Christianity|Western]], but the Eastern Churches do not consider death in such a state to automatically mean damnation to "hell."{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Jehovah's Witnesses==
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that sin is inherited, like a disease, and has been passed on from generation to generation of humans, beginning with [[Adam and Eve]], whom Witnesses believe are real historical characters.&lt;ref&gt;"What Does the Bible ''Really '' Teach" pp. 61–63 'Why humans die?'&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that it began with the Devil, and then with humans wanting to decide for themselves what was "Good and Bad." They believe that at that very moment they lost perfection and began to die. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human beings to ''be'' souls, and so when a human dies due to sin, they believe that his soul dies as well.&lt;ref&gt;"What Does the Bible ''Really '' Teach" pp. 57–65 'Where are the Dead?'&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that [[Jesus]] is the only human ever to have lived and died sinless.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Atonement==
{{Main|Atonement in Christianity}}
In Christianity, it is generally understood that the death of Jesus was a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] that relieves believers of the burden of their sins. However, the actual meaning of this precept is very widely debated. The traditional teaching of some churches traces this idea of atonement to [[korban|blood sacrifices]] in the ancient Hebraic faith.

Christian theologians have presented different interpretations of atonement:
* [[Origen]] taught that the death of Christ was a ''[[Atonement (ransom view)|ransom]]'' paid to [[Satan]] in satisfaction of his claim on the souls of humanity as a result of sin. This was opposed by theologians such as St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], who maintained that this would have made Satan a power equal to God.
* [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] taught that Christ recapitulated in himself all the stages of life of sinful man, and that his perfect obedience substituted for [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s disobedience.
* [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] taught that Christ came to overcome death and corruption, and to remake humanity in God's image again.&lt;ref&gt;See ''On the Incarnation'', by St. Athanasius&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Augustine of Hippo]] said that sin was not a created thing at all, but was "privatio boni", a "taking away of good".
* [[Anselm of Canterbury]] taught that Christ's death satisfied God's offended sense of justice over the sins of humanity. God rewarded Christ's obedience, which built up a storehouse of merit and a treasury of grace that believers could share by their faith in Christ. This view is known as the ''[[satisfaction theory of atonement]]'', the ''merit'' theory, or sometimes the ''commercial'' theory. Anselm's teaching is contained in his treatise ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' (''Why God Became Human''). Anselm's ideas were later expanded utilizing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy into a grand theological system by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century, particularly in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', which although initially inciting controversy eventually became official [[Roman Catholic]] [[doctrine]].
* [[Pierre Abélard]] developed the view that Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] was God suffering with his creatures in order to show the greatness of his love for them, and the realization of this love in turn leads to repentance. It is often known as the ''[[moral influence theory of atonement]]'' and became central to more [[religious liberalism|liberal strands]] of Christian theology.
* [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], leaders of the [[Protestant Reformation]], owed much to Anselm's theory and taught that Christ, the only sinless person, was obedient to take upon himself the penalty for the sins that should have been visited on men and women. This view is a version of ''[[substitutionary atonement]]'' and is sometimes called the ''[[penal substitution]] view''. It is derived from the Roman Catholic ''[[satisfaction theory of atonement]]'', although it is not identical to that of Anselm. Calvin additionally advocated a doctrine of [[limited atonement]], which teaches that the atonement extends and applies only to the sins of the eternally [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] [[election (Christianity)|elect]] rather than to the entire [[human race]], whereas Anselm affirmed a general redemption for all humanity and denied that Christ received punishment for sins, although he made satisfaction to God.
* [[D.L. Moody]] once said, "If you are under the power of evil, and you want to get under the power of God, cry to Him to bring you over to His service; cry to Him to take you into His army. He will hear you; He will come to you, and, if need be, He will send a legion of angels to help you to fight your way up to heaven. God will take you by the right hand and lead you through this wilderness, over death, and take you right into His kingdom. That's what the Son of Man came to do. He has never deceived us; just say here; "Christ is my deliverer.""
* [[Arminianism]] has traditionally taught what is known as the ''[[governmental theory of atonement]]''. Drawing primarily from the works of [[Jacobus Arminius]] and especially [[Hugo Grotius]], the governmental theory teaches that Christ suffered for humankind so that God could forgive humans while still maintaining divine justice. Unlike the traditional [[Calvinism|Reformed]] perspective, this view states that Christ was not punished by God the Father in the place of sinners, for true forgiveness would not be possible if humankind's offenses were already punished. Christ's suffering was a real and meaningful ''[[substitutionary atonement]]'' for the punishment humans deserve, but Christ was not punished on behalf of some or all of the human race. This view has prospered in traditional [[Methodism]] and all who follow the teachings of [[John Wesley]], and has been detailed by, among others, 19th century [[Methodist]] theologian [[John Miley]] in his  ''Atonement in Christ'' and 20th century [[Church of the Nazarene]] theologian [[J. Kenneth Grider]] in his ''Wesleyan-Holiness Theology''. Variations of this view have also been espoused by 18th century Puritan [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and 19th century revival leader [[Charles Grandison Finney]].
* [[Karl Barth]] taught that Christ's death manifested God's love and his hatred for sin.
* Barbara Reid, a dissenting Roman Catholic [[feminist theology|feminist]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican nun]], argues that commonly conceived atonement theologies are harmful, especially to women and other oppressed minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara E. Reid, ''Taking Up the Cross: New Testament Interpretations Through Latina and Feminist Eyes'' (Fortress, 2007), 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other [[religious liberalism|liberal]] and [[liberation theology|radical theologians]] have also challenged traditional views of atonement. (see [[collective salvation]])
* [[Mary Baker Eddy]], founder of the [[Christian Science]] movement, taught that atonement exemplifies our underlying spiritual unity with God, whereby we reflect divine Love (God): Christ's atonement reconciles man to God, not God to man.

'''Cleavage''' is the exposed area between a woman’s [[breasts]] lying over the [[Human sternum|sternum]], and refers ''only'' to what is visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent [[body art]]) that includes a low-cut [[neckline]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Erin ; Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAUmDwAAQBAJ Beauty around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia]. Santa Barbara, CA: [[ABC-CLIO]], 2017, p. 81, {{ISBN|978-1-61069-944-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, lingerie, and [[swimwear]]. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[modesty]] of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally [[taboo]] (e.g. ''juyub'' in Islam,) illegal or otherwise socially disapproved.

The [[Anatomical terminology|anatomical term]] for the area that constitutes a cleavage is [[intermammary cleft]], intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius.

[[Décolletage]] is the upper part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Barnhart|editor1-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as "side cleavage", "sidewinders" or "sideboob".&lt;ref name="Dun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Elizabeth|title=The glossary: can't pronounce the ingredient, the makeup artist's name, or even the product?

Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', said, "The look is unlikely to fade fast, with [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[Roberto Cavalli]] both pushing the silhouette next season."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Imogen|first1=Fox|title=The side cleavage: a new trend is born|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2012/may/29/side-cleavage-new-trend-born|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff writer|title=Trend Watch: The Side Cleavage|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/trend-watch-the-side-cleavage-2011276|website=Us Weekly|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called "underboob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/thailand-warns-underboob-trend-breaks-computer-laws|title=Thailand warns women who post 'underboob' photos face five years in jail|last=Reuters|date=2015-03-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/kylie-jenner-works-underboob-in-skintight-jumpsuit-photos-w208727|title=Kylie Jenner's Underboob Is Out of Control in This Jumpsuit|work=Us Weekly|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Western culture ===
{{See also|Dress code|Breast fetishism}}

Many people in [[Western culture]], both male and female, consider breasts an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |title=Secondary Characteristics |work=hu-berlin.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075821/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an important aspect of femininity. [[Décolletage]] that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their [[physical attractiveness|physical]] and [[sexual attractiveness]] and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive [[erotic pleasure]] from seeing a woman's cleavage,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, Alfred C.]] et al. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''.  Saunders, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention.&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, '' The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths'', Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9857249-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During adolescence, some girls become fixated on breast shape and cleavage.&lt;ref name="Ashlea"&gt;Ashlea Worrel, ''An Examination of Women's Body Image and Sexual Satisfaction'', page 15, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-65144-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed as causes of an increase in [[breast fetishism]], and atypical [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="ggf2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazier|Flowerday|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salmansohn |first=Karen |title=The Power of Cleavage |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html  |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by [[dress code]]s in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[James Laver]] argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael ''Fashion classics from Carlyle to Barthes'', page 732, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modesty considerations ===
{{See also|Modesty}}

There is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or any hint of a bosom.&lt;ref name="harari"&gt;Herbert Harari and Robert Malcolm Kaplan, ''Social Psychology: Basic and Applied'', page 271, Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|978-0-8185-0481-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Puritans under James I|Early English Puritans]] used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century [[Spaniard]]s put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.&lt;ref name="harari" /&gt;

In the [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Islam]], it is stated, "Let them draw their [[Khimar]] (shawl/head veil) over their ''juyub'' (breast-line/cleavage)".&lt;ref&gt;[[An-Nur]]:&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php Ayat 31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818132125/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php |date=2016-08-18 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ayat'' refers to the women's clothes worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, at the time when it was cited.&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Cahill and M.A. Farley, ''Embodiment, Morality, and Medicine'', page 47, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-3342-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haideh"&gt;Haideh Moghissi, ''Women and Islam: Social conditions, obstacles and prospects'', page 77, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-32420-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reina Lewis and Sara Mills, ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader'', page 589, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-415-94274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar, ''Reading the Qur'an: The Contemporary Relevance of the Sacred Text of Islam'', page 332, Oxford University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-19-991149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later interpreted as total covering of a woman's body.&lt;ref name="Haideh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reina Lewis and Sara Mills, ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader'', page 590, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-415-94274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar, ''Reading the Qur'an: The Contemporary Relevance of the Sacred Text of Islam'', page 333, Oxford University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-19-991149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 21st century [[Muslim world]] there are differences in legal implementation.

=== Theories ===
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology}}

The cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest{{Clarify|reason=interest in what?|date=November 2018}}. Breast and [[buttock cleavage]]s, sharing a similarity between their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa Berger, ''Media and Society: A Critical Perspective'', page 194, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4422-1780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists{{Who|date=November 2018}} hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Curtis, ''Steal This Book Too!'', page 287, Authorhouse, May 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4184-1875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allowed females to "solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile",&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Charles B. and Krebs, Dennis (eds.) "How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature", ''Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology: Ideas, Issues, and Applications'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1997) pp. 236,240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2004), pp. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt; According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary [[sexualization]] devices of Western costume.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer. ''The Face of Fashion'', page 122, Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|0-203-40942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Boye De Mente, ''The Origins of Human Violence'', page 61, Cultural-Insight Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4528-5846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
In 2600 BCE, princess [[Nofret]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]] was depicted in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, [[Snake Goddess]] figurines were sculpted in [[Minos]] with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;James S. Olson, ''Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer, and History'', page 324, JHU Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8064-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek goddess [[Hera]] wore an early version of a push-up bra, described in the ''[[Iliad]]'' as festooned with "brooches of gold" and "a hundred tassels", to increase her cleavage to divert [[Zeus]] from the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=divide&gt;Daphne Merkin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/style/tmagazine/TW1792179.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 The Great Divide]", ''New York Times'', August 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Décolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages. This continued through the [[Victorian period]]. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"&gt;Gernsheim, Alison. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion. A Photographic Survey''. pp. 25-26, 43, 53, 63, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1981 (Reprint of 1963 edition). {{ISBN|0-486-24205-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DesmondMorris"&gt;Desmond Morris.

In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine – 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c.1480.

In many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cunnington, C.

During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. [[Anne of Austria]] was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight [[bodice]] and [[corset]]s that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the [[areola]] and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;

=== Modern period ===
[[Image:Sargent MadameX.jpeg|thumb|This portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]] of [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]] depicting her cleavage caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] art exhibition in Paris.]]

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see [[1880s in fashion]]).

During the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Schama, Simon]]. ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', p. 147. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1989. {{ISBN|0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the [[Tuileries]] in [[Paris]] in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!"&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]'', a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticized&lt;ref name="Elaine Kilmurray 1998, p. 114"&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884.&lt;ref name="Fairbrother 2001 139, Note 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a "bust form" was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrie A. Inness, ''Delinquents and Debutantes: Twentieth-century American Girls' Cultures'', page 117, New York University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the [[German Empire]], for example, all [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kim K. P.; Torntore, Susan J. and Eicher, Joanne Bubolz. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century===
In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of [[Jane Russell]]'s "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her décollete gowns were thought "...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and [[falsies]]). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mazur, "U.S. trends in feminine beauty and overadaptation", ''Journal of Sex Research'', pp. 281-303, Volume 22, Issue 3, 1986, The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Pennsylvania, USA. DOI: 10.1080/00224498609551309&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane Russell and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] being the biggest stars who led the fashion,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Baker, ''Fashions of a Decade'', page 51, Infobase Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4381-1891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in everyday life low-cut dress styles became very common, even for casual wear.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Koestenbaum, ''Cleavage: essays on sex, stars, and aesthetics'', page 125, Ballantine Books, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-345-43460-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.

The ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of [[#Cleavage enhancement|methods and techniques]]. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] look of the times; in the 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with [[Hippie chic]] of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed, pumped and engorged look has become the preference.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Gill, ''To America with Love'', page 113, Simon and Schuster, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-9621-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century===
[[File:Zoë Bell 07.jpg|thumb|upright|Actress [[Zoë Bell]] in a low-cut dress at a film premiere in USA, 2006]]

21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations, such as those seen at the 2016 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/it-was-all-about-cleavage-on-the-oscars-red-carpet-this-year/news-story/3e8b2386e2b8a2474f07963b25f589f5 |title=It was all about cleavage on the Oscars red carpet this year |publisher=News.com.au |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Zoe |url=http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/news/features/2016/02/cleavage-controversy-at-the-sag-awards |title=Susan Sarandon and Sarah Silverman's cleavage cause controversy at the SAG awards |work=Glamour |location=UK |date=2016-02-06 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low-cut dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also noticeable in the 2013 film ''[[American Hustle]]'', as well as in films which expose cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.

Display of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref name="Woman told she was too Hot to Fly"&gt;NBC News.

== Cleavage enhancement ==
{{Main|Cleavage enhancement}}
Various methods have been used by women in history to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.

=== Underwear ===

[[Corset]]s that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Condra, Jill. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History,'' page 152, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-33664-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Catherine. ''Fashioning Gothic Bodies,'' page 28, Manchester University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6401-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesmondMorris"/&gt;

When corsets became unfashionable, [[brassiere]]s and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a "breast supporter," described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern [[push-up bra]] designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits.&lt;ref name="Tucek"&gt;{{cite news |last=Riordan |first=Teresa |title=Patents; In bra technology, an incremental improvement can translate into comfort |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=2009-04-21 |date=2002-10-28 |publisher=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gHMwNkFs?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2009-04-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 494397  | y = 1893 | m = 03 | d = 28 | inventor = Marie Tucek | title = Breast Supporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Napoleon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Napoleon | first = Anthony | title = Awakening Beauty: An Illustrated Look at Mankind's Love and Hatred of Beauty | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AyJLqNcfM3IC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=history+underwire+bra | accessdate = 2009-04-21 | edition = Illustrated | year = 2003 | publisher = Virtual Bookworm Publishing | isbn  = 978-1-58939-378-3 | pages = 31, 130–131 | chapter = Wardrobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of [[World War II]] freed metal for domestic use.&lt;ref name="Kanner"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kanner | first = Bernice | title = The Bra's not for Burning | journal = [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KdgBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA29&amp;dq=history+underwire+bra+1938 | accessdate = 2009-04-21 | volume = 16 | issue = 49 | date = 1983-12-12 | issn = 0028-7369 | pages = 26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seigel"&gt;{{cite news | last = Seigel | first = Jessica | title = The Cups Runneth Over | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/opinion/the-cups-runneth-over.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2013-05-09 | date = 2004-02-13 | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviator and filmmaker [[Howard Hughes]] designed a prototype for an aerodynamic underwire bra for [[Jane Russell]] when filming ''[[The Outlaw]]'' in 1941. According to Hughes, the resultant amount was "the length of the actual cleavage is five and one-quarter inches."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; Several brassiere manufacturers, among them [[Wonderbra]] and [[Victoria's Secret]], produce push-up and other types of bras that enhance cleavage. [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] introduced a design called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like [[Pamela Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jene Luciani, ''The Bra Book'', pp=103, 140, BenBella Books Inc., 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-935251-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taping ===
Many women, such as beauty pageant participants and [[transgender]] people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling them together and up.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Banet-Weiser, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BsZHUu3gmV0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=breast+cleavage+taping&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9Ys9VLOkI4KVuASCvICYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=breast%20cleavage%20taping&amp;f=false The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: Beauty Pageants and National Identity],'' page 73, University of California Press, (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-520-21789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apaige&gt;Andy Paige, ''Style on a Shoestring,'' page 24, McGraw Hill Professional, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-159506-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2"&gt;JoAnn Roberts, ''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' (Vol. 2), Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of [[moleskin]] under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.&lt;ref name=apaige /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2" /&gt;

=== Surgery ===
{{Main|Breast augmentation}}

Bigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them.&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt; Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking [[breast augmentation]].&lt;ref name=brett&gt;{{cite news|last=Brett|first=Samantha|title=The Great Cleavage Conundrum: should men look if it's on display?|url=http://www.northernargus.com.au/blogs/national-comment/the-great-cleavage-conundrum-should-men-look-if-its-on-display/2459026.aspx?storypage=0|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=Northern Argus|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, "you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You have to be at least a B or a C."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] promises "high-rise cleavage to small busts" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an "exciting C cup cleavage").&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;Kristina Roberts Ellis, ''Bodies of Thought, Sites of Anxiety'', pages 82-83, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-98382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast surgery for emplacing [[breast implant]]s can be done for three purposes:

# primary reconstruction to replace breast tissues damaged by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease (breast cancer) and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast]] deformity).
# revision and reconstruction to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# primary augmentation to aesthetically augment the size, form and feel of the [[breast]]s.

For [[breast reconstruction]] and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]] and silicone implants filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel.

If a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts, it could result in [[symmastia]], a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the [[Human sternum|sternum]], creating a lack of defined cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Iliana E. Sweis, ''Outsmarting Mother Nature,'' page 163, ABC-CLIO, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-313-38614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures are generally followed during [[breast reconstruction]] to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Jay R. Harris, Marc E. Lippman, C. Kent Osborne and Monica Morrow, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GLc8xYe239kC&amp;pg=PT1448&amp;lpg=PT1448&amp;dq=intermammary+succulus+pathology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zb2PvcRnK1&amp;sig=AkGgy-yKvAl3pgJSsUB4nENhuXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iLhVVKfFA8TguQT7s4CYAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Diseases of the Breast],'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4511-4870-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Regular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage.&lt;ref name=bmars&gt;Brigitte Mars, ''Beauty by Nature'', page 136, Book Publishing Company, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-57067-193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Lydon, ''Look Hot, Live Long'', page 198, Basic Health Publications, Inc., 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-59120-024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L.

=== Make up ===
Making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage with makeup is achieved using [[shading]] effects. The middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin, while the most prominent areas of the breasts (either side of the cleavage) are made to look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour.&lt;ref&gt;''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' Third Edition, Vol. 2 – Fashion &amp; Style", JoAnn Roberts, Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Making Faces", Kevyn Aucoin, Prion Books Limited, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85375-355-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Consulting the Oracle''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[John William Waterhouse]]. Waterhouse painted it in 1884; according to Anthony Hobson, "''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' described it as one of the principal works of the year". Hobson describes the work as having a "keyhole composition" because a partial ring of women focus upon a single other (the priestess).&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;Hobson, Anthony. 1989. ''J. W. Waterhouse''. Oxford: Phaidon Christie's. pages 31, 33-34. {{ISBN|0-7148-8066-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobson goes on to say that the painting helps "to establish Waterhouse as a classical painter" because of his use of "classical, geometrical structures...the vertical, the horizontal and the circle". When he adds the diagonal, as "in the inclined figure of the priestess" and the out-of-place rug, it is a deliberately added tension.&lt;ref name="Hobson" /&gt;

'''''Deep in My Heart''''' is a 1999 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on a true story, starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Lynn Whitfield]] and directed by [[Anita W. Addison]]. Bancroft received a [[primetime Emmy]] for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her role. 

==Plot==
In [[Boston]] in the early 1960s, Geraldine Cummins was walking home alone from the movies when she was jumped and raped by a black man. Stunned, she returned home to her husband Bob, stating she had been raped. Sometime later, she finds she is pregnant. She keeps the baby for a few reasons: she is Catholic and she harbors a small hope that it could be her husband's baby. As the baby is black girl, she fears the social isolation she would receive and what people would think of her. She is heartbroken, but decides to give up her daughter. She names her newborn daughter Barbara Anne Cummins and gives her to foster mother Corrine Burrel, a black woman in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]].

Seven years later, Barbara is a happy little girl. A few months later, a social worker comes into their home and informs Corrine that Barbara will be adopted by Annalise and Paul, white people living in Wisconsin. Corrine seeks legal action, looking to adopt Barbara for herself, but as she is divorced with no job and many children, she is turned down.

Annalise becomes worried about Barbara's very detached nature and suggests to Paul they move to a suburban neighborhood where Barbara could be around other black kids. Paul is angry that they have to change everything for a child he did not want, but agrees, only to leave them after moving. Barbara has once again receded into herself after the neighborhood children make fun of her for being black with a white mother. Over the years until she is 16, she is alone without her mother or friends. At 16 she meets Don, a football playing choirboy. She falls in love with him and ultimately gets pregnant. 

Years later, in the middle of Barbara's third pregnancy, the doctor suggests she look into her birth family history for medical reasons. This leads her in search for her mother. She visits Corrine and later contacts the agency in charge of her adoption. By reading her adoption records, she comes to know the truth about her birth and her biological mother. After a night of contemplation, she decides to seek out her birth mother. 

Revitalized by the happiness of knowing she was wanted by both her birth mother and foster mother, Barbara reconciles with Annalise. Anxiously, Gerry and her 3 grown children wait at the airport for Barbara's arrival. Finally, after 34 years, mother and daughter meet. Barbara is angry as to why Gerry gave her up if she loves her, asking if it would have made a difference if she had been born white. Gerry says she only wanted the best for Barbara, to be with people who could teach her courage, which she could not, because Gerry felt ashamed for being raped and having a black daughter, though she loved her. Gerry apologizes to Barbara and the two reconcile as mother and daughter. Later, at a family reunion, Corrine, Gerry and Annalise meet again for the first time. The film ends with a picture of the entire side of Barbara's family, her mothers, her uncles, her brothers and sisters, her children, and her nieces and nephews, and Barbara no longer feels alone.

'''Degenerate art''' ({{lang-de|Entartete Kunst}}) was a term adopted in the 1920s by the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Germany]] to describe [[modern art]]. During the dictatorship of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[German art#20th century|German modernist art]], including many works of internationally renowned artists, was removed from state owned museums and banned in [[Nazi Germany]] on the grounds that such art was an "insult to German feeling", un-German, [[Jewish]], or [[Communist]] in nature. Those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions that included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art.&lt;ref name="VAM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/entartete-kunst/ |title=Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art), complete inventory of over 16,000 artworks confiscated by the Nazi regime from public institutions in Germany, 1937–1938, Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda.

''Degenerate Art'' also was the title of [[Degenerate Art Exhibition|an exhibition]], held by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of 650 [[modernist]] artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and [[Austria]].

While modern styles of art were prohibited, the Nazis promoted [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s that were traditional in manner and that exalted the "[[Blood and Soil|blood and soil]]" values of [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]], [[militarism]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)#Cultural attitudes to obedience|obedience]]. Similar restrictions were placed upon music, which was expected to be [[Tonality|tonal]] and free of any [[jazz]] influences; disapproved music was termed [[degenerate music]]. Films and plays were also [[censorship|censored]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10077 |title=The Collection &amp;#124; Entartete Kunst |publisher=MoMA |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction against modernism==
[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|A still from ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'']]
The early 20th century was a period of wrenching changes in the arts. In the visual arts, such innovations as [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and [[Surrealism]]—following [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]]—were not universally appreciated. The majority of people in Germany, as elsewhere, did not care for the new art, which many resented as [[elitist]], morally suspect, and too often incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who took an active interest in regulating art in Germany, criticized [[Impressionism]] as "gutter painting" ({{lang|de|Gossenmalerei}})&lt;ref name="Kühnel_GAO"&gt;Kühnel, Anita (2003). "Entartete Kunst". ''Grove Art Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; and forbade [[Käthe Kollwitz]] from being awarded a medal for her print series ''A Weavers' Revolt'' when it was displayed in the Berlin Grand Exhibition of the Arts in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Robert Justin, and Andrew Nedd (2015). ''Political Censorship of the Visual Arts in Nineteenth-Century Europe: Arresting Images''. Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan. p. 159. {{ISBN|9780230248700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the Prussian house of representatives passed a resolution "against degeneracy in art".&lt;ref name="Kühnel_GAO"/&gt;

Under the [[Weimar government]] of the 1920s, Germany emerged as a leading center of the ''[[avant-garde]]''. It was the birthplace of [[Expressionism]] in painting and sculpture, of the [[Atonal music|atonal]] musical compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the jazz-influenced work of [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. Films such as [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) and [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu (film)|Nosferatu]]'' (1922) brought Expressionism to [[Film|cinema]].

The Nazis viewed the culture of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar period]] with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from a conservative [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] taste and partly from their determination to use culture as a [[propaganda]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; On both counts, a painting such as [[Otto Dix]]'s ''War Cripples'' (1920) was anathema to them. It unsparingly depicts four badly disfigured veterans of the [[First World War]], then a familiar sight on [[Berlin]]'s streets, rendered in [[caricature]]d style. (In 1937, it would be displayed in the Degenerate Art exhibition next to a label accusing Dix—himself a volunteer in World War I&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Wolf, Uta Grosenick (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MbOdSrOFfpEC&amp;pg=PA36 ''Expressionism''], Taschen, p. 34. {{ISBN|3-8228-2126-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—of "an insult to the German heroes of the Great War".&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1930 [[Wilhelm Frick]], a Nazi, became Minister for Culture and Education, and announced a campaign "against Negro culture—for German national traditions".&lt;ref name="Kühnel_GAO"/&gt; By his order, 70 mostly Expressionist paintings were removed from the permanent exhibition of the Weimar [[Schloss Weimar|Schlossmuseum]] in 1930, and the director of the König Albert Museum in Zwickau, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], was dismissed for displaying modern art.&lt;ref name="Kühnel_GAO"/&gt;

As dictator, Hitler gave his personal taste in art the force of law to a degree never before seen. Only in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] [[Soviet Union]], where [[Socialist Realism]] was the mandatory style, had a modern state shown such concern with regulation of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of  Germany, the model was to be [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] art, regarded by Hitler as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Henry Grosshans says that Hitler "saw Greek and Roman art as uncontaminated by Jewish influences. Modern art was [seen as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler even though only [[Max Liebermann|Liebermann]], [[Ludwig Meidner|Meidner]], [[Otto Freundlich|Freundlich]], and [[Marc Chagall]], among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposedly "Jewish" nature of all art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented "depraved" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race. By propagating the theory of degeneracy, the Nazis combined their [[anti-Semitism]] with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degeneracy==
[[File:Barlach Magdeburger Ehrenmal.jpg|thumb|upright|{{lang|de|Das Magdeburger Ehrenmal}} (the Magdeburg cenotaph), by [[Ernst Barlach]] was declared to be degenerate art due to the "deformity" and emaciation of the figures—corresponding to [[Max Nordau|Nordau's]] theorized connection between "mental and physical degeneration".]]
The term {{lang|de|Entartung}} (or [[Degeneration theory|"degeneracy"]]) had gained currency in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author [[Max Nordau]] devised the [[theory]] presented in his 1892 book ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Entartung]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Nordau drew upon the writings of the [[criminology|criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]], whose ''The Criminal Man'', published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were "born criminals" whose [[atavism|atavistic]] personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of [[modern art]], explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. He attacked [[Aestheticism]] in [[English literature]] and described the [[mysticism]] of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in [[French literature]] as a product of mental pathology. Explaining the [[painterliness]] of [[Impressionism]] as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish and a key figure in the [[Zionist]] movement (Lombroso was also Jewish), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German [[Nazism|National Socialists]] during the [[Weimar Republic]] as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for [[Aryan race|Aryan]] purity in art.

Belief in a Germanic spirit—defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, and noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the Nazis; the composer [[Richard Wagner]] celebrated such ideas in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning before World War I, the well-known German architect and painter [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]]'s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and [[modern architecture|architecture]], supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical [[Greece]] and the [[Middle Ages]] were the true sources of Aryan art.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Schultze-Naumburg subsequently wrote such books as {{lang|de|Die Kunst der Deutschen. Ihr Wesen und ihre Werke}} (The art of the Germans. Its nature and its works) and {{lang|de|Kunst und Rasse}} (Art and Race), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only racially pure artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless [[Platonic idealism|ideals]] of [[classical beauty]], while racially mixed modern artists produced disordered artworks and monstrous depictions of the human form. By reproducing examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, he graphically reinforced the idea of modernism as a sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 9. Grosshans calls Schultze-Naumburg "[u]ndoubtedly the most important" of the era's German critics of modernism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Rosenberg]] developed this theory in {{lang|de|[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Der Mythos des 20. Jahrhunderts]]}} (Myth of the Twentieth Century), published in 1933, which became a best-seller in Germany and made Rosenberg the Party's leading ideological spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purge==
[[File:Entartete musik poster.jpg|thumb|Cover of the exhibition program: ''[[Degenerate music]]'' exhibition, [[Düsseldorf]], 1938]]
Hitler's rise to power on January 31, 1933, was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy: [[biblioclasm|book burnings]] were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, and curators who had shown a partiality to modern art were replaced by Party members.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1933, the {{lang|de|[[Reichskulturkammer]]}} (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with [[Joseph Goebbels]], Hitler's {{lang|de|Reichminister für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda}} (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and [[Propaganda]]) in charge. Sub-chambers within the Culture Chamber, representing the individual arts (music, film, literature, architecture, and the visual arts) were created; these were membership groups consisting of "racially pure" artists supportive of the Party, or willing to be compliant. Goebbels made it clear: "In future only those who are members of a chamber are allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfill the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded."&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, p. 53"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, p. 53"/&gt;

Nonetheless there was, during the period 1933–1934, some confusion within the Party on the question of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]]. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[Erich Heckel]] exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, "We National Socialists are not unmodern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a faction led by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] despised the Expressionists, and the result was a bitter ideological dispute, which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; This edict left many artists initially uncertain as to their status. The work of the Expressionist painter Emil Nolde, a committed member of the Nazi party, continued to be debated even after he was ordered to cease artistic activity in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Boa, Elizabeth, and Rachel Palfreyman (2000).

Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 158. {{ISBN|0198159226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For many modernist artists, such as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], and [[Oskar Schlemmer]], it was not until June 1937 that they surrendered any hope that their work would be tolerated by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael (June 19, 2014).

Although books by [[Franz Kafka]] could no longer be bought by 1939, works by ideologically suspect authors such as [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Hans Fallada]] were widely read.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture, possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, until the outbreak of the war, most [[Hollywood]] films could be screened, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. While performance of [[atonal]] music was banned, the prohibition of jazz was less strictly enforced. [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] were popular, and leading British and American jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war; thereafter, dance bands officially played "swing" rather than the banned jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entartete Kunst poster, Berlin, 1938.jpg|thumb|Entartete Kunst poster, Berlin, 1938]]
By 1937, the concept of degeneracy was firmly entrenched in Nazi policy. On June 30 of that year Goebbels put [[Adolf Ziegler]], the head of {{lang|de|Reichskammer der Bildenden Künste}} (Reich Chamber of Visual Art), in charge of a six-man commission authorized to confiscate from museums and art collections throughout the Reich, any remaining art deemed modern, degenerate, or subversive. These works were then to be presented to the public in an exhibit intended to incite further revulsion against the "perverse Jewish spirit" penetrating German culture.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 123, quoting Goebbels, November 26, 1937, in ''Von der Grossmacht zur Weltmacht''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ELW-Selbstportrait.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait by [[Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler]], who was murdered at [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre]] in 1940]]
Over 5000 works were seized, including 1052 by Nolde, 759 by Heckel, 639 by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and 508 by [[Max Beckmann]], as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[James Ensor]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|de|Entartete Kunst}} exhibit, featuring over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of 32 German museums, premiered in [[Munich]] on July 19, 1937, and remained on view until November 30, before traveling to 11 other cities in Germany and Austria.

The exhibit was held on the second floor of a building formerly occupied by the Institute of [[Archaeology]]. Viewers had to reach the exhibit by means of a narrow staircase. The first sculpture was an oversized, theatrical portrait of [[Jesus]], which purposely intimidated viewers as they literally bumped into it in order to enter. The rooms were made of temporary partitions and deliberately chaotic and overfilled. Pictures were crowded together, sometimes unframed, usually hung by cord.

The first three rooms were grouped thematically. The first room contained works considered demeaning of religion; the second featured works by Jewish artists in particular; the third contained works deemed insulting to the women, soldiers and farmers of Germany. The rest of the exhibit had no particular theme.

There were slogans painted on the walls. For example:
* Insolent mockery of the Divine under Centrist rule
* Revelation of the Jewish racial soul
* An insult to German womanhood
* The ideal—cretin and whore
* Deliberate sabotage of national defense
* German farmers—a Yiddish view
* The Jewish longing for the wilderness reveals itself—in Germany the [[Negro]] becomes the racial ideal of a degenerate art
* Madness becomes method
* Nature as seen by sick minds
* Even museum bigwigs called this the "art of the German people"&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scene from Degenerate Art auction, 1938, works by Picasso, Head of a Woman, Two Harlequins.jpg|thumb|Scene from the [[Degenerate Art]] auction, spring 1938, published in a Swiss newspaper; works by [[Pablo Picasso]], ''Head of a Woman'' (lot 117), ''Two Harlequins'' (lot 115). "Paintings from the degenerate art action will now be offered on the international art market. In so doing we hope at least to make some money from this garbage" wrote Joseph Goebbels in his diaries.&lt;ref name="LACMA"&gt;Barron, Stephanie, Guenther and Peter W., [https://archive.org/stream/degenerateartfa00barr#page/n0/mode/2up ''"Degenerate Art": The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany]''], LACMA, 1991, {{ISBN|0810936534}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Speeches of Nazi party leaders contrasted with artist [[manifesto]]s from various art movements, such as [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. Next to many paintings were labels indicating how much money a museum spent to acquire the artwork. In the case of paintings acquired during the post-war [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] of the early 1920s, when the cost of a kilogram loaf of bread reached 233&amp;nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[German Papiermark|German marks]],&lt;ref&gt;Evans 2004, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; the prices of the paintings were of course greatly exaggerated. The exhibit was designed to promote the idea that modernism was a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] by people who hated German decency, frequently identified as Jewish-Bolshevist, although only 6 of the 112 artists included in the exhibition were in fact Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition program contained photographs of modern artworks accompanied by defamatory text.&lt;ref name="LACMA" /&gt; The cover featured the exhibition title—with the word {{lang|de|"Kunst"}}, meaning art, in [[scare quotes]]—superimposed on an image of [[Otto Freundlich]]'s sculpture {{lang|de|[[Der Neue Mensch]]}}.

A few weeks after the opening of the exhibition, Goebbels ordered a second and more thorough scouring of German art collections; inventory lists indicate that the artworks seized in this second round, combined with those gathered prior to the exhibition, amounted to 16,558 works.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/entartete-kunst/ |title=Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art), complete inventory of artworks confiscated by the Nazi regime from public institutions in Germany, 1937–1938, Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda. Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=1939-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the {{lang|de|Entartete Kunst}} exhibition, the {{lang|de|Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung}} (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial {{lang|de|[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]}} (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months {{lang|de|Entartete Kunst}} had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby {{lang|de|Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung}}.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Fate of the artists and their work==

[[Avant-garde]] German artists were now branded both enemies of the state and a threat to German culture. Many went into [[exile]]. [[Max Beckmann]] fled to [[Amsterdam]] on the opening day of the {{lang|de|Entartete Kunst}} exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz-Hoffmann and Weiss 1984, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Ernst]] emigrated to America with the assistance of [[Peggy Guggenheim]]. [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] committed suicide in Switzerland in 1938. [[Paul Klee]] spent his years in exile in Switzerland, yet was unable to obtain Swiss [[citizen]]ship because of his status as a degenerate artist. A leading German dealer, [[Alfred Flechtheim]], died penniless in exile in [[London]] in 1937.

Other artists remained in internal exile. [[Otto Dix]] retreated to the countryside to paint unpeopled landscapes in a meticulous style that would not provoke the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Karcher 1988, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reichskulturkammer]] forbade artists such as [[Edgar Ende]] and [[Emil Nolde]] from purchasing painting materials. Those who remained in Germany were forbidden to work at [[university|universities]] and were subject to surprise raids by the [[Gestapo]] in order to ensure that they were not violating the ban on producing artwork; Nolde secretly carried on painting, but using only [[watercolor]]s (so as not to be betrayed by the telltale odor of [[oil paint]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley 1986, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially no artists were put to death because of their work, those of Jewish descent who did not escape from Germany in time were sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos 2000, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were murdered in the [[Action T4]] (see, for example, [[Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler]]).

[[File:'The Prophet', woodcut by Emil Nolde, 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Membership in the [[Nazi Party]] did not protect [[Emil Nolde]], whose 1912 woodcut ''The Prophet'' is shown here. 1052 of Nolde's paintings were removed from German museums, more than any other artist.]]
After the exhibit, paintings were sorted out for sale and sold in Switzerland at auction; some pieces were acquired by museums, others by private collectors. Nazi officials took many for their private use: for example, [[Hermann Göring]] took 14 valuable pieces, including a [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] and a [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In March 1939, the Berlin Fire Brigade burned about 4000 paintings, drawings and prints that had apparently little value on the international market. This was an act of unprecedented vandalism, although the Nazis were well used to [[book burning]]s on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olinda.com/ArtAndIdeas/lectures/ArtWeDontLike/entarteteKunst.htm |title=Entartete Kunst |publisher=Olinda.com |date=1937-07-19 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large amount of "degenerate art" by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]], Ernst, Klee, [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] and [[Joan Miró|Miró]] was destroyed in a bonfire on the night of July 27, 1942, in the gardens of the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, Mallory, ''Let's Go Paris'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas it was forbidden to export "degenerate art" to Germany, it was still possible to buy and sell artworks of "degenerate artists" in occupied France. The [[Nazi]]s considered indeed that they should not be concerned by Frenchmen's mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Dorléac, Laurence (1993). ''L'art de la défaite, 1940–1944''. Paris: Editions du Seuil. p. 482. {{ISBN|2020121255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, many works made by these artists were sold at the main French auction house during the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Oosterlinck, Kim (2009). "The Price of Degenerate Art", Working Papers CEB 09-031.RS, ULB – Universite Libre de Bruxelles.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of Nazi Germany and the invasion of [[Berlin]] by the [[Red Army]], some artwork from the exhibit was found buried underground. It is unclear how many of these then reappeared in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where they still remain.

In 2010, as work began to extend an [[Rapid transit|underground line]] from [[Alexanderplatz]] through the historic city centre to the [[Brandenburg Gate]], a number of sculptures from the degenerate art exhibition were unearthed in the cellar of a private house close to the "Rote Rathaus". These included, for example, the [[bronze]] [[cubist]]-style statue of a female dancer by the artist [[Marg Moll]], and are now on display at the [[Neues Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hickley |first=Catherine |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-08/-degenerate-sculptures-unearthed-from-bomb-rubble-put-on-show-in-berlin.html |title=‘Degenerate’ Art Unearthed From Berlin Bomb Rubble |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1946-09-27 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/11/09/2010-11-09_rescued_prewwii_degenerate_art_on_display_in_the_neues_museum_in_berlin.html |title=Rescued pre-WWII 'degenerate art' on display in the Neues Museum in Berlin |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date= November 9, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10 |first=Rosemary |last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,727971,00.html |title=Nazi Degenerate Art Rediscovered in Berlin |date=November 8, 2010 |work=Der Spiegel |author=Charles Hawley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Listing ==

The {{lang|de|[[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda]]}} (Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda) compiled a 479-page, two-volume typewritten listing of the works confiscated as "degenerate" from Germany's public institutions in 1937–38. In 1996 the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London acquired the only known surviving copy of the complete listing. The document was donated to the V&amp;A's [[National Art Library]] by Elfriede Fischer, the widow of the art dealer Heinrich Robert ("Harry") Fischer. Copies were made available to other libraries and research organisations at the time, and much of the information was subsequently incorporated into a database maintained by the Freie Universität Berlin.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A Entartete Kunst webpage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/entartetekunst |title=V&amp;A Entartete Kunst webpage |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=1939-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free University of Berlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/en/e/db_entart_kunst/index.html |title=Freie Universität Berlin Database "Entartete Kunst" |publisher=Geschkult.fu-berlin.de |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital reproduction of the entire inventory was published on the Victoria and Albert Museum's website in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/entartete-kunst/ Entartete Kunst], Victoria and Albert Museum. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The V&amp;A's version of the inventory is thought to have been compiled in 1941 or 1942, after the sales and disposals were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum 2014. Introduction by Douglas Dodds &amp; Heike Zech, p. i.&lt;/ref&gt; Two copies of an earlier version of Volume 1 (A–G) also survive in the German Federal Archives in Berlin, and one of these is annotated to show the fate of individual artworks. Until the V&amp;A obtained the complete inventory in 1996, all versions of Volume 2 (G–Z) were thought to have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum 2014. Introduction by Douglas Dodds &amp; Heike Zech, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; The listings are arranged alphabetically by city, museum and artist. Details include artist surname, inventory number, title and medium, followed by a code indicating the fate of the artwork, then the surname of the buyer or art dealer (if any) and any price paid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The entries also include abbreviations to indicate whether the work was included in any of the various {{lang|de|Entartete Kunst}} exhibitions (see [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]) or {{lang|de|Der ewige Jude}} (see [[The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum 2014, vol. 1, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main dealers mentioned are Bernhard A. Böhmer (or Boehmer), Karl Buchholz, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and Ferdinand Möller (or Moeller). The manuscript also contains entries for many artworks acquired by the artist Emanuel Fohn, in exchange for other works.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum 2014, vol. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st-century reactions ==
Neil Levi, writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', suggested that the branding of art as "degenerate" was only partly an aesthetic aim of the Nazis. Another was the confiscation of valuable artwork, a deliberate means to enrich the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Levi, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/11/12/the-uses-of-nazi-degenerate-art/ "The Uses of Nazi ‘Degenerate Art’"], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (Nov. 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
''[[A Picasso]]'', a play by [[Jeffrey Hatcher]] and based loosely inspired by actual events, is set in Paris 1941 and sees [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] being asked to authenticate three works for inclusion in an upcoming exhibition of Degenerate art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/theater/reviews/20PICA.html|title = Portrait of the Artist as a Master of the One-Liner|author = Isherwood, C.|date = April 20, 2005|accessdate = June 22, 2013|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Ve haff vays of being unintentionally funny|date = October 3, 2012|accessdate = June 22, 2013|author = Blake, J.|url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/ve-haff-vays-of-being-unintentionally-funny-20121003-26yp9.html|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1954 film ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'', a German Army colonel attempts to steal hundreds of "degenerate" paintings from Paris before it is liberated during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Train, The (1965) – (Movie Clip) Degenerate Art |accessdate = February 15, 2015 | url=http://www.tcmclassicfilmfestival.com/mediaroom/video/476066/Train-The-Movie-Clip-Degenerate-Art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|a comparison of fairy tale with other kinds of stories, such as myths, legends and fable|Traditional story}}

[[File:Däumling.jpg|thumb|alt= Illustration of the fairy tale character, Tom Thumb, on a hillside, next to a giant's foot.|1865 illustration of [[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]] and the [[ogre]]]]
A '''fairy tale''', '''wonder tale''', '''magic tale''', or '''''Märchen''''' is a [[folklore genre]] that takes the form of a [[short story]]. Such stories typically feature entities such as [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]], [[dragons]], [[Elf|elves]], [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[gnome]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[griffins]], [[mermaid]]s, [[talking animals]], [[troll]]s, [[unicorn]]s, or [[witchcraft|witches]], and usually [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[incantation|enchantments]]. Fairy tales may be distinguished{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} from other folk narratives such as [[legend]]s (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Stith. ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology &amp; Legend'', 1972 s.v. "Fairy Tale"&lt;/ref&gt; and explicit moral tales, including beast [[fable]]s. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to [[children's literature]].

In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in "fairy-tale ending" (a [[happy ending]])&lt;ref&gt;http://w.com/dictionary/fairy%2{{Dead link|date= October 2018 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "fairy-tale [[romance (love)|romance]]". Colloquially, the term "fairy tale" or "fairy story" can also mean any far-fetched story or [[tall tale]]; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true, but could not possibly be true. Legends are perceived{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as real; fairy tales may merge into [[legend]]s, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike [[legend]]s and [[Epic poems|epics]], fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to [[religion]] and to actual places, people, and events; they take place "[[once upon a time]]" rather than in actual times.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form; the name "fairy tale" was first ascribed to them by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6142964/Fairy-tales-have-ancient-origin.html "Fairy tales have ancient origin"]. ''The Telegraph'' 5 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive. Still, according to researchers at universities in [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa|Lisbon]], such stories may date back thousands of years, some to the Bronze Age more than 6,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= BBC|title= Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35358487|website= BBC News|publisher =BBC|accessdate= 20 January 2016|date= 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.

Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] and the morphological analysis of [[Vladimir Propp]] are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.

==Terminology==

Some [[folkloristics|folklorists]] prefer to use the [[German language|German]] term ''Märchen'' or "wonder tale"&lt;ref name=companion/&gt; to refer to the genre over ''fairy tale'', a practice given weight by the definition of Thompson in his 1977 [1946] edition of ''The Folktale'': "a tale of some length involving a succession of [[motif (literature)|motifs]] or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the marvellous. In this never-never land, humble [[hero]]es kill adversaries, succeed to kingdoms and marry princesses."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stith Thompson]], ''The Folktale'', 1977 (Thompson: 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple and archetypal: princesses and goose-girls; [[youngest son]]s and gallant [[prince]]s; [[ogre]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[dragon]]s, and [[troll]]s; [[wicked stepmother]]s and [[false hero]]es; [[fairy godmother]]s and other [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helpers]], often [[talking animal|talking horses, or foxes, or birds]]; glass mountains; and prohibitions and breaking of prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fairy tale with a tragic rather than a [[happy ending|happy end]] is called an [[anti-fairy tale]].

==Definition==

Although the fairy tale is a distinct genre within the larger category of folktale, the definition that marks a work as a fairy tale is a source of considerable dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/introduction/ftdefinition.html What Is a Fairy Tale?]"&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself comes from the translation of Madame D'Aulnoy's ''Conte de fées'', first used in her collection in 1697.)&lt;ref name=Windling1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forconte.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140328002739/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forconte.html | archivedate = 2014-03-28 | title = Les Contes de Fées: The Literary Fairy Tales of France | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common parlance conflates fairy tales with [[beast fable]]s and other folktales, and scholars differ on the degree to which the presence of fairies and/or similarly mythical beings (e.g., elves, goblins, trolls, giants, huge monsters) should be taken as a differentiator. [[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folktale'', criticized the common distinction between "fairy tales" and "animal tales" on the grounds that many tales contained both [[fantasy|fantastic]] elements and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, to select works for his analysis, Propp used all [[Russian folklore|Russian folktales]] classified as a folklore [[Antti Aarne|Aarne-Thompson]] 300-749&amp;nbsp;– in a cataloguing system that made such a distinction&amp;nbsp;– to gain a clear set of tales.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; His own analysis identified fairy tales by their [[plot (narrative)|plot]] elements, but that in itself has been criticized, as the analysis does not lend itself easily to tales that do not involve a [[quest]], and furthermore, the same plot elements are found in non-fairy tale works.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Were I asked, what is a fairytale? I should reply, Read [[Undine (novella)|Undine]]: that is a fairytale ... of all fairytales I know, I think Undine the most beautiful. |author=[[George MacDonald]], ''The Fantastic Imagination''}}

As [[Stith Thompson]] points out, talking animals and the presence of [[magic (fantasy)|magic]] seem to be more common to the fairy tale than fairies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p. 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mere presence of animals that talk does not make a tale a fairy tale, especially when the animal is clearly a mask on a human face, as in [[fable]]s.&lt;ref name=Tolkien15&gt;Tolkien, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", [[J.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Tolkien]] agreed with the exclusion of "fairies" from the definition, defining fairy tales as stories about the adventures of men in ''[[Álfheimr|Faërie]]'', the land of fairies, fairytale [[prince]]s and [[princess]]es, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], elves, and not only other magical species but many other marvels.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same essay excludes tales that are often considered fairy tales, citing as an example ''[[The Heart of a Monkey|The Monkey's Heart]]'', which [[Andrew Lang]] included in ''[[The Lilac Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref name=Tolkien15 /&gt;

Steven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of the Imagination''. Routledge, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson and Chaudri identify "transformation" as the key feature of the genre.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;''A companion to the fairy tale''. By Hilda Ellis Davidson, Anna Chaudhri. Boydell &amp; Brewer 2006. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a psychological point of view, [[Jean Chiriac]] argued for the necessity of the [[fantastic]] in these narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/fairy_tales.html |title=Psychoanalysis and Fairy-Tales |publisher=Freudfile.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of aesthetic values, [[Italo Calvino]] cited the fairy tale as a prime example of "quickness" in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Six Memos for the Next Millennium'', pp. 36–37. {{ISBN|0674810406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the genre===

[[File:Perrault1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A picture by Gustave Doré showing Mother Goose, an old woman, reading written (literary) fairy tales to children|A picture by [[Gustave Doré]] of [[Mother Goose]] reading written (literary) fairy tales]]

Originally, stories that would contemporarily be considered fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term "Märchen" stems from the old German word "Mär", which means story or tale. The word "Märchen" is the [[diminutive]] of the word "Mär", therefore it means a "little story". Together with the common beginning "[[once upon a time]]" it means a fairy tale or a märchen was originally a little story from a long time ago when the world was still magic. (Indeed, one less regular German [[once upon a time|opening]] is "In the old times when wishing was still effective".)

The English term "fairy tale" stems from the fact that the French ''contes'' often included fairies.

Roots of the genre come from different oral stories passed down in European cultures. The genre was first marked out by writers of the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]], such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], and stabilized through the works of later collectors such as [[Charles Perrault]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In this evolution, the name was coined when the ''[[précieuses]]'' took up writing literary stories; [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] invented the term ''Conte de fée'', or fairy tale, in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the definition of the genre of [[fantasy]], many works that would now be classified as fantasy were termed "fairy tales", including Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', p. 83, {{ISBN|0253356652}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Tolkien's "On Fairy-Stories" includes discussions of [[world-building]] and is considered a vital part of fantasy criticism. Although fantasy, particularly the subgenre of [[fairytale fantasy]], draws heavily on fairy tale motifs,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; the genres are now regarded as distinct.

===Folk and literary===

The fairy tale, told orally, is a sub-class of the [[folklore|folktale]]. Many writers have written in the form of the fairy tale. These are the literary fairy tales, or ''Kunstmärchen''.&lt;ref name="Windling1"/&gt; The oldest forms, from ''[[Panchatantra]]'' to the ''[[Pentamerone]]'', show considerable reworking from the oral form.&lt;ref name=" Swann Jones, p. 35"&gt;Swann Jones, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brothers Grimm]] were among the first to try to preserve the features of oral tales. Yet the stories printed under the Grimm name have been considerably reworked to fit the written form.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in Matthew's American Literature'', p. 5, {{ISBN|0253356652}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fairy tales and oral fairy tales freely exchanged plots, motifs, and elements with one another and with the tales of foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary fairy tale came into fashion during the 17th century, developed by aristocratic women as a parlour game. This, in turn, helped to maintain the oral tradition. According to [[Jack Zipes]], "The subject matter of the conversations consisted of literature, mores, taste, and etiquette, whereby the speakers all endeavoured to portray ideal situations in the most effective oratorical style that would gradually have a major effect on literary forms."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fairy tale as myth/myth as fairy tale|last=Zipes|first=Jack|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many 18th-century folklorists attempted to recover the "pure" folktale, uncontaminated by literary versions. Yet while oral fairy tales likely existed for thousands of years before the literary forms, there is no pure folktale, and each literary fairy tale draws on folk traditions, if only in parody.&lt;ref name=" Zipes, p. 846"&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it impossible to trace forms of transmission of a fairy tale. Oral story-tellers have been known to read literary fairy tales to increase their own stock of stories and treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Redsun.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Illustration of the Russian fairy tale about Vasilisa the Beautiful, showing a rider on a horse in a forest|[[Ivan Bilibin]]'s illustration of the Russian fairy tale about [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]]]

The [[oral tradition]] of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout literate cultures, as in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', which includes ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' ([[Ancient Rome|Roman]], 100–200 AD),&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/introduction/timeline.html "Fairy Tale Timeline"]&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' ([[Folklore of India|India]] 3rd century BC),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms.&lt;ref name=" Swann Jones, p. 35"/&gt; What they do show is that the fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' collection of magical tales (compiled ''circa'' 1500 AD),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; such as ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]'', and ''[[Bel and the Dragon]]''. Besides such collections and individual tales, in [[Chinese folklore|China]], [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers such as [[Liezi]] and [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] recounted fairy tales in their philosophical works.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Moss Roberts, "Introduction", p. xviii, ''Chinese Fairy Tales &amp; Fantasies''. {{ISBN|0394739949}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader definition of the genre, the first famous Western fairy tales are those of [[Aesop]] (6th century BC) in [[ancient Greece]].

Jack Zipes writes in ''When Dreams Came True'', "There are fairy tale elements in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', and&amp;nbsp;... in many of [[William Shakespeare]] plays."&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Lear]]'' can be considered a literary variant of fairy tales such as ''[[Water and Salt]]'' and ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Soula Mitakidou and Anthony L. Manna, with Melpomene Kanatsouli, ''Folktales from Greece: A Treasury of Delights'', p. 100, Libraries Unlimited, Greenwood Village CO, 2002, {{ISBN|1563089084}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tale itself resurfaced in [[Western literature]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, with ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] (Italy, 1550 and 1553),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; which contains many fairy tales in its inset tales, and the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tales of [[Giambattista Basile]] (Naples, 1634–36),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; which are all fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Gozzi]] made use of many fairy tale motifs among his [[Commedia dell'Arte]] scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140210083152/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archivedate = 2014-02-10 | title = White as Ricotta, Red as Wine: The Magic Lore of Italy | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including among them one based on ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love For Three Oranges]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Pu Songling]], in China, included many fairy tales in his collection, ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' (published posthumously, 1766).&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt; The fairy tale itself became popular among the ''[[précieuses]]'' of upper-class [[Early Modern France|France]] (1690–1710),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and among the tales told in that time were the ones of [[La Fontaine]] and the ''Contes'' of [[Charles Perrault]] (1697), who fixed the forms of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Straparola's, Basile's and Perrault's collections contain the oldest known forms of various fairy tales, on the stylistic evidence, all the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Salon Era===

In the mid-17th century, a vogue for magical tales emerged among the intellectuals who frequented the [[salon (gathering)|salons]] of Paris. These salons were regular gatherings hosted by prominent aristocratic women, where women and men could gather together to discuss the issues of the day.

In the 1630s, aristocratic women began to gather in their own living rooms, salons, in order to discuss the topics of their choice: arts and letters, politics, and social matters of immediate concern to the women of their class: marriage, love, financial and physical independence, and access to education. This was a time when women were barred from receiving a formal education. Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] and [[Madame de Lafayette]]), which encouraged women's independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives. The [[salonnières]] argued particularly for love and intellectual compatibility between the sexes, opposing the system of arranged marriages.

Sometime in the middle of the 17th century, a passion for the conversational [[parlour game]] based on the plots of old [[Folklore|folk tales]] swept through the salons. Each [[salonnière]] was called upon to retell an old tale or rework an old theme, spinning clever new stories that not only showcased verbal agility and imagination but also slyly commented on the conditions of aristocratic life. Great emphasis was placed on a mode of delivery that seemed natural and spontaneous. The decorative language of the fairy tales served an important function: disguising the rebellious subtext of the stories and sliding them past the court censors. Critiques of court life (and even of the king) were embedded in extravagant tales and in dark, sharply dystopian ones. Not surprisingly, the tales by women often featured young (but clever) aristocratic girls whose lives were controlled by the arbitrary whims of fathers, kings, and elderly wicked fairies, as well as tales in which groups of wise fairies (i.e., intelligent, independent women) stepped in and put all to rights.

The [[salon (gathering)|salon]] tales as they were originally written and published have been preserved in a monumental work called ''[[Le Cabinet des Fées]]'', an enormous collection of stories from the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=Windling1 /&gt;

===Later works===
[[File:The violet fairy book (1906) (14751020284).jpg|thumb|The violet fairy book (1906)]]
The first collectors to attempt to preserve not only the plot and characters of the tale, but also the style in which they were told, was the [[Brothers Grimm]], collecting German fairy tales; ironically, this meant although their first edition (1812 &amp; 1815)&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; remains a treasure for folklorists, they rewrote the tales in later editions to make them more acceptable, which ensured their sales and the later popularity of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such literary forms did not merely draw from the folktale, but also influenced folktales in turn. The Brothers Grimm rejected several tales for their collection, though told orally to them by Germans, because the tales derived from Perrault, and they concluded they were thereby [[French folklore|French]] and not German tales; an oral version of ''[[Bluebeard]]'' was thus rejected, and the tale of ''Little Briar Rose'', clearly related to Perrault's ''[[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', was included only because Jacob Grimm convinced his brother that the figure of [[Brynhildr]], from much earlier [[Norse mythology]], proved that the sleeping princess was authentically [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ronald Murphy, ''The Owl, The Raven, and the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms' Magic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0195151690}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This consideration of whether to keep ''Sleeping Beauty'' reflected a belief common among folklorists of the 19th century: that the folk tradition preserved fairy tales in forms from pre-history except when "contaminated" by such literary forms, leading people to tell inauthentic tales.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The rural, illiterate, and uneducated peasants, if suitably isolated, were the ''folk'' and would tell pure ''folk'' tales.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they regarded fairy tales as a form of fossil, the remnants of a once-perfect tale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]], ''The Classic Fairy Tales'' p. 17. {{ISBN|978-0192115591}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, further research has concluded that fairy tales never had a fixed form, and regardless of literary influence, the tellers constantly altered them for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], p. 22, ''Touch Magic''. {{ISBN|0874835917}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the [[Russia]]n [[Alexander Afanasyev]] (first published in 1866),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; the [[Norway|Norwegians]] [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] (first published in 1845),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; the Romanian [[Petre Ispirescu]] (first published in 1874), the [[England|English]] [[Joseph Jacobs]] (first published in 1890),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected [[Ireland|Irish]] tales (first published in 1890).&lt;ref name=" Zipes, p. 846"/&gt; Ethnographers collected fairy tales throughout the world, finding similar tales in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Australia]]; [[Andrew Lang]] was able to draw on not only the written tales of Europe and Asia, but those collected by ethnographers, to fill his [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|"coloured" fairy books series]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Brown Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/brown.htm "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also encouraged other collectors of fairy tales, as when [[Yei Theodora Ozaki]] created a collection, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'' (1908), after encouragement from Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Yei Theodora Ozaki, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/books/japan/freemanmitford/preface.html "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, writers such as [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[George MacDonald]] continued the tradition of literary fairy tales. Andersen's work sometimes drew on old folktales, but more often deployed fairytale motifs and plots in new tales.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Hans Christian Andersen", pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald incorporated fairytale motifs both in new literary fairy tales, such as ''[[The Light Princess]]'', and in works of the genre that would become [[fantasy]], as in ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' or ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "George MacDonald", p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural transmission==

Two theories of origins, have attempted to explain the common elements in fairy tales found spread over continents. One is that a single point of origin generated any given tale, which then spread over the centuries; the other is that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately in many different origins.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales with very similar plots, characters, and motifs are found spread across many different cultures. Many researchers hold this to be caused by the spread of such tales, as people repeat tales they have heard in foreign lands, although the oral nature makes it impossible to trace the route except by inference.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 845.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorists have attempted to determine the origin by internal evidence, which can not always be clear; [[Joseph Jacobs]], comparing the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] tale ''[[The Ridere of Riddles]]'' with the version collected by the Brothers Grimm, ''[[The Riddle (fairy tale)|The Riddle]]'', noted that in ''The Ridere of Riddles'' one hero ends up [[polygamy|polygamously]] married, which might point to an ancient custom, but in ''The Riddle'', the simpler riddle might argue greater antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More Celtic Fairy Tales''. London: David Nutt, 1894, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreceltic/ridere.html Notes and References]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorists of the "Finnish" (or historical-geographical) school attempted to place fairy tales to their origin, with inconclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes influence, especially within a limited area and time, is clearer, as when considering the influence of Perrault's tales on those collected by the Brothers Grimm. ''Little Briar-Rose'' appears to stem from Perrault's ''The [[Sleeping Beauty]]'', as the Grimms' tale appears to be the only independent German variant.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the close agreement between the opening of the Grimms' version of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and Perrault's tale points to an influence, although the Grimms' version adds a different ending (perhaps derived from ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Velten, pp. 966–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted because it contradicts what is in the Cinderella article (see "Chinese or Egyptian origin for Cinderella?" in talk page): "Occasionally, internal evidence points towards one source; not only is [[Duan Chengshi]]'s ''[[Ye Xian]]'' the oldest known variant of ''Cinderella'', but the value the tale places on small feet points to its being the origin of the others, reflecting the importance of tiny feet (causing the practice of [[footbinding]]) in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Windling, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forashs.html "Cinderella: Ashes, Blood, and the Slipper of Glass"]&lt;/ref&gt;"--&gt;

Fairy tales tend to take on the color of their location, through the choice of motifs, the style in which they are told, and the depiction of character and local color.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Grimm believed that European fairy tales derived from the cultural history shared by all [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples and were therefore ancient, far older than written records. This view is supported by research by the [[anthropologist]] Jamie Tehrani and the folklorist Sara Graca Da Silva using [[cladistics|phylogenetic analysis]], a technique developed by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] to trace the relatedness of living and fossil [[species]]. Among the tales analysed were ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', traced to the time of splitting of Eastern and Western Indo-European, over 5000 years ago. Both ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'' appear to have been created some 4000 years ago. The story of ''The Smith and the Devil'' ([[Deal with the Devil]]) appears to date from the [[Bronze Age]], some 6000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35358487|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 January 2016|date=20 January 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with children==

[[File:Cutlery for children detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Spoons for children;engraved on them are fairy tale scenes from "Snow White", "Little Red Riding Hood", and "Hansel and Gretel".|Cutlery for children. Detail showing fairy-tale scenes: [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]

Originally, adults were the audience of a fairy tale just as often as children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary fairy tales appeared in works intended for adults, but in the 19th and 20th centuries the fairy tale became associated with [[children's literature]].

The ''[[précieuses]]'', including [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], intended their works for adults, but regarded their source as the tales that servants, or other women of lower class, would tell to children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Seifert]], "The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the ''Contes de Fées'' in Late Seventeenth Century France", Jack Zipes, ed., ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a novel of that time, depicting a countess's suitor offering to tell such a tale, has the countess exclaim that she loves fairy tales as if she were still a child.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, p. 915.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the late ''précieuses'', [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] redacted a version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' for children, and it is her tale that is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brothers Grimm titled their collection ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'' and rewrote their tales after complaints that they were not suitable for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, fairy tales were altered so that they could be read to children. The Brothers Grimm concentrated mostly on sexual references;&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapunzel]], in the first edition, revealed the prince's visits by asking why her clothing had grown tight, thus letting the witch deduce that she was pregnant, but in subsequent editions carelessly revealed that it was easier to pull up the prince than the witch.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many respects, violence{{nsmdns}}particularly when punishing villains{{nsmdns}}was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, pp. xlii–xliv.&lt;/ref&gt; Other, later, revisions cut out violence; J.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}Tolkien noted that ''[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]'' often had its [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] stew cut out in a version intended for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The moralizing strain in the [[Victorian era]] altered the classical tales to teach lessons, as when [[George Cruikshank]] rewrote ''Cinderella'' in 1854 to contain [[temperance movement|temperance]] themes. His acquaintance [[Charles Dickens]] protested, "In an utilitarian age, of all other times, it is a matter of grave importance that fairy tales should be respected."&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pp. 181–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva239.html |title=A Transcription of Charles Dickens's "Frauds on the Fairies" (1 October 1853) |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalysts]] such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]], who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts, strongly criticized this expurgation, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48, {{ISBN|0312293801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times. To quote Rebecca Walters (2017, p.&amp;nbsp;56) “Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children’s fears …. and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children’s window of tolerance”. These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Rebecca|date=2017-04-01|title=Fairytales, psychodrama and action methods: ways of helping traumatized children to heal|journal=Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=53–60|doi=10.1007/s11620-017-0381-1|issn=1619-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too. For example, Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales. Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales, especially the color in them, triggered their child's imagination as the read them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsani|first=P.|last2=Psyllidou|first2=S.|last3=Batzios|first3=S.

"An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales". Zurich, New York 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; based on Jung‘s view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung: The Phenomoneology of the Sprit in Fairytales (1948). In: Collected Works, Vol. 9,I, Princeton/Bollingen 1980, par. 432&lt;/ref&gt; That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the “purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes” and “they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form” because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. “In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche”. “The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these”. “I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician’s variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, Marie-Louise (1970), An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales, Zurich, New York: Spring publications, {{ISBN|0882141015}}] 1–2 (chapter 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous people commented on the importance of fairy tales, especially for children. For example, Albert Einstein once showed how important he believed fairy tales were for children’s intelligence in the quote “If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales."&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1427525203&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptation of fairy tales for children continues. [[Walt Disney]]'s influential ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was largely (although certainly not solely) intended for the children's market.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Grant and Clute, "Cinema", p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anime]] ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]'' draws on the fairy tale ''[[Momotarō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Zipes has spent many years working to make the older [[traditional stories]] accessible to modern readers and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric James The Art of Storytelling Show Interview [http://www.artofstorytellingshow.com/2008/06/29/jack-zipes-fairy-tales/ Jack Zipes&amp;nbsp;– Are Fairy tales still useful to Children?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary tales==

===Literary===

[[File:John Bauer 1915.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of three trolls surrounding a princess in a dark area, as adapted from a collection of Swedish fairy tales|[[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]'s illustration of trolls and a princess from a collection of Swedish fairy tales]]

In [[contemporary literature]], many authors have used the form of fairy tales for various reasons, such as examining the [[human condition]] from the simple framework a fairytale provides.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'' and so on!, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors seek to recreate a sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Fairytale", p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers use fairy tale forms for modern issues;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; this can include using the psychological dramas implicit in the story, as when [[Robin McKinley]] retold ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' as the novel ''[[Deerskin (novel)|Deerskin]]'', with emphasis on the abusive treatment the father of the tale dealt to his daughter.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky&gt;{{cite journal | author = Helen Pilinovsky | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325011315/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archivedate = 2014-03-25 | title = Donkeyskin, Deerskin, Allerleirauh: The Reality of the Fairy Tale | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, especially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist simply for comic effect, such as ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales|The Stinky Cheese Man]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]] and ''The ASBO Fairy Tales'' by Chris Pilbeam. A common comic motif is a world where all the fairy tales take place, and the characters are aware of their role in the story,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the film series [[Shrek (film series)|Shrek]].

Other authors may have specific motives, such as [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[feminism|feminist]] reevaluations of predominantly [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] masculine-dominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of the [[damsel in distress]] has been particularly attacked by many feminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure include ''The Paperbag Princess'' by [[Robert Munsch]], a picture book aimed at children in which a princess rescues a prince, and [[Angela Carter]]'s ''The Bloody Chamber'', which retells a number of fairy tales from a female point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angela Carter – The Bloody Chamber And Other Stories|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/rote/CARTER.html|publisher=Angelfire.com|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many contemporary erotic retellings of fairy tales, which explicitly draw upon the original spirit of the tales, and are specifically for adults. Modern retellings focus on exploring the tale through use of the erotic, explicit sexuality, dark and/or comic themes, female empowerment, [[Fetishism|fetish]] and [[BDSM]], multicultural, and heterosexual characters. [[Cleis Press]] has released several fairy tale themed erotic anthologies, including ''Fairy Tale Lust'', ''Lustfully Ever After'', and ''A Princess Bound''.

It may be hard to lay down the rule between fairy tales and [[fairytale fantasy|fantasies]] that use fairy tale motifs, or even whole plots, but the distinction is commonly made, even within the works of a single author: George MacDonald's ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' are regarded as fantasies, while his "[[The Light Princess]]", "[[The Golden Key]]", and "The Wise Woman" are commonly called fairy tales. The most notable distinction is that fairytale fantasies, like other fantasies, make use of [[novelist]]ic writing conventions of prose, characterization, or setting.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', pp. 22–23, {{ISBN|068910846X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Fairy tales have been enacted dramatically; records exist of this in [[commedia dell'arte]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Commedia Dell'Arte", p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Commedia Dell'Arte", p. 745.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[film|cinema]] has meant that such stories could be presented in a more plausible manner, with the use of [[special effects]] and [[animation]]. [[The Walt Disney Company]] has had a significant impact on the evolution of the fairy tale film. Some of the earliest short silent films from the Disney studio were based on fairy tales, and some fairy tales were adapted into shorts in the musical comedy series "[[Silly Symphony]]", such as ''[[Three Little Pigs (1933 film)|Three Little Pigs]]''. [[Walt Disney]]'s first feature-length film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', released in 1937, was a ground-breaking film for fairy tales and, indeed, fantasy in general.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Disney and his creative successors have returned to traditional and literary fairy tales numerous times with films such as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). [[Disney]]'s influence helped establish the fairy tale genre as a genre for children, and has been accused by some of [[bowdlerizing]] the gritty naturalism&amp;nbsp;– and sometimes unhappy endings&amp;nbsp;– of many folk fairy tales.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky /&gt; However, others note that the softening of fairy tales occurred long before Disney, some of which was even done by the Grimm brothers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Kay|year=1981|title=Märchen to Fairy Tale: An Unmagical Transformation|journal=Western Folklore|volume=40|issue=3|pages=232–44|doi=10.2307/1499694|jstor=1499694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, M.|year=1987|title=The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=24|isbn=978-0691067223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filmed fairy tales have been made primarily for children, from Disney's later works to Aleksandr Rou's retelling of ''[[Vasilissa the Beautiful]]'', the first [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet film]] to use Russian folk tales in a big-budget feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = James Graham | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archivedate = 2013-01-09 | title = Baba Yaga in Film | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used the conventions of fairy tales to create new stories with sentiments more relevant to contemporary life, as in ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scheib, [http://www.moria.co.nz/fantasy/labyrinth-1986.htm Review of ''Labyrinth'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', and the films of [[Michel Ocelot]].&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works have retold familiar fairy tales in a darker, more horrific or psychological variant aimed primarily at adults. Notable examples are [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115234313/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archivedate = 2013-11-15 | title = Beauty and the Beast | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', based on [[Angela Carter]]'s retelling of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130920005533/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archivedate = 2013-09-20 | title = The Path of Needles or Pins: Little Red Riding Hood | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html|title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-07-14|date=2006-12-25 |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]|last=Spelling|first=Ian| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707173614/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html| archivedate = July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Suspiria]]'', and ''[[Spike (2008 film)|Spike]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://variety.com/2008/film/news/festival-highlights-1117987482/ | title = Festival Highlights: 2008 Edinburgh International Film Festival | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2008-06-13 | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; create new stories in this genre from fairy tale and folklore motifs.

In comics and animated TV series, ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[Princess Tutu]]'', ''[[Fables (Vertigo)|Fables]]'' and ''[[MÄR]]'' all make use of standard fairy tale elements to various extents but are more accurately categorised as [[fairytale fantasy]] due to the definite locations and characters which a longer narrative requires.

A more modern cinematic fairy tale would be [[Luchino Visconti|Luchino Visconti's]] ''[[Le Notti Bianche]]'', starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before he became a superstar. It involves many of the romantic conventions of fairy tales, yet it takes place in post-[[World War II]] [[Italy]], and it ends realistically.

==Motifs==

Any comparison of fairy tales quickly discovers that many fairy tales have features in common with each other. Two of the most influential classifications are those of [[Antti Aarne]], as revised by [[Stith Thompson]] into the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]], and [[Vladimir Propp]]'s ''[[Morphology of the Folk Tale]]''.

===Aarne-Thompson===

This system groups fairy and folk tales according to their overall plot. Common, identifying features are picked out to decide which tales are grouped together. Much therefore depends on what features are regarded as decisive.

For instance, tales like ''[[Cinderella]]''&amp;nbsp;– in which a persecuted heroine, with the help of the [[fairy godmother]] or similar [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helper]], attends an event (or three) in which she wins the love of a prince and is identified as his true bride{{nsmdns}}are classified as type 510, the persecuted heroine. Some such tales are ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; ''[[Aschenputtel]]''; ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]''; ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]''; ''[[Ye Xian]]''; ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''; ''[[Catskin]]''; ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]''; ''[[Finette Cendron]]''; ''[[Allerleirauh]]''.

Further analysis of the tales shows that in ''Cinderella'', ''The Wonderful Birch'', ''The Story of Tam and Cam'', ''Ye Xian'', and ''Aschenputtel'', the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission to go to the ball or other event, and in ''Fair, Brown and Trembling'' and ''Finette Cendron'' by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in ''Cap O' Rushes'', ''Catskin'', and ''Allerleirauh'', the heroine is driven from home by her father's persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in ''Katie Woodencloak'', she is driven from home by her stepmother's persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in ''Tattercoats'', she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, ''Katie Woodencloak'' is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and ''Tattercoats'' as 510B because the grandfather fills the father's role.

This system has its weaknesses in the difficulty of having no way to classify subportions of a tale as motifs. ''[[Rapunzel]]'' is type 310 (The Maiden in the Tower), but it opens with a child being demanded in return for stolen food, as does ''[[Puddocky]]''; but ''Puddocky'' is not a Maiden in the Tower tale, while ''[[The Canary Prince]]'', which opens with a jealous stepmother, is.

It also lends itself to emphasis on the common elements, to the extent that the folklorist describes ''[[The Black Bull of Norroway]]'' as the same story as ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. This can be useful as a shorthand but can also erase the coloring and details of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===

[[File:1932. Билибин. Морозко.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Father Frost, a fairy tale character made of ice, acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale "Father Frost". He tests the heroine, a veiled young girl sitting in the snow, before bestowing riches upon her.|Father Frost acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', testing the heroine before bestowing riches upon her]]

[[Vladimir Propp]] specifically studied a collection of [[Russian fairy tale]]s, but his analysis has been found useful for the tales of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''.&lt;/ref&gt; Having criticized Aarne-Thompson type analysis for ignoring what motifs ''did'' in stories, and because the motifs used were not clearly distinct,&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; he analyzed the tales for the ''function'' each character and action fulfilled and concluded that a tale was composed of thirty-one elements ('functions') and seven characters or 'spheres of action' ('the princess and her father' are a single sphere). While the elements were not all required for all tales, when they appeared they did so in an invariant order&amp;nbsp;– except that each individual element might be negated twice, so that it would appear [[rule of three (writing)|three times]], as when, in ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', the brother resists drinking from enchanted streams twice, so that it is the third that enchants him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Propp's 31 functions also fall within six 'stages' (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition), and a stage can also be repeated, which can affect the perceived order of elements.

One such element is the ''[[donor (fairy tale)|donor]]'' who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking [[fox]] tests the hero by warning him against entering an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find the object of his quest; in ''[[The Boy Who Drew Cats]]'', the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in ''[[Cinderella]]'', the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; in ''[[The Fox Sister]]'', a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk gives the brothers magical bottles to protect against the [[Huli jing|fox spirit]]. The roles can be more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Red Ettin]]'', the role is split into the mother{{nsmdns}}who offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessing{{nsmdns}}and when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in ''[[Mr Simigdáli]]'', the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kallo and the Goblins]]'', the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in ''[[Schippeitaro]]'', the evil [[cat]]s betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'', do not feature the donor.

Analogies have been drawn between this and the analysis of myths into the [[Monomyth|Hero's journey]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Vogler, ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers'', 2nd edition, p. 30, {{ISBN|0941188701}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

Many fairy tales have been interpreted for their (purported) significance. One mythological interpretation saw many fairy tales, including ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog King]]'', as [[solar deity|solar myths]]; this mode of interpretation subsequently became rather less popular.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychoanalysis|Freudian]], [[analytical psychology|Jungian]], and other [[psychology|psychological]] analyses have also explicated many tales, but no mode of interpretation has established itself definitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bettleheim Bruno|title= The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales |publisher= Penguin|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0140137279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific analyses have often been criticized{{by whom|date=May 2016}} for lending great importance to motifs that are not, in fact, integral to the tale; this has often stemmed from treating one instance of a fairy tale as the definitive text, where the tale has been told and retold in many variations.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, "Interpreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically", pp. 18–19, James M. McGlathery, ed., ''The Brothers Grimm and Folktale'', {{ISBN|0252015495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants of ''[[Bluebeard]]'', the wife's curiosity is betrayed by [[Bluebeard|a blood-stained key]], by [[Fitcher's Bird|an egg's breaking]], or by [[How the Devil Married Three Sisters|the singing of a rose she wore]], without affecting the tale, but interpretations of specific variants have claimed that the precise object is integral to the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other folklorists have interpreted tales as historical documents. Many{{quantify|date=May 2016}} German folklorists, believing the tales to have preserved details from ancient times, have used the Grimms' tales to explain ancient customs.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach sees the topography of European Märchen as echoing the period immediately following the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = As the glaciers of the last ice age retreated (from c. 10,000 BC) forests, of various types, quickly colonised the land and came to cover most of Europe. [...] These forests formed the topography out of which the fairy stories (or as they are better called in German – the ''marchen''), which are one of our earliest and most vital cultural forms, evolved.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Other folklorists have explained the figure of the wicked stepmother in a historical/sociological context: many women did die in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p. 213. {{ISBN|0374159017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 lecture, [[Jack Zipes]] reads fairy tales as examples of what he calls "childism". He suggests that there are terrible aspects to the tales, which (among other things) have conditioned children to accept mistreatment and even abuse.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fairy tales in music ==
Fairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French [[Opéra féerie]] and the German [[Märchenoper]]. French examples include Gretry's ''[[Zémire et Azor]]'', and Auber's ''[[Le cheval de bronze]]'', German operas are Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', Siegfried Wagner's ''[[An allem ist Hütchen schuld!]]'', which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff's ''[[Die Kluge]]''. Even contemporary fairy tales have been written for the purpose of inspiration in the music world. "Raven Girl" by [[Audrey Niffenegger]] was written to inspire a new dance for the Royal Ballet in London.

'''''First Love''''' ({{lang-ru|Первая любовь}}, ''Pervaya ljubov'') is a [[novella]] by [[Ivan Turgenev]], first published in 1860. It is one of his most popular pieces of short fiction. It tells the love story between a 21-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy.

==Background to the work==
''First Love'' was published in March 1860 in the ''[[Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya|Reader's Library]]''. Like many of Turgenev's works, this one is highly autobiographical. Indeed, the author claimed it was the most autobiographical of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack, David. 1954. ''Turgenev: a Life.'' London: Faber and Faber, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Turgenev is retelling an incident from his own life, his infatuation with a young neighbor in the country, Catherine Shakovskoy (the Zinaida of the novella), an infatuation that lasted until his discovery that Catherine was in fact his own father's mistress.

Critics were divided. Some criticized its light subject matter that did not touch upon any of the pressing social and political issues of the day. Others condemned the impropriety of that subject matter, namely a father and son in love with the same woman and a young woman who was the mistress of a married man. But it had its many admirers, including the French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]], who gushed in [[Flaubert's letters|a letter]] to Turgenev, "What an exciting girl that Zinochka [Zinaida] is!"&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The Countess Lambert, a close acquaintance of Turgenev, told the author that the [[Alexander III of Russia|Russian emperor]] himself had read the novella to the empress and been delighted by it.&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, Henri. 1988. ''Turgenev'' (New York: Dutton), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central characters==

'''Vladimir Petrovich''' – The storyteller, at the time of narration a 16-year-old boy; the protagonist of the story.

'''Zinaida Alexandrovna Zasyekina''' – The object of Vladimir's affections. Capricious, mocking and difficult, she is inconsistent in her affections towards her suitors, of which Vladimir is the one to whom she shows (outwardly) the most affection. However, it is the affection of sister to brother rather than between lovers.

'''Pyotr Vasilyevich''' – Vladimir's father, a stoic symbol of 19th century masculinity; very 'British' in outlook and apparently unreceptive to emotion but the object of quiet admiration by the son

[[File:CDC Graphic Artists at Work.jpg|right|thumb|Graphic artists at work during the 1960s]]
A category of [[fine art]], '''graphic art''' covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-art Graphic art]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Britannica.com. Retrieved 2016-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially [[drawing]] and the various forms of [[engraving]];&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;"Graphic art." ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. 3rd ed.  Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to [[printmaking]] processes,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; such as [[line engraving]],  [[aquatint]], [[drypoint]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[monotyping|monotype]], [[lithography]], and [[screen printing]] (silk-screen, serigraphy).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph (1992). "Graphic arts, or graphics." ''The HarperCollins Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques''. 2nd ed. Revised and edited by Steven Sheehan. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphic art further includes [[calligraphy]], [[photography]], [[painting]], [[typography]], [[computer graphics]], and [[bindery]]. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

==History==
Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as [[hieroglyphics]]. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.&lt;ref name="Meggs"&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip B.|last=Meggs|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design |title=Graphic design|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, scribes [[scriptorium|manually copied]] each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to [[illuminated manuscript|insert drawings and decorations]]. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"&gt;McGuire-Lyle, Erin.  ''Careers in the Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics'' (Career Resource Library). June 2000. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the [[printing press]] in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.

Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on [[typeface]].

Due to the development of larger fonts during the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[posters]] became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.

The invention and popularity of [[film]] and [[television]] changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.

The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal [[computer]] was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.&lt;ref name="Meggs"/&gt;

The scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.

== Graphic design software ==
{{off topic|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Vacation Rentals In Hawaii Image.jpg|thumb|Example of graphic arts created with the free tool, Paint.net.]]
Graphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.

Graphic art software includes applications such as:
*[[Adobe Dreamweaver]] – a tool that facilitates the creation of webpages and dynamic internet content
*[[Adobe Illustrator]] – an application that allows artists to manipulate vector graphics
*[[Adobe InDesign]] – desktop publishing software used for layout and design manipulation
*[[Adobe Photoshop]] – a bitmap graphics software including powerful graphics editing tools that provide a large variety of editing functionality
*[[CorelDRAW]] – similar to Adobe Illustrator, it is another vector graphic manipulation tool
*[[PhotoImpact]] – a digital photograph editor
*[[QuarkXPress]] – similar to Adobe InDesign, it is another computer publishing software tool

===Free software===
*[[Paint.net]] – photograph editing capabilities with lots of plugins to expand use
*[[GIMP]] – similar to paint.net and Photoshop
*[[Inkscape]] – similar to Illustrator

Beside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt;

== Careers ==
{{howto|date=October 2013}}
One of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the [[World Wide Web]], the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and [[logos]] to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt; The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.

The '''Handboogdoelen''' ("longbowmen's shooting range") is a building on the [[Singel]] canal in [[Amsterdam]], near [[Koningsplein]] square. It dates back to the early 16th century and originally served as headquarters and [[shooting range]] of the local ''[[schutterij]]'' (civic guard). Most of the current building at Singel 421 dates to the 18th century and is part of the main complex of the [[Amsterdam University Library]]. The Doelenzaal hall on the ground floor of the building (not to be confused with the Doelenzaal on [[Kloveniersburgwal]] canal) is used for lectures, meetings, receptions and [[thesis|doctoral dissertations]]. The building has ''[[rijksmonument]]'' status.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305070118/https://www.monumenten.nl/monument/5095 "Singel 421, Amsterdam", Monumenten.nl] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Shooting range ===
The Handboogdoelen, also known as the  ''Garnalendoelen'', ''Grote Doelen'' or ''St. Sebastiaansdoelen'' (after the patron saint of [[archers]], [[Saint Sebastian]]) was one of three ''doelens'' (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam ''schutterij'' (civic guard). The other two shooting ranges were the [[Voetboogdoelen, Amsterdam|Voetboogdoelen]] and [[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]], located along the [[Singel]] and [[Kloveniersburgwal]] canals respectively. The Handboogdoelen civic guard was armed with [[longbow]]s, while the Voetboogdoelen civic guard wielded [[crossbow]]s and the Kloveniersdoelen civic guard used an early type of [[musket]], the [[arquebus]]. The headquarters of the Handboogdoelen was the largest and grandest of the three.&lt;ref name=fontaineverwey&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140822135314/http://dbnl.org/tekst/_boe022198601_01/_boe022198601_01_0002.php H. de la Fontaine Verwey, "Herinneringen van een bibliothecaris'", ''De boekenwereld'', Jaargang 3. Uitgeverij Matrijs, Utrecht, 1986-1987] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handboogdoelen was established shortly before 1500 as the  shooting range for the ''handboogschutterij'' (longbowmen's civic guard), and the associated building was completed around 1512. Like the adjacent Voetboogdoelen (established in 1458), the shooting range extended from the Singel canal to the back side of the houses on [[Kalverstraat]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170312071432/http://rijksmonumenten.nl/monument/5246/voormalige-st-sebastiaans--of-handboogdoelen-met-voorgevel/amsterdam/ "Voormalige St. Sebastiaans- of Handboogdoelen met voorgevel in Amsterdam", Rijksmonumenten.nl] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amsterdam.nl/publish/pages/561386/aar_75_hei1.pdf "Heiligeweg 32", Amsterdam Archeologische Rapporten, Gemeente Amsterdam Bureau Monumenten &amp; Archeologie, 2013] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

Amsterdam's militia [[guild]]s were formed in the [[Middle Ages]] to defend the city against attack. Around 1580, at the behest of [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], these Medieval guilds were incorporated into a new, much larger civic guard to defend the [[Alteratie|newly Protestant]] city  against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] during the [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch revolt]] which ultimately led to a full-blown war of independence, the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Officers of this new civic guard were recruited from the well-to-do of Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160425014321/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-378 "The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw, Cornelis Ketel, 1588", Rijksmuseum] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Handboogdoelen was used by the civic guard from about 1509. In 1533, two [[bay window]]s were added to the building, the first known examples of bay windows in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150110035309/http://www.amsterdamsebinnenstad.nl/binnenstad/223/oogvoordetail.html Theo Rouwhorst, "Erkers", ''Binnenstad'' 223/224, Oct. 2007] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting range lay behind the building, stretching north towards the [[Kalverstraat]]. A small gate provided access to the shooting range. This gate, dating to about 1650, is still in existence and is now located on Handboogstraat, a small street running behind the building. The gate features [[Doric order|Doric]] [[column]]s and depicts [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]] and [[quiver]]s.

In the mid-17th century, the Eighty Years' War ended and the civic guard no longer served a military purpose. The civic guard continued to exist, but membership became an honorary position and the ''doelens'' assumed a primarily social function. The wealthiest and most powerful citizens of [[Dutch Golden Age]] Amsterdam came together in the ''doelens'' to eat, drink and smoke. In 1650 the city gave permission for houses to be built on the former shooting ranges of the Hand- and Voetboogdoelen. For these houses, two new streets were constructed: the Handboogstraat and Voetboogstraat.&lt;ref name=fontaineverwey /&gt;

===Inn and hotel===
In the 17th century, the building was also in use as lodgings for prominent visitors to Amsterdam. Its role as shooting range and headquarters of the civic guard ended in 1672, when the building was rented out to an innkeeper. In the late 17th century, the inn was expanded with additional rooms and halls by adding another floor to the building and connecting it to the adjacent house. A new facade was added to the building in 1733, depicting the coat of arms of the city of Amsterdam at the top, as well as five smaller coats of arms between the windows below: the coat of arms of the civic guard and those of four ''overlieden'' (directors) of the civic guard, including [[Frans Banning Cocq]], who features as the central figure in Rembrandt's ''[[The Night Watch]]''.

The building served as a meeting place for the radical political faction of the ''[[Patriottentijd|Patriotten]]'' in the late 18th century. For instance, a large feast was held in the banqueting hall in 1786 to celebrate a Dutch alliance with [[Kingdom of France|France]]. In the 19th century, the inn transformed into a well-respected hotel, known as Hotel de Garnalen Doelen.

===University library===
In 1860, the city of Amsterdam offered the building to the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam|Athenaeum Illustre]], the predecessor of the [[University of Amsterdam]]. The city library, predecessor of the [[Amsterdam University Library]], moved there around 1881 from the [[Agnietenkapel]], as this chapel had become to small and derelict to house the library. The Handboogdoelen remains part of the main university library complex to this day. In the 20th century, the adjacent buildings were added to the library complex.

Physicist [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] established his first laboratory in the building. He remained there until about 1883, when his laboratory was moved to a new building on Plantage Muidergracht canal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305074830/https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.deboer/master/websites/history.php A.J. Kox,"Honderdvijfentwintig jaar theoretische natuurkunde in Amsterdam", University of Amsterdam] (Dutch, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1968 restoration uncovered the original 16th-century building, revealing that it may contain the city's oldest remaining masonry work and the only remaining late-Medieval [[Fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]].

== Painting ==

Members of the civic guard, drawn from the well-to-do of Amsterdam, frequently commissioned group portraits of themselves, which were hung in the ''doelens''. For instance, [[Jan Tengnagel]] in 1613 painted a ''rot'' (section) of 17 members of the ''handboogschutterij'' (longbowmens' civic guard) under the command of [[Geurt van Beuningen]]. This painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]]. Around 1653, [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]] portraited the ''overlieden'' (directors) of the longbowmens' civic guard. This painting is now in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. 

[[Jan Weenix]] painted a wall covering for the Handboogdoelen depicting a hunting scene. The painting is now on display in the [[Mauritshuis]] museum in [[The Hague]]. [[Rembrandt]] sketched the front facade of the Handboogdoelen.

The Handboogdoelen was one of three ''doelens'' (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam civic guard, alongside the [[Voetboogdoelen, Amsterdam|Voetboogdoelen]] and [[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]], which were located along [[Heiligeweg]] and [[Kloveniersburgwal]] canal respectively.

The Dutch towns of [[Middelburg]] and [[Goes]] also had a Handboogdoelen for their civic guards of longbowmen.

'''''In Time of Peril''''' is a painting by the English painter [[Edmund Leighton]].  The subject does not appear to represent any specific historical subject, but an invented incident from the [[Middle Ages]] where a young boy and a baby are in flight with their mother, a soldier or father, and chests and bundles of treasures, and arrive at a monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/explore-art-and-ideas/artwork/11478/in-time-of-peril Auckland Art Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/in-time-of-peril/9gF4Die6xd2HeQ&lt;/ref&gt;

''In Time of Peril'' was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] Exhibition of 1897. It was later bought by the Mackelvie Trust, and placed in the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], where it quickly became one of the most popular pictures in the Gallery, copied by generations of Auckland's art students. As with many other art galleries in Australia and New Zealand founded in the later nineteenth century, Auckland's collection is particularly rich in late Victorian and Edwardian academic paintings.&lt;ref&gt;http://karmapolice92.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Keep Portland Weird'''" is a popular [[slogan]] that appears on bumper stickers, signs, and public buildings throughout [[Portland, Oregon]] and its surrounding metro area. It originated from the "[[Keep Austin Weird]]" slogan and was originally intended to promote [[Small business|local businesses]], though it has since evolved into an all-encompassing slogan that secondarily promotes individuality, expressionism, local art, as well as atypical lifestyle choices and leisure activities.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepportlandweird.com/index.html |title=Keep Portland Weird |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831055906/http://www.keepportlandweird.com/index.html |archivedate=August 31, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan frequently inspires articles and debate that attempt to quantify the exact level to which Portland is considered [[wikt:weird|weird]], unusual or eccentric.

The slogan has been called the unofficial motto of Portland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Craft Beers of the Pacific Northwest: A Beer Lover's Guide to Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia |isbn= 1-60469-089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Washington, Oregon &amp; the Pacific Northwest |isbn= 1-74059-534-3 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[San Diego Magazine]] |volume=62}}{{Incomplete citation|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the informal [[mantra]] of the city's residents.&lt;ref name="Samson2010"&gt;{{cite book |first= Karl |last= Samson |title= Frommer's Oregon  |year=2011 |publisher=Frommer's |isbn= 978-0-470-53771-8 |page= 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the slogan was adopted by first European city - Brno, Czech republic, in a spinoff - "Udržujte Brno divné" ("Keep Brno weird" in English).

==History==
The slogan was created with the intention of supporting local businesses and small business owners.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; It was based on the [[Keep Austin Weird]] organization and slogan in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], and was brought to Portland in 2003&lt;ref name=WW-2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Marty|title=Dr. Know: Whence the Weird?|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-16538-dr_know_whence_the_weird.html|accessdate=November 17, 2013|newspaper=[[Willamette Week]]|date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[Music Millennium]] owner Terry Currier after he learned of the movement in Austin.&lt;ref name=oregonian-2007oct&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffin|first=Anna|title='Keep Portland Weird'?

==Weirdness==
[[File:Portland Urban Iditarod 2008 - cavemen.png|thumb|right|Contestants in the Portland Urban Iditarod]]
In 2014 an Austin blog put together an infographic that compared Austin and Portland in a series of categories to try to decide which city was "weirder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sparefoot.com/self-storage/blog/5625-portland-vs-austin-weird-infographic/|title=Portland vs. Austin - Which is the Weirdest?|publisher=[[SpareFoot]]|date=March 14, 2014|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve different categories were used, including "Most Tattooed US Cities" and "America's Craziest Cities". From this comparison, Portland was the clear winner taking first in nine of the twelve categories.

''[[The Oregonian]]'' newspaper developed a weirdness scale in response to the slogan and Portland ranked 11th, with high rates of hiking, hunting, and hybrid car ownership. The most "normal" cities in the U.S. were in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and [[Salt Lake City]] and [[San Francisco]] were among the weirdest.&lt;ref name="jobs"/&gt; In comparing Portland to New York City and San Francisco, [[Lonely Planet]] writer Becky Ohlsen said "Something about how cheap and isolated Portland is, allows oddballs to explore odd behavior without being squished by economics or the harsh judgment of fashion people."&lt;ref name="quaint"/&gt;

Items mentioned as illustrating the residents' eccentricities include the [[Voodoo Doughnut]] shop, the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], the [[Zoobomb]] cycling events, artist [[Adam Kuby]]’s (now removed) Portland Acupuncture Project, the popularity of [[yarn bombing]], the [[Portland Urban Iditarod]], and the now-defunct [[Velveteria|Velveteria Museum of Velvet Paintings]] and [[24 Hour Church of Elvis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2008-05-12-quirky-portland_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 12, 2008|title=Portland, Ore., celebrates its quirky side|accessdate=January 12, 2015|first=Joseph B.|last=Frazier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?a=298163&amp;c=50730 |title=Portland Artist Adam Kuby Installs Giant Acupuncture Needles to Help Kick Off Phase II of the Portland Plan |publisher=City of Portland |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/02/05/us-yarn-bombers-idUKTRE71427O20110205 |publisher=[[Reuters]] UK |title=Oregon "yarn bombers" knit graffiti for lamp posts, trees |date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katu.com/news/41451542.html |publisher=[[KATU]] |title='Urban Iditarod' keeps Portland weird |accessdate=2011-08-25 |date=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210083612/http://www.katu.com/news/41451542.html |archivedate=February 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is the [[Horse rings in Portland, Oregon#Horse Project|"Horse Project"]].&lt;ref name=oregonian-2007oct/&gt;  The first "Keep Portland Weird festival" was held in October 2007 at the [[Central Library (Portland, Oregon)|Central Library]], and among the participants were the Portland [[Ukulele]] Association, [[Free Geek]], and the Portland Area Robotics Society.&lt;ref name=oregonian-2007oct/&gt; Another took place in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMullen|first=Peggy|title=Knitting events coming up in the next few days|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/knitting/2009/11/kniting_events_coming_up_in_th.html|accessdate=November 17, 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland's [[city commission government]]—a type of municipal governance now rare in the U.S.—has been described as another aspect of its weirdness, compounded by the various peculiarities of its implementation.&lt;ref name="Svara2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=James H. |last=Svara |title=More Than Mayor or Manager: Campaigns to Change Form of Government in America's Large Cities |date= December 15, 2010 |publisher=[[Georgetown University Press]] |isbn=978-1-58901-709-2 |page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The slogan "Keep Portland Weird" has created controversy and been imitated with slogans such as "Keep Portland Beered" and others.&lt;ref name="jobs"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cortright|first=Joe|url= http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2010/02/keep_portland_weird_makes_sens.html |title= 'Keep Portland Weird' makes sense as a jobs strategy |newspaper= [[The Oregonian]] |date= February 13, 2010 |accessdate=  January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also suggested is that Portland might not have been originally weird, but the campaign leads to a new weirdness among some Portlanders. Not all citizens view the campaign in a positive light.  Some have advanced the idea that Portland's weirdness is an excuse for the younger generation to be underachievers. Also some citizens claim that the intended effect of the campaign—economic stimulation for local businesses—has not achieved the desired results.&lt;ref name="quaint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jobs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portlandor.about.com/b/2006/10/04/keep-portland-weird.htm Keep Portland Weird], by Nancy Levenson, About.com Guide, October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, the "Keep Portland Weird" slogan was used in a debate about Portland's refusal to join the federal government's [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]]. Portland originally opted out of the task force in 2005 over concerns for civil liberties. Recent potential threats have prompted local officials to reconsider joining the task force. Those opposed to joining the task force adopted the "Keep Portland Weird" slogan to point out that Portland was different from other cities and should continue to opt out of the task force and not join with other government forces. Opposing citizens felt joining the task force could have potentially affected Portland's traditionally progressive stance on civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Public Voices Concerns About Joining Terrorism Task Force, April Baer, January 14, 2011, Portland, Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/03/jttf_debate_captures_portlands.html Joint Terrorism Task Force debate captures Portland's idiosyncratic attitude], March 11, 2011, Brad Schmidt, The Oregonian.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/jttfreview/ |accessdate=August 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513145607/http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/jttfreview/ |archivedate=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kneeling Camels''''' is a [[public art]] work by [[Paul Moulon]] located at front entrance of the [[Tripoli Shrine Temple]], a civic organization in the [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|Concordia neighborhood]] west of downtown [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The work consists of two large camels carved from stone.&lt;ref name=Daniel&gt;{{cite web|last=Biondich|first=Sarah|title=The Tripoli Mosque: Milwaukee's Taj Mahal|url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-8238-the-tripoli-mosque.html|work=Express Milwaukee|publisher=Shepherd Express|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two sculptures were installed in 1928 at a cost of $10,000.&lt;ref name="SIRIS-Kneeling Camels (sculpture)"&gt;{{cite web

==Description==
The camels flank the stairway entrance to the Tripoli Shrine Temple on West Wisconsin Avenue. The carving on each camel includes details such as reins and saddle, both with tassel decoration. Temple business administrator George Vignyvich told the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', that the camels are "one of the symbols used by the Shrine. Other Tripoli shrines use live camels. We use concrete ones."&lt;ref name=Loohaus&gt;{{cite news|last=Loohaus|first=Jackie|title=Eccentric and All Ours: 10 Oddball and Totally Milwaukee Tales|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==
The camels were commissioned by Louis Kuehn, a Shrine leader and founder of the Milwaukee Corrugating Company, the largest sheet metal company in the Midwest, and an organizer of the Milwaukee Rolling Mill. Kuehn arranged the commission while traveling in Europe.&lt;ref name="SIRIS-Kneeling Camels (sculpture)" /&gt;

==Reception==
The camels are popular among visitors, many of whom attempt to climb on top of them for photo opportunities.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Andrea|title=Local 'Shriners' Gather for Fun and Philanthropy|url=http://marquettetribune.com/2012/02/16/news/tripoli-local-shriners-gather-for-fun-and-philanthropy/|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=Marquette Tribune|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] volunteers conducting a condition survey for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] urgently recommended treatment for the sculptures in 1997.&lt;ref name="SIRIS-Kneeling Camels (sculpture)" /&gt;

'''''Lady Lilith''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] first painted in 1866–68 using his mistress [[Fanny Cornforth]] as the model, then altered in 1872–73 to show the face of [[Alexa Wilding]].&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt; The subject is [[Lilith]], who was, according to ancient [[Judaic]] myth, "the first wife of [[Adam]]" and is associated with the seduction of men and the [[child murder|murder of children]]. She is shown as a "powerful and evil temptress" and as "an iconic, [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like female with long, flowing hair."&lt;ref name="DAM"&gt;[http://www.delart.org/collections/preraph/lady_lilith.html Delaware Art Museum, ''Lady Lilith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233622/http://www.delart.org/collections/preraph/lady_lilith.html |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Rossetti overpainted Cornforth's face, perhaps at the suggestion of his client, shipping magnate [[Frederick Richards Leyland]], who displayed the painting in his drawing room with five other Rossetti "stunners."&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Leyland's death, the painting was purchased by [[Samuel Bancroft]] and Bancroft's estate donated it in 1935 to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] where it is now displayed.

The painting forms a pair with ''Sibylla Palmifera'', painted 1866–70, also with Wilding as the model.  ''Lady Lilith'' represents the body's beauty, according to Rossetti's sonnet inscribed on the frame.  ''Sibylla Palmifera'' represents the soul's beauty, according to the Rossetti sonnet on its frame.

A large 1867 replica of ''Lady Lilith'', painted by Rossetti in [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], which shows the face of Cornforth, is now owned by New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. It has a verse from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' as translated by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] on a label attached by Rossetti to its frame:

{{Quotation|"Beware of her fair hair, for she excells&lt;!--excells in original--&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All women in the magic of her locks,&lt;br/&gt;And when she twines them round a young man's neck&lt;br/&gt;she will not ever set him free again."&lt;ref name="met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/08.162.1 "Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Lady Lilith (08.162.1)"]. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.  (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Painting==
On 9 April 1866 Rossetti wrote to Frederick Leyland: 
{{Quote|As you continue to express a wish to have a good picture of mine, I write you word of another I have now begun, which will be one of my best.  The picture represents a lady combing her hair.  It is the same size as ''Palmifera'' – 36 x 31 inches, and will be full of material, – a landscape seen in the background.  Its color chiefly white and silver, with a great mass of golden hair.&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Lady Lilith'' was commissioned by Leyland in early 1866 and delivered to him in early 1869 at a price of £472. 10 s.  
Two studies, dated to 1866, exist for the work, but two notebook sketches may be from an earlier date. The painting focuses on Lilith, but is meant to be a "Modern Lilith" rather than the mythological figure. She contemplates her own beauty in her hand-mirror. The painting is one of a series of Rossetti paintings of such "mirror pictures." Other painters soon followed with their own mirror pictures with narcissistic female figures, but ''Lady Lilith'' has been considered "the epitome" of the type.&lt;ref name="F and W"&gt;{{cite web

Rossetti's assistant, [[Henry Treffry Dunn]], states that the final part painted was the flowery background. He and G. P. Boyce gathered large baskets of white roses from  [[John Ruskin]]'s garden in [[Denmark Hill]], and returned with them to Rossetti's house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. Dunn is thought to have later recreated Rossetti's picture of Lady Lilith in coloured chalk.&lt;ref name=dunn&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Treffry Dunn – Past Auction Results|url=http://www.artnet.com/Artists/LotDetailPage.aspx?lot_id=0F957DD0E84DA61A628844E360BFD8D7 |publisher=Artnet|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sources disagree on whether Leyland or Rossetti initiated the repainting,&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt; but the major change was the substitution of Alexa Wilding's face for Cornforth's.  The painting was returned to Rossetti in February 1872, and he completed the repainting on 2 December at [[Kelmscott Manor]] before returning it to Leyland.&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; Alexa was born Alice Wilding and was about 27 years old at the time of the repainting.  Rossetti paid her a retainer of £1 per week for modelling. Wilding's face had earlier replaced the face in another painting ''Venus Verticordia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s173.rap.html Venus Verticordia, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1864-8], Rossetti Archive, Retrieved 18 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Rossetti's record of serial liaisons with his models, there is little or no evidence of a romantic attachment between Wilding and Rossetti.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jennifer J.|title=VENUS IMAGINARIA: REFLECTIONS ON ALEXA WILDING, HER LIFE, AND HER ROLE AS MUSE IN THE WORKS OF DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI p.26b and 31|journal=M.A. Dissertation |year=2006 |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/6646/1/umi-umd-4045.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2011|publisher=University of Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of the painting that are commonly noted include the overt flower symbolism, and the unreal, crowded, depthless space, perhaps best shown by the bizarre mirror that reflects both the candles in the "room" and an exterior garden scene.&lt;ref name="Rarchive"&gt;{{cite web

The white roses may indicate cold, sensuous love and reflect the tradition that roses first "blushed" or turned red upon meeting [[Eve]]. The poppy in the lower right hand corner may indicate sleep and forgetfulness and reflect the languid nature of Lilith.  Foxgloves, near the mirror, may indicate insincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sarah Phelps. “Dante Gabriel Rossetti's ‘Lady Lilith’ and the Language of Flowers.” Arts Magazine 53 (1979): 142–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Rossetti's assistants, Charles Fairfax Murray, who had created copies of his master's work claimed that some paintings later attributed to Rossetti were actually painted by his assistants. Murray claimed that the ''Lady Lilith'' in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was painted by Henry Treffry Dunn and was just "touched up" by Rossetti.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=David Wayne|title=Cultivating Victorians: liberal culture and the aesthetic p.128|year=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yU6OXCO18kC&amp;dq=%22Henry+Treffry+Dunn%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body's Beauty and Soul's Beauty==
[[File:Rosetti sibyl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sibylla Palmifera, 1866–70, also features Alexa Wilding as the model.  It forms a pair with ''Lady Lilith'' with Rossetti poems inscribed on each frame. Now in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]].]]

Rossetti began painting ''Sibylla Palmifera'' before persuading George Rae to commission it&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"/&gt; in late 1865. The final price was 400 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].  He worked sporadically on the painting and only completed it in December 1870.  In June 1869 he received £200 from Leyland for a copy that was never completed.

The name Palmifera means "palm-bearer," and the model holds a palm in her hands. The palm, together with the inclusion of [[butterfly|butterflies]], may indicate the spiritual nature of the painting. This painting also has flower symbolism – using red roses and poppies in this case – and an unrealistic background space.&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =12 December 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossetti wrote the sonnet "Soul's Beauty" to accompany the painting ''Sibylla Palmifera'',&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"/&gt; just as he wrote the sonnet "Lilith" to accompany the painting ''Lady Lilith''.
Both pairs of poems and pictures were first published, side-by-side, in [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition'' in 1868.  In 1870 the poems were published again in Rossetti's ''Sonnets for Pictures''.

It was not until 1881 however that the sonnets became a true pair.  At that time Rossetti decided to directly contrast the two poems, renamed "Lilith" to "Body's Beauty" and published them on consecutive pages of his book ''The House of Life'' as sonnets LXXVII and LXXVIII.&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossetti|first=Date Gabriel|title=The House of Life|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist perspective==
In myth, [[Lilith]] is a powerful, threatening, sexual woman who resists domination by men.  Thus she has been considered a symbol of the feminist movement.  In the painting she concentrates on her own beauty, luxuriates in her free, sensual hair, lacks the usual [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[corset]], and wears "clothes that look as if they are soon to be removed."&lt;ref name="Scerba"&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher =EServer.org | year =1999  | url =http://feminism.eserver.org/theory/papers/lilith/
  | accessdate =9 December 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''The Power of Women's Hair in the Victorian Imagination,'' Elizabeth G. Gitter writes:

{{Quote|The more abundant the hair, the more potent the sexual invitation implied in its display. For folk, literary and psychoanalytic traditions agree that the luxuriance of the hair is an index of vigorous sexuality, even of wantonness.&lt;ref name="F and W"/&gt;}}

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

The painting hung in Leyland's drawing room with five other Rossetti paintings that Leyland called "stunners."&lt;ref name=figure&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 26 (figure 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Bancroft, a textile mill owner from [[Wilmington, Delaware]], bought the painting at Leyland's estate sale, held at [[Christie's]] on 28 May 1892, for £525.  He bought at least four other Rossetti paintings at the same time and later accumulated one of the largest collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside of the United Kingdom.  The Bancroft estate donated Bancroft's extensive collection of paintings in 1935 to the [[Delaware Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=prb&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.preraph.org/history/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting was exhibited in London in 1883, and Philadelphia in 1892 while Bancroft's house was being expanded to hold his new paintings. 
It has also been exhibited in [[Richmond, Virginia]] (1982), Tokyo (1990), [[Birmingham]] and [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] (2000), and in London, Liverpool and Amsterdam (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p.186.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was exhibited at the [[Tate Gallery]] in London, and from 17 February to 19 May 2013 it was on exhibit at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.

'''Lawrence Block''' (born June 24, 1938) is an American [[crime fiction|crime]] writer best known for two long-running [[New York city|New York]]–set series about the recovering alcoholic [[Private Investigator|P.I.]] [[Matthew Scudder]] and the [[gentleman thief|gentleman burglar]] [[Bernie Rhodenbarr]]. Block was named a Grand Master by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] in 1994.

==Career==
Block's earliest work, published pseudonymously in the 1950s, was mostly in the soft-porn mass market paperback industry, an apprenticeship he shared with fellow mystery author [[Donald E. Westlake]]. Block describes the early sex novels as a valuable experience, noting that despite the titillating content of the books (rather mild by later standards of adult fiction) he was expected to write fully developed novels with plausible plots, characters and conflicts. He further credits the softcore novels as a factor in his prolific output; writing 15 to 20 sex novels per year to support himself financially, Block was forced to learn to write in a manner that required little revision and editing of his first drafts.&lt;ref name="Block_PlotToPrint"&gt;Block, Lawrence (1979). ''Writing the Novel: From Plot to Print'', Writer's Digest Books&lt;/ref&gt; His first novel was a lesbian fiction titled ''Strange Are The Ways of Love'', written under the name Lesley Evans.&lt;ref name=DailyNews/&gt; In 2016, Block reissued this novel with a new title ''Shadows'', under another of his pseudonyms, Jill Emerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Block|first1=Lawrence|title=Welcome back, Jill Emerson!|url=http://lawrenceblock.com/welcome-back-jill-emerson/|website=lawrenceblock.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of his work to appear under his own name was the 1957 story "You Can't Lose," for the crime/adventure magazine ''Manhunt''. The first novel to be published under Block's name was ''Grifter's Game'' (1961). It started as an erotic novel but, as Block would later write, "I decided it might be a cut above what I’d been writing, so I wrote it as a crime novel with the hope it might work for [[Gold Medal Books|Gold Medal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Block (2013), [http://lawrenceblock.com/grifters-game/ Afterward to Grifter's Game e-book]; LawrenceBlock.com, accessed 13 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He has since published more than fifty novels and more than a hundred short stories, as well as a series of books for writers.

Block has lived in [[New York City]] for decades, setting most of his fiction there, and has come to be very closely associated with the city. He is married to Lynne Block. He has three daughters, Amy Reichel, Jill Block and Alison Pouliot, from an earlier marriage. With Lynne, he spends much of his time traveling (the two have been to 135 countries),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lawrence |last=Block |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_qCCV-JJ08C&amp;pg=PA344|title=Step by Step: A Pedestrian Memoir |year=2009 |page= 344}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continues to consider New York his home.

He was a regular guest on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' (2005-2015), appearing in eight of Ferguson's ten seasons as host of the program.

Considerable autobiographical information on the earlier phase of his life and career may be found scattered through ''Telling Lies for Fun and Profit'' (1981), a collection of his fiction columns from ''[[Writer's Digest]]''.

In 2005 he was honored with the [[Gumshoe Awards|Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award]].

Block is an alumnus of the [[Ragdale|Ragdale Foundation]].

===Recurring characters===
====Matthew Scudder====
{{Main|Matthew Scudder}}
Block's most famous creation, the ever-evolving Matthew Scudder, was introduced in 1976's ''The Sins of the Fathers'' as an alcoholic ex-cop working as an unlicensed private investigator in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]. Originally published as paperbacks, the early novels are in many ways interchangeable; the second and third entries—''In the Midst of Death'' (1976) and ''Time to Murder and Create'' (1977)—were written in the opposite order from their publication dates. 1982's ''[[8 Million Ways to Die]]'' (filmed in 1986 by [[Hal Ashby]], with unpopular results) breaks from that trend, concluding with Scudder introducing himself at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting. The series was set to end on that note, but an idle promise Block had made to supply an editor friend with an original Scudder short resulted in "By the Dawn's Early Light", a story set during the character's drinking days, but told from the perspective of a recovering alcoholic. Block expanded on that with 1986's ''When the Sacred Ginmill Closes'' (named for a line in a song by folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]], a close friend), which proved not only one of the more literary entries, but also a favorite of the author and his fans. From then on, Scudder's circumstances rarely remain the same from one book to the next; 1990's ''A Ticket to the Boneyard,'' for example, reunites him with Elaine Mardell, a hooker from his days on the force, whom he marries several books later. Other fan favorites are 1991's taut, gruesome ''A Dance at the Slaughterhouse'' (winner of the [[Edgar Award]] for Best [mystery] Novel), and 1993's ''A Long Line of Dead Men,'' a tightly plotted puzzler featuring a rapidly dwindling fraternity known as the "Club of 31".  [[A Walk Among the Tombstones (novel)|A Walk Among the Tombstones]], published in 1992, was made into a [[A Walk Among the Tombstones (film)|film]], released in 2014, written and directed by [[Scott Frank]], with [[Liam Neeson]] playing the lead role. The seventeenth entry, ''A Drop of the Hard Stuff'' was published in May, 2011.

It has been suggested that Scudder's struggle with alcoholism is in part autobiographical; while Block has repeatedly refused to discuss the subject, citing AA's own tradition of anonymity, in a column he wrote for Writer's Digest, Block wrote that when he created Scudder, "I let him hang out in the same saloon where I spent a great deal of my own time. I was drinking pretty heavily around that time, and I made him a pretty heavy drinker, too. I drank whiskey, sometimes mixing it with coffee. So did Scudder."

====Bernie Rhodenbarr====
{{Main|Bernie Rhodenbarr}}
Block's other major series, humorous and much lighter in tone, relates the misadventures of gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. The series is rich in sophisticated, witty dialogue.

Unlike Scudder, Rhodenbarr is ageless, remaining essentially the same from 1977's ''Burglars Can't Be Choosers,'' to the eleventh and most recent entry, 2013's ''The Burglar Who Counted the Spoons.'' The only significant advancements come in the third volume, ''The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling'' (1979, winner of the first annual [[Nero Award]]) which sees Bernie having used the spoils from his previous caper to buy a bookstore, and introduces Carolyn Kaiser, his lesbian "soulmate" and partner in crime. The plots run very much to form: Bernie breaks into a residence (usually on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]]) and, through a series of implausible events, becomes involved in a murder investigation—often as the prime suspect. Not even an eleven-year hiatus (between 1983's ''The Burglar Who Painted Like Mondrian'' and 1994's ''The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams'') would see that basic formula change. There is, however, a meta quality to the more recent entries: Bernie, the reluctant detective, is himself a bookseller and genre fan, and is apt to make references to [[Agatha Christie]], [[E. W. Hornung|E.W. Hornung]] (his cat is named "[[Raffles the Thief|Raffles]]"), [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Sue Grafton]] and [[John Sandford (novelist)|John Sandford]], among others. ''The Burglar Who Thought He Was Bogart'' (1995) exploits this to full effect: set during a [[Humphrey Bogart]] film festival, the story is itself inspired by many of the actor's most famous roles. ''The Burglar in the Library'' (1997) similarly imagines a meeting between Hammet and Chandler at a New England inn in the 1940s, casting a volume inscribed by Chandler to Hammett as its own [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|Maltese Falcon]]. In ''The Burglar in the Rye,'' Bernie helps track down a writer clearly based on [[J.D. Salinger]].

The second novel, ''The Burglar in The Closet'' was filmed in 1987 as ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]'', with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Bernie (or Bernice).

====Evan Michael Tanner====
{{Main|Evan Michael Tanner}}
Besides Scudder and Rhodenbarr, Block has written eight novels about Evan Tanner, an adventurer and accidental revolutionary who, as a result of an injury sustained in the [[Korean War]], cannot sleep. All but the last of these were published in the '60s and early '70s (beginning with 1966's ''The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep''), while the most recent, 1998's ''Tanner on Ice,'' revived the character after nearly a thirty-year hiatus.

====Chip Harrison====
Chip Harrison, running on the twin engines of lust and curiosity, originally appeared in two funny, non-mystery novels which revolved around seventeen-year-old Chip's obsessive quest to lose his virginity: ''No Score'' and ''Chip Harrison Scores Again.''

Realizing the series didn't have much of a future once Chip reached his goal, Block puts Chip to work as an assistant to Leo Haig, an admirer of sleuth [[Nero Wolfe]] who models himself after his hero (e.g., Wolfe raises tropical flowers, Haig raises tropical fish). They appeared in two subsequent, decidedly tongue-in-cheek mystery novels: ''Make Out With Murder'' and ''The Topless Tulip Caper'', and a handful of short stories.

====Keller====
Four episodic novels (''Hit Man'' (1998), ''Hit List'' (2000), ''Hit Parade'' (2006) and ''Hit Me'' (2013)) as well as one full-length novel (''Hit and Run'' (2008)) chronicle the life of Keller, a lonely, wistful hitman who originally appeared as a semi-regular feature in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine in the 1990s. Most of the novels are [[fix-up]]s of related short stories; ''Hit and Run'' is the only Keller novel conceived of and written as a single story.

Keller's full name is John Paul Keller (a fact mentioned in ''Hit Man''), although he is rarely called anything but Keller in the series. The stories are rarely action-oriented or focused on the details of his crimes, instead being character studies of Keller's personality and the people he meets (e.g., Keller's being hired to kill a major league baseball [[designated hitter]] but postponing the act and following the team to away games so the hitter can reach the career milestone of 400 home runs). Originally based in New York City, he later relocates to New Orleans where he lives under the name "Nicholas Edwards".  Keller receives assignments via a contact named Dot, who is originally based in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].  His assignments usually take him to different cities, where he often envisions himself retiring from the business, daydreaming about settling there, before finishing off the assignment and returning, his fantasies forgotten as a passing dream. Keller's unlikely [[pastime]] is [[stamp collecting]], to which he is nearly obsessively devoted.  He collects non-U.S. issues, prior to 1940, with a particular interest in stamps from Former colonies of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]].

''Hit and Run'' was nominated for The CWA Gold Dagger at the 2009 [[Crime Thriller Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Allen, Kate |date=September 7, 2009 |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/96297-coben-cole-atkinson-vie-for-crime-awards.html |title=Coben, Cole, Atkinson vie for crime awards |work=The Bookseller |accessdate=September 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910005647/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/96297-coben-cole-atkinson-vie-for-crime-awards.html |archivedate=September 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
''Small Town'' (2003), Block's first non-series book in fifteen years, details a group of New Yorkers' varying responses to the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]. Block has also written dozens of short stories over the years, and he is the only four-time winner of the [[Edgar Award]] for Best Short Story.  The 2002 collection ''Enough Rope'' compiles stories, 84 in all, from earlier collections, such as ''Like a Lamb to Slaughter'' and ''Sometimes They Bite'', along with new and previously uncollected stories.

Block describes series character Martin H. Ehrengraf as a dapper little criminal defense lawyer whose clients all turn out to be innocent. Ehrengraf charges a mere $1 retainer fee and afterwards works on [[Contingent fee|contingency]]; he gets paid a massive fee if and only if his clients are cleared of wrongdoing. When his clients are cleared, it's because Ehrengraf has committed misdeeds up to and including murder to exonerate his client and often frame another for the crimes. The first short story featuring Ehrengraf, “The Ehrengraf Defense,” was published in ''Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine'' in 1978. By 2003, twelve stories had been published and in 2012 Block completed an eleventh story, “The Ehrengraf Settlement.” All eleven were collected and published in an eVolume, ''Ehrengraf For The Defense'' (2012).

In addition to writing the scripts for a handful of television episodes over the years—including, in 2005, two episodes of the [[ESPN]] series ''[[Tilt (TV series)|Tilt]]''—Block co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[My Blueberry Nights]]'', a 2007 film directed by [[Wong Kar-wai]] and starring [[Norah Jones]].&lt;ref name=NYSun&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/56437?page_no=2 "A Hodge-Podge of Homicide"]  by OTTO PENZLER, [[The New York Sun]], June 13, 2007, accessed June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Lola'''" is a song written by [[Ray Davies]] and performed by English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Kinks]] on their album ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One]]''. The song details a romantic encounter between a young man and a &lt;!-- PLEASE read the section titled "Playful ambiguity" on this article's talk page before deleting the word "possible" that follows. Thanks. --&gt; possible &lt;!-- see preceding comment --&gt; [[transvestite]], whom he meets in a club in [[Soho]], London. In the song, the narrator describes his confusion towards Lola, who "walked like a woman but talked like a man". Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band's manager, alternative explanations for the song have been given by drummer [[Mick Avory]].

The song was released in the United Kingdom on 12 June 1970, while in the United States it was released on 28 June 1970. Commercially, the single reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]&lt;ref name="UK charts"&gt;{{cite web|title=KINKS|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/11246/KINKS/|website=Official Charts|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=chartsUS&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kinks – Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-kinks-mn0000100160/awards|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its controversial subject matter and use of the brand name [[Coca-Cola]], the single received backlash and even bans in Britain and Australia. The single version (mono) used the words "cherry cola" while the album version (stereo) uses the name "Coca-Cola". The track has since become one of The Kinks' most iconic and popular songs, later being ranked number 422 on "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]" as well as number 473 on the "[[NME]]'s 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time" list.&lt;ref name="nme 500"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time – 473. The Kinks – 'Lola'|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-500-401/330541#/photo/39|publisher=''[[New Musical Express]]''|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its release, "Lola" has appeared on multiple compilation and live albums. In 1980, a live version of the song from the album ''[[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|One for the Road]]'' was released as a single in the US and some European countries, becoming a minor hit. In the Netherlands it became #1, just as in 1970 with the studio version. Other versions include live renditions from 1972's ''[[Everybody's in Show-Biz]]'' and 1996's ''[[To the Bone (The Kinks album)|To the Bone]]''. The "Lola" character also made an appearance in the lyrics of the band's 1981 song, "[[Destroyer (The Kinks song)|Destroyer]]".

==Background==
{{quote box|quote=It was a real experience in a club. I was asked to dance by somebody who was a fabulous looking woman. I said "no thank you". And she went in a cab with my manager straight afterwards. It's based on a personal experience. But not every word.|source= – Ray Davies{{sfn|Hasted|2011}}|width=25%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}

Ray Davies has claimed that he was inspired to write "Lola" after Kinks manager Robert Wace spent a night in Paris dancing with a [[transvestite]].{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|p=171}} Davies said of the incident, "In his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, 'I'm really onto a thing here.' And it was okay until we left at six in the morning and then I said, 'Have you seen the stubble?' He said 'Yeah', but he was too pissed [intoxicated] to care, I think".{{sfn|Savage|1984}}

Drummer [[Mick Avory]] has offered an alternative explanation for the song's lyrics, claiming that "Lola" was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of transvestite bars in west London.{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|pp=171–172}} Avory said, "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people. He used to come down to ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs. And that's where Ray [Davies] got the idea for 'Lola'. When he was invited too, he wrote it while I was getting drunk".{{sfn|Hasted|2011}}

Despite claims that the song was written about a supposed date between Ray Davies and [[Candy Darling]], Davies has since claimed this rumour to be false, saying that the two only went out to dinner together and that he had known the whole time that Darling was trans.{{sfn|Hasted|2011}}

In his autobiography, [[Dave Davies]] said that he came up with the music for what would become "Lola", noting that brother Ray added the lyrics after hearing it.{{sfn|Hickey|2012|p=138}} In a 1990 interview, Dave Davies stated that "Lola" was written in a similar fashion to "[[You Really Got Me]]" in that the two worked on Ray's basic skeleton of the song, saying that the song was more of a collaborative effort than many believed.&lt;ref name=davedavies&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCue|first1=Danny|title=Dave Davies – Out Of the Ordinary|url=http://www.davedavies.com/articles/gm_0290.htm|website=Davedavies.com|publisher=Guitar Magazine|accessdate=11 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XfDYXak2?url=http://www.davedavies.com/articles/gm_0290.htm|archivedate=9 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and recording==
{{quote box|quote=I remember going into a music store on Shaftesbury Avenue when we were about to make "Lola". I said, "I want to get a really good guitar sound on this record, I want a Martin". And in the corner they had this old 1938 Dobro [resonating guitar] that I bought for $150. I put them together on "Lola" which is what makes that clangy sound: the combination of the Martin and the Dobro with heavy compression.|source= – Ray Davies{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}}|width=30%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}

Written in April 1970, "Lola" was cited by Ray Davies as the first song he wrote following a break he took to act in the 1970 [[Play for Today]] film ''The Long Distance Piano Player''.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=139}} Davies said that he had initially struggled with writing an opening that would sell the song, but the rest of the song "came naturally".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=139}}

Initial recordings of the song began in April 1970, but, as the band's bassist [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]] remembered, recording for "Lola" took particularly long, stretching into the next month.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}} During April, four to five versions were attempted, utilizing different keys as well as varying beginnings and styles.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}} In May, new piano parts were added to the backing track by John Gosling, the band's new piano player that had just been auditioned.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}} Vocals were also added at this time. The song was then mixed during that month. Mick Avory remembered the recording sessions for the song positively, saying that it "was fun, as it was the Baptist's [John Gosling's] first recording with us".&lt;ref name="kok mick interview"&gt;{{cite web|title="Not Many Drummers from West Molesey Have Done That!" – The Mick Avory Interview: Part 2|url=http://kastoffkinks.co.uk/Mick%20Avory%20interview%20part%202.htm|website=Kastoffkinks.uk|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guitar opening on the song was produced as a result of combining the sound of a [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin guitar]] and a vintage [[Dobro|Dobro resonating guitar]].{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|p=171}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}} Ray Davies cited this blend of guitar sounds for the song's unique guitar sound.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}}

==Release==
{{quote box|quote= I wanted to write a hit [with "Lola".] It wasn't just the song. it was the musical design. It wasn't a power chord song like "[[You Really Got Me]]". It was a power chord beginning. It needed a special acoustic guitar sound ... sonorous, growling, with an attack to it.|source= – Ray Davies, Radio 4's ''Master Tapes''{{sfn|Hasted|2011}}|width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Despite the chart success "Lola" would achieve, its fellow ''Lola vs. Powerman'' track "Powerman" was initially considered to be the first single from the album.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=140}} However, "Lola", which Ray Davies later claimed was an attempt to write a hit, was eventually decided on as the debut single release.{{sfn|Hasted|2011}}

"Lola" was released as a single in 1970.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=142}} In the UK, the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the single was ''[[the Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' outtake "[[Berkeley Mews]]"{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=110–111}} while the Dave Davies-penned "Mindless Child of Motherhood" was used in the US.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=142}} It became an unexpected chart smash for the Kinks, reaching number two in Britain&lt;ref name="UK charts" /&gt; and number nine in the United States.&lt;ref name=chartsUS /&gt; The single also saw success worldwide, reaching the top of the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as the top 5 in Germany, Austria, Belgium, and Switzerland. The success of the single had important ramifications for the band's career at a critical time, allowing them to negotiate a new contract with [[RCA Records]], construct their own London Studio, and assume more creative and managerial control. In a 1970 interview, Dave Davies stated that, if "Lola" had been a failure, the band would have "gone on making records for another year or so and then drifted apart".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=145}}

Although the track was a major hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of "Lola", saying, "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a different sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder".{{sfn|Hasted|2011}} Mick Avory said that he "enjoyed the success" the band had with "Lola" and its follow-up, "[[Apeman (song)|Apeman]]".{{sfn|Hasted|2011}}

== Controversy ==
Originally, "Lola" saw controversy for its lyrics. In a ''[[Record Mirror]]'' article entitled "Sex Change Record: Kink Speaks", Ray Davies addressed the matter, saying, "It really doesn't matter what sex Lola is, I think she's alright".{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|p=172}} Some radio stations would fade the track out before implications of Lola's biological sex were revealed.{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|p=171}} On 18 November 1970, the song was banned in Australia because of its "controversial subject matter".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=146}}

The BBC banned the track for a different reason. The original song recorded in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] had the word "[[Coca-Cola]]" in the lyrics, but because of BBC Radio's policy against [[product placement]], Ray Davies was forced to make a 6000-mile round-trip flight from New York to London and back on June 3, 1970, interrupting the band's American tour, to change those words to the generic "cherry cola" for the single release, which is included on various compilation albums as well.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10483279"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/radio-industry/news/article.cfm?c_id=295&amp;objectid=10483279&amp;ref=rss |title=Banning songs not a rare occurrence for the BBC |date=19 December 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucr rerecord"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giles|first1=Jeff|title=45 Years Ago: Ray Davies Flies Across the Atlantic&amp;nbsp;– Twice!&amp;nbsp;– to Re-Record Two Words in ‘Lola’|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kinks-lola-lyric-changes/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Ray Davies later stated that, like in the lyrics of "Lola", he had actually drunk champagne that tastes like cola, saying, "I had a Californian champagne that tasted like it, in some kind of L.A. bordello tourist trap".&lt;ref name="ucr rerecord" /&gt;}}

==Reception and legacy==
"Lola" received positive reviews from critics. Upon the single's release, the ''[[NME]]'' praised the song as "an engaging and sparkling piece with a gay Latin flavour and a catchy hook chorus".{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|p=172}}{{refn|group=nb|The ''NME'' later ranked the song number 473 on their "500 Greatest Songs Of All Time" list, calling it "the sweetest" account of "accidentally sleeping with a ladyboy".&lt;ref name="nme 500" /&gt;}} ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said of the song at the time of its US release, "Currently a top ten British chart winner, this infectious rhythm item has all the ingredients to put the Kinks right back up the Hot 100 here with solid impact".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=144}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Paul Gambaccini]] called the song as "brilliant and a smash".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=148}}{{refn|group=nb|''Rolling Stone'' later ranked "Lola" at 422 on their 2004 list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596267/lola |title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time – 422: Lola – The Kinks |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917184302/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596267/lola |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed from the list on their 2011 revision of the ranking.}} Music critic [[Robert Christgau]], despite his mixed opinion on the ''Lola vs. Powerman'' album, praised the single as "astounding".&lt;ref name=christgau&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christgau|first1=Robert|title=The Kinks|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1464&amp;name=The+Kinks|website=Robertchristgau.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] lauded the song for "its crisp, muscular sound, pitched halfway between acoustic folk and hard rock".&lt;ref name=allmusic /&gt; ''[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]'' ranked "Lola" as The Kinks' third best song, saying "the great guitar riff that feeds the song is one of Dave's all-time greatest".&lt;ref name=UCR&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallucci|first1=Michael|title=Top 10 Kinks Songs|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kinks-songs/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' listed the track as the band's fourth best song.&lt;ref name=paste&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stiernberg|first1=Bonnie|title=The 15 Best Kinks Songs|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/04/the-15-best-kinks-songs-1.html|website=Pastemagazine.com|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song as one of the songs he was most proud to be associated with,&lt;ref name="kok mick interview" /&gt; said "I always liked 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not like anything else. I liked it for that. We'd always take a different path".{{sfn|Hasted|2011}} In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it".&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Mark Goodman|Goodman, Mark]] (interviewer)|date= |year=1983 |title=Groovy Movies |medium=Television production |publisher=MTV |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band revisited the "Lola" character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, "[[Destroyer (The Kinks song)|Destroyer]]", a minor chart hit in America.{{sfn|Jovanovic|2014|p=245}}

Satirical artist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] created a parody of the song called "[[Yoda (song)|Yoda]]", featuring lyrics about the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Yoda|character of the same name]], on his 1985 album ''[[Dare to Be Stupid]]''.&lt;ref name="weird al parody"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caulfield|first1=Philip|title=Weird Al Yankovic sings parody hit ‘Yoda’ with 13-year-old autistic girl|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/weird-al-sings-yoda-13-year-old-autistic-girl-article-1.2142749|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its release, "Lola" became a mainstay in The Kinks' live repertoire, appearing in the majority of the band's subsequent set-lists until the group's break-up.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=161–344}} In 1972, a live performance of the song recorded at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City appeared on the live half of the band's 1972 album, ''[[Everybody's in Show-Biz]]'', a double-LP which contained half new studio compositions and half live versions of previously released songs.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=165}}

A live version of "Lola", recorded on 23 September 1979 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]],{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=238}} was released as a single in the US in July 1980 to promote the live album ''[[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|One for the Road]]''. The B-side was the live version of "[[Celluloid Heroes]]". The single was a moderate success, reaching number 81 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=240}} It was also released in some countries in Europe (although not the UK) in April 1981. It topped the charts in both the Netherlands, matching the number one peak of the original version,&lt;ref name="dutchcharts.nl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Kinks&amp;titel=Lola+%28Live%29&amp;cat=s |title=dutchcharts.nl – The Kinks – Lola (Live) |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Belgium, where it exceeded the original's peak of three.&lt;ref name="ultratop live version" /&gt; It also charted in Australia, peaking at number 69 and spending 22 weeks on the charts.&lt;ref name="aus chart book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kent|first1=David|title=Australian Chart Book: 1970–1992, 23 Years of Hit Singles &amp; Albums from the Top 100 Charts|publisher=Australian Chart Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not released as a stand-alone single in the UK, it was included on a bonus single (backed with a live version of "[[David Watts (song)|David Watts]]" from the same album) with initial copies of "[[Better Things (song)|Better Things]]" in June 1981.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=248}} This live rendition, along with the live versions of "Celluloid Heroes" and "[[You Really Got Me#Live history|You Really Got Me]]" from the same album, also appeared on the 1986 compilation album ''Come Dancing with The Kinks: The Best of the Kinks 1977–1986''.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=282}}

Although it did not appear on the original 1994 version, another live version of "Lola" was included on the 1996 US double-album release of ''[[To the Bone (The Kinks album)|To the Bone]]'', the band's final release of new material before their dissolution.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=340}}

[[File:A copy of the Magna glossatura.jpg|thumb]]
{{italic title}}
The '''''Collectanea''''', or '''''Magna glossatura''''' as it came to be known, is a collection of commentaries on the [[Psalms]] and the [[Pauline Epistles]] written by [[Peter the Lombard]] between 1139 and 1141.

==Origin and characteristics==

The ''Magna glossatura'' is a set of [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es written beside passages from the [[Latin Vulgate Bible]]. These glosses were written by Peter the Lombard during his teaching career and before he became the bishop of Paris (1159–1160). His gloss of Psalms and his gloss of the Pauline Epistles (referred to as the ''Collectanea'') were compiled and became a part of the official gloss on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of glosses would take on the name of ''Magna glossatura'' and would, during the 12th century, replace the ''Glossa ordinaria'' as the most frequently studied and copied exegetical gloss of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colish|first1=Marcia L.|title=Peter Lombard|date=1994|publisher=Brill's Studies in Intellectual History|location=New York|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other works included the ''Libri Quatuor Sententiarum'' (or the ''[[Sentences|Four Books of Sentences]]'') and his commentaries in the ''glossa Ordinaria''. The ''Magna glossatura'', along with other systematic glosses, would have been developed at theological schools such as Laon and St.-Victor of Paris, and would have been used for the research conducted by theologians as well as the teaching of students in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouchard|first1=Constance B.|title=The Cistercians and the "glossa Ordinaria"|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=2000|volume=86 |issue=2|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of text in the ''Magna glossatura'', is written in the ''intercisum'' (or intercut) format, which was developed by Peter Lombard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lesley|title=The Glossa Ordinaria : The Making of a Medieval Bible Commentary|date=2009|publisher=Brill|location=Boston|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a way of distinguishing scripture from the commentaries by writing the biblical verses in a larger script and on alternate lines next to the commentary, which would be ordered into columns. Blocks of scripture were then placed on the left edge of the columns to balance the biblical verses with the commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''intercisum'' method, from ca.1160, began to be applied to glosses on all the books of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layout also gave glosses and their commentators greater influence in their relationship with the Word of God, as these glosses played a larger role in theological books by forming an essential reading in connection with the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Lombard's gloss of the Pauline Epistles features not only commentaries concerning the traditional mode of reflection on the Christian faith, which regards the biblical text as ''sacra pagina'', but also commentaries of systematic theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lombard writes on specific theological themes which deal with issues such as the nature of the Trinity. Lombard's glosses also include references to the works of other ecclesiastical figures and theologians, [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] to name a few. The biblical commentaries and ideas present in the ''Magna glossatura'' are also present in the various sermons given by Peter Lombard to his peers and to his cathedral's congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcel Lempereur-Haut''' (1898, [[Liège (city)|Liège]] – 1986, [[Lille]]) was a [[Belgian]] painter. He took drawing lessons at the Liège Academy of Fine Arts where he obtained a diploma in surveying and, after [[World War I]] he worked as a technical [[technical drawing|draughtsman]].

In 1920, he joined the group publishing the ''Anthologie'' art magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |journal=Revue belge d'archéologie et d'histoire de l'art |publisher=Académie royale d'archéologie de Belgique |volume=66 |pages=149 |issn=0035-077X }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his artistic career by producing book illustrations and prints, mostly inspired by [[cubism]]. He produced his first [[abstract art]] in 1921, and in 1922 befriended [[František Kupka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Actuel XX: la peinture à Liège au XXe siècle |last=Parisse |first=Jacques |year=1975 |publisher=Editions Mardaga |isbn=978-2-8021-0006-5 |page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1932, he participated in the exhibitions of the [[musicalism|musicalist artists]].

He lived in Paris from 1945 to 1958, and participated in the exhibitions  of the ''[[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Réalités nouvelles: 1946-1956 : [exposition], Musée des beaux-arts de Calais, 9 février-8 avril 1980 |last=Lhotellier |first=Henry |author2=Dominique Viéville |year=1980 |publisher=Musée des beaux-arts de Calais |oclc=8346369 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, his work mainly comprised combinations of circles, spirals and stars. His later works were mostly decorative.

Lempereur-Haut continued to paint into at least his late seventies, limiting himself to crayons on cardboard after a [[cataract]] operation in 1976 restricted his vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art &amp; ophthalmology: the impact of eye diseases on painters |last=Lanthony |first=Philippe |year=2009 |publisher=Kugler Publications |isbn=978-90-6299-460-1 |pages=82–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[retrospective exhibition]] of his work was held in Lille in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lempereur-Haut, rétrospective: du 18 octobre au 29 décembre 1985 |year=1985 |publisher=Musée d'art moderne, Lille |oclc=464029426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nanban art'''|南蛮美術}} refers to [[Japanese art]] of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced by contact with the {{nihongo|''Nanban''|南蛮}} or 'Southern barbarians', [[Nanban trade|traders]] and [[Kirishitan|missionaries]] from Europe and specifically from [[Portugal]]. It is a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese word]], Chinese ''[[Nanman|Nánmán]]'', originally referring to the peoples of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].  During the [[Nanban trade period]], the word took on a new meaning when it came to designate the Portuguese, who first arrived  in 1543, and later other Europeans. The term also refers to paintings Europeans brought to [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Namban"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Namban Art of Japan |author=Okamoto, Yoshitomo |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |year=1972 |ISBN=0-8348-1008-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nanbane.htm |title=Nanban-e |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nanban art developed after the first Portuguese ships arrived in [[Kyushu]] in 1543. While Christian [[icons]] and other objects were produced, {{nihongo|Nanban [[byōbu]]|南蛮屏風}} or folding screens are particularly notable, with between 60 and 80 pairs surviving to this day&lt;ref name="Namban"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Another popular area within Nanban art was the depiction of foreign warriors. Artists of the [[Kanō school]] were joined by those of the [[Tosa school]] in combining foreign subject matter with [[Japanese painting|Japanese styles of painting]]. Canons of western art of the period such as [[linear perspective]] and alternative materials and techniques appear to have had little lasting influence. The [[Persecution of Christians in Japan|persecution and prohibition of Christianity]] from the end of the sixteenth century and the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] policy of [[sakoku]] that largely closed Japan to foreign contact from the 1630s saw the decline of Nanban art.&lt;ref name="Namban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAANUS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nanbanbyoubu.htm |title=Nanban-byoubu |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse influence==
While [[Japonism]] did not develop in the west until after the [[Bakumatsu|reopening of Japan]] in the 1850s and the 1860s, there is evidence of earlier Japanese influence in the art of [[Colonial Mexico]], as Japanese crafts were traded through the [[Manila Galleons]] from [[Manila]] (Philippines) to [[Acapulco]] (Mexico) from 1565 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Namban: Art in Viceregal Mexico |author=Lake, Rodrigo Rivero |publisher=Turner |year=2006 |ISBN=978-84-7506-693-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mesdag-Scheveningen.png|thumb|300px|[[Scheveningen]] village, a small section of the ''Panorama Mesdag'', with fake terrain in the foreground.]]
'''''Panorama Mesdag''''' is a [[panorama]] by [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]]. Housed in a purpose-built museum in [[The Hague]], the panorama is a cylindrical painting (also known as a [[Cyclorama]]) more than 14 metres high and about 40 metres in diameter (120 metres in circumference). From an observation gallery in the centre of the room the cylindrical perspective creates the illusion that the viewer is on a high sand dune overlooking the sea, beaches and village of Scheveningen in the late 19th century. A foreground of fake terrain around the viewing gallery hides the base of the painting and makes the illusion more convincing.

==History==
Mesdag was a notable marine painter of the [[Hague School]]; in 1880 he was engaged by a Belgian company to paint the panorama, which with the assistance of his wife [[Sina Mesdag-van Houten|Sientje Mesdag-van Houten]] and some student painters (including [[George Hendrik Breitner]]), was completed by 1881. However, the vogue for panoramas was coming to an end, and the company went bankrupt in 1886. Mesdag purchased the panorama and met its losses from his own pocket. The panorama is now the oldest surviving panorama in its original location.

Cummins conceived the monumental installation ''[[Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red]]'' at the [[Tower of London]], which commemorated British and Colonial losses in the [[First World War]] with 888,246 ceramic poppies. Cummins produced the flowers together with a number of assistants in Derbyshire, while the setting of the work was designed by theatre designer [[Tom Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/01/designer-tower-london-poppies-wwi-tom-piper The Guardian.

This left him requiring extensive surgery and resulted in the loss of a finger and use of his dominant hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/WWI/article1475755.ece |newspaper=Sunday Times |title=Poppies artist wounded in action |author=Josh Glancy |date=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in interviews that was "overwhelmed" by the public response to this work, saying "I think that it is something everybody can relate to and they feel very personally about." However, he also received death threats for his work, stating that it was because the money was being donated to "war charities".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/15/tower-of-london-poppies-artist-death-threats-paul-cummins-first-world-war "Tower of London poppies artist received death threats"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the success of the work, both Cummins and Piper were awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[2015 New Year Honours]], Cummins' award being made "for services to art and First World War commemorations".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61092|supp=y|page=N18|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/391413/New_Year_Honours_List_2015.pdf 2015 New Year Honours List]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30633687 "NY Honours for poppy duo, Joan Collins and John Hurt"], BBC News, 31 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s '''''Poetics''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ ποιητικῆς}}; {{lang-la|De Poetica}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isnature.org/Files/Aristotle/ ''Aristotelis Opera''] by [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; c. 335 BC&lt;ref name="dukore"&gt;Dukore (1974, 31).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]] and first [[Extant literature|extant]] philosophical treatise to focus on [[literary theory]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been the traditional view for centuries.  However, recent work is now challenging whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;"Aristotle on the Power of Music in Tragedy," Pierre Destrée, Greek &amp; Roman Musical Studies, Vol. 4, Issue 2, 2016; Gregory L. Scott, ''Aristotle on Dramatic Musical Composition The Real Role of Literature, Catharsis, Music and Dance in the Poetics'' (2016b), {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, Aristotle offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes verse [[drama]] – [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]] – as well as [[lyric poetry]] and [[epic poetry]]). They are similar in the fact that they are all imitations but different in the three ways that Aristotle describes:
# Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter and melody. 
# Difference of goodness in the characters. 
# Difference in how the narrative is presented:  telling a story or acting it out.

In examining its "first principles", Aristotle finds two: 1) imitation and 2) [[genre]]s and other concepts by which that of truth is applied/revealed in the poesis. His analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions".&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]] only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habib|first=M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory: From Plato to the Present|year=2005|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=0-631-23200-1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, Aristotle's original work was divided in two, each "book" written on a separate roll of [[papyrus]].&lt;ref name=j20&gt;Janko (1987, xx).&lt;/ref&gt; Only the first part &amp;ndash; that which focuses on [[tragedy]] and epic (as a quasi-dramatic art, given its definition in Ch 23) &amp;ndash; survives. The lost second part addressed [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]].&lt;ref name=j20/&gt; Some scholars speculate that the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' summarises the contents of the lost second book.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, xxi).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other scholars indicate that "tragedy" is a very misleading translation for the Greek &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt;, which seems to have meant "goat-song" originally.  The reason is that Aristotle says three times in the treatise that the protagonist can go from fortune to misfortune or &lt;i&gt;misfortune to fortune&lt;/i&gt;; also in Chapter 14 the best type of &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt; is that which ends happily, like &lt;i&gt;Cresphontes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Iphigenia&lt;/i&gt; (presumably &lt;i&gt;"in Tauris"&lt;/i&gt;)!&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aristotle's Favorite Tragedy: Oedipus or Cresphontes?&lt;/i&gt;, Gregory Scott, 2018, {{ISBN|9780999704912}} or 9780999704905&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The table of contents page of the ''Poetics'' found in Modern Library's ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Basic Works of Aristotle''. Ed. Richard McKeon Modern Library (2001) – Poetics. Trans. Ingrid Bywater, pp. 1453–87&lt;/ref&gt;

* A. Preliminary discourse on tragedy, epic poetry, and comedy, as the chief forms of imitative poetry.
* B. Definition of a tragedy, and the rules for its construction. Definition and analysis into qualitative parts.
* C. Rules for the construction of a tragedy: Tragic pleasure, or [[catharsis]] experienced by fear and pity should be produced in the spectator. The characters must be four things: good, appropriate, realistic, and consistent. [[Discovery (observation)|Discovery]] must occur within the plot. Narratives, stories, structures and poetics overlap. It is important for the poet to visualize all of the scenes when creating the plot. The poet should incorporate complication and [[dénouement]] within the story, as well as combine all of the elements of [[tragedy]]. The poet must express thought through the characters' words and actions, while paying close attention to [[diction]] and how a character's spoken words express a specific idea. Aristotle believed that all of these different elements had to be present in order for the poetry to be well-done.  However, starting in 1948 with a Macedonian classicist, M.D. Petruševski, some scholars have rejected that Aristotle himself could have written the word ''katharsis'' in the definition of tragedy, because unlike all of the other words in the definition, it is not discussed either before or after the definition.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Petruševski "Pathēmatōn Katharsin ou bien Pragmatōn Systasin?," Ziva antika/Antiquite vivante (Skopje: Societe d'etudes classiques Ziva Antika) 1954.

Scott (2016b) {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D. Possible criticisms of an epic or tragedy, and the answers to them.
* E. Tragedy as artistically superior to epic poetry: Tragedy has everything that the epic has, even the epic meter being admissible. The reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the play as acted. The tragic imitation requires less space for the attainment of its end. If it has more concentrated effect, it is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it. There is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets (plurality of actions) and this is proved by the fact that an epic poem can supply enough material for several tragedies.

===Content===

Aristotle distinguishes between the [[genre]]s of "poetry" in three ways:
* Matter
::[[language]], [[rhythm]], and [[melody]], for Aristotle, make up the matter of poetic creation. Where the [[epic poem]] makes use of language alone, the playing of the lyre involves rhythm and melody. Some poetic forms include a blending of all materials; for example, Greek tragic drama included a singing chorus, and so music and language were all part of the performance.  These points also convey the standard view.  Recent work, though, argues that translating ''rhuthmos'' here as "rhythm" is absurd:  melody already has its own inherent musical rhythm, and the Greek can mean what Plato says it means in ''Laws'' II, 665a:  "(the name of) ordered body movement," or dance.  This correctly conveys what dramatic musical creation, the topic of the ''Poetics'', in ancient Greece had:  music, dance, and language.  Also, the musical instrument cited in Ch 1 is not the lyre but the ''kithara'', which was played in the drama while the kithara-player was dancing (in the chorus), even if that meant just walking in an appropriate way.  Moreover, epic might have had only literary exponents, but as Plato's ''Ion'' and Aristotle's Ch 26 of the ''Poetics'' help prove, for Plato and Aristotle at least some epic rhapsodes used all three means of mimesis:  language, dance (as pantomimic gesture), and music (if only by chanting the words).&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"&gt;Scott (2016b)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Subjects
::Also "agents" in some translations. Aristotle differentiates between [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] throughout the work by distinguishing between the nature of the [[Character (arts)|human characters]] that populate either form. Aristotle finds that tragedy treats of serious, important, and virtuous people. Comedy, on the other hand, treats of less virtuous people and  focuses on human "weaknesses and foibles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Aristotle's Poetics|page= 270

|first= Stephen |last= Halliwell |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle introduces here the influential ''tripartite division of characters'' in superior (βελτίονας) to the audience, inferior (χείρονας), or at the same level (τοιούτους).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michael Sifakis (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GfLAlkcFYgC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Aristotle on the function of tragic poetry''] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Poetics 1448a, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448a English], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0055%3Asection%3D1448a original Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]] (1957). ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Method
::One may imitate the agents through use of a narrator throughout, or only occasionally (using direct speech in parts and a narrator in parts, as Homer does), or only through direct speech (without a narrator), using actors to speak the lines directly.  This latter is the method of tragedy (and comedy): without use of any narrator.

Having examined briefly the field of "poetry" in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tragedy is a [[Mimesis|representation]] of a serious, complete action which has magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people acting and not by [[Diegesis|narration]], accomplishing by means of pity and [[terror]] the [[catharsis]] of such emotions.

By "embellished speech", I mean that which has rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By "with its elements separately", I mean that some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and others again by means of song (1449b25-30).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 7). In Butcher's translation, this passage reads: "Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play, in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper [[catharsis]] of these emotions."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then identifies the "parts" of tragedy:

* [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'')
::Refers to the "organization of incidents". It should imitate an action evoking pity and fear. The plot involves a change from bad towards good, or good towards bad. Complex plots have reversals and recognitions. These and suffering (or violence) are used to evoke the tragic emotions. The most tragic plot pushes a good character towards undeserved misfortune because of a mistake  (''[[hamartia]]''). Plots revolving around such a mistake are more tragic than plots with two sides and an opposite outcome for the good and the bad. Violent situations are most tragic if they are between friends and family. Threats can be resolved (best last) by being done in knowledge, done in ignorance and then discovered, almost be done in ignorance but be discovered in the last moment.

::Actions should be follow logically from the situation created by what has happened before, and from the character of the agent. This goes for recognitions and reversals as well, as even surprises are more satisfying to the audience if they afterwards are seen as a plausible or necessary consequence.

* [[Character (arts)|character]] (''[[ethos]]'')
::Character is the moral or ethical character of the agents. It is revealed when the agent makes moral choices. In a perfect tragedy, the character will support the plot, which means personal motivations and traits will somehow connect parts of the cause-and-effect chain of actions producing pity and fear. 
::Main character should be
::* good—Aristotle explains that audiences do not like, for example, villains "making fortune from misery" in the end. It might happen though, and might make the play interesting. Nevertheless, the moral is at stake here and morals are important to make people happy (people can, for example, see tragedy because they want to release their anger)
::* appropriate—if a character is supposed to be wise, it is unlikely he is young (supposing wisdom is gained with age)
::* consistent—if a person is a soldier, he is unlikely to be scared of blood (if this soldier is scared of blood it must be explained and play some role in the story to avoid confusing the audience); it is also "good" if a character doesn't change opinion "that much" if the play is not "driven" by who characters are, but by what they do (audience is confused in case of unexpected shifts in behaviour [and its reasons and morals] of characters)
::* "consistently inconsistent"—if a character always behaves foolishly it is strange if he suddenly becomes smart. In this case it would be good to explain such change, otherwise the audience may be confused. If character changes opinion a lot it should be clear he is a character who has this trait, not a real life person - this is also to avoid confusion
* thought (''[[dianoia]]'')—spoken (usually) reasoning of human characters can explain the characters or story background
* diction (''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'')  Lexis is better translated according to some as "speech" or "language."  Otherwise, the relevant necessary condition stemming from ''logos'' in the definition (language) has no followup:  mythos (plot) could be done by dancers or pantomime artists, given Chs 1, 2 and 4, if the actions are structured (on stage, as drama was usually done), just like plot for us can be given in film or in a story-ballet with no words.&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"/&gt;
::Refers to the quality of speech in tragedy. Speeches should reflect character, the moral qualities of those on the stage. The expression of the meaning of the words.
* melody (''melos'')  "Melos" can also mean "music-dance" as some musicologists recognize, especially given that its primary meaning in ancient Greek is "limb" (an arm or a leg).  This is arguably more sensible because then Aristotle is conveying what the chorus actually did.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2016a and 2016b&lt;/ref&gt;
::The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors. It should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action. Should be contributed to the unity of the plot. It is a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama. 
* spectacle (''[[opsis]]'')
::Refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes and props (anything you can see). Aristotle calls spectacle the "least artistic" element of tragedy, and the "least connected with the work of the poet (playwright). For example: if the play has "beautiful" costumes and "bad" acting and "bad" story, there is "something wrong" with it. Even though that "beauty" may save the play it is "not a nice thing".

He offers the earliest-surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyway, arising from an [[Improvisation|improvisatory]] beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the [[dithyramb]], and comedy from the leaders of the [[phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities) [...] (1449a10-13)&lt;ref&gt;
Janko (1987, 6). This text is [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a available online] in an older translation, in which the same passage reads: "At any rate it originated in improvisation—both tragedy itself and [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]. The one tragedy came from the prelude to the dithyramb and the other comedy from the prelude to the [[Fertility rite|phallic songs]] which still survive as institutions in many cities."
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Poetique Aristote Arabe 2346.jpg|thumbnail|Arabic translation of the ''Poetics'' by [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus|Abū Bishr Mattā]].]]
The Arabic version of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' that influenced the [[Middle Ages]] was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated ''Paris 1741.''  The [[Syriac language | Syriac-language]] source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original ''Poetics'' and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Hardison, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paris 1741'' appears online at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France).&lt;ref&gt;To obtain it on images or on a pdf format, follow this route: &gt; http://www.bnf.fr/; &gt; COLLECTIONS ET SERVICES; &gt; Catalogues; &gt; Accès à BnF archives et manuscrits; &gt; Collections; &gt; Département des Manuscrits; &gt; Grec; &gt; Manuscrits grecs - Présentation du fonds. &gt; Grec 1741 &gt; Download Images or pdf. The Poetics begins at 184r, page 380 of the pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle's ''Poetics'' included [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition|pages= 15–16

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Portraits_Inc_Park_Ave.jpg|thumb|Portraits, Inc.'s [[Park Avenue]] gallery mid 20th century]]
===New York===
Portraits, Inc., was founded in New York City in 1942 by [[Mary Quinn Sullivan#A collection dispersed|Lois Shaw]], an [[Art dealer|art]] and [[antiques dealer]] and socialite. The idea began as a partnership between Mrs. Shaw and the [[USO]] in the early 1940s. At this time Mrs. Shaw hosted weekly studio parties in her [[Park Avenue]] gallery in which she asked guest portrait artist to create drawings from life of the [[United States Armed Forces|military]] men and women in attendance. The portraits of men and women in [[Uniforms of the United States Armed Forces|uniform]] were sent as [[Mat (picture framing)|matted]] works of art to the families of the sitters.
At the time there were not galleries in New York dedicated to the exhibition of fine portraiture. Mrs. Shaw announced a gallery service for living portrait artists called "The Portrait Painters' Clearing House," then, in 1942, founded Portraits, Inc.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |title= Portraits, Inc.: Portrait center of America [ad] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHtOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=%22Lois+Shaw%22+us+government+portrait&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Msa9O3dd8&amp;sig=b7NzAhdw26bqSp4t-FYA7WE2ZKc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1hrTCn_PXAhVKQiYKHTitAEwQ6AEIajAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lois%20Shaw%22%20us%20government%20portrait&amp;f=false |journal=Art News Annual |volume=21–24 |page=173.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Shaw was soon joined by [[Helen Appleton Read]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/helen-appleton-read-papers-9184 “Helen Appleton Read papers, [ca. 1920]-1974"] "[[Smithsonian]] Archives of American Art".

The '''Praetorians Relief''' is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] marble relief dated to {{circa|51–52}} AD and housed in the [[Louvre-Lens]].&lt;ref name="afa"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.afaweb.org/exhibitions/details/documents/HighlightsofRomanArtfromtheLouvre.pdf| title =Highlights of Roman art from the Louvre|publisher =[[American Federation of Arts]]| page=3|accessdate =23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts three soldiers in [[Relief#High relief|high relief]] in the foreground, while two others in the background, accompanied by a standard bearer, are made in [[bas-relief]]. The standard-bearer holds an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila standard]], where the eagle grasps a thunderbolt in its talons. The soldiers have been identified as [[Praetorians]] due to the richness of the apparel, particularly the helmets, the ceremonial dress and oval shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Lawrence Keppie | title =The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire| publisher =University of Oklahoma Press | year =1998 | pages =233–234 | isbn =0806130148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are wearing [[calcei]] and not [[caligae]], worn by ordinary soldiers. However, according to [[Boris Rankov]], "the [[Attic helmet|Attic-style helmets]] are almost certainly an artistic convention".&lt;ref name="Rankov"&gt;{{cite book | author =Boris Rankov | title =The Praetorian Guard| publisher =Osprey Publishing | year =1994 | page =20 | isbn =1855323613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankov suggests that "early in their history the Praetorians were still using the [[Montefortino helmet|Montefortino-style helmet]] normal in the [[Roman legion|legions]] of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]".&lt;ref name="Rankov"/&gt;

The relief was previously dated to the early 2nd century AD. The lower half of the left-hand figure, portions of the middle two and the heads of all three foreground figures are modern restorations. In 2006 the relief underwent restoration by N. Imbert and A. Méthivier.&lt;ref name="Ancientrome"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ancientrome.ru/art/artwork/img.htm?id=2537| script-title=ru:Рельеф с преторианцами |publisher =Ancientrome.ru| language=Russian|accessdate =23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The Praetorians Relief was once part of the [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|Arch of Claudius]], erected in 51 to commemorate the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]].&lt;ref name="afa"/&gt; The relief is mentioned already in the 16th century. The head of the standard-bearer is depicted in ''Album'' by [[Pierre Jacques de Reims]], on the page dated to 1577.&lt;ref name="Ancientrome"/&gt; The relief was once in the possession of the [[Mattei family]], in 1824 it was purchased by the French.

The 72 stone steps before the entrance of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], have become known as the "'''Rocky Steps'''" as a result of the scene from the film ''[[Rocky (film)|Rocky]]''.  Tourists often mimic Rocky's famous climb, a metaphor for an underdog or an everyman rising to a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visitphilly.com/museums-attractions/philadelphia/the-rocky-statue-and-the-rocky-steps/ | title=The Rocky Statue and the Rocky Steps | publisher=Visit Philadelphia | work=VisitPhilly.com | accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze '''''Rocky'' statue''' was briefly situated at the top of the steps for the filming of ''[[Rocky III]]''. This statue, now located at the bottom right of the steps, is a popular photo opportunity for visitors. The top of the steps offers a commanding view of [[Eakins Oval]], the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]], and [[Philadelphia City Hall]].

In 2006, Rocky creator [[Sylvester Stallone]] recounted the genesis of the iconic scene: (while filming the 1976 movie) the film crew, bound by a tight budget, identified the steps one night while searching for filming locations around the city. Stallone first thought Rocky should carry his dog Butkus up the steps, but the big [[bull mastiff]] proved too heavy for the scene to work. Still, the view from the top of the stairs inspired him to reshoot the scene without the dog. Also in ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', Rocky lifts his dog Punchy when he reaches the top of the steps. The [[closing credits]] of ''Rocky Balboa'' show a montage of dozens of people running up the steps.

This scene was one of the first uses in a major film of the [[Steadicam]], a stabilized camera mount that allows its operator to walk and even climb steps while smoothly filming.&lt;ref name="steadicam30anniv"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html | title=Steadicam Celebrates its 30th Anniversary at NAB 2005 | publisher=Tiffen | date=April 2005 | accessdate=March 3, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430033456/http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html | archivedate=April 30, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze ''Rocky'' statue==
[[File:Philly042107-014-RockyStatue.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Rocky'' statue, situated just northeast of the steps]] [[File:Philadelphia skyline-daytime.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Ben Franklin Parkway from the top of the steps]]
Before ''Rocky III'', released in 1982, Stallone commissioned [[A. Thomas Schomberg]] to create a bronze statue of Rocky.&lt;ref name="pophistorydig"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=rocky-statue-philadelphia-art-museum | title=The Rocky Statue | work=The Pop History Dig | date=2009-07-20 | author=Doyle, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three 2-ton, 10-foot-tall copies were to be cast. One was installed atop the steps for the filming of ''Rocky III'', and was ultimately relocated at the bottom of the steps. The second ''Rocky'' is in the [[San Diego Hall of Champions|San Diego Hall of Champions Sports Museum]] in [[San Diego, California]].  The third was planned, but was not cast at the time.

A third casting of the statue was put up for auction to raise funds for charities.  The third was listed on [[eBay]] three separate times between 2002-2005, with a starting bid of US$5,000,000, then US$3,000,000, and finally US$1,000,000 to raise funds for the International Institute for Sport and Olympic History. In 2006, Schomberg studios realized the casting mold for the statue was beginning to decay, and had a third and final edition of the statue cast in bronze. The third statue is currently exhibited at the Schomberg's gallery in Colorado &lt;ref name="pophistorydig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.harveyabramsbooks.com/501c3press1.html | title=Yo!

After filming was complete, a debate arose between the Art Museum and Philadelphia's Art Commission over the meaning of "[[art]]". City officials, who argued that the ''Rocky'' statue was not "art" but a "movie [[Theatrical property|prop]]", eventually moved it to the front of the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rose|first= Joel|date= July 30, 2006|title= ‘Prop’ Culture? Rocky Statue Blurs Art Line|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5593082|newspaper= WHYY National Public Radio, All Things Considered|location= Philadelphia, PA |access-date=December 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of ''[[Rocky V]]'', then brought back to the Spectrum. The statue was replaced with a bronze inlay of Converse sneaker footprints with the name "Rocky" above them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/the-rocky-statue-1980-2009/|title= The Rocky Statue: 1980-2009|last= Doyle|first= Jack |date= July 20, 2009|website= pophistorydig.com|publisher= |access-date= December 16, 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2006, the ''Rocky'' statue was returned to the Art Museum and placed on a pedestal in a grassy area near the foot of the steps to the right of the Museum. The unveiling ceremony included live music, the debut of the first full trailer for ''Rocky Balboa,'' and a free showing of the first ''Rocky'' movie. At the ceremony, Philadelphia Mayor [[John F. Street|John Street]] said that the steps were one of Philly's biggest tourist attractions, and that Stallone, a native [[New York City|New Yorker]], had become "the city's favorite adopted son".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/08/AR2006090801620_pf.html | title=Rocky Is Back Where He Belongs | work=The Washington Post | date=2006-09-08 | agency=The Associated Press | accessdate=March 3, 2014 | author=Gelston, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rocky'' film scene has become a cultural icon. Many tourists visit the steps to recreate the scene themselves.&lt;ref name="straziuso20040701"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/01/entertainment/main627057.shtml | title=Nostalgic Jaunt To 'Rocky' Steps | work=CBS News | date=2004-07-01 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=March 24, 2013 | author=Straziuso, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E!|E!

The steps are the backdrop for the annual Independence Day celebration, and have often been featured in large concerts such as [[Live 8]]. Two journalists from the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' spent a year interviewing people who ran the steps, and published a book in 1996 called ''Rocky Stories: Tales of Love, Hope, and Happiness at America's Most Famous Steps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vitez | first = Michael | title = Rocky stories : tales of love, hope, and happiness at America's most famous steps | publisher = Paul Dry Books | location = Philadelphia, Pa | year = 2006 | isbn = 1589880293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2017 NFL Draft]] was held from the steps, the first time the NFL draft was held outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parkway, and perhaps Rocky steps, to be stage for 2017 NFL draft|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160902_Parkway_and_perhaps_Rocky_Steps_to_be_stage_for_2017_NFL_Draft.html|publisher=philly.com|date=September 2, 2016|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene has inspired homages and parodies since Rocky was released in 1976.
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]", [[Lisa Simpson]] runs up a flight of stairs wearing a tracksuit similar to Rocky's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 September 2006|url = http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/im-spelling-as-fast-as-i-can/episode/181997/trivia.html|title = I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can @ TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film ''[[In Her Shoes (2005 film)|In Her Shoes]]'', [[Toni Collette]]'s character, Rose Feller, runs up the steps with four dogs.
* On an episode of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]'', the character Will, while back in Philly, trains for a big fight against a former childhood bully; the training ends with Will running up the steps to "[[Gonna Fly Now]]", and celebrating and passing out, where a passer-by steals his wallet and hat.
* In the [[Eddie Murphy]] movie ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', [[Sherman Klump]] runs up the steps to one of his college's buildings, parodying the scene.
* Participants in Philadelphia's monthly [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bike ride generally finish up by cycling to the Rocky Steps, hoisting their bicycles, running up the steps, then lifting their bikes above their heads.
* In a [[Reebok]] campaign, [[Allen Iverson]], then with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], ran up the steps while dribbling a basketball.
* In the ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' episode, "The Witches of Pennbrook" Eric says that he and Jack are going to run up the steps and had been planning it for months.
* In the opening episode of the 2005 boxing reality television series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]'' (which featured and was executive produced by Stallone), Philadelphia native [[Najai Turpin]] ran up the steps.

Alland's work focuses on social justice, language, humour and experimental forms.

==Life and work==
Sandra Alland grew up in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], a suburb of [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. She was raised by a Scottish migrant father and grandfather, and a mother of French-Canadian and Dutch descent. The first in her family to attend university, Alland completed undergraduate studies in Drama at the [[University of Toronto]], graduating with high distinction in 2000.

Alland began publishing and performing her work in Toronto in 1995. From 1995 to 1997, she was part of the [[performance poetry]] band Stumblin' Tongues, with Bermudian poet [[Andra Simons]] and musicians Garth and Grant Kien. Alland worked extensively in Toronto's theatre, literary and visual art communities until she relocated to Scotland in 2007.

Alland has published two collections of poetry: ''Proof of a Tongue'' (McGilligan Books, 2004) and ''Blissful Times'' (BookThug, 2007). In 2009, Edinburgh's Forest Publications published a chapbook of her short stories, ''Here's to Wang.'' Her poetry chapbook ''Naturally Speaking,'' a meditation on disability poetics and gender, was published in 2012 by Toronto's espresso&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Fresh_start-12877.aspx|title=Fresh Start|last=Dupuis|first=Chris|date=November 30, 2012|work=Xtra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was joint winner of the 2013 [[bpNichol]] Chapbook Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meetthepresses.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/2013-bpnichol-chapbook-award-winners-announced/|title=2013 bpNichol Chapbook Award Winners Announced!|last=Award|first=bpNichol|date=November 18, 2013|work=Meet the Presses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a four-star performance review in December 2007, Edinburgh's ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'' said: "(In) Sandra Alland's brilliant [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]] cut-ups...the images come so fast you sometimes feel like a Slinky falling down the stairs, yet the emotion and intention are clear, moving, and often funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/latest/40973-whos_your_dandy_word_power_books_edinburgh_12_nov|title=Who's Your Dandy|last=MacDonald|first=Hamish|date=December 7, 2007|work=The Skinny}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2009, Glasgow's ''Lock Up Your Daughters'' magazine said: "Reminiscent of [[Miranda July]] and complemented by a deadpan delivery, Alland's words are at once both drolly funny and sweetly strange."

In 2017 co-edited ''Stairs and Whispers: D/deaf and Disabled Poets Write Back'' (Nine Arches Press).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ninearchespress.com/publications/poetry-collections/stairs%20and%20whispers.html "Stairs and Whispers: D/deaf and Disabled Poets Write Back"], Nine Arches Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Alland's writing has been published internationally in anthologies including ''Protest: Stories of Resistance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://glasgowreviewofbooks.com/2017/11/15/some-thoughts-on-protest/|title=SOME THOUGHTS ON ‘PROTEST’|last=Bell|first=Henry|date=November 15, 2017|work=Glasgow Review of Books|access-date=June 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Comma Press]]), ''Thought X: Fictions and Hypotheticals'' (Comma Press), ''The Mirror in the Mirror'' (Comma Press), ''The State of the Arts: Living with Culture in Toronto'' ([[Coach House Books]]), ''radiant danse uv being: A Poetic Portrait of [[bill bissett]]'' (blewointment), ''Red Light: Superheroes, Saints, and Sluts'' ([[Arsenal Pulp Press]]), ''My Lump in the Bed: Love Poems for George W.

In autumn 2009, Scotland's ultimatemetal.com said of her work: "A very unique mix of poetry, music, stories and just plain weird. The poetry was sharp and funny, the placement effective, the visuals fitting; a rather unforgettable experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/live-reviews/531551-cocoon-counter-culture-festival-edinburgh-scotland-12-13-september-2009-a.html|title=Cocoon Counter Culture Festival|last=Brand|first=Simon|date=September 30, 2009|work=Ultimate Metal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alland is featured in [[Andrea Brady]]'s Archive of the Now ([[Queen Mary University of London|Queen Mary]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archiveofthenow.org/authors/?i=182|title=Archive of the Now|last=Brady|first=Andrea|date=October 2013|website=www.archiveofthenow.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Santo Tomás de las Ollas''' hermitage is situated in the town with the same name close to [[Ponferrada]], [[León, Spain|León]] ([[Spain]]).

==History==
[[Image:STdlO interior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Double horseshoe arch which separates the principal chapel from the nave.]]

The name of the hermitage, taken from the town Santo Tomás de las Ollas (St. Thomas of the [[Ollas]]), comes from the main occupation of that locality: pottery. They supplied to the [[Valle del Silencio]] zone.

The hermitage was donated to the community of [[San Pedro de Montes]] monastery by the [[Bishop of Astorga]].

Haydée (d. 2007) and Sahara (d. 2008) Scull, known as the Scull Twins or the Scull sisters, were Cuban-Chinese [[Folk art|Folk-artists]].

They typically created humorous three-dimensional paintings and sculptures of Old [[Havana]] and [[Florida]], using paper mache, wire and acrylic paint.  These now fetch high prices with collectors.

They were referenced in a song entitled ''Scull Twins'' by [[Duncan Browne]].

'''''Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Colouring Book''''' is a 2013 [[colouring book]] for adults by [[Johanna Basford]]. The book has been translated into 14 languages and has sold more than a million copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Keiligh |date=March 5, 2015 |title=The colour of money: British author sells more than a million copies around the world of her colouring-in books for grown-ups|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2981484/British-author-sells-million-copies-colouring-book-adults.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |location=[[UK]] |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the best-selling books on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="BusinessTimes" /&gt; 

Basford had been approached by [[Laurence King Publishing]] in 2011 after the publisher had seen Basford's work online. While the publisher originally wanted a colouring book for children, Basford proposed one for adults.&lt;ref name="BusinessTimes"/&gt;  Basford was inspired by several of her clients joking with her that they would enjoy colouring in her work, which was frequently done in [[black and white]].&lt;ref name="telegraph2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boztaz|first1=Senay|last2=Freeman|first2=Colin|title=Colouring-in craze causes pencil shortages|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/12199078/Colouring-in-craze-causes-pencil-shortages.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the publisher was reluctant to release such an unorthodox book. However they eventually relented and the first run quickly sold out.&lt;ref name="telegraph2016"/&gt; The book's success is frequently cited as  starting the adult coloring book trend. &lt;ref name="BusinessTimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herman |first=Barbara |date=March 30, 2015 |title='Secret Garden' Colouring Book Outsells Harper Lee As Adults Seek 'Digital Detox'|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/secret-garden-coloring-book-outsells-harper-lee-adults-seek-digital-detox-1863678 |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |location= |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="telegraph2016"/&gt;The book is modelled after the [[Brodick Castle]] Gardens on the [[Isle of Arran]] where Basford played as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frank |first=Priscilla |date=March 24, 2015 |title=A Colouring Book For Adults, Because Everyone Deserves To Unleash Their Inner Creative|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/24/johanna-basford_n_6925752.html |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |location= |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By August 2015, Secret Garden had sold 2 million copies worldwide and launched the colouring trend for adults. In 2013, Basford released a second book: ''Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest &amp; Colouring Book'', and a third, ''Lost Ocean: An Inky Adventure and Colouring Book'' in October 2015.

'''''Spring Day''''' (Russian: [http://cyclowiki.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C_(%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%9D._%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0) ''Весенний день (картина Н. Позднеева)''] is a painting by the well-known Russian artist [[Nikolai Pozdneev|Nikolai Matveevich Pozdneev]]&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Members of the Union of Artists of USSR. Volume 2.''- Moscow: Soviet artist, 1979. P. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; (1930–1978). It attempts to convey the mood of Soviet society of the late 1950s to the early 1960s.

==History==
''Spring Day'' was one of the first original genre compositions by Nikolai Pozdneev. He developed the theme for the first time raised three years earlier in his graduate painting ''From the School'' (1956, now reside in collection of the Pskov Painting Gallery). The first version of painting shown in 1960 on the principal Art Show in Leningrad&lt;ref&gt;''Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1960. Exhibition catalogue.'' - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1961. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Moscow&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Russia. The Republic Exhibition of 1960. Exhibition catalogue.'' - Moscow: Soviet Artist, 1960. P. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; the author does not fully satisfied. Pozdneev repainted the picture, making it a more extended vertically. A group of children has shifted from the center to the upper left corner. The bold decision proved justified: composition of the painting acquired aspiration, which is consistent with the general concept of the work. Were reinforced color accents, the lighter has become the whole palette of the picture. As a result, in the work began to fully feel the air of spring and hope, in tune with the mood of the era turn of the decades.

From 1960 to 1980, ''Spring Day'' was kept in the artist's family. In 1994, after a long pause, it was featured at the [[Leningrad painting of 1950-1980s (Saint Petersburg, 1994)|''Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School'']] Art Show in the Exhibition Halls of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paintings of 1950-1980s by the Leningrad School's artists. Exhibition catalogue.'' Saint Petersburg, Saint Petersburg Union of Artists, 1994. P.4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995-1996 ''Spring Day'' was exhibited in Saint Petersburg in the ''Nekrasov Memorial Museum'' at the exhibitions [[Lyrical motifs in postwar Leningrad painting (Saint Petersburg, 1995)|''The Lyrical motive in painting of artists of the WWII generation'']],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyrical motifs in postwar Leningrad painting (Saint Petersburg, 1995)|''Lyrical motives in the works of artists of the WWII generation. Painting, drawings. Exhibition catalogue.'']] Saint Petersburg, Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial museum, 1995. P.6.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School (Saint Petersburg, 1996)|''Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School (Saint Petersburg, 1996)|''Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School. Exhibition catalogue'']]. Saint Petersburg, Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial museum, 1996. P.6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting was reproduced on the official poster and cover of exhibition catalog. 

In 2007 the ''Spring Day'' was reproduced and described among 350 art works by Leningrad artists in the book «''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School''»,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclowiki.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%86%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC._%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0 Sergei V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6234">[[Image:Standrewssarcophagus.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The St Andrews Sarcophagus.]]

The '''Saint Andrews Sarcophagus''' is a [[Picts|Pictish]] monument dating from the second half of the 8th century. The [[sarcophagus]] was recovered beginning in 1833 during excavations by [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrew's Cathedral]], but it was not until 1922 that the surviving components were reunited. The sarcophagus is currently on display at the Cathedral museum in [[St Andrews]], close to the site of its discovery.

==Description==
As originally constructed the sarcophagus would have comprised two side panels, two end panels, four corner pieces and a roof slab. The roof slab is entirely missing, as are most of one side and one end panel and a corner piece so that the extant sarcophagus is essentially L-shaped. The external dimensions of the sarcophagus are 177&amp;nbsp;cm by 90&amp;nbsp;cm and a height of 70&amp;nbsp;cm. The stone used is a local sandstone.

The surviving side panel shows, from right to left, a figure breaking the jaws of a lion, a mounted hunter with his sword raised to strike a leaping lion, and hunter on foot, armed with a spear and assisted by a hunting dog, about to attack a wolf. Although it is not certain that the first two figures represent the same person, 19th century illustrations depict them as if they are. The surviving end panel is much simpler, essentially a cross with four small panels between the arms. The fragments of the missing end panel are similar, but not identical, to the surviving one.

==Discovery==
The Sarcophagus was discovered within the grounds of The Cathedral near the St Regulus Chapel.  The Cathedral had been in use from when it was constructed during the 1100s until it was stripped of all its altars and images, left in ruins and abandoned after 1559 during the Reformation.  Much of its remaining stonework was recycled over the years into buildings in the town of [[St Andrews]].&lt;ref name=Buist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buist|first1=George|editor1-last=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|title=On the Ancient Sculptured Monument Discovered at St Andrews, in 1833 [speech given February 27, 1854]|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|date=1855|volume=1|pages=234–237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyI9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 27, 2016|publisher=Neill &amp; Company|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical opinion==
[[Image:ÓengusmacFergusa.JPG|300px|thumb|right|This is the royal figure on the St Andrew's sarcophagus. The figure is dressed like a late Roman emperor, bearing on the neckline of the garment what is probably a ''kaiserfibel'' like that depicted on [[Justinian]] in the mosaic at [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]. This is in the grandest tradition of ''imitatio imperii''. It may therefore be taken as an indirect depiction of the king who commissioned it.&lt;ref&gt;See T. M. Charles Edwards, "'The Continuation of Bede', s.a. 750: high-kings of Tara and 'Bretwaldas'".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Historians differ on who was likely to have been interred in the sarcophagus. Although it is generally presumed that it was commissioned by the [[List of kings of the Picts|Pictish King]] [[Óengus I|Óengus, or Onuist]], a Christian who died in 761, whether it was actually used for his corpse,&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Douglas.

'''Sword swallowing''' is a skill in which the performer passes a [[sword]] through the mouth and down the esophagus to the [[stomach]]. This feat is not [[swallowing]] in the traditional sense; the natural processes that constitute swallowing do not take place, but are repressed in order to keep the passage from the [[mouth]] to the stomach open for the sword. The practice is dangerous and there is risk of injury or death.

==History==
[[File:The great Victorina Troupe.jpg|thumb|alt=circus poster: The great Victorina Troupe|The Great Victorina Troupe: originators and presenters of the most marvelous sword swallowing act on earth|left]]
[[File:Sword swallower in 1980.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;Center&gt;Street performer&lt;/center&gt;]]

Sword swallowing spread to [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] in the 1st century AD and to [[China]] in the 8th century. In [[Japan]], it became a part of the Japanese acrobatic theatre, [[Sarugaku|Sangaku]], which included [[fire eating]], [[tightrope walking]], [[juggling]] and early [[illusion]]. In [[Europe]] it developed into yet a third distinct type of performance associated with the medieval [[jongleur]]s, that of the [[busking|street performance]].

Sword swallowing was performed during the [[Middle Ages]] as part of [[street theatre]] and was popular at festivals and other large gatherings. It began to die out in the mid-19th century, and was outlawed in Scandinavia in 1893.

According to an early 19th-century English magazine article&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvQ0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=%22jugglers+in+india,+from+a+late+narrative%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4xvhdvcBFJ&amp;sig=0uXUrVhapNx1Vv3EYtqO2L68QMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iCXQUr2TEIWe0QXb3YDgCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jugglers%20in%20india%2C%20from%20a%20late%20narrative%22&amp;f=false] 'Jugglers in India, from a late narrative', quoted in ''Select Reviews and Spirit of Foreign Magazines'', ed. Enos Bronson, Philadelphia, 1810: p.124&lt;/ref&gt; the abilities of sword-swallowers in India were considered incredible when first reported in England.  In 1813 'swallowing the sword' was advertised as among the new and astonishing feats&lt;ref&gt;'The swallowing of the sword, and the novelty of the other performances, have attracted the attention of the public beyond any thing that has appeared in the metropolis for many years past.' ''The Times''(London, England), 27 July 1813, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Indian Jugglers surprised the town by swallowing a sword...' ''The Times'',(London, England), 30 September 1820, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; performed by the Indian Jugglers then appearing in London. The troupe was led by the famous juggler and sword swallower Ramo Samee, who continued to perform until his death in London in August 1850, having at times also toured Europe and America.&lt;ref&gt;Article from the ''Salem Gazette'', 5 October 1819&lt;/ref&gt; From 1850 to the 1890s a small number of sword swallowers performed in the UK, such as Martha Mitchell (c 1855) and Benedetti (1863–95), and in the US, including Lawson Peck (c 1850s), Ling Look (c 1872), Wandana (died May 9, 1875), and Harry Parsons (died December 1880).  The best-known North American sword swallower of this time was Fred McLone, better known to the public as "Chevalier Cliquot", who performed from 1878 to the early 20th century.

In 1893 sword swallowing was featured at the [[World Columbian Exposition]] at the Chicago World's Fair.

In the early 1900s traveling [[circuses]] and [[sideshow]]s featured sword swallowers. In Europe performers tried to swallow large numbers of swords; in America there was a focus on the novel and bizarre.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} Some tried to swallow longer swords, many swords, hot swords, [[bayonet]]s or glowing [[neon sign|neon tubes]].  Sword swallowers appeared on the same bill as magicians such as [[Houdini]]. [[Western Europe]] and [[England]] also saw an increase in sword swallowing interest during this period, with many cross-Atlantic influences. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, traveling magic shows from the Orient toured Europe and America; some included sword swallowing. The middle of the 20th century saw a demise in circuses in general and [[sideshow]]s in particular.

==Anatomy and method==
[[Image:Pharynx.gif|thumb|alt=pharynx|The pharynx|201x201px]]The performer must first lean the head back, hyper-extending the neck, and relax the upper esophageal sphincter (a generally involuntary muscle that contracts the top of the esophagus). Retching must be controlled while the sword, lubricated by saliva, is inserted through the mouth and past the pharynx.

Once past the pharynx and sphincter the sword passes swiftly, assisted by gravity, straightening the flexible esophagus. The stomach, at an angle to the esophagus, is brought into line as the sword enters through the cardiac opening.&lt;ref name="SSU"&gt;Witcombe, Brian. [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7524/1080?? "Sword swallowing uncertainties."] ''British Medical Journal.'' 5 Nov 2005. Retrieved 16 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some swallowers consume a large meal or drink water before performing to give the stomach a more vertical orientation, allowing for easier passage of the sword.&lt;ref name="SSU"/&gt;  Careful focus is required to complete the process without injury, as the sword passes within millimetres of vital body parts such as the aorta, heart and lungs.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt;

==Physical consequences==

Most serious sword swallowing injuries and fatalities occur after minor injuries or while attempting a feat beyond that of a "normal" sword swallow.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; The most common injury is a sore throat when first learning, after frequent consecutive performances, or after swallowing curved swords or several swords at once.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; Swallowing multiple swords simultaneously over time can also lead to distension of the esophagus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/ "Sword Diet Did Not Agree: M'Lone's Exhibition Had Rather Serious Results."] ''New York Times.'' 21 Jan. 1894. Retrieved 29 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A minor injury may predispose the performer to sustaining a more major one, including perforation of the esophagus, stomach, heart, lungs, and other organs in proximity to the path of the sword, or intestinal bleeding. Twenty-nine deaths have been reported as a result of sword swallowing injuries since 1880.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt;

===Medical case reports===
* A 59-year-old man experienced chest pain and severe dysphagia following practice for his sword swallowing act. An esophageal perforation was found and surgically repaired; 19 days later a leak at the site required a transhiatal esophagectomy with a left cervical esophagogastrostomy. The patient recovered normally, but ceased the practice of sword swallowing.&lt;ref name="EPSS"&gt;Scheinin, Scott A., MD, and Patrick R. Wells, MD. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC101136/ "Esophageal Perforation in a Sword Swallower."] ''Texas Heart Institute Journal.'' 28(2001): 65-68. {{PMC|101136}}. 17 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 27-year-old woman reported neck pain and a single episode of hematemesis (vomiting blood) after pricking her throat while practicing her sword swallowing act with a sharp dagger. The injury was found to be immediately below the esophageal sphincter, and the patient was admitted to intensive care and placed on intravenous antibiotics and a proton-pump inhibitor. She recovered well and returned to all previous activities with the exception of sword swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Matthew MD, Scott Steele, MD, Philip Mullenix, MD, William Long, MD, and Seth Izenberg, MD.

==Contributions to science==
[[File:Hans Rosling swallows sword.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rosling]] of Gapminder Foundation swallows a [[bayonet]] during his [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk]]The abilities of sword-swallowers have proven useful to the progress of medical knowledge, specifically in the development and advancement of upper endoscopy.&lt;ref name="EPSS"/&gt;

In 1868 Adolf Kussmaul of Freiburg, Germany, performed an esophagoscopy on a sword-swallower using a rigid 47&amp;nbsp;cm tube, mirrors, and a gasoline lamp.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; The apparatus, an early endoscope, allowed him to examine the esophagus and the fundus of the stomach.&lt;ref name="EPSS"/&gt;

In 1897 a Scottish physician named Stevens performed digestive experiments with a sword swallower assistant; small metal tubes, pierced with holes and filled with meat, were swallowed and after a time regurgitated, allowing Stevens to examine the extent of the digestion that had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Albert A. ''Magic, Stage Illusions, and Scientific Diversions, Including Trick Photography''. New York: Munn &amp; Co., Inc., 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 a doctor named Cremer performed an electrocardiogram by passing an electrode down the  esophagus of a sword swallower.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This approach has since been proven useful by numerous studies; esophageal recording at a location in proximity to the heart improves signal detection.&lt;ref&gt;Machler, Heinrich E. et al. [http://www.anesthanalg.com/content/86/1/34.full.pdf+html "A New High-Resolution Esophageal Electrocardiography Recording Technique: An Experimental Approach for the Detection of Myocardial lschemia."] ''Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia.'' 86.1 (1998): 34-39. 21 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2006, a research study on the effects of sword swallowing was conducted by Brian Witcombe, consultant radiologist at the [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]] in Gloucester, England, and Dan Meyer. The results were published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;Witcombe, Brian and Meyer, Dan. [http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7582/1285.full ' 'Sword swallowing and its side effects.' '] ''British Medical Journal.'' 23 Dec. 2006. Retrieved 16 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Dan Meyer worked with physicians and researchers in swallowing disorders at Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Center at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] to explore whether the techniques involved in sword swallowing could be used to help patients who suffer from swallowing disorders such as [[dysphagia]] or [[achalasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vanderbiltstallworthrehab.com/en/healthcare-professionals/leading-technologies/vitastim-therapy |title=Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Center |publisher=Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Center |date= |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Dai Andrews]] worked with Dr. Sharon Caplan at [[Johns Hopkins University]] on a study to determine whether sword swallowing could be used to help patients who suffer from [[achalasia]], or those who had suffered severe throat trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/256861/how-to-swallow-a-sword|title=How to swallow a sword|author=Amy Kraft|publisher=The Week|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Guinness World Records''==
In 2009, the [[Guinness World Record]] for longest sword swallowed was achieved by Natasha Veruschka with a 58&amp;nbsp;cm (22.83&amp;nbsp;in) long sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/longest-sword-swallowed/|title=Longest Sword Swallowed|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guinness World Record for 'Most swords swallowed underwater' is 4 and was achieved by Chayne Hultgren (a.k.a. [[Space Cowboy (performer)|The Space Cowboy]], Australia) on the set of 'Lo Show dei Record' in Milan, Italy, on 11 July 2014. He was also the first person to swallow a sword underwater on May 9, 2006 at Manly Ocean World Aquarium in Sydney Australia. He performed this under water feat in a tank of live sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-swords-swallowed-underwater|title=Most swords swallowed underwater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chayne Hultgren (a.k.a. The Space Cowboy) also holds the most official 'Guinness World Record' for sword swallowing including 'Most swords swallowed at once' (24 swords), 'Most swords swallowed while juggling' (18 swords), 'Most swords swallowed while riding a unicycle' (3 swords swallowed on a 3m tall unicycle) and 'Longest lightning bolt to strike swallowed sword'. The measured distance the stream of electrical discharge traveled from Australia's largest Tesla Coil, owned and operated by Peter Terren (AKA: Dr Electric), to the handle of Chayne's swallowed sword was 3 feet 10 inches. The sword blade measured 62&amp;nbsp;cm and was swallowed all the way to the hilt on the 20th of April 2013. Perth, WA, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UMclIYkApM|title=Shocking World Record by The Space Cowboy!!!

As of July 2016 The Space Cowboy currently holds 44 official [[Guinness World Records]]. He is Australia's most prolific record breaker.

In 2009, the Guinness World Record for "Largest Curve in a Sword Swallowed" was achieved by [[Dai Andrews]] with a 120 degree curved sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/largest-curve-in-a-sword-swallowed/|title=Largest Curve in a Sword Swallowed|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brad Byers]] holds the Guinness World Record for "The Most Swords Swallowed and Twisted at One Time" by swallowing ten 27 inch swords one at a time and then twisting all ten swords 180 degrees in his throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-11000/most-swords-swallowed-and-twisted/|title=Most Swords Swallowed and Twisted|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Blackthorne made the sword known as "The Sword of Swords".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1193">The '''''Symphony in G Major ("Mannheim No. 1")''''' is a Mannheim symphony that was proposed to be by [[Johann Stamitz]], but probably written (but not proven to be) by [[Antoine Mahaut]], a close contemporary of the composer.  It was probably written from 1741 to 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes to Johann Stamitz Symphonies Vol. 1 on Naxos|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553194&amp;catNum=553194&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if it is truly a symphony by Stamitz, it could be his first.  But if it is by Mahaut, it probably is his first.  It is formed with the standard 3-movement symphonic scheme of the time:
#Allegro
#Larghetto
#Presto   
This symphony, just like the others by Stamitz or Mahaut, definitely influenced [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Mozart]].  It is about 7 minutes long.

'''Terribilità''', the spelling in modern Italian, or '''terribiltà''', as [[Michelangelo]]'s 16th century contemporaries tended to spell it, is a quality of provoking  terror (the literal meaning), awe, or a sense of the sublime, in the viewer, that is ascribed to his art.  It is perhaps especially applied to his [[sculpture]]s, such as his figures of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] or in [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].

[[Pope Julius II]] was apparently the first to describe Michelangelo as a ''uomo terribile'' ("terror-inducing man"), apparently describing his difficult character as much as his art. This ''terribilità'', also references the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonics]] of humanists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had known Michelangelo in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lleó Cañal, Vicente, Revista de Libros:Tintoretto 2, 2 Abril 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's friend and collaborator [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] reported in a letter to him of 15 October 1520 on a private audience with [[Pope Leo X]].  After praising Michelangelo's work, the pope continued "But he is ''terribile'', as you see; one cannot deal with him".  Sebastiano responded "that your ''terribile'' character did not harm anyone, and that you appear ''terribile'' for love of the great works you carry out."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition handlist for "Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano", 2017, National Gallery.

'''''The Murder of Andreas Baader''''' ({{Lang-no|'''Mordet på Andreas Baader'''}}) is a 1978 painting by the Norwegian artist [[Odd Nerdrum]]. It depicts the speculative murder of [[Andreas Baader]], one of the leaders of the terrorist organisation [[Red Army Faction]], in the [[Stammheim Prison]] in 1977.

The painting is in the collections of the [[Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art]] in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afmuseet.no/en/samlingen/utvalgte-kunstnere/n/odd-nerdrum/mordet-pa-andreas-baader|title=Mordet på Andreas Baader|publisher=[[Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Andreas Baader]] is partially naked in his cell in the [[Stammheim Prison]]. Two men hold Baader while a third lies beaten on the floor before him. A fourth man in trenchcoat executes Baader with a gun shot to the back of the neck. The men are positioned in the shape of a [[Saltire|St Andrew's Cross]]. The composition and [[chiaroscuro]] are inspired by [[Baroque]] art, with associations to [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Crucifixion of St. Peter (Caravaggio)|Crucifixion of St. Peter]]''.&lt;ref name="vetland"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vetland|first=Barbara|year=2010|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/24803/MasteroppgaveDUO.pdf|title=Den tidløse omsorgen – mor og barn motivet i Odd Nerdrums bilder|language=Norwegian|publisher=Institutt for filosofi, ide- og kunsthistorie og klassiske språk, [[University of Oslo]]|pp=26–28|quote=Det som særlig fascinerte var det uttrykk for det frie mennesket som jeg så i dem. Ellers hadde jeg sympati for Baader for så vidt som han var en av de mange som var villig for å dø for sin sak. For meg var han den kompromissløse, tragiske idealisten.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Baader had died on 18 October 1977 in what became known as the Stammheim "Death Night", when also [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] died. In the official version they committed suicide, but rumours and theories spread quickly that they had been murdered by secret agents. Nerdrum was an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] at the time he made the painting. He later described his attraction to the Baader-Meinhof group: "What particularly fascinated me was the expression of the free man that I saw in them. Otherwise I had sympathy for Baader to the extent that he was one of the many who were ready to die for their cause. To me he was the uncompromising, tragic idealist."&lt;ref name="vetland" /&gt;

==Reception==
The painting was presented at [[Høstutstillingen]] in Oslo in 1978. It immediately drew strong reactions in both Norway and Germany for its way of depicting a terrorist as a religious martyr, as well as supposing he was murdered. The painting established Nerdrum as a political voice in the Norwegian public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Steen|first=Thea|date=2012-09-07|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/09/06/kultur/kunst/hostutstillingen/odd_nerdrum/christopher_nielsen/23274283/|title=Dette nye Odd Nerdrum-maleriet kommer du til å bli advart mot|language=Norwegian|work=[[Dagbladet]]|accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="rijksmuseum"/&gt;

The [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] is {{convert|144|cm|in}} high and {{convert|171|cm|in}} wide. The painting's subject is a life-size&lt;ref&gt;van Luttervelt, Remmet, ''Masterpieces from the Great Dutch Museums: Rijksmuseum, Mauritshuis, Boymans-Van Beuningen, Frans Hals Museum'', p. 172, H.N. Abrams, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; [[mute swan|swan]] (''Cygnus olor'') defending its nest against a dog.&lt;ref name="rijksmuseum"/&gt; At the bottom right, the painting is signed with the [[monogram]] "A".&lt;ref name="rkd"&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/7695 Bedreigde zwaan; later opgevat als allegorie op Johan de Witt], [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]], 2012. Retrieved on 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1800 when it was purchased, the painting was interpreted as a political [[allegory]] of [[grand pensionary]] (the highest official in [[Holland]], the main province of the [[Dutch Republic]]) [[Johan de Witt]] protecting the country from its enemies.&lt;ref name="rijksmuseum"/&gt; Three inscriptions had been added: the words "de raad-pensionaris" (the grand pensionary) between the swan's legs, the words "de viand van de staat" (the enemy of the state) above the head of the dog on the left, and the name "[[Holland]]" on the egg on the right.&lt;ref name="rkd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cat&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalvan00schl#page/n18/mode/1up Catalog entry at 1800 purchase] for ''Een Levensgrote Zwaan in een Landschap''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1790s this painting was in the collection of [[Jan Gildemeester]] and was included in the 1800 catalog of paintings (ordered alphabetically by artist) produced for his estate sale, though it was not included in [[Adriaan de Lelie]]'s 1794 painting of the collection known as ''[[The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of works in the collection of Jan Gildemeester]]&lt;/ref&gt; The catalog states that it is an "allegory of Raadpensionaris de Witt".&lt;ref name=cat/&gt; The painting was purchased by the art dealer [[Cornelis Sebille Roos]] for 100 guilders for the Nationale Konst-Gallery in The Hague, on behalf of the director [[Alexander Gogel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002646 Cornelis Sebille Roos] in [[KNAW]] members list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifthenisnow.eu/fr/node/159786 Biography of Roos]&lt;/ref&gt; It is documented as the first purchase by that institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/denationalekonst00moes#page/n48/mode/1up De Nationale Konst-Gallery en het Koninklijk Museum, Amsterdam] by [[E.W. Moes]], 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the white text that was painted onto the painting was done during the [[Witten-Oorlog]].&lt;ref&gt;De inrichting van de Nationale Konst-Gallery in het openingsjaar 1800, by [[Pieter J.J. van Thiel]], Oud Holland, Vol. 95, No. 4 (1981), page 173&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was purchased for the Nationale Konst-Gallery in The Hague in 1800 based on its allegorical reference, but only later did visitors point out that the painter had died long before the murder of the De Witt brothers took place.

{{redirect|Triumphus|the Italian theologian|Augustinus Triumphus}}
A '''thriambus''' (also spelled '''thriamb''', '''thriambas''', or '''thriambos'''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θρίαμβος|θρίαμβος]]}}) is a [[hymn]] to [[Dionysus]], sung in processions in his honour, and at the same time an epithet of the god himself, according to  [[Diodorus]] (4.5.2):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Thriambus'' is a name that has been given him, they say, because he was the first of those of whom we have a record to have celebrated a triumph (''thriambos'') upon entering his native land after his campaign, this having been done when he returned from [[Ἰνδία|India]] with great booty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was loaned into [[Old Latin]] via [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] as ''{{lang|la|triumpus}}'', in [[Classical Latin]] taking the form ''{{lang|la|triumphus}}'', the [[Roman triumph]] where the victorious general takes the role of Dionysus as leader of the procession, later associated with {{lang|la|[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]}} rather than Dionysus. [[Arrian]] traces the custom to [[Alexander the Great]] when he states (''[[Anabasis Alexandri|Anabasis]]'' 6b.28):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Certain authors have said (though to me the statement seems incredible) that Alexander led his forces through [[Carmania (satrapy)|Carmania]] lying extended with his Companions upon two covered waggons joined together, the flute being played to him; and that the soldiers followed him wearing garlands and sporting. Food was provided for them, as well as all kinds of dainties which had been brought together along the roads by the Carmanians. They say that he did this in imitation of the Bacchic revelry of Dionysus, because a story was told about that deity, that after subduing the Indians he traversed the greater part of Asia in this manner and received the appellation of ''Thriambus'', and that for the same reason the processions in honour of victories after war were called ''thriambi''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term's etymology is connected with the word {{lang|grc|θρῖον}} "fig leaf" by [[Aemilius Luetcke]] (1829) who refers to the epithet {{lang|grc|Συκίτης}} "of the [[fig tree]]" of Dionysus.

An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] or [[Pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], and literally means "Dreischritt", i.&amp;nbsp;e., "three-step", compare ''[[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]]'' and ''[[dithyramb]]'', but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation.&lt;ref name="Versnel1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Versnel|first=H. S.|title=Triumphus: An Inquiry Into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPjBSq2jCrcC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=2 January 2015|year=1970|publisher=Brill Publishers|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=90-04-02325-9|pages=16–38|chapter=I. 2 Θρίαμβος}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Roman Greece]] (2nd century BC), the Greek term increasingly narrows to a translation of Latin ''[[:wikt:triumphus|triumphus]]''. In [[Modern Greek]], {{lang|el|θρίαμβος}} is used in the same generalized meaning as English ''[[:wikt:en:triumph|triumph]]''.

'''Timur Petrovich Novikov''' (September 24, 1958, [[Leningrad]] – May 23, 2002, [[St. Petersburg]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]], [[Drawing|graphic artist]],  [[designer]], [[Painting|painter]], [[Art theory|art theorist]] and [[curator]]. He is considered one of the most influential proponents of [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#The Petersburg group|Nonconformist Art]] before and after [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] in Russia.

==Life and work==

As he grew up in the [[Soviet Union]], Novikov experienced its cultural and political constraints. His artistic education began at the age of seven at the House of Pioneers in Leningrad, and later at the Young Art Historians Club at the [[Russian Museum]] in the same city.

In 1977 he became a member of the Letopis (Chronicles) art group; and in 1982 he founded the Novye khudozhniki (New Artists) movement. During the 1980s Novikov worked at the Russian Museum and enjoyed access to its collection and archive, as well as close working relationships with its curators. This connection lasted to when he started work as an artist. In 1990 and 1991 he studied as an intern at the Institut des Arts Plastiques (Institute of Plastic Arts) in [[Paris]], France.

During the 1980s and 1990s Novikov was a regular participant in the Pop Mekhanika show of experimental composer [[Sergey Kuryokhin]] and worked on its stage design. Several pop groups from the show worked with him to explore a new visual and stage design. In 1983 Novikov founded and led an experimental rock-group Novye Kompozitory (New Composers) and invented new musical instruments for it. He was also involved in a number of film projects as an actor and artist, and made a name as an innovative film designer. In 1987 Novikov shared the [[Nika Award]] for his contribution to the popular Russian film [[Assa (film)|Assa]], directed by [[Sergei Solovyov]].

The New Academy of Fine Arts, founded by Novikov in 1989, soon became a well-known meeting point for the Leningrad, Russian and international art scene and a symbol for the spirit of freedom and recomposition in the new Russia. The academy and artist community, named also after its address Pushkinskaya 10, was at first self-organized by artists. It later offered ateliers as well as regular courses for students, including scholarships. The academy, with Novikov as one of its most prominent teachers, was sometimes referred to as an underground art project, but also cooperated with established art institutions, among them the [[Russian Museum]] and the [[Hermitage Museum]].

The core conception of the academy was called Neo-Academism and comprised a specific teacher-student relationship as well as a focus on the historic and aesthetic perspective of [[Neoclassicism]].

Novikov also contributed to numerous art exhibitions outside Russia. His style of painting combined a bold avant-garde attitude with refined classically based conceptions of Neo-Academism. Furthermore, he contributed to contemporary [[art theory]], writing books such as "The New Russian Classicism" (1998), "Horizons" (2000), and "Intercontacts" (2000), published by the [[Russian Museum]].

A lengthy illness led to blindness in the later part of Novikov's career. He continued working as a lecturer at the New Academy and led assistants to work on graphic works. Novikov died of pneumonia on May 23, 2002, in St. Petersburg.

Posthumous exhibitions of Novikov's works were held at the Moscow Russian Museum and in Brussels in 2002, in Denmark 2004, London 2005 and 2012, and several times in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timurnovikov.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=23&amp;lang=en timurnovikov.ru: Personal exhibitions], registered Dec 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
In spring 2013 the Moscow Museum of Modern Art presented a large-scale solo retrospective of Novikov's work, curated by Ekaterina Andreeva, the leading academic researcher at the State Russian Museum and author of Novikov's biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmoma.ru/en/exhibitions/gogolevsky/timur/ mmoma.ru: Timur], registered Dec 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaboration'''

In 2015, the estate of Timur Novikov collaborated with Russian street wear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy. The resulting collection consisted of T-shirts, sweatshirts and caps incorporating designs from Novikov's work. The 'eternal sun' motif is the stand out design element and has previously been appropriated by Rubchinskiy, who greatly reveres his art. The pieces were very well received, selling out within minutes on the Dover Street Market e-shop.

The '''Trees of Life''' (Spanish: Árboles de la Vida) are a public art installation in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]]. Begun in 2013 to honor the 34th anniversary of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Sandinista Revolution]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/117612/psychedelic-symbols-of-state-power-in-nicaragua/|title=Psychedelic Symbols of State Power in Nicaragua|last=Mallonee|first=Laura C.|date=2014-03-31|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trees of Life are a city beautification project of First Lady [[Rosario Murillo]], who has also served as Nicaragua's Vice President since 2017.

[[File:Artificial flowers on the streets of the city.jpg|thumb|left|Trees of Life in daylight, Managua, 2017]]
The approximately 140 abstract, brightly colored tree sculptures were reportedly inspired by the 1909 work by Austrian painter [[Gustav Klimt]] called [[The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze|The Tree of Life]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are made of metal and decorated 2.5 million tiny light bulbs in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Tim|title=Nicaragua's capital city is batshit crazy, which is why I love it|url=https://splinternews.com/nicaraguas-capital-city-is-batshit-crazy-which-is-why-1793853419|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=Splinter|date=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing 42 to 56 feet tall, they cost a reported $20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Tracy|title=Nicaragua's first lady is a powerful partner of president|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-nicaragua-trees-20150524-story.html|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to $25,000 ([[United States dollar|USD]]) a piece and in total $1 million to light annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The violent end of Daniel Ortega’s decade of quiet|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21741216-without-venezuelan-aid-president-can-no-longer-buy-support-potential-adversaries|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=The Economist|date=April 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trees often line streets and parks in Managua and sometimes accompany other statues, including the illuminated statue of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Managua's [[Hugo Chávez Roundabout]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2016/07/28/nacionales/2074520-rotonda-hugo-chavez-es-la-mimada-en-managua|title=Rotonda Hugo Chávez es la “mimada” en Managua|last=Moncada|first=Roy|date=2016-07-28|work=La Prensa|access-date=2018-05-12|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cost $1.1 million to construct, and the statue of Nicaraguan revolutionary (and Murillo's great-uncle) [[Augusto Sandino]] on the stage of Managua's outdoor concert venue, the [[Acoustic Shell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Commentary on the visual style of the installation has been mixed. One observer compared them to the lavish [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedrals constructed in the colonial period, saying "these vibrant public artworks have drastically brightened the streets of Managua — and in a relatively short time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However other viewers have called them "garish".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/opinion/daniel-ortega-nicaragua.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Beginning of the End for Ortega?|last=Jarquín Chamorro|first=Mateo|date=2018-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''World Soundtrack Academy''' ('''WSA''', or '''World Soundtrack Awards'''), launched in 2001 by the [[Film Fest Gent]], is aimed at organizing and overseeing the educational, cultural and professional aspects of the art of [[film music]], including the preservation of the history of the soundtrack and its worldwide promotion. The event takes place yearly in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]] with the ceremony usually at the Capitole Concert Hall. Usually, the [[Brussels Philharmonic]] conducted by maestro [[Dirk Brossé]] performs the awarded music at the ceremony.

==Main Awards==
The '''three main categories''' are:
*[[World Soundtrack Award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year|Soundtrack Composer of the Year]]
*[[World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Soundtrack of the Year|Best Original Score of the Year]]

==Background== 
[[Brussels Philharmonic]] conducted by maestro [[Dirk Brossé]] performs fragments from several scores during the awards ceremony at the [[Kuipke]] in Ghent. Usually, the winner of the WSAward of Composer of the Year is invited to the ceremony's next edition to perform a concert with his music.

Seminars for and with film music professionals, colloquia and concerts  are also being organized next to the gala evening. There are also CD releases (with live concerts by [[Hans Zimmer]], [[George Fenton]] and [[Georges Delerue]]) and the book ''Moving Music'' (by Lannoo - Tielt) that was published in 2005, in response to 20 years of film music at the film festival. In 2007, the CD series ''For the Record'' was launched, to shed light on the works of composers who had already performed at the festival. Hitherto, this series is made up of CDs by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]] (2007), [[Mychael Danna]] (2008), [[Angelo Badalamenti]] (2009), [[Shigeru Umebayashi]] (2010), [[Gabriel Yared]] (2011) and [[Cliff Martinez]] (2014).

The festival is praised as one of the first cultural organizations to turn the spotlight on film music, which gave it the status of a pioneer. It has built up a strong reputation by organizing concerts, such as the very first concert of music by [[Hans Zimmer]].
