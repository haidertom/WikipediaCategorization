'''Achenyo Idachaba''' (c. 1970–) is an American-born entrepreneur working in [[Nigeria]]. She won the [[Cartier Women's Initiative Awards|Cartier Initiative Award]] for women in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2014. Her [[TED talk]] has had over a 1.6 million views.

==Life==
[[File:Eichhornia crassipes-water hyacinth.jpg|thumb|A pond covered with water hyacinth]]
Idachaba came to notice after she moved to [[Ibadan]], Nigeria, in 2009 to set up an environmental consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/candidate/achenyo-idachaba Achenyo Idachaba], Cartier Women's Initiative, Retrieved 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Idachaba had an affinity with Nigeria as her parents had been born there and she had spent some time visiting when she was younger although she was born (in about 1969) and educated in America.&lt;ref name=weeds&gt;[http://www.cp-africa.com/2015/04/17/achenyo-idachaba-turning-water-weeds-to-creative-wonders/ "Achenyo Idachaba - Turning Water Weeds to Creative Wonders"], CP_Africa.com, Retrieved 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

She realised that [[Water Hyacinth]] (''Eichornia crassipes'') which was recognised as an invasive weed could be harvested as she had read of this happening in Asia. In collaboration with local craftspeople she set up a range of products that were woven from the dried plants. The company was called ''Mitimeth''. She developed products such as a waste basket and a table tidy&lt;ref&gt;[http://elledecoration.co.za/2014-finalists-cartier-womens-initiative-awards/ 2014 Finalists], ElleDecoration. Retrieved 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which were made from plants that are usually only known for being invasive. These plants were originally from South America and can be seen as attractive in a domestic garden, however they have been called the "worst aquatic plant" as they grow so abundantly that they create large floating mats of plants that quickly reproduce.&lt;ref name=plant&gt;[http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/weeds/hyacinth.html "Non-native Invasive Freshwater Plants"], WA.gov. Retrieved 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 she had won a grant from the government and she was employing seven staff. The weeds are harvested, dried and then made into rope which can then be made into products.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

In 2014 her efforts were recognised when she was given the Cartier award. This was the women's initiative award for sub-Saharan Africa — which had also been won the year before by another Nigerian, [[Bilikiss Adebiyi Abiola]].&lt;ref name=cartier&gt;[http://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/candidate/bilikiss-adebiyi-Abiola Bilikiss Adebiyi], 2013, cartierwomensinitiative.com. Retrieved 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been featured on CNN&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/02/world/africa/mitimeth-achenyo-idachaba-nigeria/ "Woven wonders from water weeds and waste"], Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Carla Wanyika and Florence Obondo, 2 January 2015. Retrieved 29 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and her TED talk in 2015 achieved over a million hits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/achenyo_idachaba_how_i_turned_a_deadly_plant_into_a_thriving_business?language=en "How I turned a deadly plant into a thriving business"], Achenyo Idachaba, TED, May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been involved in over 130 full-length motion pictures&lt;ref name="Arnon Milchan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0586969/|title=Arnon Milchan|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the founder of production company [[Regency Enterprises]].

He is an Israeli citizen and a resident of Israel.

Milchan was an Israeli intelligence operative from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/business/global/new-book-tells-tale-of-israeli-arms-dealer-in-hollywood.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=New Book Tells Tale of Israeli Arms Dealer in Hollywood | date=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hollywood-producer-was-an-israeli-nuclear-agent-1.373867|title='Hollywood Producer Was an Israeli Nuclear Agent'|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Milchan was born in 1944 in [[Rehovot]], [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. His family is [[Jewish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=187430|title=The world's 50 Richest Jews: 41-50|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has a sister named Dalia. His mother was descended from European Jewish disciples of the [[Vilna Gaon]] who came to Palestine in the early 19th century, and he is the eighth generation of his family in the country.

Milchan was first married to French model, Brigitte Genmaire, and later divorced. The couple had three children, Elinor, Alexandra, and Yariv. Elinor Milchan is a professional photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/shooting-in-the-dark-1.304695|title=Shooting in the Dark|first=Ellie Armon|last=Azoulay|date=29 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later married South African professional tennis player [[Amanda Coetzer]].

== Career and businesses ==

His father owned a fertilizer company,&lt;ref name=filmr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/68/Arnon-Milchan.html|title=Arnon Milchan Biography (1944-)|work=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Milchan inherited at the age of 21 upon his father's sudden death. Over the years, Milchan turned the company into a successful chemical business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60589988.html|title=the last Tycoon.|work=highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned a degree from the [[London School of Economics]], before he and his company (Milchan Brothers Ltd.) were recruited to [[LAKAM]], a secret Israeli intelligence organization responsible for obtaining technology and material for [[Israel's nuclear program]], and other highly secretive programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/revealed-arnon-milchan--the-hollywood-producer-behind-hits-pretty-woman-fight-club-and-la-confidential-who-became-a-reallife-james-bond-8958234.html "Revealed: Arnon Milchan - the Hollywood producer behind hits Pretty Woman, Fight Club and LA Confidential who became a real-life James Bond"] by Tim Walker, ''[[The Independent]]'', November 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film industry ==

Milchan became involved in the American movie business in 1977, after an introduction to American producer [[Elliot Kastner]]. Most notable among Milchan's film collaborations was his early work with [[Martin Scorsese]]. He developed close friendships with [[Robert De Niro]], and directors [[Roman Polanski]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Oliver Stone]]. Milchan started his own production company in 1991 called [[New Regency Productions]]. Through his company Regency, in partnership with Warner Brothers, and later with [[Rupert Murdoch]] at 20th Century Fox, and other business ventures, such as [[Puma AG]], Milchan acquired a [[net worth]] estimated at about $5.1 billion {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.

Milchan has produced over 130 films, such as ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]'' (2014), ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'' (2013), ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984) (in which he also makes a [[cameo appearance]] as the [[chauffeur]]), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992), ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' (1994), ''[[Boys on the Side]]'' (1995), ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995), ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997), ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999), ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'' (2002), ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005), and ''[[Knight and Day]]'' (2010), among others, to his credit.&lt;ref name="Arnon Milchan"/&gt; He was a producer on two more recent Oscar-winners for Best Motion Picture, ''12 Years a Slave'' in 2014 and ''Birdman'' in 2015, but he was not listed as a producer in the nominees list.

Milchan is also the owner of the [[WTA (tennis)|WTA]] broadcasting rights. He was married to model Brigitte Genmaire.&lt;ref name=filmr/&gt; He is now married to former South African tennis professional [[Amanda Coetzer]]. He is owner of the [[Television network|network]] which transmits Israeli television programming to the United States and Canada. He is also a part owner of Israel's TV [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10]], and a former owner of Puma, the international sportswear line.

== Intelligence operative ==

Speculation about Milchan's involvement in arms dealing and intelligence activities was sparked after the indictment in 1985 of Dr. [[Richard Kelly Smyth]], an aerospace executive and scientist who had made illegal shipments of [[Krytron]]s (nuclear triggers) through one of Milchan's companies.  This remained largely in the category of rumor until biographers [[Meir Doron]] and Joseph Gelman wrote a controversial unauthorized biography of Milchan that was published in July 2011. The biography ''Confidential'', which is largely sympathetic to Milchan, revealed in detail how he involved himself in espionage, big-ticket arms-dealing, and obtaining sensitive technology and materials for [[Israel's nuclear weapons program]].  The research in [https://www.amazon.com/Confidential-Secret-Hollywood-Tycoon-Milchan/dp/product-description/0615433812 ''Confidential - The Life Of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon''] established that "at least through the mid-1980s [Milchan] was a full-fledged operative for Israel’s top-secret intelligence agency, [[Lekem]].  His activities included "buying components to build and maintain Israel’s nuclear arsenal" and supervising "government-backed accounts and front companies that financed the special needs of the entirety of Israel’s intelligence operations outside the country".&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;  Interviewed regarding Milchan's intelligence activities, Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Arnon is a special man. It was I who recruited him.... When I was at the Ministry of Defense, Arnon was involved in numerous defense-related procurement activities and intelligence operations. His strength is in making connections at the highest levels.... His activities gave us a huge advantage, strategically, diplomatically and technologically." (interview dated February 8, 2010, documented in [[Meir Doron]] and Joseph Gelman's "Confidential: Secret Agent turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan" p. xi).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years later, on November 25, 2013, on [[Israel's channel 2]] documentary program ''[[Ilana Dayan|Uvda]]'', Milchan confirmed on camera the central claims in the book ''Confidential'' that had been released earlier. The announcement caused international interest in the story and was covered widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/arnon-milchan-admits-arms-dealing-658717 | title=Arnon Milchan Admits to Arms Dealing in the '70s | accessdate=2013-11-26 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | first=David | last=Caspi | date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milchan claimed to have used connections to promote the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]] in exchange for it helping Israel acquire [[uranium]] for its [[Nuclear programme of South Africa|nuclear program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/arnon-milchan-israeli-spy-past|title=Arnon Milchan reveals past as Israeli spy|author=Harriet Sherwood|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case 1000 &amp; "Milchan’s Law" ==

On feb 2018 Israeli Police Recommend Arnon Milchan, alongside Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to be charged with bribery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/israeli-police-recommend-charging-producer-arnon-milchan-prime-minister-bribery-1084390|title=Israeli Police Recommend Charging Producer Arnon Milchan With Bribery|author=David Caspi|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The recommendation in the case, nicknamed "Case 1000", relates to alleged bribery Milchan provided to Netanyahu in exchange to a special tax exemption legislation believed to benefit Milchan in his homeland of Israel. The proposed legislation, nicknamed “Milchan’s Law”, dates back to 2013 and was an alleged ploy to extend Milchan’s status as a returning resident to allow him to take advantage of tax breaks. According to the police, the gifts from Milchan were worth more than $1 million shekels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/arnon-milchan-benjamin-netanyahu-indictment-bribery-1202697556/

== Art collection ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2016}}
Milchan is a leading art collector, and in April 2015, [[CNBC]] ranked him at #3 in their list of "Hollywood's top 10 art collectors" with a collection valued at $600 million, equal with [[George Lucas]], ranked #2, but some way behind [[David Geffen]] at #1, with a collection valued at $2.3 billion.&lt;ref name=hollywoodtop10artcollectors&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berk|first1=Christina Cheddar|title=Hollywood's top 10 art collectors|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/28/hollywoods-top-10-art-collectors.html|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=CNBC|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articles of incorporation''', also referred to as the '''certificate of incorporation''' or the '''corporate charter''', are a document or charter that establishes the existence of a corporation in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  They generally are filed with the Secretary of State or other [[list of company registers|company registrar]].

An equivalent term for [[limited liability companies]] (LLCs) in the United States is [[articles of organization]]. For terms with similar meaning in other countries, see [[articles of association]].

== United States ==
The articles of incorporation outline the governance of a corporation along with the [[bylaw|corporate bylaws]] and the corporate statutes in the state where articles of incorporation are filed.

The articles of incorporation typically include the name of the corporation, the type of corporate structure (e.g. profit corporation, nonprofit corporation, benefit corporation, professional corporation), the [[registered agent]], the number of authorized shares, the effective date, the duration (perpetual by default), and the names and signatures of the incorporators.

The state fee to file articles of incorporation to incorporate a profit corporation range from $50 - $300, and to incorporate a nonprofit corporation range from $0 -$125.&lt;ref&gt;Entity formation fees [https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/entity-formation-fees].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">The '''Bancroft family''' are the former owners of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] &amp;mdash; publishers of ''[[the Wall Street Journal]]'' &amp;mdash; which is now owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] (NewsCorp).

== The Family ==

The Bancrofts are a family of publicly [[recluse|reclusive]] [[Boston]] [[socialite]]s who inherited ''The Wall Street Journal'' from [[Clarence W. Barron]], who as a publisher built up the reputation of that newspaper.&lt;ref name="g2" /&gt; Upon Barron's death in 1928, control of the company passed to his stepdaughters Jane and Martha, children of his wife, Jessie Waldron.  Barron's son-in-law and Jane's husband, [[Harvard]]-educated lawyer Hugh Bancroft (1879-1933), ran the company and the paper for the next five years. Suffering from [[Clinical depression|depression]], Bancroft committed [[suicide]] in 1933 at the age of 54. The family members maintained ownership of the company through ensuing generations, though management was placed in the hands of capable professionals, like ''Journal'' editor [[Bernard Kilgore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tungate |first=Mark |title=Media Monoliths: How Great Media Brands Thrive and Survive |year=2004 |publisher=Kogan Page |location=London |isbn= |page=81 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable family member of the following generation was [[Mary Bancroft]] (1903-1997), Hugh Bancroft's only daughter by his first marriage to Mary Agnes Cogan (1879-1903). She worked for U.S. intelligence in [[Switzerland]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Calhoun |editor-first=Chris |title=52 McGs: The Best Obituaries from Legendary New York Times Writer Robert McG.

She was survived by six grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.

Jane Bancroft's daughter Jessie Bancroft Cox was another prominent member of the second generation. Her husband, son, and grandson &amp;mdash; William C. Cox, Bill Cox Jr., and Billy Cox III, respectively &amp;mdash; were "the only Bancrofts to have actually worked at Dow Jones since Hugh Bancroft's suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wolff |first=Michael |title=The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch |year=2008 |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |isbn= |page=27 |url= |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family members' private [[Hobby|pastimes]] consist mainly of show-[[horse breeding]], [[sailing]], and [[farming]].  However, the family has also produced a [[speedboat]] champion and an airline pilot.&lt;ref name="g2" /&gt;

== Dow Jones-NewsCorp sale ==

At the time of the 2007 sale of the Dow Jones Co. to NewsCorp, the Bancroft family (more than thirty members) owned 42 percent of the business but controlled 68 percent of the voting stock,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pavlik |first=John Vernon |last2=McIntosh |first2=Shawn |title=Converging Media: An Introduction to Mass Communication |year=2003 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |location=Old Tappan, NJ |isbn= |page=89 |url= |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; through their possession of 7.5 million Class B shares. In the sale to Murdoch, the Bancrofts made more than $1.2 billion.

Bancroft family representatives filled three seats on the Dow Jones board of directors, representing three branches of the family &amp;mdash; the descendants of the three children of Hugh and Jane Bancroft. At the time of the sale, those board members included Christopher Bancroft and his cousins Leslie Hill and Elizabeth Steele.

The Bancroft family initially held out for three months against Murdoch's advances until accepting a [[US Dollar|$]]60-per-share offer from NewsCorp.&lt;ref name="g2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/02/pressandpublishing.usnews | title=Meet the Bancrofts, the media clan who sold out to Murdoch | work=The Guardian: g2 | date=August 2, 2007 | last=Armstrong | first=Stephen | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Big Biz Tycoon''''' allows the player to try their hand in the business world. Similar to other [[business simulation game]]s, the intent is for the player to become a [[Business magnate|mogul]] of an industry. It was developed for [[Microsoft Windows]] by Animedia, and published by Activision Value.

==Gameplay==

===Overview===
The objective of the game is to create a successful business by developing products. As they are sold, the player earns money at a rate varying how many produced and at what price they're being sold. This enables them to hire employees and decorate the office building. The products manufactured include game software, business software, military gear, medicine, clothing, toys, books, sports equipment, etc.

These workers are then assigned to projects according to their abilities, and must then develop and market a product. In addition, the owner of the business has the option to purchase a gift and offer it to one of the employees which would improve one of their abilities.

Money can be saved in two methods: making deposits in the bank or purchasing stocks.

=== Missions ===
Unlike some business simulation games, the assigned missions don't go in a sequence. If a player succeeds in each of them, that particular mission becomes an endless world where he/she can continue playing.

A '''business executive''' is a person responsible for running an organization, although the exact nature of the role varies depending on the organization.

Executives run [[companies]] or [[government agencies]]. They create plans to help their organizations grow.

==Occupations==
The business executive occupation covers many jobs. These positions include [[chief executive officer]], department store manager, and [[small business]] operator. Executives are in charge of their organization. They create and review goals for the company. They work closely with a team of upper-level staff or assistants. This team may make both long- and short-range plans to achieve these goals. Once the plans are set, executives make sure the company follows the changes. They do this by meeting with the managers of all the departments and getting progress reports. Executives are typically elected by the organization's owners, [[shareholder]]s, [[board of director]]s. The term usually refers to the person running the organization or someone involved in the upper-level management role of a corporation, company, as opposed to being the founder, owner, or majority shareholder of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maryellen-tribby/entrepreneur-vs-ceo-under_b_3691542.html | title=Entrepreneur vs. CEO: Understanding the Difference Can Save Your Business | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/entrepreneur-vs-executive-34605.html | title=Entrepreneur Vs. Executive | publisher=Globalpost | accessdate=25 August 2014 | author=Sam Ashe-Edmunds,}}&lt;/ref&gt;
748

==Duties==
Executives' duties depend on how many people are on their staff. Some executives oversee general managers in different areas. In larger organizations, they may direct one area, such as [[marketing]], finance, or legal services. For example, in the financial area, executives may direct the buying or selling of land or other investments. Other executives get more involved. They may hire and train new staff. They may direct staff in what tasks need to be done. They may choose computer systems to record data, such as budgets. When complaints arise, executives may direct investigations to resolve what occurred in the agency or between staff members.

A large part of an executive's job is developing relationships with people outside the organization. These people may be customers or contributors. One way executives create relationships is by giving speeches at [[Business conference|conferences]]. Executives may also serve on the boards of community groups. These activities promote the company and its leader.

In addition, executives oversee [[budget]]s. They use budgets to analyze how well the organization is running. They make suggestions about where to cut expenses. Executives may also suggest where improvements could be made. Executives also negotiate contracts with outside agencies. They need good persuasion skills to keep costs down. Some executives write yearly reports to let their communities know what has been accomplished.

==Government executives==
Government executives oversee agencies that develop laws and regulations. They meet regularly with their citizens. They learn how voters feel about the issues. Officials need to do these reality checks to see if they have the citizens' support. Executives also promote economic growth within their communities. They plan and organize different activities to help meet these goals. Government executives make connections between the United States and other countries. They help to promote [[international trade]].

The government executive occupation also covers many jobs. They range from city council member, mayor, and governor, all the way up to President of the United States. Some of these positions are elected. Other officials are appointed to their jobs. In smaller communities, many of these jobs may be volunteer positions. Sometimes these jobs run through only part of the year.

'''''CartaCapital''''' is a weekly [[Brazil]]ian [[newsmagazine]] published in [[Santana do Parnaíba]], [[São Paulo]] and [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]], [[Paraíba]] and distributed throughout the country by Editora Confiança.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CartaCapital (Brazil) - Illustrations|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/20791749/CartaCapital-(Brazil)-Illustrations|work=Behance|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focuses of the magazine are [[politics of Brazil|politics]], [[economy of Brazil|economy]], [[Social issues in Brazil|social issues]] and [[culture of Brazil|culture]].

==History==
''CartaCapital'' was created as a monthly magazine in 1994 by [[Mino Carta]],&lt;ref name=chb&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christina Holtz-Bacha|author2=Jesper Strömbäck|title=Opinion Polls and the Media: Reflecting and Shaping Public Opinion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXiUiVxLO1kC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=8 August 2015|date=5 April 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37493-5|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Italo Brazilian|Italo-Brazilian]] journalist. In 1968, Carta founded Brazil's leading newsmagazine ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' alongside [[Victor Civita]]. Eight years later, he founded ''[[ISTOÉ|IstoÉ]]'', another popular newsmagazine. Unsatisfied with the result of the magazines he helped to create, Carta founded ''CartaCapital'' as an alternative to these. ''CartaCapital'' is noted for its small crew; it only has eleven journalists.

The magazine was published on a monthly until 1996 when its frequency was switched to biweekly.&lt;ref name=chb/&gt; Its frequency was changed to weekly in 2002.

The magazine is known for supporting causes in a biased way, such as [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s both candidatures, the legalization of [[abortion]] in all cases, the maintenance of the current age of criminal responsibility and the [[extradition]] of [[Cesare Battisti (born 1954)|Cesare Battisti]] to [[Italy]], among other polemic issues. Carta argues that the magazine does it to avoid hiding in a curtain of impartiality and not being honest to its readers.

''CartaCapital'' is a declared left-wing publication but has in its staff Antonio Delfim Netto, Minister of Economy during the [[Military_dictatorship_in_Brazil|right-wing military dictatorship]]. Besides his participation in a right-wing government, Antonio Delfim Netto is a ''[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]''{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

The magazine openly supported [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s government, although the article in which Mino Carta put and explained his position was later removed without notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cartacapital.com.br/app/materia.jsp?a=2&amp;a2=8&amp;i=7214|title=Carta Capital|last=|first=|date=|website=CartaCapital|language=Brazilian Portuguese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=Yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''CartaCapital'' also publishes an [[educational]] magazine titled ''Carta na Escola'' on a monthly basis. It is dedicated to teachers, advising them on how to discuss the news with their students.

As in other states that employ the [[Westminster system|Westminster political system]], Her Majesty's Home Civil Service forms an inseparable part of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. The executive decisions of government ministers are implemented by HM Civil Service. Civil servants are employees of the Crown and not of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]. Civil servants also have some traditional and [[Statute|statutory]] responsibilities which to some extent protect them from being used for the political advantage of the party in power. Senior civil servants may be called to account to Parliament.

In general use, the term ''civil servant'' in the United Kingdom does not include all [[public sector]] employees; although there is no fixed legal definition, the term is usually defined as a "servant of the Crown working in a civil capacity who is not the holder of a political (or judicial) office; the holder of certain other offices in respect of whose tenure of office special provision has been made; [or] a servant of the Crown in a personal capacity paid from the [[Civil List]]".&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Bradley and Ewing, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the civil service does not include government ministers (who are politically appointed), members of the [[British Armed Forces]], the [[police officer|police]], officers of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government authorities]] or [[non-departmental public body|quangos]] of the [[Houses of Parliament]], employees of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), or staff of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]. As at the end of March 2016 there were 418,343 civil servants in the Home Civil Service, this is down 3.6% on the previous year.&lt;ref name=Statistics2016&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/civilservicestatistics/2016 |title=Civil Service statistics: 2016 |date=6 October 2016 |publisher=UK Government |website=ons.gov.uk |accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two other administratively separate civil services in the United Kingdom. One is for [[Northern Ireland]] (the [[Northern Ireland Civil Service]]); the other is the [[Diplomatic service|foreign service]] ([[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]]). The heads of these services are members of the Permanent Secretaries Management Group.&lt;ref name=PSMG_members/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoDS/&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===
{{rquote|right|the incorruptible spinal column of England|[[John Gunther]], 1940&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n309/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Offices of State grew in England, and later the United Kingdom. Initially, as in other countries, they were little more than [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]]s for their leaders, who held positions at [[Court (royal)|court]].  They were chosen by the king on the advice of a patron, and typically replaced when their patron lost influence. In the 18th century, in response to the growth of the [[British Empire]] and economic changes, institutions such as the [[Office of Works]] and the [[Navy Board]] grew large. Each had its own system and staff were appointed by purchase or patronage. By the 19th century, it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were not working.

In 1806, the [[East India Company]], a private company that ruled only in India, established a college, the [[East India Company College]], near London. The purpose of this college was to train administrators; it was established on recommendation of officials in China who had seen the [[imperial examination]] system. The civil service, based on examination similar to the Chinese system, was advocated by a number of Englishmen over the next several decades.&lt;ref&gt;(Bodde 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Ewart Gladstone]], then a junior minister, in 1850 sought a more efficient system based on expertise rather than favouritism. The East India Company provided a model for Stafford Northcote, the private Secretary to Gladstone, who with Charles Trevelyan (Permanent Secretary of the Treasury) drafted the key report in 1854.  A permanent, unified and politically neutral civil service, in which appointments were made on merit, was introduced on the recommendations of the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854, which also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine ("mechanical") work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an "administrative" class. The report was not implemented, but it came at a time when the bureaucratic chaos in the [[Crimean War]] demonstrated that the military was as backward as the civil service.  A [[Civil Service Commission]] was set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage.  Prime Minister Gladstone took the decisive step in 1870 with his Order in Council to implement the Northcote-Trevelyan proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Heffer|title=High Minds: The Victorians and the Birth of Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1gbQwhBSiIC&amp;pg=PA476|year=2013|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was broadly endorsed by Commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955).

The Northcote–Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change.  Patrick Diamond argues:
:The Northcote-Trevelyan model was characterised by a hierarchical mode of Weberian bureaucracy; neutral, permanent and anonymous officials motivated by the public interest; and a willingness to administer policies ultimately determined by ministers. This bequeathed a set of theories, institutions and practices to subsequent generations of administrators in the central state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Diamond|title=Governing Britain: Power, Politics and the Prime Minister|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0_dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish Civil Service (pre-independence)|Irish Civil Service]] was separate from the British civil service; although the [[Acts of Union 1800]] abolished the [[Parliament of Ireland]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] was retained in formal charge of [[Dublin Castle administration|the Irish executive based at Dublin Castle]]. The [[Irish Office]] in Whitehall liaised with Dublin Castle. Some British departments' area of operation extended to Ireland, while in other fields the Dublin department was separate from the Whitehall equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=Robert Brendan|title=The Irish administration, 1801-1914|date=1 December 1976|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780837185613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Fulton's committee report===
Following the Second World War, however, demands for change again grew. There was a concern (illustrated in [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[Strangers and Brothers]]'' series of novels) that technical and scientific expertise was mushrooming, to a point at which the "good all-rounder" culture of the administrative civil servant with a classics or other arts degree could no longer properly engage with it: as late as 1963, for example, the Treasury had just 19 trained economists. The times were, moreover, ones of keen respect for technocracy, with the mass mobilisation of war having worked effectively, and the French National Plan apparently delivering economic success. And there was also a feeling which would not go away, following the war and the radical social reforms of the 1945 Labour government, that the so-called "[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]" of the higher civil service were too remote from the people. Indeed, between 1948 and 1963 only 3% of the recruits to the administrative class came from the [[working classes]], and in 1966 more than half of the administrators at [[undersecretary]] level and above had been privately educated.

[[John Fulton, Baron Fulton|Lord Fulton]]'s committee reported in 1968. He found that administrators were not professional enough, and in particular lacked management skills; that the position of technical and scientific experts needed to be rationalised and enhanced; and that the service was indeed too remote. His 158 recommendations included the introduction of a unified grading system for all categories of staff, a Civil Service College and a central policy planning unit. He also said that control of the service should be taken from the Treasury, and given to a new Department, and that the "fast stream" recruitment process for accessing the upper echelons should be made more flexible, to encourage candidates from less privileged backgrounds. The new Department was set up by Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Labour Government in 1968 and named the Civil Service Department, known as CSD. The first Minister was Cabinet Minister Lord Shackleton, also Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal. The first Permanent Secretary was Sir William Armstrong, who moved over from his post as Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. After the 1970 General Election, new Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath appointed Lord Jellicoe in Lord Shackleton's place.

Into [[Edward Heath|Heath]]'s [[Downing Street]] came the [[Central Policy Review Staff]] (CPRS), and they were in particular given charge of a series of Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) studies of policy efficiency and effectiveness.

But, whether through lack of political will, or through passive resistance by a mandarinate which the report had suggested were "amateurs", Fulton failed. The Civil Service College equipped generalists with additional skills, but did not turn them into qualified professionals as [[École nationale d'administration|ENA]] did in France. Recruits to the fast stream self-selected, with the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] still producing a large majority of successful English candidates, since the system continued to favour the tutorial system at [[Oxbridge]] while to an extent the Scottish [[Ancient universities of Scotland|Ancient universities]] educated a good proportion of recruits from north of the border. The younger mandarins found excuses to avoid managerial jobs in favour of the more prestigious  postings. The generalists remained on top, and the specialists on tap.

===Margaret Thatcher's government===
[[Margaret Thatcher]] came to office in 1979 believing in [[free market]]s as a better social system in many areas than the state: government should be small but active. Many of her ministers were suspicious of the civil service, in light of [[public choice]] research that suggested public servants tend to increase their own power and budgets.

She immediately set about reducing the size of the civil service, cutting numbers from 732,000 to 594,000 over her first seven years in office. [[Derek Rayner, Baron Rayner|Derek Rayner]], the former chief executive of [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], was appointed as an [[Business efficiency expert|efficiency expert]] with the Prime Minister's personal backing; he identified numerous problems with the Civil Service, arguing that only three billion of the eight billion [[pound sterling|pound]]s a year spent at that time by the Civil Service consisted of essential services, and that the "mandarins" (senior civil servants) needed to focus on efficiency and management rather than on policy advice.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, p.174-5&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1981 the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Civil Service Department, transferring power over the Civil Service to the Prime Minister's Office and [[Cabinet Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Priestley Commission]] principle of pay comparability with the private sector was abandoned in February 1982.

Meanwhile, [[Michael Heseltine]] was introducing a comprehensive system of corporate and business planning (known as MINIS) first in the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] and then in the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].  This led to the ''[[Financial Management Initiative]]'', launched in September 1982 (''Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service'' (Cmnd 8616)) as an umbrella for the efficiency scrutiny programme and with a wider focus on corporate planning, efficiency and objective-setting. Progress initially was sluggish, but in due course MINIS-style business planning became standard, and delegated budgets were introduced, so that individual managers were held much more accountable for meeting objectives, and for the first time for the resources they used to do so. [[Performance-related pay]] began in December 1984, was built on thereafter, and continues to this day, though the sums involved have always been small compared to the private sector, and the effectiveness of PRP as a genuine motivator has often been questioned.

In February 1988 [[Robin Ibbs]], who had been recruited from [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in July 1983 to run the [[Efficiency Unit]] (now in No. 10), published his report [[Next Steps Initiative|''Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps'']]. This envisaged a new approach to delivery featuring clear targets and personal responsibility. Without any statutory change, the managerial functions of Ministries would be hived off into [[Executive Agency|Executive Agencies]], with clear [[Framework Document]]s setting out their objectives, and whose [[chief executive]]s would be made accountable directly (in some cases to Parliament) for performance. Agencies were to, as far as possible, take a commercial approach to their tasks. However, the Government conceded that agency staff would remain civil servants, which diluted the radicalism of the reform. The approach seems somewhat similar to the Swedish model, though no influence from Sweden has ever been acknowledged.

The [[Next Steps Initiative]] took some years to get off the ground, and progress was patchy. Significant change was achieved, although agencies never really achieved the level of autonomy envisaged at the start.&lt;ref&gt;The ''locus classicus'' showing the difficulty of this boundary was the interview of [[Michael Howard]] on ''Newsnight'' on 13 May 1997, which pivoted on the question whether as Minister he had intervened in the detailed management of the Prison Services Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; By 5 April 1993, 89 agencies had been established, and contained over 260,000 civil servants, some 49% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Greer, 1994,''Transforming Central Government: the Next Steps'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on smaller, more accountable, units revived the keenness of Ministerial interest in the perceived efficiencies of the private sector. Already in the late 1980s, some common services once set up to capture economies of scale, such as the [[Property Services Agency]] and the [[Crown Supplier]]s, were being dismantled or sold off. Next, shortly after Thatcher left office, in July 1991, a new programme of market-testing of central government services began, with the White Paper ''Competing for Quality'' (Cm 1730). Five-yearly or three-yearly policy and finance reviews of all agencies and other public bodies were instituted, where the first question to be answered (the "prior options exercise") was why the function should not be abolished or privatised. In November 1991 the [[private finance initiative]] was launched, and by November 1994 the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] had referred to it as ‘the funding mechanism of choice for most public sector projects’. In 1995 the decision was taken to privatise the [[Chessington Computer Centre]], [[HMSO]], the [[Occupational Health &amp; Safety Agency]] and Recruitment &amp; Assessment Services.

===The Citizen's Charter===
It was believed with the Thatcher reforms that efficiency was improving. But there was still a perception of carelessness and lack of responsiveness in the quality of public services. The government of [[John Major]] sought to tackle this with a [[Citizen's Charter]] programme. This sought to empower the service user, by setting out rights to standards in each service area, and arrangements for compensation when these were not met. An Office of Public Service and Science was set up in 1992, to see that the Charter policy was implemented across government.

By 1998, 42 Charters had been published, and they included services provided by public service industries such as the health service and the railways, as well as by the civil service. The programme was also expanded to apply to other organisations such as local government or housing associations, through a scheme of "Chartermark" awards. The programme was greeted with some derision, and it is true that the compensation sometimes hardly seemed worth the effort of claiming, and that the service standards were rarely set with much consumer input. But the initiative did have a significant effect in changing cultures, and paradoxically the spin-off [[Chartermark]] initiative may have had more impact on local organisations uncertain about what standards to aim for, than the parent Citizen's Charter programme itself.

The last person to hold all three positions together was [[Gus O'Donnell]], Cabinet Secretary, Head of the Home Civil Service and Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary, September 2005 – January 2012. The postholder is responsible for ensuring that the Civil Service is equipped with the skills and capability to meet the everyday challenges it faces and that civil servants work in a fair and decent environment. They also chair the '''Permanent Secretary Management Group''' and the '''Civil Service Steering Board''' which are the main governing bodies of the Civil Service.&lt;ref name=HoCS/&gt;

It was announced on 11 October 2011 that, following O'Donnell's retirement at the end of 2011, the role of Head of the Home Civil Service would be split from the post of [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]]. There will additionally be a new, separate, Permanent Secretary to lead the Cabinet Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/cabinet-secretary-announces-retirement/ Number 10&amp;nbsp;– Cabinet Secretary announces retirement]&lt;/ref&gt; After O'Donnell's retirement, [[Jeremy Heywood]] replaced him as Cabinet Secretary - serving until 24 October 2018 when he retired on health grounds; [[Ian Watmore]] as Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary; and lastly, [[Bob Kerslake]] as Head of the Home Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.civilservicelive.com/pg/pages/view/623890/kerslake-to-head-the-civil-service-with-promise-of-visible-leadership|publisher=Cabinet Office Civil Service Live Network|title=Civil Service Live Network: Kerslake to head civil service with promise of 'visible leadership'|accessdate=8 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711052450/http://network.civilservicelive.com/pg/pages/view/623890/kerslake-to-head-the-civil-service-with-promise-of-visible-leadership|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 it was announced that Kerslake would step down and Heywood would take the title of Head of the HCS while [[John Manzoni]] would be Chief Executive of the Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jeremy-heywood|title=Sir Jeremy Heywood|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 24 October 2018 to 4 November 2018, the office of Head of the Home Civil Service was vacant, as Heywood resigned on health grounds.

===Civil Service Steering Board (CSSB)===

===Civil Service Commissioners===
{{Main article|First Civil Service Commissioner}}
The Civil Service Commissioners are not civil servants and are independent of Ministers, they are appointed directly by the Crown under Royal Prerogative and they report annually to the Queen.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/ |title=Civil Service Commissioners website (About Us) |publisher=Civil Service Commissioners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914173227/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/ |archivedate=14 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their main role is regarding the recruitment of civil servants. They have the responsibility to ensure that all civil servants are recruited on the "principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition." They maintain a recruitment code on the interpretation and application of that principle, and approve any exceptions to it. They audit recruitment policies and practices within the Civil Service and approve all appointments to the most senior levels of the Civil Service.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/Code_of_Practice/ |title=Civil Service Commissioners website (Code of Practice) |publisher=Civil Service Commissioners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085220/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/About_us/Code_of_Practice/ |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioners also hear and determine appeals in cases of concern about propriety and conscience raised by civil servants under the Civil Service Code which cannot be resolved through internal procedures.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_02/&gt;

Northern Ireland has a separate Commission called the ''Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland'' which has the same role.&lt;ref name=CSCommission_02/&gt;&lt;ref name=nics_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicscommissioners.org/ |title=CCivil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland | publisher=Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political neutrality==
The Home Civil Service is a politically neutral body, with the function of impartially implementing the policy programme of the elected government.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Christoph, Political Rights and Administrative Impartiality in the British Civil Service," in Canadian Public Administration, eds. J.E. Hodgetts and D.C. Corbett (Toronto: Macmillan, 1960), 421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1986|title=Political Neutrality, The Duty Of Silence And The Right To Publish In The Civil Service|url=http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/4/437.full.pdf|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=39|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ministers-plot-end-to-civil-service-neutrality-7995033.html Ministers plot end to Civil Service neutrality - UK Politics - UK]. The Independent (1 August 2012). Retrieved on 2013-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all servants of the [[The Crown|Crown]], civil servants are legally barred from standing for election as [[Members of Parliament]] or Members of the European Parliament.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Bradley and Ewing, p.279-80&lt;/ref&gt; Also, under regulations first adopted in 1954 and revised in 1984, members of the Senior Civil Service (the top management grades) are barred from holding office in a [[political party]] or publicly expressing controversial political viewpoints, while less senior civil servants at an intermediate (managerial) level must generally seek permission to participate in political activities. The most junior civil servants are permitted to participate in political activities, but must be politically neutral in the exercise of their duties.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

All civil servants are subject to the [[Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989]], meaning that they may not disclose sensitive government information. Since 1998, there have also been restrictions on contact between civil servants and [[lobbyist]]s; this followed an incident known as "Lobbygate", where an undercover reporter for ''[[The Observer]]'', posing as a [[business]] leader, was introduced by a lobbyist to a senior [[Downing Street]] official who promised privileged access to government ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley and Ewing, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Chapter 7: Lobbying and All-Party Groups], Sixth Report of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]], also created in 1998, is responsible for regulation of contacts between public officials and lobbyists.

The increasing influence of politically appointed "special advisers" in government departments can reduce the political neutrality of public administration. In Thatcher's government, [[Alan Walters]] was an official adviser from 1981 to 1984, and again in 1989.&lt;ref name=2alans&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/06/sir-alan-walters-obituary|title=Obituary-Sir Alan Walters:Economic adviser to Margaret Thatcher, he opposed Britain joining the ERM|publisher=Guardian newspapers|author=Alan Budd|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters' criticisms "of many aspects of Treasury policy, particularly in relation to exchange rate policy" and Thatcher's refusal to dismiss him led to Nigel Lawson's resignation as chancellor in 1989.&lt;ref name=2alans/&gt; Thatcher also claimed that the 1981 budget, which increased taxes during the recession and was criticised by 364 economists, had been devised by Walters.&lt;ref name=2alans/&gt;
In 2000, then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was criticised for appointing 20 special advisers (compared to eight under his predecessor [[John Major]]) and for the fact that the total [[salary]] cost of special advisers across all government departments had reached [[£]]4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/597687.stm The advisers: Modernisation or politicisation?], BBC News, 12 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Stephen Byers]], then [[Secretary of State for Transport]], was forced to resign because of the actions of his special adviser [[Jo Moore]], who instructed a departmental civil servant, Martin Sixsmith, that [[9/11|September 11, 2001]], would be "a good day to bury bad news"; this was seen as inappropriate political manipulation of the Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3368603.stm Spin doctor role under spotlight], BBC News, 5 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, under the administration of [[Tony Blair]], the influence of two [[Downing Street]] special advisers, [[Jonathan Powell (chief of staff to Tony Blair)|Jonathan Powell]] and [[Alastair Campbell]], both of whom were given formal power over Downing Street civil servants, provoked widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=217432002 Uncivil to the servants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204065656/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/s2.cfm?id=217432002 |date=4 December 2007 }}, ''The Scotsman'', 26 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010–2015 had proposed introducing a more American-style system where senior civil servants, such as permanent secretaries, became political appointees.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; However, this was dropped after it was considered that the existing permanent civil service style was better-suited to the government of the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Codes==

===Civil Service Code===
The current civil service code was introduced on 6 June 2006 to outline the core values and standards expected of civil servants. The core values are defined as ''integrity'', ''honesty'', ''objectivity'', and ''impartiality''. A key change from previous values is the removal of ''anonymity'' within the core values.&lt;ref name=CS_Code_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/iam/codes/cscode/index.asp |title=The Civil Service Code |publisher=UK Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923142002/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/iam/codes/cscode/index.asp |archivedate=23 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code includes an independent line of appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on alleged breaches of the Code.

===Civil Service Management Code===
The Civil Service Management Code (CSMC) sets out the regulations and instructions to departments and agencies regarding the terms and conditions of service of civil servants. It is the guiding document which gives delegation to civil service organisations, from the Minister for the Civil Service, in order for them to make internal personnel policies.&lt;ref name=CSMC_Code_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/resources/civil-service-management-code |title=The Introduction to the Civil Service Management Code | publisher=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code===
The Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code is maintained by the Civil Service Commissioners and is based on the ''principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.''&lt;ref name=CSRC_01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/Reference_Documents/Recruitment_Code_reference/ |title=The Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code |publisher=Civil Service Commissioners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919123725/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/Reference_Documents/Recruitment_Code_reference/ |archivedate=19 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osmotherly Rules===
The [[Osmotherly Rules]] set out guidance on how civil servants should respond to [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Parliamentary select committees]].&lt;ref name="parlo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf |title=The Osmotherly Rules (Standard Note: SN/PC/2671) |last=Gay |first=Oonagh |date=4 August 2005 |publisher=[[British House of Commons|Parliament and Constitution Centre, House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=22 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530063927/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directory of Civil Service Guidance===
A two-volume 125-page ''Directory of Civil Service Guidance'' was published in 2000 to replace the previous ''Guidance on Guidance'', providing short summaries of guidance on a wide range of issues and pointing to more detailed sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directory-civil-service-guidance Directory of Civil Service Guidance], Cabinet Office 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:The number of civil servants employed in the UK in 2013 is 448,840.png|thumb|right|A breakdown by department of civil servants employed in 2013.]]
The structure of the home civil service is divided into organisations, grades and professions.  Each [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] has a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|Department]] which has [[executive agency|executive agencies]] and [[non-departmental public bodies]] subordinate to it.

===Grading schemes===
The grading system used in the civil service has changed many times, and the current structure is made up of two schemes. All senior grades (Deputy Director / Grade 5 level and above) are part of the Senior Civil Service, which is overseen by the [[Cabinet Office]] on behalf of the civil service as a whole. Below the Senior Civil Service, each individual department/executive agency can put in place its own grading and pay arrangements, provided they still comply with the central civil service pay and review guidance.

For other grades many departments overlay their own grading structure, however all these structures must map across to the central government structure as shown below.&lt;ref name=Departmental_Grades&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabilisationunit.gov.uk/attachments/article/178/Civil_Service_Equivalent_Grades.xls |title=Civil Service Equivalent Grades |publisher=UK Civil Service, the Cabinet Office |date=1 February 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171759/http://www.stabilisationunit.gov.uk/attachments/article/178/Civil_Service_Equivalent_Grades.xls |archivedate=13 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professions ===
The ''lingua franca'' is to describe Civil Servants, and in particular their grades, predominanly through a lens of Administrative activity (as in the Current Structure of the table above), but in practice the Civil Service has an always had a number of subdivisions, with the Historic Grades having an additional designator (usually omitted for Senior Managers, but included from Middle and Junior Managers) as shown as "xxx", with the major groupings being:
* Executive ([x]EO)
* Scientific ([x]SO)
* Professional and Technology ([x]PTO)
The Current Structure identifies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/professions|title=Civil Service professions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of distinct professional groupings:
* Communications and Marketing
* Economics
* Engineering
* Finance
* Human Resources
* Digital, Data and Technology (formerly Information Technology)
* Inspector of Education and Training
* Internal Audit
* Knowledge and Information Management
* Law
* Medicine
* Operational Delivery
* Operational Research
* Policy Delivery
* Procurement and Contract Management
* Programme and Project Management
* Property Asset Management
* Psychology
* Science
* Social and Market Research
* Statistics
* Tax Professionals
* Veterinarian
* Other (for minority groups, such as Investigating Officers)

==In popular culture==
The [[BBC]] television series ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes Prime Minister]]'' are a [[satire]] on the British [[civil service]] and its relationship with government ministers. The portrayal is a caricature of the civil service predominantly characterised through [[Nigel Hawthorne]]'s [[Humphrey Appleby|Sir Humphrey Appleby]]. ''[[The Thick of It]]'', first broadcast in 2005, is a similar BBC television series that has been called "the 21st century's answer to Yes Minister". The series portrays a modernised version of the interactions between the Civil Service and the Government (chiefly in the form of [[Special advisers in the United Kingdom|special advisors]]), as well as the media's involvement in the process. There is a long history of civil servants who are also literary authors, who often comment on their own institutions, including such writers as [[John Milton]], [[John Dryden]], [[Andrew Marvell]], [[Robert Burns]], [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Anthony Trollope]].

'''Collective bargaining''' is a process of [[negotiation]] between employers and a group of employees aimed at agreements to regulate working salaries, working conditions, benefits, and other aspects of workers' compensation and rights for workers. The interests of the employees are commonly presented by representatives of a [[trade union]] to which the employees belong. The [[collective agreement]]s reached by these negotiations usually set out wage scales, working hours, training, health and safety, [[overtime]], [[Grievance (labour)|grievance]] mechanisms, and rights to participate in workplace or company affairs.&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm |title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008 |work=Glossary |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trade union|union]] may negotiate with a single employer (who is typically representing a company's shareholders) or may negotiate with a group of businesses, depending on the country, to reach an industry-wide agreement. A collective agreement functions as a [[Labor and employment law|labour contract]] between an employer and one or more unions. Collective bargaining consists of the process of negotiation between representatives of a union and employers (generally represented by management, or, in some countries such as Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, by an [[employers' organization]]) in respect of the terms and conditions of employment of employees, such as wages, hours of work, working conditions, grievance procedures, and about the rights and responsibilities of trade unions. The parties often refer to the result of the negotiation as a ''collective bargaining agreement'' (CBA) or as a ''collective employment agreement'' (CEA).

==History==
[[File:BeatriceWebb.jpg|thumb|upright|Beatrice Webb in 1894]]
The term "collective bargaining" was first used in 1891 by [[Beatrice Webb]], a founder of the field of industrial relations in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Wilkinson et al. eds.|title=Handbook of Research on Employee Voice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd9nAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|year=2014|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the sort of collective negotiations and agreements that had existed since the rise of trade unions during the 18th century.

In the United States, the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935  made it illegal for any employer to deny union rights to an employee. The issue of unionizing government employees in a [[public-sector trade union]] was much more controversial until the 1950s. In 1962 President [[John F. Kennedy]] issued an executive order granting federal employees the right to unionize.

An issue of jurisdiction surfaced in ''National Labor Relations Board v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago ''(1979) when the Supreme Court held that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) could not assert jurisdiction over a church-operated school because such jurisdiction would violate the First Amendment establishment of freedom of religion and the separation of church of state.&lt;ref&gt;Pynes, J.E. &amp; Lombardi (2011) Human Resources Management for Healthcare Organizations.

The right to collectively bargain is recognized through international human rights conventions. Article 23 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] identifies the ability to organize trade unions as a fundamental human right.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly]] (1948). [[s:Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 23|"Article 23"]]. ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]''. Paris. Retrieved August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Item 2(a) of the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization's]] ''[[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]]'' defines the "[[freedom of association]] and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining" as an essential right of workers.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization (1998). ''[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081027221608/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/declaris/DECLARATIONWEB.static_jump?var_language=EN&amp;var_pagename=DECLARATIONTEXT Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]''. 86th Session: Geneva. Retrieved August 29, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention]], 1948 (C087) and several other conventions specifically protect collective bargaining through the creation of [[international labour standards]] that discourage countries from violating workers' rights to associate and collectively bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C087 - Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C087|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 the Supreme Court of Canada extensively reviewed the rationale for regarding collective bargaining as a human right. In the case of ''Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v. British Columbia'', the Court made the following observations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to bargain collectively with an employer enhances the human dignity, liberty and autonomy of workers by giving them the opportunity to influence the establishment of workplace rules and thereby gain some control over a major aspect of their lives, namely their work… Collective bargaining is not simply an instrument for pursuing external ends…rather [it] is intrinsically valuable as an experience in self-government… Collective bargaining permits workers to achieve a form of [[workplace democracy]] and to ensure the rule of law in the workplace. Workers gain a voice to influence the establishment of rules that control a major aspect of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia'' [2007] [http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc27/2007scc27.html SCC 27] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712233951/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2007/2007scc27/2007scc27.html |date=July 12, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Empirical findings==
* Union members and other workers covered by [[collective agreement]]s get, on average, a wage markup over their nonunionized (or uncovered) counterparts. Such a markup is typically 5 to 10 percent in industrial countries.&lt;ref name="aidt2002"&gt;{{cite web |author=Toke Aidt and Zafiris Tzannatos|title=Unions and Collective Bargaining |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unions tend to equalize the [[income distribution]], especially between skilled and unskilled workers.&lt;ref name="aidt2002" /&gt;
* The [[deadweight loss|welfare loss]] associated with unions is 0.2 to 0.5 of [[GDP]], which is similar to [[monopoly|monopolies]] in product markets.&lt;ref name="aidt2002" /&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (1935) covers most collective agreements in the private sector. This act makes it illegal for employers to discriminate, spy on, harass, or terminate the employment of workers because of their union membership or to retaliate against them for engaging in organizing campaigns or other "concerted activities," to form [[company union]]s, or to refuse to engage in collective bargaining with the union that represents their employees. It is also illegal to require any employee to join a union as a condition of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can I be required to be a union member or pay dues to a union?|url=http://www.nrtw.org/a/a_1_p.htm|publisher=National Right To Work|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unions are also able to secure safe work conditions and equitable pay for their labor.

At a workplace where a majority of workers have voted for union representation, a committee of employees and union representatives negotiate a contract with the management regarding wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment, such as protection from termination of employment without just cause. Individual negotiation is prohibited. Once the workers' committee and management have agreed on a contract, it is then put to a vote of all workers at the workplace. If approved, the contract is usually in force for a fixed term of years, and when that term is up, it is then renegotiated between employees and management. Sometimes there are disputes over the union contract; this particularly occurs in cases of workers fired without just cause in a union workplace. These then go to [[arbitration]], which is similar to an informal court hearing; a neutral arbitrator then rules whether the termination or other contract breach is extant, and if it is, orders that it be corrected.

In 24 U.S. states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrtw.org/right-to-work-states/|title=National Right to Work Foundation  » Right to Work States|author=|date=|website=www.nrtw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; employees who are working in a unionized shop may be required to contribute towards the cost of representation (such as at disciplinary hearings) if their fellow employees have negotiated a union security clause in their contract with management. Dues are generally 1–2% of pay. However, union members and other workers covered by collective agreements get, on average, a 5-10% wage markup over their nonunionized (or uncovered) counterparts.&lt;ref name="aidt2002"/&gt;  Some states, especially in the south-central and south-eastern regions of the U.S., have outlawed union security clauses; this can cause controversy, as it allows some net beneficiaries of the union contract to avoid paying their portion of the costs of contract negotiation.  Regardless of state, the Supreme Court has held that the Act prevents a person's union dues from being used without consent to fund political causes that may be opposed to the individual's personal politics. Instead, in states where union security clauses are permitted, such dissenters may elect to pay only the proportion of dues which go directly toward representation of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communications Workers of America v. Beck|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/487/735/|accessdate=2011-08-27}}, 487 U.S. 735.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[industrial revolution]] brought a swell of labour organizing in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The [[American Federation of Labor]] was formed in 1886, providing unprecedented bargaining powers for a variety of workers.&lt;ref name="curriculum"&gt;Illinois Labor History Society.

The [[Railway Labor Act]] (1926) required employers to bargain collectively with unions.

In 1931, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], in the case of ''Texas &amp; N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks'', upheld the act's prohibition of employer interference in the selection of bargaining representatives.&lt;ref name="curriculum"/&gt; In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] signed an executive order giving public-employee unions the right to collectively bargain with federal government agencies.&lt;ref name="curriculum"/&gt;

The [[Office of Labor-Management Standards]], part of the [[United States Department of Labor]], is required to collect all collective bargaining agreements covering 1,000 or more workers, excluding those involving railroads and airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective Bargaining Agreements File: Online Listings of Private and Public Sector Agreements|url=http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/cba/index.htm|website=Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS)|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide public access to these collections through [http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/cba/index.htm their website].

==OECD==
Only one in three [[OECD]] employees have wages which were agreed on through collective bargaining. The organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with its 36 members, has become an outspoken proponent for collective bargaining as a way to ensure that the falling unemployment also leads to higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2018/article.2018-07-04.6865902732|title=OECD: The crisis is over, but collective bargaining is needed for wage growth — Nordic Labour Journal|first=|last=lars|date=|website=www.nordiclabourjournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In Sweden the coverage of collective agreements is very high despite the absence of legal mechanisms to extend agreements to whole industries. In 2016, 84% of all private sector employees were covered by collective agreements, 100% of public sector employees and in all 90% (referring to the whole labor market).&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2018) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/kollektivavtalens-tackningsgrad-samt-organisationsgraden-hos-arbetsgivarfoerbund-och-fackfoerbund(ac892d07-5fbe-4e0e-a441-aa342da66c6a).html ''Kollektivavtalens täckningsgrad samt organisationsgraden hos arbetsgivarförbund och fackförbund''], Department of Sociology, Lund University.

A '''Community Benefits Agreement''' ("CBA") in the United States is a [[contract]] signed by community groups and a real estate developer that requires the developer to provide specific amenities and/or mitigations to the local community or neighborhood. In exchange, the community groups agree to publicly support the project, or at least not oppose it. Often, negotiating a CBA relies heavily upon the formation of a multi-issue, broad based community coalition including community, environmental, faith-based and labor organizations.

In the United Kingdom, [[Section 106 agreement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and in Canada, "Section 37" agreements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/01/16/section-37-what-it-is-and-why-everybodys-fighting-about-it-keenan.html| title=Section 37 — What it is, and why everybody's fighting about it| first=Edward| last=Keenan| date=January 16, 2015| publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly require certain benefits from developers, but differ from CBAs in that they are part of development agreements with governments, not communities.  CBAs are generally private, contractual agreements, although they can in some instances be made part of a development agreement with a city.&lt;ref&gt;Graser, D. Community Benefits and Tower Renewal (Evergreen, 2016). See also Gross, J. Community Benefits Agreements:  Definitions, Values and Legal Enforceability, Journal of Affordable Housing Vol. 17:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==

[[Economic development]] projects are often heavily [[subsidized]] by taxpayer dollars, but there is usually no guarantee that a project's “ripple effects” will benefit current residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable-development/beginners-guide|title=Good Jobs First, A Beginner's Guide to Accountable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments can cause inner-city [[gentrification]], pushing out low-income residents as housing prices rise, or they may create only [[working poor|low-wage retail and service sector jobs]]. As a result, many metropolitan regions continue to experience problems related to [[poverty]] and [[affordable housing|housing]], despite major investments in economic development.

Responding to these problems, the CBA model was created in the late 1990s as a way for the communities most impacted by economic development projects to participate in the planning process and seek to ensure that development benefits will accrue to existing communities.&lt;ref name="Understanding Community Benefits Agreements"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1272795 Patricia Salkin and Amy Lavine, Understanding Community Benefits Agreements: Equitable Development, Social Justice and Other Considerations for Developers, Municipalities and Community Organizations], published at 26 UCLA J. Envir. L. &amp; Pol. 291 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; For developers, negotiating with community representatives can be an attractive way to gain community support and help move their projects forward. Participating in CBA negotiations can eliminate surprises in the development approvals process and allow developers to work with a unified coalition rather than having to engage community organizations one by one.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook"&gt;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/downloads/CBA%20Handbook%202005%20final.pdf Julian Gross, Greg LeRoy &amp; Madeline Janis-Aparicio, Community Benefits Agreements: Making Development Projects Accountable (Good Jobs First 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Community Benefits Movement==

As [[local governments]] grappled with their responsibility to shape development and [[land use]] patterns, the community benefits movement emerged to challenge conventional thinking and offer a broader vision. Related to [[smart growth]] and [[environmental justice]], the community benefits movement aims to ensure that the main purpose of economic development is to bring measurable, permanent improvements to the lives of affected residents, particularly those in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. Organizations allied with the community benefits movement have pressured the public sector to play a more strategic role in land use planning and urban growth, and to leverage economic development subsidies toward the creation of good jobs, affordable housing, and neighborhood services that improve the quality of life for all residents.&lt;ref name="Understanding Community Benefits Agreements" /&gt;

The community benefits movement began in Los Angeles, with successful implementation at mixed-use projects at Hollywood and Highland,&lt;ref&gt;http://communitybenefits.blogspot.com/2008/01/hollywood-and-highland-center.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Staples Center / LA Live.&lt;ref&gt;http://communitybenefits.blogspot.com/2008/01/success-of-hollywood-and-highland-cba.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has since spread rapidly to other cities, including [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[New Haven]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Seattle]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].&lt;ref name="Case Studies of Current and Developing Agreements"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1117681 Patricia Salkin and Amy Lavine, Negotiating for Social Justice and the Promise of Community Benefits Agreements: Case Studies of Current and Developing Agreements], published at 17 J.

CBA advocates contend that the community benefits approach improves the development process for the community, developers and local officials by creating an overall win-win-win scenario.&lt;ref name="Leveraging Partnerships"&gt;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/downloads/CBs%20for%20Developers.pdf Community Benefits: Leveraging Partnerships for Successful Development (The Partnership for Working Families 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the principles and goals that CBA advocates seek to promote include:

'''Inclusiveness.''' The CBA negotiation process can provide a mechanism to ensure that community concerns are heard and addressed. While some cities do a good job of seeking community input and responding to it, many do not. Low-income neighborhoods, non-English speaking areas, and communities of color have historically been excluded from the development process. Laws concerning public notice and participation are often poorly enforced, and official public hearings are frequently held at times and places that are not neighborhood-friendly. Having a CBA negotiation process can help to address these problems, providing a forum for all parts of an affected community.

'''Enforceability.''' A CBA can ensure that a developer’s promises regarding community benefits are legally enforceable. Developers “pitching” a project often make promises that are never written into any project approval documents, and even when they are, they may not be monitored and enforced by the relevant government agencies. By creating an enforcement mechanism or expanding the class of parties who can enforce these promises, CBAs can make enforcement much easier.

'''Accountability.''' CBAs enable citizens to hold governments accountable for the use of tax dollars by giving them a voice in how development subsidies are distributed.&lt;ref name="Definitions, Values, and Legal Enforceability"&gt;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/downloads/CBAs%20Definitions%20Values%20and%20Legal%20Enforceability.pdf Julian Gross, Community Benefits Agreements: Definitions, Values, and Legal Enforceability, 17 J. Affordable Hous. 35 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CBA Coalitions==
At the heart of the community benefits strategy are community organizing and coalition building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17549175.2012.693125 | volume=5 | title=The grassroots and New Urbanism: a case from a Southern California Latino community | journal=Journal of Urbanism: International Research on Placemaking and Urban Sustainability | pages=219–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aecf.org/upload/PublicationFiles/AECF_CBA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10705420902862124 | volume=17 | title=Organizing Community and Labor Coalitions for Community Benefits Agreements in African American Communities: Ensuring Successful Partnerships | journal=Journal of Community Practice | pages=120–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing and maintaining a coalition, facilitating compromise and crafting a shared agenda are essential to creating a successful CBA. Coalitions can include a variety of community groups, such as neighborhood groups, environmental organizations, good-government organizations, labor unions, and faith-based organizations.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook" /&gt; Coalitions are usually unincorporated, but member community groups may enter into an operating agreement to govern their relationship in the coalition. A model CBA Coalition Operating Agreement has been created by the Public Law Center at [[Tulane Law School]].&lt;ref name="Operating Agreement"&gt;[http://www.law.tulane.edu/assets/0/260/262/719A253B-F54A-4A56-BBC4-7FDF754CCCAB.pdf Community Benefits Coalition Operating Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected officials and government agencies often play an active role in CBA negotiations. In California and other jurisdictions where development agreements are authorized, government representatives may be formal CBA signatories. In other cases, government officials may play a more informal role by facilitating CBA negotiations and encouraging cooperation.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook"/&gt;

==CBA Negotiations==

Typically, negotiations between a CBA coalition and a developer begin after a project has been announced but prior to governmental approval. However, there are examples of legislative CBA requirements attached to subsidies that impose community benefit standards on land within particular districts. For example, developers participating in the [[Atlanta Beltline]] project that opt to use [[tax increment financing]] are required to incorporate community benefits through a development or funding agreement.&lt;ref name="Case Studies of Current and Developing Agreements" /&gt;

==Possible benefits==
The CBA contract model allows each particular CBA to be tailored to the community’s needs, the size and type of the proposed development, and the relative bargaining power of the community groups and the developer. Benefits may be provided by the developer itself, or a CBA may require the developer to impose CBA provisions on its tenants, vendors, and contractors. Typically, CBAs include job quality standards, [[local hiring]] programs, and affordable housing requirements.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook" /&gt;

Other benefits include, among other things:

* [[Living wage]] and [[prevailing wage]] requirements
* Local hiring goals
* Job training programs
* [[Supplier diversity|Minority/women/local business contracting goals]]
* Provisions prohibiting developers from hiring contractors that have violated labor or other occupational laws (known as "responsible contractor" provisions)
* [[Union neutrality]] requirements
* Retail/commercial space set-asides for small and local businesses
* [[Big box]] retail restrictions
* [[Green building]] requirements
* Space set-asides for neighborhood organizations, community centers, child-care centers, and other non-profits
* Construction of [[parks]] and recreational facilities
* Provisions for community input in the selection of tenants
* Funding for community organizations/programs
* Mitigations in excess of those required under state/local law that address parking, traffic, increased pollution, and other environmental impacts
* [[Affordable housing]] requirements

The range of benefits offered by a CBA has been explored extensively in the scholarly literature,&lt;ref&gt;David A. Marcello, "Community Benefit Agreements: New Vehicle for Investment in America's Neighborhoods," 39 ''The Urban Lawyer'' 657 (2007), found at [http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlscenters/PublicLawCenter/home.aspx?id=3906 Tulane Public Law website] and [http://www.law.tulane.edu/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=6232 Tulane law School website article page].  Accessed September 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conferences, in an effort to raise awareness about the benefits of CBA's for developers, local government, and struggling communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlscenters/PublicLawCenter/home.aspx?id=3906 Win-Win-Win: The Advantages of CBA's for the Community, Developers, Government, and You, The Public Law Center and the Urban Land Institute Symposium on May 11, 2012]. Accessed September 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring==

Community groups should consider how each provision in a CBA will be monitored and enforced. Although financial commitments and other one-time benefits may be fairly easy to monitor, other developer and tenant commitments, such as living wage and local hiring requirements, may be in place for decades and require long-term oversight. To address this issue, CBAs have included periodic reporting and disclosure requirements, complaint investigation mechanisms, and provisions establishing oversight committees. Where a CBA is incorporated into a development agreement, government agencies may also play a role in monitoring the CBA's implementation.&lt;ref name="Understanding Community Benefits Agreements" /&gt;

==Enforcement==

As a CBA is a legally binding contract, it can be enforced only by the parties that signed it. CBAs that are incorporated into development agreements can be enforced by the government as well as by community groups.&lt;ref name="CBA Handbook" /&gt; To date, there is no [[case law]] regarding the validity and enforceability of CBAs. [[Donald Trump|Donald Trump's]] 1993 CBA-like contract relating to the New York City [[Riverside South (New York City)|Riverside South]] project was the subject of a 2008 New York Appellate Division opinion, but the court held that the contract's terms were expired.[http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2008/2008_10229.htm]

==Concerns and issues==
Although numerous CBAs have proven to be successful tools to improve the economic development process, a variety of criticisms have emerged. Perhaps the most significant criticism is that CBAs offer no way to ensure that they are truly representative of community needs and desires. The [[Atlantic Yards public opinion|Atlantic Yards CBA]], for example, has been criticized because it was negotiated by only a handful of community groups, all of which are receiving funding from the developer, while many other community groups were excluded from the negotiations. A report from the [[New York City Bar Association]] has also questioned whether CBA negotiators will drive appropriate bargains with developers, and whether CBAs will interfere with the planning process. Various legal problems relating to [[exactions]] and [[consideration]] may also weaken the effectiveness of CBAs.&lt;ref name="The Role of Community Benefit Agreements in New York City's Land Use Process"&gt;[http://www.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20071844-TheRoleofCommunityBenefitAgreementsinNYCLandUseProcess.pdf New York City Bar Association, The Role of Community Benefit Agreements in New York City's Land Use Process (Mar. 8, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent examples==
CBAs have been negotiated for numerous projects. The most well known CBA is likely the [[Los Angeles]] [[Staples Center]] CBA, which has generally been viewed as a success.[http://www.communitybenefits.org/article.php?id=1475] Other projects that have had CBAs include the Dearborn Street [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] project in [[Seattle]], the [[Consol Energy Center]] arena (for the [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins hockey team]]) in [https://web.archive.org/web/20121219161053/http://hdcg.org/HillCBA Pittsburgh], [[San Francisco's]] Bayview-Hunters Point residential development, the Gates-Cherokee redevelopment project in [[Denver]], and the Ballpark Village development in [[San Diego]].[http://www.communitybenefits.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=155#cbaslist]

The "CBAs" of some recent projects have not been accepted as legitimate CBAs by advocates of the community benefits movement. For example, the "CBA" for the new [[Yankee Stadium]] has not been considered to be a "true" CBA because it was negotiated by elected officials, not community groups.&lt;ref name="Definitions, Values, and Legal Enforceability" /&gt; The agreement did include significant community benefits such as $28,000,000 in grants and free tickets for local organizations.&lt;ref name=Yankees&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Timothy |title=$28 Million for the Bronx in the Yankees' Stadium Plan |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/nyregion/22bronx.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |via=The New York Times website |accessdate=October 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CBA has not been smoothly implemented. In 2009, the former administer the community fund sued the Yankees' community charity, claiming that the fund had been mismanaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/nyregion/01bronx.html?_r=3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the city of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, awarded a contract to Millennium Development Corporation to build its {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, 600-unit athletes' village on south east False Creek. This development included a CBA with targets to create 100 jobs for locally sourced and trained inner city residents and to procure a targeted $15 million in goods and services from the inner city. It also included a $750,000 legacy fund to train inner city residents.&lt;ref&gt;City of Vancouver {{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/pdf/CBAFactsheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328052745/http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/PDF/CBAFactsheet.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBA included investment and support from the Canadian Federal Government, BC Provincial Government, the City of Vancouver and Building Opportunities with Business Inner-City Society [[Building Opportunities with Business]] (a community economic development non-profit also known as BOB) these parties collectively are recognized under the Vancouver Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316205956/http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm |archivedate=2005-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBA also received support from Bell, VanCity, the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation and the Vancouver Regional Construction Association. Building Opportunities with Business oversaw the use of the legacy funds, sourced labor and supported the inner city residents with training and aid while the VRCA oversaw the training of residents. Though the Olympic Village was widely criticized for going over budget, in a 2008 report to the City prepared by BOB the creation of 120 jobs with procurement closer to $50 million is cited. The report also admits that tracking the actual economic activity from the development was difficult and that the procurement is not exact. Regardless of the difficulty tracking procurement and the fact that the project went over budget the CBA is widely considered to be a success.

An updated examination into past, current, and future CBAs, can be found in [http://www.law.tulane.edu/uploadedFiles/Institutes_and_Centers/Public_Law_Center/Summary%20and%20Index%20of%20%20Community%20Benefit%20Agreements.pdf this summary].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlscenters/PublicLawCenter/home.aspx?id=3906 Daniel LaSalle, Summary and Index of Community Benefit Agreements, published at The Public Law Center (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''contract of sale''', '''sales contract''', '''sales order''', or '''contract for sale'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=contract+of+sale%2Ccontract+for+sale%2Csales+contract%2Csales+agreement%2Csales+order&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ccontract%20of%20sale%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccontract%20for%20sale%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20contract%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20agreement%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20order%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngram Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal [[contract]] for the purchase of assets (goods or property) by a buyer (or purchaser) from a seller (or vendor) for an agreed upon value in money (or money equivalent). 

An obvious ancient practice of exchange, in many [[common law]] jurisdictions, it is now governed by statutory law. See [[commercial law]].

Contracts of sale involving [[good (economics)|goods]] are governed by Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in most [[jurisdiction]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. However in [[Quebec]], such contracts are governed by the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] as a [[nominate contract]] in the book on the [[law of obligations]]. In Muslim countries it is governed by [[sharia]] (Islamic law).

A contract of sale lays out the terms of a transaction of goods or services, identifying the goods sold, listing delivery instructions, inspection period, any warranties and details of payment.

== Personal life ==
Emilio Lavazza was born on August 7, 1932 in Turin, Italy. Lavazza was married to Maria Teresa, who is a socialist and a humanitarian. She was also the captain of the Italian National Team, known as the "Second Blue Team." Lavazza and Teresa have two children: Joseph (son), and Francesca (daughter).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgeonlineworldcup.com/maria-teresa-lavazza/|title=Maria Teresa Lavazza {{!}} Yeh Online Bridge World Cup|website=bridgeonlineworldcup.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lavazza's spokesperson, he was described as having a reserved-calm [[introverted]] personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8522663.stm Emilio Lavazza, boss of coffee giant, dies aged 78]  ''BBC News Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having this reserved personality, he was also a multi-dimensional person who enjoyed various activities: playing [[golf]], [[fishing]], reading murder mystery books, listening to [[Jazz|jazz music]], and collecting models of [[soldier]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lavazza had written two murder mystery books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On February 18, 2010, Lavazza died at the age of 78,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stancati|first=Margherita|date=February 19, 2010|title=Emilio Lavazza: 1932 - 2010; Italy's King of Coffee|url=https://search.proquest.com/wallstreetjournal/docview/237950581/6D0A9B993D72457EPQ/2?accountid=35779|journal=Wall Street Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his wife and two children to take charge of the company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Emilio Lavazza's History ==
As Lavazza grew older, he became invested in his [[family business]] that was started by his grandfather, [[Luigi Lavazza|Luigi]], in 1895. Previously, Luigi worked as a salesman, but soon bought a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] which transformed into the Lavazza company. Emilio joined the company in 1955. His role in the company expanded when his father, Beppe, died in 1971. He became the Chief Executive and succeeded his uncle Pericle and became the company's President in 1979.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Emilio spoke multiple languages, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]], which assisted him in making the company more successful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the year of 1892, the Lavazza company had expanded in international countries, such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. To promote the brand, Lavazza used the "[[bandwagon effect|bandwagon tactic]]" by using famous-award winning actors, [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Monica Vitti]], to promote the Lavazza coffee brand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lavazza had invested himself in advancing technology to produce greater quality of coffee. He called the need for having [[coffee capsules]] for shot brewing, and developed the technology to roast and vend the coffee in the later years of his leadership within the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, he made a productive partnership coalition with [[Catalans|Catalan]] Chef Ferran Adria, who is the founder of "[[Molecular gastronomy|Molecular Gastronomy]]" and worked at El Bulli restaurant. With this collaboration, they worked together to produce novelty coffee products and Italian caviar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the growing success of the Lavazza company under Emilio's reign, he managed to obtain recognition worldwide. He received various honors, such as becoming the President of European Coffee Roasters Associazione Italiana Industrie Prodotti Alimentari and was honored with the title of "Calivere del Lavoro" by the [[President of Italy|Italian President]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mobile.ilsole24ore.com/solemobile/main/art/SoleOnLine4/Economia%20e%20Lavoro/2010/02/emilio-lavazza-morte-caffe-italiano?fn=srchFdold&amp;id=SEARCH/NEWS24/becd79c6-1bcd-11df-b68a-7f42509e5788|title=È morto Emilio Lavazza,  il padre del caffè italiano - Il Sole 24 Ore|website=mobile.ilsole24ore.com|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Lavazza further expanded the company in [[Portugal]] to reinforce the idea of internationalism. Furthermore, in 2015, the Lavazza company faced inconsistent fluctuations in their shares, which resulted in the [[Keurig]] company to buy half of the shares that are worth $624 million. The Lavazza company has a home beverage maker share that is worth approximately 6.6% and in February, the shares' value dropped 7.8%. Keurig purchased 5.2 million shares with a 3% discount because of the stock's declining prices.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/27/will-lavazza-be-able-to-take-down-starbucks.html|title=Will this brand be able to take down Starbucks?|last=Castillo|first=Michelle|date=2015-10-27|work=CNBC|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Keurig was able to maintain the stability of the company's condition.

Prior to retiring, on February 1, 2008, Lavazza signed an agreement to occupy one of the Brazilian companies, Cafe Grao Nobre Ltda, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. After signing the agreement, Lavazza had also obtained Cafe Terra Brasil in [[São Paulo|Sao Paulo]], Brazil. With these two major transactions, the Lavazza company becomes one of the major coffee vendors in the world.

== The Lavazza Company Today ==
Today, the Lavazza company sells coffee in four broad categories: [[Grounds for Coffee|ground]], whole bean, [[espresso]], and single serve in the variations of dark to medium roastings. The pricing of the coffee typically varies from $0.00 to $30.00 maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shoplavazza.com/coffee?price=20-|title=Coffee ShopLavazza|website=shoplavazza.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, the company's profits had increased to $139.9 million after Emilio's death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8224">In finance, the '''equivalent annual cost''' ('''EAC''') is the cost per year of owning and operating an asset over its entire lifespan. It is calculated by dividing the [[Net present value|NPV]] of a project by the "present value of [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] factor":

&lt;math&gt; EAC = \frac{NPV}{A_{t,r}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{A_{t,r}} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^t}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where r is the annual interest rate and

t is the number of years.

Alternatively, EAC can be obtained by multiplying the NPV of the project by the "loan repayment factor".

EAC is often used as a decision making tool in [[capital budgeting]] when comparing investment projects of unequal lifespans. However, the projects being compared must have equal risk: otherwise, EAC must not be used.{{sfn|Copeland|Weston|1988|p=51}}

The technique was first discussed in 1923 in engineering literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fish|first= John Charles Lounsbury|date= 1923|title= Engineering Economics|url= |location= New York|publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]]|page= |asin= B001CZKN9K|edition= 2nd}}, and expanded upon in {{cite book |last= Grant|first= Eugene L.|date= 1930|title= Principles of Engineering Economy|url= |location= New York|publisher= Ronald Press|page= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a consequence, EAC appears to be a favoured technique employed by [[engineer]]s, while [[accountant]]s tend to prefer [[net present value]] (NPV) analysis.{{sfn|Jones|Smith|1982|p=103}} Such preference has been described as being a matter of professional education, as opposed to an assessment of the actual merits of either method.{{sfn|Jones|Smith|1982|p=108}} In the latter group, however, the [[Society of Management Accountants of Canada]] endorses EAC, having discussed it as early as 1959 in a published [[monograph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= C. Geoffrey|last= Edge|authorlink= |title= The appraisal of capital expenditures|url= http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2015-11-09T14%3A20%3A58Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=11838055&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Aamicus&amp;lang=eng|year= 1959|publisher= Society of Industrial Accountants of Canada|location= [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]|ol= 16634923M }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was a year before the first mention of NPV in accounting textbooks).{{sfn|Jones|Smith|1982|p=106}}

==Application==
EAC can be used in the following scenarios:

#Assessing alternative projects of unequal lives (where only the costs are relevant) in order to address any built-in bias favouring the longer-term investment.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=74{{endash}}78}}
#Determining the optimum economic life of an asset, through charting the change in EAC that may occur due to the fluctuation of operating costs and salvage values over time.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=78{{endash}}80}}
#Assessing whether leasing an asset would be more economical than purchasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Leasing vs. Buying Farm Machinery|url = http://www.agmanager.info/farmmgt/machinery/MF2953.pdf|publisher = Department of Agricultural Economics, [[Kansas State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Assessing whether increased maintenance costs will economically change the useful life of an asset.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=88{{endash}}89}}
#Calculating how much should be invested in an asset in order to achieve a desired result (i.e., purchasing a storage tank with a 20-year life, as opposed to one with a 5-year life, in order to achieve a similar EAC).{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=90{{endash}}91}}
#Comparing to estimated annual cost savings, in order to determine whether it makes economic sense to invest.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|p=94}}
#Estimating the cost savings required to justify the purchase of new equipment.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|p=96}}
#Determining the cost of continuing with existing equipment.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|p=97}}
#Where an asset undergoes a major overhaul, and the cost is not fully reflected in salvage values, to calculate the optimum life (i.e., lowest EAC) of holding on to the asset.{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=98{{endash}}99}}

==A practical example==
A manager must decide on which machine to purchase, where the cost of capital is 5%:&lt;ref&gt;demonstrated at {{cite web|title=Equivalent Annual Cost |url=http://formularium.org/?go=82 |publisher=formularium.org }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
! Option
! Machine A
! Machine B
|-
| Investment cost || $50,000 || $150,000
|-
| Expected lifetime || 3 years || 8 years
|-
| Annual maintenance cost || $13,000 || $7500
|-
|Equivalent annual cost || &lt;math&gt;\frac{\$50\,000}{A_{3,5}}+\$13\,000=\$31\,360&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{\$150\,000}{A_{8,5}}+\$7\,500=\$30\,708&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The conclusion is to invest in machine B since it has a lower EAC.

==Canadian context with capital cost allowance==
Such analysis can also be carried out on an after-tax basis, and extensive work has been undertaken in Canada for investment appraisal of assets subject to its [[capital cost allowance]] regime for computing depreciation for income tax purposes. It is subject to a three-part calculation:{{sfn|Edge|Irvine|1981|pp=74{{endash}}102}}

#Determination of the after-tax NPV of the investment
#Calculation of the after-tax NPV of the operating cost stream
#Applying a [[sinking fund]] amortization factor to the after-tax amount of any salvage value.

In mathematical notation, for assets subject to the general half-year rule of CCA calculation, this is expressed as:

&lt;math&gt; EAC = \frac{I \left [ 1-\left (\frac{td}{i+d}\right )\left (\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}i}{1+i}\right ) \right ]}{A_{n,i}} + \frac{1}{A_{n,i}}\sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{{R_n}\left (1-t\right )}{(1+i)^{n}} - \frac{S \left [ 1-\left (\frac{td}{i+d}\right )\left (\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}i}{1+i}\right ) \right ]}{F_{n,i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:''A'' = Capital recovery (amortization) factor
:''F'' = Sinking fund amortization factor
:''I'' = Investment
:''S'' = Estimated salvage value
:&lt;math&gt;{R_n}&lt;/math&gt; = Operating expense stream
:''d'' = CCA rate per year for tax purposes
:''t'' = rate of taxation
:''n'' = number of years
:''i'' = [[cost of capital]], rate of interest, or minimum rate of return (whichever is most relevant)

A '''general assignment or assignment''' is a concept in [[bankruptcy law]] that has a similar meaning, due to common law ancestry, in different jurisdictions, but wide dispersion in practical application. The "assignment for the benefit of creditors", also known as an ABC or AFBC is an alternative to bankruptcy, which is a "general assignment"/"assignment" concept.

==The United States==
In the [[United states]], a general assignment or an assignment for the benefit of creditors is simply a contract whereby the insolvent entity ("Assignor") transfers legal and equitable title, as well as custody and control of its property, to a third party ("Assignee") in trust, to apply the proceeds of sale to the assignor's creditors in accord with priorities established by law.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

An assignment for the benefit of creditors is a relatively well-established common law tool and is one alternative to a bankruptcy. An assignment for the benefit of creditors is designed to save time and expense by concluding the affairs of a bankrupt company. The assignment for the benefit of creditors is a state form of bankruptcy action versus a federal form of bankruptcy action. The assignment for the benefit of creditor’s process is similar in character to a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy and parallels some of the same procedures, but is not an actual "bankruptcy" in the form the word is used in the United States.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Mechanism===
The assignment for the benefit of creditors is a common law contract between the board of directors and the assignee in which the board "assigns" the assets and liabilities of the company to the assignee, a third party. The assignment for the benefit of creditors contract is usually recorded the public record at a town, a city, a county or a state level. Each state will differ on recording requirements for the assignment for the benefit of creditors contract.{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

The physical filing of the assignment usually occurs after: the board of directors has spoken with local insolvency counsel; a board of directors authorization of some nature has been enacted; an appropriate assignee chosen; and the contract has been written. The assignee's primary goal is to try to make the creditors whole. The assignee performs duties similar to a trustee under federal bankruptcy. The assignee has a similar, if not equivalent, fiduciary role as the bankruptcy trustee. The assignee has the primary responsibility to: liquidate the assets of the company; vette creditor claims; and issue a dividend to the creditors. The creditors are the assignee's top priority, not shareholders. Shareholders by definition have a residual claim on assets once all creditors are satisfied.{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

The assignee, once the assignment process is completed, issues a dividend. The dividend is derived from the sale of assets, collection of receivables, recovery of the bankrupt company’s assets and cash. Certain creditors may or may not receive a dividend. The assignee's hope is to provide a one-to-one redemption of the creditor’s claims; however, this depends on the amount of cash an assignee can marshal in the liquidation process.{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

The claims process is similar to a standard bankruptcy action in which creditors submit claims to the assignee for review and acceptance. The acceptance and vetting of claims is an important process to ensure that no one creditor has overstated their claim. There are rare occasions in which an assignee may issue a non-cash dividend as part of the overall dividend to creditors on their claims, but a dividend of this type is not common. If all the creditors are made whole, shareholders would then have a claim on the remainder of the dividend. This holds true only if there are no other classes of equity that have priority senior to the shareholders.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

The order of creditor’s claims usually follows the normal bankruptcy order prescribed in [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|a Chapter 7 bankruptcy]], generally secured, and unsecured in descending order. The assignee, depending on the specific state law may use [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code]] as needed. Neither the federal bankruptcy court nor a state court usually oversee this process, however the assignee is subject in most cases to a look back provision within the state the assignment took place.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

A Federal Bankruptcy Court judge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy must approve the sale of the bankrupt company's assets, thus adding time and expense on to the entire liquidation process. The assets sold in an assignment for the benefit of creditor process do not usually require a judge's intervention. It is this removal of the court from the liquidation process which increases the speed of the assets sold in an assignment process. This is one substantial difference from a regular bankruptcy.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Creditors===
Secured and unsecured creditors constitute the creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors are ahead of shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Secured creditor influence===
If there has been a determination by company management and interested parties such as a secured creditor that even after restructuring, a "going concern" may still not viable. A secured creditor or group of secured creditors frequently may encourage the company's senior management to pursue this liquidation mechanism. Secured creditor(s) may encourage this type of action to relieve themselves of the legal costs and risks associated with the [[foreclosure]] and sale of its [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. One specific risk a secured creditor wants to avoid is preference or the perception of preference in the liquidation process (see [[fraudulent transfer]]).{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

In situations where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's [[lien]], the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a [[secured creditor]] or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An assignee in practice may obtain the consent of the secured creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the assignee can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a secured party stopping or holding up the assignment process. Secured party consent in this case is optional, not necessary.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

In situations where the liquidation value of the assets is less than a secured creditor's lien, the assignment process can be done, however a vast number of legal questions need to be reconciled before the assignment process can possibly be initiated. There unfortunately is no concise answer in this particular situation.{{fact|date=January 2016}}   

Secured creditors may in certain instances assume the senior management roles within the bankrupt company, however noted earlier this situation occurs when the secured creditor(s) have [[foreclosed]] on their [[lien]]. Large secured creditors again may influence the decision making process, but that [[secured creditor]] can not enter into that contract on behalf of the bankrupt company. Only the bankrupt company's senior management and/or board of directors have the power to do an assignment.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Dividend===
The dividend is hopefully the payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted and all the assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are in the form of cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Key attributes of the process===
Noted earlier this is a state form of bankruptcy, not federal form. The assignment process or any bankruptcy process for that matter is a legal matter. The state attributes of an assignment process may be understood by any attorney however a local/regional bankruptcy attorney in the specific state usually is best equipped to handle the legal end of the process for the company making the assignment. This is not asserted to diminish an attorney’s capabilities, but to stress the legal niche that this legal instrument falls within, bankruptcy. Non legal staff familiar with bankruptcy and the assignment process can also affect the speed validity of the process.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===General assignment attributes===
The general rule is that any [[debtor]] may make an assignment.  This would include any individual, [[partnership]], [[corporation]] or limited liability company that owes anything to anyone.  Any debtor owning property has the common law right to make an assignment.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

==Other common law countries==
In other common law countries, general assignments usually refer to any general assignment of existing or future book debts by a natural person (including, in some cases, partnerships).  A general assignment made by a natural person who is subsequently adjudged bankrupt is [[void (law)|void]] against the trustee in bankruptcy as regards any book debts which have not been paid prior to the presentation of the bankruptcy petition. {{fact|date=January 2016}}

The definition of book debts includes "debts which in the ordinary course of business would be entered in a well-kept trade book",&lt;ref&gt;''Re Shipley v Marshall'' [1863] 4 C.B. 566&lt;/ref&gt; future debts and future rents under a [[hire purchase]] agreement.  [[Bill of exchange|Bills of exchange]] also fall within the definition of book debts,&lt;ref&gt;''Re Siebe Gorman v Barclays Bank Plc'' [1979] 2 Lloyds Rep 142&lt;/ref&gt; but a bank balance does not.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Brightlife Ltd'' [1987] 1 Ch 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Under (for example) [[English law]], any general assignment, either absolute or by way of security, of book debts is void unless registered under the Bills of Sale Act 1878.   A trustee would not be able to attack an assignment under this section which relates to debts due from specified debtors or debts becoming due under specified contracts or where the debts were assigned as part of a ''[[bona fide]]'' transfer of a business or the assignment is for the benefit of creditors generally.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

==Controversy and conflicts==
On August 10, 2016, the Greek Prosecutor for Financial Crimes, Panagiotis Athanasiou, ordered the freezing of Alafouzos' property and bank accounts, after an investigation by the Greek Center for the Audit of High-Income Taxpayers (KEFOMEP) concluded that certain amounts were not reflected in his tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/601898/desmeuthike-i-periousia-tou-gianni-alafouzou-apo-to-kefomep/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnos.gr/oikonomia/arthro/desmeusi_tis_periousias_tou_g_alafouzou-64443266/&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Alafouzos proceeded to pay the amount due, certified by KEFOMEP, and his property was released. Alafouzos stated that he welcomed the audit and that he would assist in the process with any available information. 

In 2016, SKAI TV journalist Kyriakos Thomaidis and Giannis Alafouzos, being the Managing Director of SKAI, were sued for violating the Privacy Act regarding the [[2015 Greek football scandal]] but were cleared of all charges. Giannis Alafouzos has come up against much opposition in his efforts to reveal corruption in Greek football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sdna.gr/news-english/article/175139/alafouzos-believes-its-time-football-be-cleaned|title=Alafouzos to start talks with PAOK and AEK against football corruption|access-date=2018-07-05|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/09/22/president-of-panathinaikos-fc-leaves-club/|title=President of Panathinaikos FC Leaves Club {{!}} GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-commitment management''' emphasizes personal responsibility, independence, and [[empowerment]] of employees across all levels instead of focusing on one higher power; it always intended to keep commitment at high level  “calling all the shots”.&lt;ref name="WesenbergSean"&gt;Wesenberg, Sean. Phone Interview. 18 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

A high commitment system is unusual in its job design and cultural structure. These practices emphasize getting the tasks complete, but do it in a way that their employees enjoy doing it. According to Harvard Business School Professor Michael Beer, “leaders develop an organizational design, business processes, goals and measures, and capabilities that are aligned with a focused, winning strategy.”&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Michael and Russell A. Eisenstat. ''High Commitment, High Performance: How to Build a Resilient Organization for Sustained Advantage''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of environment allows employees to approach tasks at ease, wearing jeans instead of suits and staying home to watch their children get on the bus for school before coming to work. Technology also plays a role in this system. Recently,{{When|date=November 2012}} technology has slaughtered barriers of communication, which makes this high-commitment model fit that much better. That father waiting for the bus can still answer phone calls and check emails for work, so is he working or is he spending time with his daughter? He can be doing both.&lt;ref name="WesenbergSean" /&gt; As long as the job gets done, this system is casual on how it gets done, relieving employees of constant stress.

A flat organizational structure is one of the biggest success factors. Individuals are responsible for their own decision-making and these decisions, their skill, and their performance is how they get paid. Instead of putting too much weight on the individual, “people are likely to see the locus of the control coming from ‘within’ through the adoption of self-created demands and pressures as opposed to external and making them feel subordinate.” &lt;ref name="LoweJim" /&gt; While these companies allow each employee to be a manager in their own way and try not to distinguish its structure by higher levels of employment, it doesn’t mean that they lack these higher powers entirely. It's that under this system people aren’t relying on the general managers, CEOs, or other employees to do their work for them. This personal discipline is what drives the employees to help the company be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Jim, and Nick Oliver. "The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a Hi-Tech Industry." ''Work, Employment &amp; Society'' 5.3 (1991): 437-50. Print&lt;/ref&gt; and eliminates the chance at a thought like, “Why would I want to help my company become better if I know I’m just going to get yelled at?” &lt;ref&gt;Wesenberg, Sean. Phone Interview. 18 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus of high commitment practices is their employee relationships. They only hire people who are flexible, determined, and are willing to handle challenges. Because this system relies on individual performance, there is a big emphasis on hiring the right people for the job. The detailed recruitment process can consist of many interviews with different members of the company, an induction course, and in some cases, team-building exercises.&lt;ref name="LoweJim" /&gt; Once found, the right employees help create a strong bond and high trust throughout the entire company.

High commitment workplaces are successful through their importance on an individual’s responsibility in order to help the team prosper. By creating a culture that motivates individuals to want to succeed while sustaining high commitment, “these firms stand out by having achieved long periods of excellence.” &lt;ref&gt;Beer, Michael and Russell A. Eisenstat. ''High Commitment, High Performance: How to Build a Resilient Organization for Sustained Advantage''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

High-commitment management firms are designed by their founders or transformational chief executives to achieve sustained high [[Organizational commitment|commitment]] from employees. The application of high-commitment management in firms today originated from an alignment of the employees’ and the firm’s mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beer|first=Michael|title=High Commitment, High Performance|year=2009|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|Sociologist]]s{{Who|date=November 2012}} attribute this congruence as a product of [[job performance|performance]] and psychological collaboration between the firm and its employees. Since its initial developments, high commitment management has been driven by self-regulated behavior and performance-driven group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Nathaniel. "High Commitment, High Performance Management” HBS Working Knowledge. Harvard Business School, 10 August 2009. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6119.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the top-down leadership practices, high-commitment management took form as leaders engaged and listened to people, allowing ideas from different levels of the organization to push the firm forward.

===Self-directed work teams===
In a study of illumination in the workplace of [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne]] and the [[Western Electric Company]], a sociologist from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Elton Mayo]], concluded that when the organization established experimental work groups, “the individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation.”&lt;ref name="MayoElton"&gt;Mayo, Elton 1984 [1949]. ― Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.‖ Pp. 279-292 in ''Organization Theory: Selected Readings''. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a natural system{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} of collaboration, the teams are not only responsible for the work but also the management of their group. Mayo’s research uncovered that teams under their own direction established a capacity for self-motivated learning and change.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Elton 1984 [1949]. ―Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company.‖ Pp. 279-292 in Organization Theory: Selected Readings. Second Edition. Edited by D.S. Pugh. New York: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of designing the work system with the full participation of the people proved to be a breakthrough for organizations during the 1990s. During that time, employees closest to the product and customer began to have increasing decision making capacities and capabilities.&lt;ref name="fic.wharton.upenn"&gt;Hunter, Larry W., and Lorin M. Hitt. "What Makes a Committed Workplace?" Wharton Business School. University of Pennsylvania, 24 July 2002. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/papers/00/0030.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview programs===
The Hawthorne Experiments sought to determine a correlation between light levels and productivity. Researchers had divided the employees into teams of six and interviewed the individuals to determine the effect of the lighting. Mayo discovered that the interview program set up by the study inherently gave the employees a sense of higher purpose.&lt;ref name="MayoElton" /&gt; Exposure of employee thoughts and concerns to managers appeared to be a fundamental aspect of the relation between managers and employees. Evidently, by having the ability to speak to their managers, the employees at Western Electric exhibited a dramatic improvement in their attitudes towards work.&lt;ref&gt;Mifflin, Jeffrey. "Western Electric Company. Hawthorne Studies Collection, 1924-1961 (inclusive): A Finding Aid." Western Electric Company. Hawthorne Studies Collection, 1924-1961 (inclusive): A Finding Aid. Harvard Business School, 04 Jan. 1998. Web. 16 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00047&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Essential to a highly committed work force, the interview program formally developed and sustained cooperation with management.

===Problem-solving teams===
The Hawthorne experiment further highlighted that teams working without coercion from above or limitation from below could astonish even their own expectations of themselves. Sociologist [[Fritz Roethlisberger]] argued that this informal organization left the team responsible for addressing the myriad of problems that continuously arose. Roethlisberger noted by studying the chemistry of informal groups that human interactions and collaboration have the potential to set when teams have to face problems on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Roethlisberger, Fritz J. and William J. Dickson. 1981 [1939]. ―Human Relations.‖ Pp. 67-83 in The Sociology of Organizations: Basic Studies. Second Edition. Edited by O. Grusky and G. A. Miller. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together the individuals of the team strive to improve the processes of the team by adapting to different demands and learning from each other.

===Cross training===
Cross training began to be heavily examined through the scope of modern Japanese management in the automobile industry in the 1970s. Sociologists examined the way in which the Japanese automobile firms cross-trained its employees through a company wide orientation and training program. As Japanese firms trained their employees in a multitude of aspects in the production process, sociologists discovered that the training brought the employees together and formed a connection in which all the employees were dedicated to the company’s mission.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Laurie 1993. ―Inside a Japanese Transplant: A Critical Perspective.‖ Work and Occupations. 20(2):147-173.&lt;/ref&gt; These established connections appeared to solicit cooperation among the work force.&lt;ref name="fic.wharton.upenn" /&gt; The Japanese auto plants revealed that flexibility within the production teams allowed employees to work on their own tasks while keeping others efficient.

==Difference from other management strategies==

High-commitment practices are spin-offs from the natural system of managements.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin"&gt;Frank Dobbin, “From Incentives to Teamwork: Rational and Natural Management Systems” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 1 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Like other management strategies in the natural system of management,&lt;ref&gt;E. Mayo.'Hawthorne and the Western Electric Company'.The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization. Routledge, 1949. chapter 4. pp. 60-76.&lt;/ref&gt; High-commitment practices assume natural theories of motivation &lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt; rather than the considerably different rational theories of motivation.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt;
[[File:Rational and Natural Theories of Motivation.jpg|thumb|Differences between rational and natural management systems &lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt;]] Because most management strategies before High Commitment practices assumed rational theories of motivation, high-commitment practices differ from these strategies in three primary aspects.

===Employee motivation===
In terms of methods of motivating workers, differences between High Commitment Practices and strategies from the rational system of management are extreme. The rational system of management focuses on either punishments or incentives.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin" /&gt; For example, the earliest form of rational management, ''direct control'', encourages employee productivity by having supervisors oversee the production process and punish workers who are not producing enough outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Managing the Workforce” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 17 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of rational management, ''bureaucratic control'', encourages productivity through career incentives like bonuses and promotions. However, High Commitment Practices, unlike any rational management, aim to stimulate productivity by encouraging employee commitment to the institution.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a"&gt;Frank Dobbin, “High Commitment Practices” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 10 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Data General, a corporation which advocates High Commitment Practices, manages to make employees love their tasks and grow attached to the corporation so much that many employees elect to work twelve hours, four more than Data General prescribes.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Kidder, The Soul of a New Machine, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to rational management, High Commitment Practices attempt to create scenarios in which employees aspire to deliver their best efforts.

===Employee control===
High Commitment Practices also differ from practices in the rational management system with regards to employee control. The rational system of management discourages job autonomy, believing that such freedom will only lower productivity because employees will elect not to work. For example, in ''[[scientific management]]'' and ''Fordism'',&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Federick W. "Scientific Management." CLASSICAL THEORETICAL PERSPECTlVES : 54-66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; employees are micro-managed- they are given specific instructions  on how to perform certain tasks. However, High Commitment Practices encourage job autonomy, creativity, and innovation,&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a" /&gt; all of which institutions with High Commitment Practices believe will increase job satisfaction and commitment leading to increased outputs. While the rational system of management attempts to micro-manage employees, High Commitment Practices greatly encourage independence.

===Influence on corporate structure===
With respect to corporate structure, institutions employing rational management and institutions employing high commitment practices also differ. Institutions with rational management tend to have a steep hierarchy with many ranks between floor-workers and executives.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Internal Labor Market” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 14 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, institutions employing bureaucratic control often have one entry level at the bottom of the hierarchy, and new recruits slowly work their ways up the seemingly endless ladder. Because these institutions have a steep hierarchy, those near the bottom of the chain are often alienated from higher ups&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobbin, “Alienation” (Sociology 25, Harvard University, Cambridge MA, 19 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, relationship between executives and workers are minimal. However, institutions which employ High Commitment Practices have fairly flat hierarchy and intra-firm networking is easy. As a result, most employees readily develop attachment to their on-job peers, bosses, and the institution, increasing their commitment. While the rational system of management maintains distance between executive and lower employees, High Commitment Practices foster good relationship between the two.

===Other natural managements===
While high-commitment practices are similar to other strategies in the system, particularly the Human Relations School, in terms of the three aspects previously discussed, their goals are different. Although both attempt to increase job satisfaction and make employees feel valued, High Commitment Practices seek to make employees feel attached to their institutions while the Human Relations School simply seek to make employees aspire to work because of the satisfaction gained from contributing outputs.&lt;ref name="FrankDobbin_a" /&gt;

With the significant shift in the way firms are motivating their employees in recent years,{{When|date=November 2012}} many companies are beginning to realize that having a “strong [[corporate culture]]” is an important ingredient in organizational success.  Employee commitment is “replacing traditional controls such as direct supervision and bureaucratic arrangements.” &lt;ref name="LoweJim"&gt;Lowe, Jim, and Nick Oliver. "The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a Hi-Tech Industry." Work, Employment &amp; Society 5.3 (1991): 437-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer do these high commitment workplaces rely on their CEOs to force the workers to produce, but instead, these workers are self-motivated to bring their best to the company.

One company that follows this high commitment model is [[Google]].  A little over a decade ago,{{When|date=November 2012}} Google was an unknown. Today, Google not only refers to the multinational corporation which provides Internet-related products and services, but it has also become a common verb many use every day—“just Google it.”  What sets Google apart from many companies, however, is its unique{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} corporate culture.  Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the two men wanted Google to be a place where people would enjoy work.  The company’s philosophies, which include principles such as “work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun” and “you can be serious without a suit”, are consistent with its innovative and informal environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Things We Know to Be True." Google Company. Google, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of organization, Google maintains “a casual and democratic atmosphere, resulting in its distinction as a ‘Flat’ company.”&lt;ref name="JohanssonGreg"&gt;Johansson, Greg. "Google: The World's Most Successful Corporate Culture." Weblog post.Suite 101. N.p., 29 May 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earlier years, Google had a fairly informal product-development system.  Ideas moved upwards from “Googlers” without any formal review process from senior managers, and teams working on innovative projects were kept small.  However, with the continuing expansion of the company, Google now holds weekly, all-hands (‘TGIF’) meetings at which employees ask questions directly to Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and other executives about any number of company issues.  This is consistent with the idea that high commitment work systems “typically involve practices that enhance communication across organizational levels.” &lt;ref&gt;Burton, M. Diane, and Charles O'Reilly. Walking the Talk: The Impact of High Commitment Values and Practices on Technology Start-ups. Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, employees are encouraged to propose wild, ambitious ideas, and supervisors are assigned small teams to test if these ideas will work.  Teams are made up of members with equal authority—“there is no top-down hierarchy”—and nearly everyone at Google carries a generic job title, such as “product manager.” &lt;ref name="JohanssonGreg" /&gt;

Google hires those who are “smart and determined,” and it favors “ability over experience.” &lt;ref&gt;"Our Culture." Google Company. Google, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2012. &lt;https://www.google.com/ about/company/facts/culture/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview on the company’s corporate culture and hiring, Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, stressed the importance of evaluating potential hires’ passions and commitments in addition to their technical qualifications.  He said that “people are going to do what they’re going to do, and you (company, leader) just assist them.” &lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eric. "Corporate Culture Example: Google’s Eric Schmidt On Culture &amp; Hiring." Interview. Weblog post. Culture Matters: Corporate Culture Pros Blog. Corporate Culture Pros, 6 July 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.corporateculturepros.com/2011/07/corporate-culture-example-google-hiring/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Google does not believe that its job is to manage the company; instead, it believes that its greatest task is to hire the right people.  And once the company has those people, it “will see a building of ‘self-initiative’ behavior”—one of the important characteristics of people working in high commitment workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Eric. "Corporate Culture Example: Google’s Eric Schmidt On Culture &amp; Hiring." Interview. Weblog post. Culture Matters: Corporate Culture Pros Blog. Corporate Culture Pros, 6 July 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.corporateculturepros.com/2011/07/corporate-culture-example-google-hiring/&gt;.).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, all engineers at Google are allotted 20 percent of their time to work on their own ideas—some of which yield public offerings, such as [[Google News]] and [[Orkut]], a [[social networking]] website.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}


==Implementation difficulties and disadvantages==

While there is substantial evidence that high commitment management practices have many benefits to the efficiency and well-being of the workplace as seen above, there are some disadvantages and difficulties found in the system.

Much of the research presenting strong evidence of success with high commitment management practices may actually be due to confounding variables. An example of this can be seen in research by Burton and O’Reilly &lt;ref name="BurtonDiane"&gt;Burton, Diane O’Reilly, Charles. “Walking the Talk: The Impact of High Commitment Values and Practices on Technology Start-ups”, 14 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that the benefits seen from high commitment practices may not be due to the practices themselves, but may result from on overarching system architecture or organizational logic. Another possibility they suggested was that good managers themselves pick this form of managing practice &lt;ref name="BurtonDiane" /&gt; and therefore good managers may be a confounding variable. Thus it is possible that the relative success of these practices is in fact a result of reasons other than the practices themselves.

In the process of becoming a workplace with high commitment management practices, the transition &lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Walton, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zuZ3HEi4dXIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=difficulty+implementing+high+commitment+management+practices&amp;ots=vCvhLn2uKL&amp;sig=7ogbuhmp2Syqoofx-DxG17te-cM#v=onepage&amp;q=difficulty%20implementing%20high%20commitment%20management%20practices&amp;f=false “From Control to Commitment in the Workplace”], Chapter 10. September 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; can be difficult and in order to gain the full benefits of such practices full implementation is required.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Sue Purcell, John Kinnie, Nick. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9pzmzba&amp;s=229f7c2b19333a8c5ffdde32dceee06d1cdb9cf2 “Evolving High Commitment Management and Experience of the RAC Calling Centre”], ‘’[[Human Resource Management Journal]]’’, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; All companies must go through a transitioning stage from their previous form of management to high commitment management practices, however not all of the changes can be made at once. This transition can often be difficult for managers to find the right balance between enough and too much worker influence &lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; and change the management philosophy along with the practices.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b"&gt;Guest, David. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.1999.tb00200.x/asset/j.1748-8583.1999.tb00200.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9onltqr&amp;s=2c3caa172d412fdfb8492d663f574f38ff2bd31c “Human Resource Management – The Workers’ Verdict”], ‘’[[Human Resource Management Journal]]’’, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Full implementation of high commitment management practices is required in order to receive the full benefits of the system,&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley"&gt;Hutchinson, Sue Purcell, John Kinnie, Nick. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2000.tb00014.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9pzmzba&amp;s=229f7c2b19333a8c5ffdde32dceee06d1cdb9cf2 “Evolving High Commitment Management and Experience of the RAC Calling Centre”], ''[[Human Resource Management Journal]]'', January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore during the transition period firms may not experience positive changes right away, which may provide disincentives for continuing the transition. This may explain why very few firms in the US have comprehensive commitment practices.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

High-commitment management practices are currently considered a universal approach &lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_a"&gt;Kinnie, Nicholas et al. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1748-8583.2005.tb00293.x/asset/j.1748-8583.2005.tb00293.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9oopqht&amp;s=1ecc68cf20ac62f41211644da8d74baa49492042 “Satisfaction with HR Practices and Commitment to the Organisation: Why one size does not fit all”], ''[[Human Resource Management Journal]]''. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; seen to be effective in all firms, however the best form of management for a firm with a price-sensitive, high-volume commodity market will differ from a firm with a high-quality, low-volume market.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley" /&gt; This has been seen within the private and public sectors, where only some high-commitment management practices in the private sector have the same benefits in the public sector and the entire program cannot be transported.&lt;ref&gt;Gould-Williams, Julian. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.0033-3298.2004.00383.x/asset/j.0033-3298.2004.00383.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9ookh58&amp;s=3a667459d7c3ef22f27834e079cc4538fd9e470f “The Effects of ‘High Commitment’ HRM Practices on Employee Attitude: The Views of Public  Sector Workers”], ‘’[[Public Administration]]’’, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Managers may also face difficulty when implementing high commitment management practices as they face a tension between a consistent approach using the same practices throughout the entire workforce or adjusting their practices based on specific needs of different groups.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_a" /&gt; As workforces become more diverse, this tension may become more pronounced.

While it has been proven that workers feel positively towards high commitment management practices, it is also admitted that these practices portray workers as a resource or commodity that will be exploited by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, David Shields, John. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/1472-9296.00052/asset/1472-9296.00052.pdf?v=1&amp;t=h9oo3t4y&amp;s=f9138b30fb74c34e15f4600805a88b424433ea8d “In Search of the Subject: Researching Employee Reactions to Human Resource Management”], ‘’[[The Journal of Industrial Relations]]’’, September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even though positive effects have been shown, these practices are also seen as another management initiative to try to gain greater control and efficiency from employees.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b" /&gt; Therefore, these practices are still exploiting the worker. Workers do express excessive pressure &lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley_b" /&gt; and high insecurity &lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Jim Oliver, Nick [http://wes.sagepub.com/content/5/3/437 “The High Commitment Workplace: Two Cases from a High-Tech Industry”], ‘’[[Work, Employment and Society]]’’, September 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; when high commitment management practices are implemented. However, even though companies may have high commitment practices, which in itself mean companies will have little employee flexibility, if the nature of the company is such that they embrace change, then it is possible for these to coexist.

Therefore, while there are many benefits proven to exist as a result of high commitment management practices, there are also disadvantages and difficulties incurred by management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">'''Ignition Park''' is a [[technology park]] under development in [[South Bend]], [[Indiana]], United States.

It represents the municipal government's response to a decision in 2008 by the [[Semiconductor Research Corporation|Semiconductor Research Corporation's]] Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI) to locate the fourth of its national research centers, known as the [http://mind.nd.edu/ Midwest Institute for Nanoelectronics Discovery (MIND)], at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalltimes.com/articles/article_display.cfm?Section=ARCHI&amp;C=Profi&amp;ARTICLE_ID=349403&amp;p=109 “South Bend’s legacy of innovation sparks Ignition Park,” Small Times, January 6, 2009. retrieved 2009-06-12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition Park is one of the two locations that make up Indiana's first two-site State-Certified Technology Park in South Bend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/37115949.html Nanotech site name announced,” WSBT, January 5, 2009. Retrieved 2009-06-12.]&lt;/ref&gt; The other is Innovation Park at Notre Dame, located on {{convert|12|acre|m2}} on the city's northeast side adjacent to the Notre Dame campus. Innovation Park at Notre Dame facilitates commercialization of many forms of research, by convening innovators throughout the entire Notre Dame community and beyond.&lt;ref name="bizvoicemagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.bizvoicemagazine.com/archives/09marapr/CommunityFocus.pdf Gwaltney, Candace. “Inventive Growth – South Bend Developing a High-tech Future,” BizVoice, March/April 2009, pp. 56-58.  Retrieved on 2009-06-12.]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies formed at Innovation Park may choose to expand their operations at Ignition Park, and by doing so, they'll continue to receive support services and other benefits from being part of the same state-certified technology park.&lt;ref name="smalltimes.com"&gt;[http://www.smalltimes.com/articles/article_display.cfm?Section=ARCHI&amp;C=Profi&amp;ARTICLE_ID=349403&amp;p=109 "South Bend's legacy of innovation sparks Ignition Park," Small Times, Jan. 6, 2009. Retrieved on 2009-06-12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition Park sits on the grounds of the former [[Studebaker]] plant.&lt;ref name="bizvoicemagazine.com" /&gt; It will concentrate on high-potential technologies and ventures, as well as the commercialization of nanotechnology concepts inspired by MIND.&lt;ref name="smalltimes.com" /&gt;

The '''Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland''' (CPA Ireland) is a [[professional body]] for [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs) in Ireland. It is one of the main Irish [[accountancy]] bodies, with 5,000 members and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Numbers add up to top accountancy award|url=http://www.newrossstandard.ie/lifestyle/numbers-add-up-to-top-accountancy-award-2983850.html|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=[[New Ross Standard]]|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPA designation is the most commonly used designation worldwide for professional accountants. One million qualified accountants worldwide are CPAs. CPA Ireland was founded in 1926 and its members work in accountancy firms, the public sector, the financial services, and other private sector businesses.

The institute is a member of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies – Ireland]] (CCAB&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;I), a founding member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/organization-overview/history/founding-members Founding Members], IFAC&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the Fédération des Experts Comptables Européens (FEE), the representative organisation for the profession in Europe.

CPA Ireland has headquarters in Dublin and Belfast.

== History of CPA Ireland ==
The Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland was founded as the Irish Association of Accountants on 11 March 1926 and then went on to join with the Irish Society of Public Accountants, originally incorporated 29 January 1943. This amalgamation, in 1964, blended the two bodies to become the CPA Ireland we have today. 
The first CPA exams for election to membership were held in November 1926 and CPA Ireland today represents 5000 members and students.
[[File:Harcourt Street Headquarters.jpg|thumb|CPA Ireland Headquarters in Dublin.]]

In 1961 the Society of Public Accountants gained legal recognition and changed its name to The Irish Society of Certified Public Accountants Ltd; this was changed again in 1971 to The Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland.

The institute was invited to join the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies – Ireland in 1991.

CPA Ireland held merger discussions with the 20,000-member [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]] in 2001 and again in 2003, but on both occasions the respective Councils of each body decided not to proceed to a vote of members on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish institutes' merger called off|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1764442/irish-institutes-merger-called|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=Accountancy Age|date=4 February 2004|author=Gavin Hinks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Council of the institute ==
[[File:CPA Officer Group.jpg|thumb|CPA Ireland's newly elected officer group for 2016, from left to right: Nano Brennan, president, Cormac Mohan, vice president and Deirdre Kiely, vice president.]]
The council of the institute is made up of 16 elected members and up to three non-members, including the president and vice presidents of the institute. The council meets approximately eight times a year to set policy on areas like the regulation of members in the public interest, the growth and development of the institute and examination and training standards.

The office-holders for 2016/2017 are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaireland.ie/media-publications/institute-news/2014/05/06/cpa-ireland-elects-new-officer-group Office-holders for 2013/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nano Brennan (president)
* Deirdre Kiely (vice president)
* Cormac Mohan (vice president)

== Qualification ==
Students do not need a business or accountancy-related degree to become an accountant; CPA students include school-leavers, mature students and graduates. Previous qualifications may entitle students to exemptions.

Students can study at 16 approved educators around Ireland. There is no registration fee required and students can avail themselves of full-time, part-time, distance, weekend and e-learning options.

There are four stages of examinations with the CPA Institute; Formation 1 and 2 and Professional 1 and 2.
Students must complete three years of training to apply for membership of the CPA. Training can take place in practice, industry or both. Students may first study for the CPA exams and obtain the required training at a later date.

=== Practice ===
CPA Members who wish to engage in public practice must hold a practising certificate, which requires completion of a Practice Orientation Course and examination, and two years' experience in their intended practice area after admission to membership.

=== Audit ===
To be eligible to act as an [[financial audit|auditor]], CPA members must hold an audit certificate, requiring a practising certificate and an audit qualification. To obtain this, members must have three years' experience supervised by a registered auditor.

== Role ==

As the institute is a recognised body, it has a statutory obligation to oversee the professional activities of its members in practice, ensuring that education and training standards are maintained.

"The role of the institute is to:
* regulate CPAs in accordance with the law and the institute's code of ethics in the public interest,
* ensure that CPAs are constantly up to date in all matters relating to their professional work,
* maintain the highest levels of educational standards for new entrants to the profession, and 
* represent the interests of our members where appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaireland.ie/displaycontent.aspx?nodeid=81&amp;groupID=81&amp;parentID=0 Institute home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mutual recognition ==

'''J. Amado Araneta ''' was a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] businessman. He was initially involved in [[sugar plantations]], but invested in commercial real estate following the [[Second World War]]. He is best known for the development of the [[Araneta Center]] in [[Quezon City]] and for his influence in the Philippines both before and after the [[Second World War]]. 

==Career==
With his business initially involvement in sugar plantations, Araneta changed Filipino cultural awareness in the 1930s, when he purchased two American television stations and begun broadcasting local content for the first time.&lt;ref name="plant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daniel|first1=E. Valentine|last2=Bernstein|first2=Henry|last3=Brass|first3=Tom|title=Plantations, Proletarians, and Peasants in Colonial Asia|date=1992|publisher=F. Cass|location=London|isbn=978-0-71463-467-8|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3LJkFPyFH0C&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodell|first1=Paul A.|title=Culture and Customs of the Philippines|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-31336-117-3|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Second World War]], and the independence of the Philippines, Araneta began to diversify his holdings. He purchased three [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s on the island of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]] and began to heavily invest in commercial real estate.&lt;ref name="plant"/&gt; He was influential in the Philippine government, acting as an informal adviser to President [[Manuel Roxas]]. He encouraged Roxas to fund the construction of the Negros mills and restore them to the same order they were in prior to the war, and in the two year leadership prior to Roxas' death, the president favoured the sugar barons such as Araneta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Rachel A.G.|title=Mar Roxas, his mother, his President ancestor and the Negros sugar industry|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/mar-roxas-his-mother-his-president-ancestor-and-the-negros-sugar-industry/245189/|accessdate=29 November 2016|work=The Manila Times|date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Araneta was acting as the main funding source for Roxas' [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="shining"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Navarro|first1=Nelson J.|title=Cubao’s brief shining moment|url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2013/01/13/896142/cubaos-brief-shining-moment|accessdate=29 November 2016|work=The Philippine Star|date=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Araneta's most well known projects is the development of the area known as the [[Araneta Center]] in [[Quezon City]], east of Manila, with the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum|Araneta Coliseum]] at its heart. He purchased the land in 1952, which at the time contained a series of radio towers, with the idea that there would be a series of landmark buildings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The story of the Araneta Center|url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/2014/12/29/1407300/story-araneta-center|accessdate=29 November 2016|work=The Philippine Star|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had identified the area as being at the crossroads of [[Cubao]], where city people would pass daily but was underdeveloped. He began the construction of the Coliseum in 1957, with it completed in 1959 as the largest indoor stadium in the world.&lt;ref name="deep"&gt;{{cite news|title=Success runs deep: The story of the Philippines’ Araneta Family|url=http://primer.com.ph/business/2016/10/06/success-runs-deep-the-story-of-the-philippines-araneta-family/|accessdate=29 November 2016|work=Philippine Primer|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cubao"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Villanueva|first1=Virgil S.|last2=Pingol II|first2=Agbayani P.|title=Cubao: A culture of transience|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=OnlineExclusive&amp;title=cubao-a-culture-of-transience&amp;id=111183|accessdate=29 November 2016|work=Business World|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 16 March 1960, hosting the boxing card featuring the main event bout between [[Gabriel Elorde]] and [[Harold Gomes]].&lt;ref name="cubao"/&gt;

==Exile==

Following the 1973 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] and the paramilitary style rule of the new government under [[Ferdinand Marcos]],&lt;ref name="shining"/&gt; Araneta took himself and his family out of the country. He resided in [[New York City]] until his death.&lt;ref name="rogue"/&gt; While they were out of the country, the businesses in the Philippines were controlled remotely, but were on the decline under the new regime.&lt;ref name="shining"/&gt;

==Death==
Araneta died in November 1985. His family took his body back to Manila, where it was buried some three months prior to the fall of the authority which had led to his political exile.&lt;ref name="rogue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ang|first1=Raymond|title=MARGARITA FORÉS: HER LOST YEARS AND UNLIKELY ASCENT TO ASIA’S BEST FEMALE CHEF|url=http://rogue.ph/margarita-fores-her-lost-years-and-unlikely-ascent-to-asias-best-female-chef/|newspaper=Rogue|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
He had three Children: Judy Araneta-Roxas, [[Jorge L. Araneta]], and Maria Lourdes "Baby" Araneta-Fores.  His son Jorge succeeded him as the head of the [[Araneta Group|Araneta group of companies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#31: Jorge Araneta|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jorge-araneta/|accessdate=29 November 2016|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JCDecaux Group''' ('''JCDecaux SA''', {{IPA-fr|ʒisedəˈko}}) is a [[multinational corporation]] based in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], near Paris, France,&lt;ref name="mainoffice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/layout/set/print/content/view/full/114|title=Legal disclaimer|website=JCDecaux|accessdate=2014-05-04|quote=…&amp;nbsp;whose registered office is located at 17 rue Soyer, 92523 Neuilly-sur-Seine, Paris, France.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316183931/http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/layout/set/print/content/view/full/114|archivedate=2014-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for its bus-stop advertising systems, [[billboard]]s, [[Bicycle sharing system|public bicycle rental systems]], and street furniture. It is the largest outdoor advertising corporation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/Newsroom/Archives/2011/JCDecaux-number-one-outdoor-advertising-company-in-the-world |title=JCDecaux: number one outdoor advertising company in the world |publisher=JCDecaux |date=February 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426190737/http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/Newsroom/Archives/2011/JCDecaux-number-one-outdoor-advertising-company-in-the-world |archivedate=April 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.network2media.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4299%3Ainternational-jcdecaux-becomes-largest-outdoor-advertising-company-in-the-world&amp;Itemid=3 |title=International: JCDecaux becomes largest outdoor advertising company in the world |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2014-05-04 |website=network2media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 1964 in [[Lyon]], France by Jean-Claude Decaux. Over the years it has expanded aggressively, partly through acquisitions of smaller advertising companies in several countries. Its headquarters is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine,&lt;ref name="mainoffice" /&gt; a suburb of [[Paris]], France. JCDecaux currently employs more than 13,030 people worldwide and maintains a presence in over 75 countries. In France alone, JCDecaux employs more than 3,500 people.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== History ==

[[Jean-Claude Decaux]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/profile/jean-claude-decaux/&lt;/ref&gt; (b. in 1937) first created a company in 1955 that specialised in [[Out-of-home advertising|Outdoor advertising]] alongside motorways. However, as these billboards were heavily taxed by law, Jean-Claude Decaux turned towards a business model in 1964 which was based on city billboards and invented the concept of advertising street furniture - well-maintained bus shelters fully funded by advertisers.

Since the first concept of the bus shelter in 1964, JCDecaux has continued to innovate and offer different types of street furniture. During the 70s, JCDecaux launched its first Citylight Information Panels (CIPs), a 2m² billboard with signage to indicate directions in cities to drivers. The first fully accessible automatic amenities were installed in San Francisco in 1994, although, in 1981, JCDecaux established a system of automatic public amenities in France. In 1981, JCDecaux also developed the ''News Electronic Journal'', which broadcast news relating to culture, sport, associations and information about the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

JCDecaux then bought the ''Société Fermière des Colonnes Morris''. The Senior billboards, which measure 8m² and allow multiple ads on a single site, were created in the 1980s. The first scrolling billboards appeared in 1988, which increased the number of advertising panels without raising the number of structures.

In 1999, the group acquired Havas Media Communication and Avenir.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/47997/&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition allowed the Group to expand into the large format advertising market and into advertising in airports. In 2001, JCDecaux entered the Euronext Stock Exchange&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2001-09-19/news-in-brief-jc-decaux-enters-euronext-index?ea9c8a2de0ee111045601ab04d673622&lt;/ref&gt; with an opening share price of €16,50. In 2002, Jean-Claude Decaux passed the management of the company on to two of his three sons, Jean-Charles Decaux and [[Jean-François Decaux]], who then became co-[[CEO]]s of the company.

JCDecaux installed its first rental system of self-service bicycles in Vienna in 2003 and then in Lyon in 2005. In 2007, JCDecaux won a tender for Paris’ street furniture and bicycle rental system. Today,{{when|date=March 2017}} JCDecaux is ranked the number one company worldwide in self-service bicycles, with a fleet of 52,000 bicycles now present in 70 cities. JCDecaux operates this service under the brand ''Cyclocity''.

In 2011, JCDecaux acquired ''MediaKiosk'' (a company which own kiosks in France) as the main shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/idUS178677+24-Oct-2011+BW20111024{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the open data movement, JCDecaux made available its data system of the rental bike service in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/home&lt;/ref&gt; The company is also recognized for its commitment to sustainable development and holds an [[ISO 14001]] certification.

== Activities ==

The JCDecaux Group specialises in advertising street furniture, large format billboards, advertising on public transport, and self-service bicycle rental systems.

=== Street furniture ===

Advertising street furniture was a concept invented by Jean-Claude Decaux.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Street furniture includes bus shelters, [[Advertising column|Morris Columns]], City Information Panels (CIP/MUPIs) and kiosks. Such formats enable advertisers to reach city centres, where large format billboards are not available. Cities can retain a portion of the advertising panels for their own use.

In some countries, JCDecaux holds a contract in shopping malls.

In order to adapt street furniture to the environment, JCDecaux works with internationally renowned designers, such as: [[Mario Bellini]], [[Philip Cox]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Norman Foster]], [[Patrick Jouin]], [[Philippe Starck]], [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]], [[Martin Szekely]] and [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte]]. JCDecaux also has a Design Office, which works to improve and modernise furniture.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Street furniture also includes a range of non-advertising sites, such as self-service toilets, electronic newspapers and interactive kiosks next to public benches, bins, columns, road signs, glass batteries and paper containers.

=== Transport advertising ===

The term transport includes [[Outdoor advertising]] in airports, on the underground, on buses, trams, and on taxis. JCDecaux operates concessions in 150 airports and over 300 subways, trains, trolleys and bus stations.
In 2013, advertising in Transport accounted for 37.9% of JCDecaux's revenue.&lt;ref name="jcdecaux.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/The-JCDecaux-group/Annual-Report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004031930/http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/The-JCDecaux-group/Annual-Report |archivedate=2016-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Billboard advertising ===

Billboard advertising includes advertising billboards of more than 8m². These formats can be adapted for many different purposes, such as for event artworks (for example: building wraps), which is operated by JCDecaux under the brand ''Artvertising''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Individuals are offered the opportunity to lease part of their property (i.e. wall or garden) to JCDecaux as a billboard site.

==Bicycle rental systems==
[[File:Vélib Sèvres-Lecourbe.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Vélib' bicycle hire station at [[Sèvres – Lecourbe (Paris Métro)]].]]
[[File:Fiat Doblo JC Decaux Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|upright|JCDecaux van in France.]]
The [[Bicycle sharing system|public bicycle rental systems]] are each financed by local advertising operators, in most cases in return for the cities signing over a 10-year licence to exploit citywide billboards. The overall scheme is called ''Cyclocity'' by the company, but each city's system is branded under an individual name.

The cities that have implemented its bicycle rental systems are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.cyclocity.com/Cities/Cyclocity-in-the-world/Cyclocity-cities |title=Cyclocity cities |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2014-05-04| website=Cyclocity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Michel Goudard''' is a French [[Public relations]] [[consultant]], who is the current [[Presudent]] and [[Chairman]] of the board of [[BBDO]] Paris. 

Goudard was born in [[Montpellier]], [[France]] on 13 November 1939. He graduated from [[HEC Business School]] in 1962, became a Navy Officer in 1964, and brand manager at [[Procter and Gamble]] in 1965, managing director of [[Young and Rubicam]]&lt;ref name="CoignardGuichard2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coignard|first1=Sophie|last2=Guichard|first2=Marie-Thérèse|title=French connections: networks of influence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVyohk7knogC&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=16 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-1-892941-02-2|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France in 1970, he created with Bernard Roux, Jacques Seguela and Alain Cayzac the advertising agency [[RSCG]] (Roux Seguele Cayzac Goudard) which grew into an international network agency. Goudard is also a hobbyist bullfighter.
&lt;ref name=Campaignlive&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Emma|title=CLOSE-UP: NEWSMAKER/JEAN-MICHEL GOUDARD; Bon viveur poised to prove his worth in America|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/close-up-newsmaker-jean-michel-goudard-bon-viveur-poised-prove-worth-america/20822|work=Campaignlive|accessdate=July 21, 2018|date=1995-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Bernard Brochand, he made the winning campaign of [[Jacques Chirac]] and his gaullist party RPR "Oui à la France qui gagne" in 1978. He did it again in 1986 with the campaign "Vivement Demain". The same year, he published his book "Je vous salue fiascos" (Jean-Claude Lattes) about his own fiascos in advertising. In 1988, Jacques Chirac, then Prime Minister, asked him to manage his presidential campaign against [[François Mitterrand]]. In 1991, he became the president of Euro-RSCG International, covering the whole worldwide network outside France. In 1995, he managed again the presidential campaign of Jacques Chirac ("La France pour tous"), and, immediately after the election of Jacques Chirac as President of France, he left Euro-RSCG and France to live in [[New York City]], for 10 years, as president of BBDO International. He retired in April 2006 to run the presidential campaign of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], and became so close with the President that he even attended the G7 summit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Michel Goudard, the strategist.|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/15/04/2009/LesEchos/20405-050-ECH_jean-michel-goudard--le-stratege-.htm|accessdate=July 21, 2018|date=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Immediately after Sarkozy's election, in 2007, he retired in [[Switzerland]] in [[Rolle]] (canton of [[Vaud]]). In 2008, President Sarkozy asked him to become his Chief Strategy Officer. Goudard accepted. He came back to France to work at the [[Elysée Palace]].

'''John Anthony Quelch''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 8 August 1951) was appointed in 2017 as Vice Provost for Executive Education and Dean of the School of Business Administration at the [[University of Miami]]. He is also the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration Emeritus at [[Harvard Business School]] and Dean Emeritus at the [[China Europe International Business School]], [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name=Whoswho&gt;'QUELCH, Prof. John Anthony', Who's Who 2014, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2013 ; online edn, Dec 2013 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U31684 accessed 3 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==

Quelch was born in London, son of an RAF officer and a nurse .&lt;ref name=Times98&gt;Dearlove, Desmond. "Coming home: the man from Harvard." Times [London, England] 26 January 1998: 3. InfoTrac Custom Newspapers. Web. 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He began his education at a one-room schoolhouse in the [[Isle of Man]], attended primary school in Australia, then returned to England, settling in [[Norwich]] and enrolling in [[Town Close School]]&lt;ref name=Times98/&gt; and later [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]].&lt;ref name=Whoswho/&gt; Quelch received his BA and MA from [[Exeter College, Oxford University]], where he was an Open Scholar in Modern History.  At Oxford, he edited the student newspaper ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''.&lt;ref name=Times98/&gt; As a [[Thouron Award|Thouron Scholar]], he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He then took an SM from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and a [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] from [[Harvard Business School]].

Quelch's first academic post was as a visiting instructor at the [[University of Hawaii]].  He was next appointed assistant professor at the [[School of Business Administration]] (now the Ivey School) of the [[University of Western Ontario]].  In 1979, he returned to [[Harvard Business School]] as an assistant professor.  He became a tenured professor in 1988 and was appointed the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing and Co-Chair of the Marketing department in 1994.

In 1998, he was appointed Dean (with Vice-Chancellor status) of [[London Business School]]. During his tenure, revenues and student enrollments increased 50% over three years,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2001-01-07/london-business-schools-dean-goes-home "London Business School's Dean Goes Home,"] 7 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and faculty numbers increased 30%.  A network of twenty-five alumni clubs and six international advisory boards was established, corporate sponsorships doubled, and the yield on MBA admissions rose from 57% to 73%.  In 2001, London Business School received the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] and was ranked number eight business school in the world by the ''Financial Times.''&lt;ref&gt;http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/charts&lt;/ref&gt;

Quelch returned to Harvard in 2001 as Lincoln Filene Professor of Business Administration and Senior Associate Dean for International Development overseeing the establishment of a global network of research centers.&lt;ref&gt;"A Global Perspective," ''HBS Global Ventures'', Winter 2002, pp.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2006 and 2008, he served as Senior Associate Dean responsible for coordinating the planning and execution of Harvard Business School's 2008 Centennial celebrations. He also served as a director of the Harvard Business School Publishing Company.

In 2009, Quelch was on sabbatical leave in Shanghai as the La Caixa Visiting Professor of International Management and Chairman of the Academic Advisory Council at the [[China Europe International Business School]] (CEIBS).  Between 2011 and 2013, Professor Quelch served as Dean, Vice-President and Distinguished Professor of International Management at the [[CEIBS]].&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching Case Studies in China," ''Economist'', 20 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   During his tenure, CEIBS' MBA global ranking in the ''Financial Times'' improved from 24 to 15 and the Executive MBA from 18 to 7.  The number of full-time faculty and CEIBS revenues both increased by one-third.  Special emphasis was placed on upgrading CEIBS research output, executive education, global awareness and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Browne, "China Eyed as Next Educational Frontier," ''Wall Street Journal'', 30 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quelch returned to Harvard in 2013 as the first Harvard Business School professor to hold a joint primary appointment at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] as professor of Health Policy and Management.  Between 2013 and 2017, he also served as an associate in research at [[Harvard's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies]], fellow of the Harvard China Fund, and member of the Harvard China Advisory Board.

==Research and publications==
Quelch's early research focused on the application of marketing to preventive healthcare programs.This resulted in the article "Marketing Principles and the Future of Preventive Health Care" (''Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly/Health and Society'', 1980) and other papers in the ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'' and ''Nutrition Reviews''.

Next, Quelch focused on how to improve the design and productivity of temporary price promotions.  This work coalesced in the book, ''Sales Promotion Management, (''Prentice-Hall'','' 1989).

By the late 1980s, Quelch had already turned his attention to the marketing implications of globalization.  His research on global marketing was profiled by Mazur and Miles in ''Conversations With Marketing Masters'' (John Wiley, 2007). His books in this domain include:

* ''The Global Market'' (Jossey Bass, 2005) and
* ''The New Global Brands:  Managing Non-Governmental Organizations in the 21st Century'' (Thomson, 2006)
* ''Business Solutions For The Global Poor'' (Jossey Bass, 2007)
* ''Greater Good:  How Good Marketing Makes For Better Democracy'' (Harvard Business Press, 2008)
* ''All Business Is Local'' (Penguin/Portfolio, 2012)
* ''Global Marketing Management'' (6th edition, BVT Publishing, 2017).

Since 2013, Quelch has focused his attention on patient centricity and consumer empowerment in the healthcare sector. ''Consumers, Corporations and Public Health,''   ([https://global.oup.com/academic/product/consumers-corporations-and-public-health-9780190235123?facet_narrowbytype_facet=Books%20for%20Courses&amp;lang=3n&amp;cc=us Oxford University Press], 2016) was followed by ''Building A Culture of Health:  A New Imperative for Business'' (Springer, 2016).

Quelch's practitioner focused articles embrace eighteen contributions in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.
His articles include:  "Bringing Customers Into The Boardroom" (''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', November 2004), "How Global Brands Compete" (''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', September 2004),  "Building And Valuing Global Brands in the Nonprofit Sector", (''Nonprofit Management and Leadership'',  2007), "Governance in the Public Sector", (''Directors &amp; Boards'',  2008), "An Exploration of Marketing's Impacts on Society: A Perspective Linked to Democracy" (''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing'', 2008), "How To Market In A Downturn" (''Harvard Business Review'', April 2009). "Can Corporate Social Responsibility Survive The Recession?" (''Leader to Leader'', 2009) and "Government Adoption of Sales Promotions:  An Initial Appraisal" (''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 2010).

Professor Quelch is known for his teaching materials and innovations in pedagogy.  His case studies have sold over 4 million copies, third highest in HBS history.  In 1995, he developed the first HBS interactive CD-ROM exercise (on Intel's advertising budgeting process). In 1999, he developed and presented a series of twelve one-hour programs on Marketing Management for the Public Broadcasting System.  His ''Marketing Know:How'' blog, accessible at [https://archive.is/20130201020332/http://www.quelchblog.com/] and published by Harvard Business School Publishing, has been translated into Chinese and Vietnamese.

==Other activities==
In 2002, Acting Governor [[Jane Swift]] of [[Massachusetts]] appointed Quelch to be chairman of the board of the [[Massachusetts Port Authority]], overseeing three airports, waterfront real estate and the seaport of Boston.  In this ''[[pro bono]]'' role, he chaired the security and safety committee and, later, the strategy and services committee of the Massport board.  He submitted his resignation to Governor Deval Patrick in January 2011 after 8 1/2 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Thompson, "Massport Back on Course," ''HBS Bulletin'', 1 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an additional ''pro bono'' role, Quelch has served from 2003 as Honorary Consul General of the [[Kingdom of Morocco]] for the [[New England]] region.  His long-standing ties to the Middle East resulted in the book, ''Business Strategies For Muslim Countries'' (Prentice Hall, 2000).

Quelch has governance experience as a non-executive director of public companies in the United States and the United Kingdom.  In 2013, he stepped down as a non-executive director of [[WPP plc|WPP]] plc, the world's largest marketing and media services company, after 25 years of service.

'''Jorge Hank Rhon''' (born January 28, 1956) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[businessman]] and owner of Mexico's largest [[sports betting]] company, ''Grupo Caliente''. He served from December 2004 to February 2007 as the [[presidente municipal|president]] of the [[municipio (Mexico)|municipality]] of [[Tijuana (municipality)|Tijuana]]. He is the son of former [[Head of Government of the Federal District|Mexico City mayor]] [[Carlos Hank González]] and Guadalupe Rhon. Hank is the father of professional [[tennis]] player [[Tigre Hank]] and of Matador [[Alejandro Amaya]].

==Biography==
Of German descent,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/family/bergman.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Hank Rhon studied at the [[Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt (Mexico City)|Alexander von Humboldt German College]] and [[Industrial Engineering]] at the [[Universidad Anáhuac]] in the [[State of Mexico]]. In 1980 he founded the [[Grupo Taos]], a company that operates pet stores and amusement parks of which he is the President of the Board and General Director. He moved to Tijuana in 1985 to manage the [[Agua Caliente Racetrack]] and formed the [[Grupo Caliente]] which includes the [[dog racing]] track, a hotel, a mall and a network of entertainment centers in 19 [[states of Mexico]] as well as 13 countries of [[Central America|Central]], [[South America]] and [[Europe]]. The number of employees of the racetrack grew from 700 to close to 6,000. During his management Tijuana has hosted the [[Señorita México]] pageant, the World Boxing title fight between [[Julio César Chávez]] and [[Danilo Cabrera]] and from 1986 to 1988 the Caribe International Classic Horserace, considered the most important in [[Latin America]]. The Racetrack also hosts the Day of the Three Wise Men, Children's Day, Mother's Day where thousands of children and their mothers receive free food, gifts and an entertainment show since 1988. Hank also created the [[Cuauhtémoc Hank Foundation]] to give scholarships to students of all grades including studies in foreign schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jorgehank.com.mx/indexMain.php Official Campaign site]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1988 a local newspaper columnist, Hector "El Gato" Felix Miranda was assassinated on his way to work. The gunmen turned out to be security guards at the Caliente track, and one had worked as well for Hank Rhon's father, Carlos Hank. To this day the independent newsweekly in Tijuana, ZETA, runs a full page ad with white letters: "Jorge Hank: Why did your bodyguards assassinate me?" 'El Gato' had been a fierce critic of the Hank family.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/family/bergman.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for municipal president==
Hank won the [[Tijuana]] mayoral race of 2004, beating [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] candidate [[Jorge Ramos (politician)|Jorge Ramos]] by a slim margin, thus ending 15 years of PAN government in Tijuana. 

==Mayor of Tijuana==
The most notable infrastructure improvement in Tijuana during the Hank administration was the multi-million investment on an underpass at the ''Alba Roja'' intersection, just south of the ''5 y 10'' intersection. The ''5 y 10'' intersection is one of the most famous in the city and with the heaviest traffic.

==Run for governor of Baja California==
At the end of 2006, Jorge Hank expressed his wishes to run a campaign for the [[Baja California state election, 2007|2007 Baja California state election]].
This flared up comments from PAN politicians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacronica.com/edicionenlinea/notas/Nacional/23122006/213400.aspx PAN confident that the ''Anti-grasshopper law'' will be reversed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070052/http://www.lacronica.com/edicionenlinea/notas/Nacional/23122006/213400.aspx |date=2007-09-27 }}, La Crónica December 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that he would be violating the state's ''Antichapulin'' ("anti-[[grasshopper]]") law which prohibits a person of public office to "jump" from one charge to another without ending their current term.

In February 2007 he requested permission from leaving his post as municipal president to accept the candidacy for governor by the ''Alianza para que vivas mejor'' ([[The Alliance So You May live better]]), which was approved by his party's [[regidor]]es and denied by the PAN [[regidor]]es. The PAN also accused five district electoral council members of partiality towards Hank because they served as judges during his administration as president of Tijuana. The Federal Electoral Tribune rejected the complaint determining that the law does not have such restriction that would prevent these five lawyers from serving as judges and then as council members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/423027.html Desecha tribunal queja de PAN sobre Hank Rohn], El Universal, May 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2007, Baja California's state elections court voted 2 to 1 in favor of the validity of the so-called "anti grasshopper law" thus cancelling Hank's bid for Governor. He appealed the decision before the [[Federal Electoral Tribunal]], which unanimously ruled to uphold his candidacy on July 7, holding that the state law contravened the electoral and political rights of the citizenry. Pending that decision, Hank was not a registered candidate and had to abstain from campaigning. The election date was Sunday August 5, 2007.

According to the Baja California's State Electoral Institute, Jorge Hank lost the election by 8 points (almost 55,000 votes) against Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan, PAN's candidate.

The '''Middle German Chemical Triangle''' ({{lang-de|Mitteldeutsches Chemiedreieck}} or locally just ''Chemiedreieck'') is the industrial conurbation around the cities and towns of [[Halle (Saale)]], [[Merseburg]] and [[Bitterfeld]] in the North German state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Leipzig]] and [[Schkeuditz]] in the [[Saxony|Free State of Saxony]]. Its name is derived from the dominant [[industries]] of the region – the [[chemical industry|chemical]] and [[oil refinery|oil refining]] industries.

It is often referred to as the [[Leuna]]-Buna-[[Bitterfeld]] Chemical Triangle (''Chemiedreieck Leuna-Buna-Bitterfeld'') because these places are the oldest and most important in the region. Buna is not a town, but was the name of the first [[synthetic rubber]] ([[1,3-Butadiene|butadiene]] and [[Sodium|natrium]]) which was produced in the Buna factory at [[Schkopau]]. Today [[Dow Chemical]] produces synthetic rubber in Schkopau which is marketed under the name of BUNA SB.
[[File:Vockerode Plaste und Elaste Leuchtreklame DDR.png|thumb|left|''Plaste und Elaste'' neon sign, 1984]]
At the end of the 1950s the advertising slogan ''Plaste und Elaste aus Schkopau'' ("[[Plastic]] and [[Elastomer]] from Schkopau") was introduced, in order to promote the spectrum of products of the Buna Chemical Works. The slogan was used especially on posters and neon lights. The best known light advert was on a tower on the northern abutment of the Elbe bridge at [[Vockerode]] on the transit route from Berlin to Hof (nowadays part of the [[Bundesautobahn 9|BAB 9]] motorway).

Monde Selection states that "This bronze, silver, gold or grand gold quality label can be compared to the quality stars of a hotel or those of the [[Michelin Guide]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-selection.com/en/1.0_Activities_and_Awards/1.1_Our_Mission/1.1_Our_Mission.asp |title=Monde Selection : Our Mission |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst both processes are anonymous, Michelin chooses the hotels and restaurants it reviews and pays for everything. Only products who pay the Euro 1,100 entry fee are reviewed by Monde Selection. Unlike [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals]], where only one of each is awarded per event, there are no limits to how many can be awarded in each category.

== Entry fee ==
For the 2014 selection, the entry fee is 1,150 Euro per product (100 Euro discount for third product onwards in the same category), and samples have to be shipped DDP (Delivered Duty Paid).&lt;ref&gt;Monde Selection - Participation documents 2013 - AL - UK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
All products with a minimum score of 60% receive an award: Bronze for an average between 60% and 69%, Silver for 70%-79%, Gold for 80-89%, Grand Gold for 90-100%. In addition, there are trophies for consecutive years of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;N. du Parc Locmaria (2011), ''Monde Selection: Fifty years in the service of quality products'', Seraphine Graphics&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 2595 of the 2952 participating products (87.9%) received an award.

80% of the products entered by Japanese companies received an award.&lt;ref&gt;Nikkei MJ 2008 November 14th issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Neo-classical contract''' is a form of contract, defined by McNeil, describing a [[contract]] dependent upon [[wikt:trilateral|trilateral]] governance, in which "[[wikt:third party|third party]] assistance" is used  for resolving disputes or evaluating performance.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “Contracts: adjustment of long-term economic relations under classical, neoclassical, and relational contract law” (1977) ''Northwestern University Law Review'' vol:72 pg:854 .&lt;/ref&gt; Such contracts form a distinct group, along with classical and relational contracts, in McNeil's system of classification.

'''''Office Space''''' is a 1999 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Mike Judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office Space|website=[[AllMovie]]|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/office-space-v176021}}&lt;/ref&gt; It satirizes the everyday work life of a typical mid-to-late-1990s [[software company]], focusing on a handful of individuals fed up with their jobs. It stars [[Ron Livingston]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Stephen Root]], [[David Herman]], [[Ajay Naidu]], and [[Diedrich Bader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/19/entertainment/ca-9435| title='Office' Puts Corporate Culture Through the Comedy Shredder| author=Kevin Thomas| date=February 19, 1999| publisher=Los Angeles Times| accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Office Space'' was shot in [[Dallas]] and [[Austin, Texas]]. It is based on Judge's ''[[Milton (cartoon)|Milton]]'' cartoon series and was his first foray into live-action filmmaking and his second full-length motion picture release, following ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]''.

The film's sympathetic depiction of ordinary [[Information technology|IT]] workers garnered a cult following within that field, but it also addresses themes familiar to [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] employees and the workforce in general. It was a box office disappointment, making $12.2 million against a $10 million production budget. It was well received by critics, sold well on home video, and has become a [[cult film]].&lt;ref name="Doty"&gt;{{cite news | last=Doty | first=Meriah |title=Film flops flourish on DVD, VHS | work=CNN | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/second.wind/index.html | date=March 4, 2003 | accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Peter Gibbons is a programmer at a company called Initech who is frustrated and unmotivated at his job. His co-workers include Samir Nagheenanajar and Michael Bolton, also programmers, and Milton Waddams, a meek collator who is mostly ignored by the rest of the office. The staff constantly suffer under callous management, especially Initech's smarmy vice president [[Bill Lumbergh]], whom Peter loathes. They are further agitated by the arrival of consultants Bob Slydell and Bob Porter, who are brought in to help the company [[layoff|downsize]].

Peter's girlfriend Anne persuades him to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session, but Dr. Swanson, the therapist, dies of a heart attack while hypnotizing Peter. Peter wakes up the next morning newly relaxed, and he ignores repeated phone calls from Lumbergh, who had been expecting him to work over the weekend. He also ignores calls from Anne, who responds by angrily breaking up with him and admitting that she has been cheating on him, confirming his friends' suspicions. The following workday, Peter decides to skip work and asks Joanna, a restaurant waitress, out for lunch. Joanna and Peter bond over their shared loathing of idiotic management and love of the television series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''.

When Peter finally shows up at work, he casually disregards office protocol, including violating Initech's dress code, taking Lumbergh's reserved parking spot, refusing to follow Lumbergh's directions, and removing a cubicle wall that blocks his view out the window. The consultants, however, are impressed by his frank insights into the office problems, and they decide to promote him. They also confide that Michael and Samir's jobs will be eliminated; Peter relays this news to them, and the trio decide to get even by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed to [[Salami slicing|divert fractions of pennies]] into a bank account. They believe that such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but will result in a substantial amount of money over time. On Michael and Samir's last day at Initech, the pair along with Peter steal a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three take to a field and smash to pieces to vent their frustration.

At a barbecue, Peter learns that Joanna had previously slept with a colleague identified as "Lumbergh". He assumes it to be his boss and confronts Joanna in disgust. She questions the morality of his financial scheme, and the two split up. Peter then discovers that a [[Software bug|bug]] in Michael's code has caused their virus to steal over $300,000 in only a few days, which is far more conspicuous. Meanwhile, Joanna has finally stood up to her boss and quit, and Peter has discovered that she slept with a different "Lumbergh." Peter admits to her that the scheme was a bad idea and that he plans to accept responsibility for the crime, and they reconcile. He writes out a confession and slips it under Lumbergh's office door late at night, along with [[traveler's cheque]]s for the stolen money.

Milton, meanwhile, has become increasingly disgruntled at his treatment by management, to the point that he has mumbled threats about setting the building on fire.  The next morning, he enters Lumbergh's office to reclaim a red [[Swingline]] stapler that was taken from him. Peter arrives at work fully expecting to be arrested, but he finds instead that his problem has solved itself. The Initech building is engulfed in flames, and all evidence of the missing money has been destroyed. Peter finally finds a job that he likes, doing construction work with his next-door neighbor Lawrence, while Samir and Michael both get jobs at a rival company to Initech. Milton lounges on the beach at a Mexican resort, complaining about his beverage and threatening to take his business to a competitor.

==Production==

===Development===
''Office Space'' was shot primarily in [[Austin, Texas]]. It originated in a series of four animated [[short film]]s that Judge created entitled ''[[Milton (cartoon)|Milton]]'' about an office drone named Milton. They first aired on ''[[Liquid Television]]'' and ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', and later aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="fierman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fierman | first = Daniel | coauthors = | title = Judge's Dread | work = Entertainment Weekly | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 26, 1999 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274497,00.html | accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration came from a temp job which he had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders&lt;ref name="beale"&gt;{{cite news | last = Beale | first = Lewis |authorlink=Lewis Beale| title = Mr. Beavis Goes to Work | work = [[New York Daily News]] | page = | publisher = | date = February 21, 1999 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/mr-beavis-work-irreverent-animator-s-newest-target-corporate-america-live-action-film-office-space-article-1.839280 | accessdate =2013-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another job as an engineer for three months in the Bay Area during the 1980s, "just in the heart of [[Silicon Valley]] and in the middle of that overachiever [[yuppie]] thing, it was just awful".&lt;ref name="sherman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sherman | first = Paul | coauthors = | title = Humorist is a good Judge of office angst | work = [[Boston Herald]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 21, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The setting of the film reflects a prevailing trend that Judge observed in the United States. "It seems like every city now has these identical office parks with identical adjoining chain restaurants", he said in an interview.&lt;ref name="fierman"/&gt; "There were a lot of people who wanted me to set this movie in [[Wall Street]], or like the movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', but I wanted it very unglamorous, the kind of bleak work situation like I was in".&lt;ref name="beale"/&gt;

Judge sold the film to [[20th Century Fox]] based on his script and a cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Ron Livingston, and [[David Herman]].&lt;ref name="fierman"/&gt; Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an [[ensemble cast]]–based film.&lt;ref name="sherman"/&gt; The studio suggested that he make a movie like ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' but "just set in an office".&lt;ref name="sherman"/&gt; 

Judge made the transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film's director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, "I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert".&lt;ref name="beale"/&gt; Studio executives were not happy with the footage that Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, "More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!"&lt;ref name="Valby"&gt;{{cite news | last = Valby | first = Karen | coauthors = | title = The Fax of Life | work = Entertainment Weekly | page = 41 | language = | publisher = | date = May 23, 2003 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,452194,00.html | accessdate = 2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fox did not like the [[gangsta rap]] music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and wished he could have completely rewritten the third act.&lt;ref name="Valby"/&gt;

===Film poster===
Judge hated the poster that the studio created for ''Office Space'', which depicted an office worker completely covered in [[Post-it notes]]. He said, "People were like, 'What is this? A big bird? A mummy? A beekeeper?' And the tagline 'Work Sucks'? It looked like an [[Office Depot]] ad. I just hated it. I hated the trailers, too and the TV ads especially".&lt;ref name="Valby"/&gt; Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman Tom Rothman conceded that the marketing campaign did not work and said, "''Office Space'' isn't like ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. It doesn't have the kind of jokes you put in a 15-second television spot of somebody getting hit on the head with a frying pan. It's sly. And let me tell you, sly is hard to sell".&lt;ref name="Valby"/&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
''Office Space'' was released on February 19, 1999 in 1,740 theatres, grossing USD$4,231,727 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $10,827,810 in North America.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Office Space|work=Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=officespace.htm|accessdate=2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this gross, $2 million was made internationally,&lt;ref name="thenum" /&gt; 6 million copies in DVD, [[Blu-ray Disc]] and VHS sales&lt;ref name="thenum" /&gt; since February 12, 2006.&lt;ref name="Numbers2"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Office-Space#tab=video-sales | title=Office Space - DVD sales | publisher=the-numbers.com | accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''Office Space'' received positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="Valby" /&gt; On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 79% rating based on 96 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Mike Judge lampoons the office grind with its inspired mix of sharp dialogue and witty one-liners."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|office_space|Office Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives a weighted average score of 68/100, based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|office-space|Office Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of "C+" on a scale ranging from A+ to F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cinemascore |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ | work = [[CinemaScore]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that Judge: {{cquote|Treats his characters a little like cartoon creatures. That works.

[[Owen Gleiberman]] in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "C" rating and criticized it for feeling "cramped and underimagined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Office Space|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 5, 1999|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274661,00.html|accessdate=2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Rick Groen wrote: {{cquote|Perhaps his TV background makes him unaccustomed to the demands of a feature-length script (the ending seems almost panicky in its abruptness), or maybe he just succumbs to the lure of the easy yuk...what began as discomfiting satire soon devolves into silly farce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Groen|first=Rick|title=Workplace satire almost does the job |work=Globe and Mail |date=February 19, 1999 |location=Toronto |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/movie/MOVIEREVIEWS/19990219/TASPAC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181107/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/movie/MOVIEREVIEWS/19990219/TASPAC |archivedate=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2008-09-18|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Stephen Holden wrote, "It has the loose-jointed feel of a bunch of sketches packed together into a narrative that doesn't gather much momentum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Film Review; One Big Happy Family?

In 2008, ''Entertainment Weekly'' named ''Office Space'' one of "The 100 best films from 1983 to 2008", ranking it at #73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Classics: Movies |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=June 16, 2008 |issue=999-1000 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207063,00.html |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===Cult status===
''Office Space'' has become a [[cult classic]], selling well on home video and DVD.&lt;ref name="Doty"/&gt; {{As of|2003}}, it had sold 2.6 million copies on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="Valby2"&gt;Valby 2003, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, it was in the top 20 best-selling Fox DVDs.&lt;ref name="Valby3"&gt;Valby 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, it had sold over six million DVDs in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Emily|title=13 Box Office Flops That Became Hugely Successful On DVD|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/13-box-office-flops-that-became-hugely-successful-on-dvd-1420911|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=[[NME]]|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked it fifth on its list "25 Great Comedies From the Past 25 Years", despite having originally given the film a poor review.&lt;ref name="ewtop25"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Comedy 25: The Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years | work=Entertainment Weekly | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20221235_21,00.html | date=August 27, 2008 | accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2009, a reunion of many of the cast members took place at the [[Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]] in Austin to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the film, which included the destruction of a printer on the sidewalk.&lt;ref name="ktbc"&gt;{{cite news | title="Office Space" Turns 10 | publisher=KTBC | date=February 8, 2009|url= http://www.myfoxaustin.com/dpp/news/020809_office_space_turns_10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211131334/http://www.myfoxaustin.com/dpp/news/020809_office_space_turns_10 |archivedate=2009-02-11  | accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], a scene from the film was spoofed in a [[political advertisement]], which was run by [[Ted Cruz]] mocking [[Hillary Clinton]] over her wiped personal email server. The advertisement spoofs the scene where the office workers destroy their malfunctioning printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krieg|first1=Gregory|title=Cruz mocks Clinton email controversy with 'Office Space' spoof ad|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/12/politics/ted-cruz-hillary-clinton-office-space-ad/|accessdate=27 March 2016|publisher=CNN|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Ted Cruz Ad Spoofs "Office Space" In Clinton Server Attack|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/02/12/new_ted_cruz_ad_spoofs_office_space_in_clinton_attack.html |accessdate=27 March 2016|publisher=RealClear Politics|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television ===
[[Comedy Central]] premiered ''Office Space'' on August 5, 2001 and 1.4 million viewers tuned in. By 2003, the channel had broadcast the film another 35 times.&lt;ref name="Valby3"/&gt; These broadcasts helped develop the film's cult following and Ron Livingston remembers being approached by college students and office workers. He said, "I get a lot of people who say, 'I quit my job because of you.' That's kind of a heavy load to carry."&lt;ref name="Valby3"/&gt; People approached Stephen Root asking him to sign their staplers. The red [[Swingline]] stapler featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of the film. Its appearance in the film was achieved by taking a standard Swingline stapler and spray-painting it red.&lt;ref name="Valby3"/&gt;

==Video game==
[[Kongregate]] released a mobile game based on the film, titled ''Office Space: Idle Profits'', on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in 2017. The game is a [[free-to-play]] [[Incremental game|idle clicker]] that offers [[in-app purchases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sowden|first1=Emily|title=Screw your bosses over in the clicker Office Space: Idle Profits, out now on iOS and Android|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Office+Space%3A+Idle+Profits/news.asp?c=73717|website=Pocket Gamer|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offshoring''' is the relocation of a [[business process]] from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, or supporting processes, such as accounting. Typically this refers to a [[company]] business, although state governments may also employ offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;"The Offshoring of American Government", Cornell Law Review, Nov. 2008, available: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1143044&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, offshoring has been associated primarily with the [[outsourcing]] of technical and administrative services supporting domestic and global operations from outside the home country ("[[offshore outsourcing]]"), by means of internal (captive) or external (outsourcing) delivery models.&lt;ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1287369 |title=SSRN-A Dynamic Perspective on Next-Generation Offshoring: The Global Sourcing of Science and Engineering Talent |authors=Stephan Manning, Silvia Massini, Arie Lewin |journal=[[Academy of Management Perspectives]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=35–54|publisher=[[Social Science Electronic Publishing]]|date=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=|doi=10.5465/amp.2008.34587994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is in use in several distinct but closely related ways.  It is sometimes used broadly to include substitution of a service from any foreign source for a service formerly produced internally to the firm.  In other cases, only imported services from subsidiaries or other closely related suppliers are included.  A further complication is that intermediate goods, such as partially completed computers, are not consistently included in the scope of the term.&lt;ref&gt;See "Appendix II: Definitions of Offshoring" in General Accounting Office: "International Trade: Current Government Data Provide Limited Insight into Offshoring of Services", September 2004.  Imported intermediate goods are included in offshoring in "Swenson, D: "International Outsourcing", in ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring. After its accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 2001, the [[People's Republic of China]] emerged as a prominent destination for production offshoring. Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.

The economic logic is to reduce costs, sometimes called [[labor arbitrage]], to improve corporate profitability. Jobs are added in the destination country providing the goods or services (generally a lower-cost labor country), but are subtracted in the higher-cost labor country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=Milosz|date=2016-06-22|title=Labour arbitrage: the lifecycle of a global production node|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|journal=Journal of Organizational Ethnography|volume=5|issue=2|pages=106–122|doi=10.1108/JOE-04-2016-0009|issn=2046-6749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring.

== Frequently used terms ==
Offshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same or another company in another, different country. Almost always work is moved because of a lower cost of operations in the new location. More recently, offshoring drivers also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and increasing speed to market.&lt;ref name="Papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; Offshoring is sometimes contrasted with [[outsourcing]] or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Outsourcing is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. Outsourcing refers to the process by which an organization gives part of its work to another firm / organization and makes it responsible for most of the applications as well as the design of the enterprise business process. This process is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns. However, subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring.

Related terms include [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting [[United States]]-based business processes to [[Canada]]/[[Latin America]]); inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the "best shore" based on various criteria. [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] &amp; [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced.
More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.

A further term sometimes associated with offshoring is [[bodyshopping]] which is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.

=== Production offshoring ===
Production offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes to a lower-cost destination. Examples of production offshoring include the manufacture of electronic components in [[Costa Rica]], production of apparel, toys, and consumer goods in China, [[Vietnam]] etc.

Product design, research and the development process that leads to new products, are relatively difficult to offshore. This is because research and development, in order to improve products and create new reference designs, require a skill set that is harder to obtain in regions with cheap labor. For this reason, in many cases only the manufacturing will be offshored by a company wishing to reduce costs.

However, there is a relationship between offshoring and patent-system strength. This is because companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.

A major incentive for [[physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]]. This trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, T: "China, Inc." Scribner, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; NAFTA has increased the velocity at which [[physical restructuring]] is occurring.

=== IT-enabled services offshoring ===
The growth of IT-enabled services offshoring is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s. This was seen all the way up to the year 2000. Coupled with the digitization of many services, it was possible to shift the actual production location of services to low-cost countries in a manner theoretically transparent to end-users. Services include administrative services, such as finance and accounting, HR, and legal; call centers; marketing and sales services; IT infrastructure; application development; and knowledge services, including engineering support, product design, research and development, and analytics.

India first benefited from the offshoring trend, as it has a large pool of [[English language|English]] speaking people and technically proficient manpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=cgirs Working Through Outsourcing: Software Practice, Industry Organization and Industry Evolution in India] Kyle Eischen. eScholarship Repository, 2006. Retrieved 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; India's offshoring industry took root in low-end IT functions in the early 1990s and has since moved to back-office processes such as call centers and transaction processing. This spawned the [[neologism]] ''Bangalored'', used to indicate a [[layoff]], often systemic, and usually resulting from corporate [[outsourcing]] to lower wage economies – derived from [[Bangalore]] in [[India]], where some of the first outsource centers were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-ban1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Bangalored|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, India's low-cost labor has made it an offshoring destination for global firms like [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Accenture]], [[Intel]], [[AMD]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Cisco]] and [[SAP AG|SAP]].

Because of inflation, high domestic interest rates, robust economic growth and increased IT offshoring, the Indian IT sector has witnessed 10 - 15% wage growth in the 21st century. Consequently, Indian's operations and firms are concerned that they are becoming too expensive in comparison with competition from the other offshoring destinations. To maintain high growth rates, attempts have been made to grow up the value chain and diversify to other high-end work in addition to software and hardware engineering. These jobs include research and development, equity analysis, tax-return processing, radiological analysis, [[medical transcription]], and more.

The choice of offshoring destination is often made according to cultural concerns. Japanese companies are starting to outsource to China, where large numbers of Japanese speakers can be found—particularly in the city of [[Dalian]], which was Japanese-occupied Chinese territory for decades (this is discussed in the book ''[[The World is Flat]]''). German companies tend to outsource to [[Eastern Europe]]an countries, such as [[Poland]] and [[Romania]], where proficiency in German is common.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephan |last=Manning |first2=Jörg |last2=Sydow |first3=Arnold |last3=Windeler |title=Securing Access to Lower-cost Talent Globally: The Dynamics of Active Embedding and Field Structuration |journal=Regional Studies |volume=46 |year=2012 |issue=9 |pages=1201–1218 |doi=10.1080/00343404.2011.571243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French companies outsource to North Africa for similar reasons. For Australian IT companies, [[Indonesia]] is one of the major choice of offshoring destination. Near-shore location, common time zone and adequate IT work force are the reasons for offshoring IT services to Indonesia.

Other offshoring destinations include [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/technology/colombia-moves-towards-top-of-outsourcing-a-list-says-nearshore-americas|title=Colombia Moves Towards Top of Outsourcing A-List|work=BnAmericas|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries.

The [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) made [[nearshoring]] more attractive between the Central American countries of [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and the [[Dominican Republic]] and the US.

=== Innovation offshoring ===
Once companies are comfortable with services offerings and started realizing the cost savings, many high-tech product companies, including some in [[Silicon Valley]], started offshoring innovation work to countries like [[Colombia]], [[Belarus]], South Africa, India, China, Mexico, Russia and Ukraine. Accessing the talent pools in these countries has the potential to cut costs or even shorten product lifecycles. Developing countries like India are also involved in this practice.

When offshoring knowledge work, firms heavily rely on the availability of technical personnel at offshore locations. One of the challenges in offshoring engineering innovation is a reduction in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moe|first=Nils Brede|last2=Šmite|first2=Darja|last3=Hanssen|first3=Geir Kjetil|last4=Barney|first4=Hamish|date=2013-08-29|title=From offshore outsourcing to insourcing and partnerships: four failed outsourcing attempts|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-013-9272-x|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1225–1258|doi=10.1007/s10664-013-9272-x|issn=1382-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure access to talent and possibly improve long-term quality, Western firms often establish collaborative relationships with technical universities abroad and thereby customize university programs to serve their particular needs. Examples include universities in Shanghai, such as [[Tong-Ji University]], where German firms and scholars co-sponsor labs, courses, and provide internships. Similar examples of collaborative arrangements can be found in Eastern Europe, e.g. Romania.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Additionally, EU companies looking for IT innovation often setup collaboration with universities in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine, which have a high percentage of ICT graduates and overall a very skilled IT labor.&lt;ref&gt;Opportunities for EU ICT Actors.

===Re-shoring===

John Urry (distinguished professor of sociology at [[Lancaster University]]) argues that the concealment of income, the avoidance of taxation and eluding legislation relating to work, finance, pleasure, waste, energy and security may be becoming a serious concern for democratic governments and ordinary citizens who may be adversely affected by unregulated, offshore activities. Further, the rising costs of transportation could lead to production nearer the point of consumption becoming more economically viable, particularly as new technologies such as [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] mature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Offshoring|author=John Urry|date=14 April 2014|isbn= 978-0745664866|publisher=polity UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of intellectual property ==
Offshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.

== Debate ==
Offshoring has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists, some of which overlap those related to the topic of [[free trade]]. It is seen as benefiting both the origin and destination country through [[free trade]], providing jobs to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country. This makes both sides see increased [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).  And the total number of jobs increases in both countries since those workers in the origin country that lost their job can move to higher-value jobs in which their country has a [[comparative advantage]].

On the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition to offshoring. Experts argue that the quality of any new jobs in developed countries are less than the jobs lost and offer lower pay.  Economists against offshoring charge that currency manipulation by governments and their central banks causes the difference in labor cost creating an illusion of comparative advantage.  Further, they point out that even more educated highly trained workers with higher-value jobs such as software engineers, accountants, radiologists, and journalists in the developed world have been displaced by highly educated and cheaper workers from India and China. On May 1, 2002, Economist and former Ambassador [[Ernest H. Preeg]] testified before the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that China, for instance, pegs its currency to the dollar at a sub-par value in violation of Article IV of the [[International Monetary Fund]] Articles of Agreement which state that no nation shall manipulate its currency to gain a market advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest H. Preeg (May 1, 2002).

===Impact on jobs in western countries===
''The Economist'' reported in January 2013 that: "High levels of unemployment in Western countries after the 2007-2008 financial crisis have made the public in many countries so hostile towards offshoring that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring The Economist-Here, there and everywhere-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2007 that while free trade among high-wage countries is viewed as win-win, free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html NYT-Paul Krugman-Trouble with Trade-December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Two estimates of the impact of offshoring on U.S. jobs were between 150,000 and 300,000 per year from 2004-2015. This represents 10-15% of U.S. job creation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569568-offshored-jobs-return-rich-countries-must-prove-they-have-what-it-takes-shape The Economist-What to Do Now: Shape Up-January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the U.S. due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

The study also found that "offshoring increases real wages for both high- and low-skilled workers, but more so for the former, increasing inequality."

===Legal implications in Japan===
Japanese companies use offshoring to exploit foreign laborers, particularly Chinese and Vietnamese, in violation of the Employment Security Act and Labor Standard Act guidelines set by the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]]. Article 44 of the Employment Security Act implicitly bans unauthorized companies supplying domestic/foreign workers, regardless of their operating locations. The laws apply if at least one party among suppliers, clients and workers reside in Japan, and if the workers are part of the integral part of the chain of command of the client company or the supplier:

{{Cquote|No person shall carry out a labor supply business or have workers supplied by a person who carries out a labor supply business work under his/her own directions or orders, except in cases provided for in the following Article.|Employment Security Act}}

{{Cquote|Unless permitted by act, no person shall obtain profit by intervening, as a business, in the employment of other|Labor Standards Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?yo=%E5%8A%B4%E5%83%8D%E5%9F%BA%E6%BA%96%E6%B3%95&amp;ft=2&amp;re=01&amp;ky=|title=日本法令外国語訳データベースシステム - [法令本文表示] - 労働基準法|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Employment Security Act sets punishment guidelines as follows:

{{Cquote|A person who falls under any of the following items shall be punished by imprisonment with work for not more than one year or a fine of not more than one million yen|Employment Security Act states, Article 64}}

Victims can lodge a criminal complaint against the CEO's of the suppliers and clients to the Labor Standards Inspection Office (in the case of the Labor Standards Act) or Public Prosecutor's Office in the company's location. Due to the risk of CEO's arrest, Japanese companies tend to privately settle with plaintiffs, offering between 20 and 100 million JPY (approximately 200,000 - 1 million USD) in damages.

== Effects of factor of production mobility ==
According to [[classical economics]], the three [[factors of production]] are [[land (economics)|land]], [[labor (economics)|labor]], and [[capital (economics)|capital]].  Offshoring relies heavily on the mobility of two of these factors.  That is, how offshoring affects economies depends on how easily capital and labor can be repurposed. Land, as a factor of production, is generally seen to have little or no mobility potential.

The effects of [[capital mobility]] on offshoring have been widely discussed.  In [[microeconomics]], a corporation must be able to spend [[working capital]] to afford the initial costs of offshoring.  If the state heavily regulates how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations.  For the same reason the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomy]] must be free for offshoring to succeed.  Generally, those who favor offshoring support capital mobility, and those who oppose offshoring call for greater [[regulation]].

Labor mobility also plays a major role, and it is hotly debated. When computers and the Internet made work electronically portable, the forces of free market resulted in a global mobility of work in the services industry. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if they have to obtain employment by downpricing themselves back into the labor market (by accepting lower salaries) or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.

Offshoring faces criticism from labor scholars who argue that [[global labor arbitrage]] leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|url=http://crs.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0896920515623076|journal=Critical Sociology|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the developed world, moving manufacturing jobs out of the country dates to at least the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;General Accounting Office: [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06423.pdf "Offshoring:  U.S. Semiconductor and Software Industries Increasingly Produce in China and India"], September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while moving knowledge service jobs offshore dates to the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jom.2007.02.012|title=History of offshoring knowledge services|journal=Journal of Operations Management|volume=26|issue=2|pages=141|year=2008|last1=Metters|first1=Richard|last2=Verma|first2=Rohit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued since then.  It was characterized primarily by the transferring of factories from the developed to the developing world. This offshoring and closing of factories has caused a structural change in the developed world from an industrial to a post-industrial service society.

During the 20th century, the decreasing costs of transportation and communication crossed with great disparities on pay rates made increased offshoring from wealthier countries to less wealthy countries financially feasible for many companies. Further, the growth of the [[Internet]], particularly fiber-optic intercontinental long haul capacity, and the [[World Wide Web]] reduced "transportation" costs for many kinds of information work to near zero.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Baase |title=A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet |edition=Third |location=Harlow |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-13-600848-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the Internet, many new categories of work such as call centres, computer programming, reading medical data such as X-rays and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], medical transcription, income tax preparation, and title searching are being offshored.

Before the 1990s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the EU. Because of Ireland's relatively low corporate tax rates, US companies began offshoring of software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property to Ireland for export. This helped create a high-tech "boom" and which led to Ireland becoming one of the richest EU countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) went into effect. As concerns are widespread about uneven bargaining powers, and risks and benefits, negotiations are often difficult, such that the plan to create free trade areas (such as [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]]) has not yet been successful. In 2005, offshoring of skilled work, also referred to as knowledge work, dramatically increased from the US, which fed the growing worries about threats of job loss.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Phi Gamma Nu''' ('''ΦΓΝ''') is one of the largest co-ed professional [[Professional fraternity|business fraternities]] in the United States, with the intent to prepare its members for professional endeavors in a business workplace.  The organization cultivates professional behavior in its members through a variety of activities and committees.  The organization promotes professional excellence through activities such as resume critiques, [[mock interview]]s, and etiquette dinners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phigammanu.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Phi Gamma Nu requires members to spend time on philanthropic endeavors.  Along with these activities, the organization also stresses the importance of physical interaction and camaraderie of its members. It is this last organizational feature that helps differentiate Phi Gamma Nu from the other national business fraternities. Currently, Phi Gamma Nu has 13 active collegiate chapters nationwide.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Pgn.jpg|right]] --&gt;

==History==
Phi Gamma Nu was founded on February 17, 1924 at the Chicago campus of [[Northwestern University]]. The original founder members were Sylvia Pekar Arnold, Elizabeth Conroy Fleming, Marge McInerney Hawes, Mary Chard Nalbach, Helen Vogel Purcell, and Celeste Weyl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upenn-pgn.org/history.php Phi Gamma Nu | Delta Lambda Chapter - University of Pennsylvania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023233549/http://www.upenn-pgn.org/history.php |date=2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phi Gamma Nu was founded as a sorority for women pursuing studies in business.  The sorority spent the next 50 years operating much the same way, but the dynamics of the organization changed to a co-ed format in 1974 due to the [[Title IX]] act. While Phi Gamma Nu began accepting male members in 1974, it was not until 1981 that the National Chapter Congress changed the name of Phi Gamma Nu Sorority to Phi Gamma Nu Fraternity to comply with Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phigammanu.com/history/ Phi Gamma Nu Historical Timeline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714204502/http://phigammanu.com/history/ |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous members from this fraternity include Dr. Lillian C. Budd, Dr. Virgil Loughbred, Robert E.J. Snyder, Joe Higgens, Nancy Barker, Honorable Barbara J. Hackett, Linda Batway, and Kate Rand Loyd.

==Three Pillars==
Three pillars form the organizational goals of Phi Gamma Nu.  Each organization event is directed towards a pillar.  Overall, four aims and purposes reflect the intent of the Phi Gamma Nu pillars.

'''1. Professional'''

''"To foster the study of business in colleges and universities."''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://phigammanu.com/purpose-mission-pillars/ Phi Gamma Nu-Mission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227194412/http://phigammanu.com/purpose-mission-pillars/ |date=2014-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"To promote professional competency and achievement in the field of business."''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Professionalism is a standard of behavioral guidelines for a business atmosphere.  This standard includes concrete actions and speech etiquette, but it also encompasses a mindset guiding ones mannerisms.  Phi Gamma Nu builds active professionalism through the following activities resume critiques, etiquette dinners, business presentations, cover letter workshops, company information sessions, mock interviews, and recruiter question and answer sessions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.uiuc.edu/pgn/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2. Social'''

''"To uphold the interests of our [[Alma mater|Alma Mater]] throughout the encouragement of high scholarship, participation in school activities, and the association of students for their mutual advancement."''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

To ensure the stability and well-being of the chapter, social events are an important aspect of Phi Gamma Nu.  A variety of different activities help build strong brotherhood.  Some activities include movie nights, game nights, study hours, scavenger hunts, apple picking, and bags tournaments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.business.uiuc.edu/pgn/ Redirect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3. Philanthropy'''

''"To further a high standard of business ethics and culture in civic and professional enterprise."''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Beyond social and professional pursuits, Phi Gamma Nu encourages its members to actively participate in philanthropy.  Active community service helps build a sense of communal ethics and culture.  Activities to build this pillar include participating in [[Adopt a Highway|Adopt-a-Highway]], [[animal shelter]]s, [[soup kitchens]], [[women's shelter]]s, and food pantries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Membership==
'''Selection'''

The recruitment period for Phi Gamma Nu occurs once each semester.  During membership selection, rushes participate in a series of interviews with Phi Gamma Nu actives and are evaluated on their professionalism, leadership skills, potential and commitment to the organization.  Phi Gamma Nu actives must vote on whether a rush satisfies these requirements before a rush initiates. 
To be eligible to join Phi Gamma Nu, a candidate must meet the following requirements:

* Regularly enrolled in an accredited university, college, or its equivalent
* A minimum GPA of 2.5 out of a possible 4.0
* You must not be a member of any other business fraternity in direct competition with this fraternity

'''Participation'''

Once initiated into Phi Gamma Nu, an members must still maintain several responsibilities.  Varying from chapter to chapter, a point system requirement enforces an active participation and attendance at Phi Gamma Nu events. Furthermore, the active must attend the minimum required events established in the fraternity bylaws of Phi Gamma Nu.  Financial obligations must also be met.  If any of these criteria are not fulfilled, the active must appear before the executive board and face expulsion from the fraternity. On the founding date each year, Founder’s Day is observed.  Celebration and attendance of Founder’s Day ritual is required for all chapters.  At ritual, the National President reads the annual message to the chapters, and all present members renew the oath of Phi Gamma Nu (Phi Gamma Nu 2006, 17).

==Notable Chapter and Member Accomplishments==

===Delta Theta Chapter===
*The Pennsylvania State University's Dance Marathon ([[THON]]) is the largest student-run philanthropy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thon.org/whatisthon/index.php Penn State Dance Marathon - Helping to Conquer Childhood Cancer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212125211/http://www.thon.org/whatisthon/index.php |date=2004-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1989, the Delta Theta chapter of Phi Gamma Nu has been a top independent (non-paired) fundraising organization of the event. During its first year of participation in 1989, Phi Gamma Nu won the independent division and won 6th place overall with a total of $2,156 to benefit children with pediatric cancer and pediatric cancer research. In 2011, PGN raised $58,797.80 winning 3rd place among all General Organizations, outearning the next closest professional business fraternity by over $10,000. In 2012, PGN raised $73,988.42 winning 1st among all business fraternities, and 2nd place among all General Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://live.psu.edu/story/57894&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beta Pi Chapter===
*On November 18, 2008, the Beta Pi chapter of Phi Gamma Nu ran the first annual "Mr. Business" competition at the [[University of Illinois]]. This event was a College of Business-wide program, which featured two male members of [http://www.illinoisbusinesscouncil.com/ Business Council] and the four business fraternities on campus: [http://business.illinois.edu/akpsi Alpha Kappa Psi], [http://www.business.illinois.edu/deltasig/ Delta Sigma Pi], Phi Gamma Nu and Phi Chi Theta. Proceeds of the event were donated to [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers and Big Sisters]] of Champaign County, an organization that mentors children in the community ages 6 through 18.
*Compete for a Cure is an event that was created by members of the Beta Pi Chapter of Phi Gamma Nu in 2010. The event is held in honor of the mother of a PGN that lost her battle to lung cancer in 2010. Since then, the Beta Pi Chapter has been hosting an annual 3 on 3 basketball tournament, as well as a coed sand volleyball tournament, as well as a variety of free food from local vendors, as well as free shirts and live entertainment. Over the last six years, Compete for a Cure has raised over $100,000 for the Pam Stern Legacy of Hope Foundation, where the money has been used to fund research work in developing a cure for lung cancer, among other things. The intention of Compete for a Cure is to spread the good that it can do as far as it can. In the past, Compete for a Cure has benefited a variety of organizations. In 2015, Compete for a Cure raised $20,500, of which 25% went to the  [[American Lung Association]], where the money was used to fund specific researchers and the work that they were doing to combat lung cancer, as well as to continue to support a lung cancer helpline that people could call for advice and information. The other 75% went to [[Keshet (organization)|Keshet]], a Jewish special education program where Pam Stern was a teacher. In 2016, Compete for a Cure will also benefit the Imerman Angels and the Tom Jones Challenger League. Imerman Angels is an organization that was built on the idea that no one should have to fight cancer alone. For free, they pair members with cancer fighters, as well as with caregivers to people with cancer. They offer their services to absolutely anyone, at any stage of the life, with any kind of cancer at any stage, anywhere in the world. The goal of Imerman Angels is to give people that are dealing with cancer in one way or another someone to talk to, to ask personal questions and garner support from someone that has been there before.

'''Samer Karam''' is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] entrepreneur, investor, author and activist. He founded Seeqnce, the first [[startup accelerator]] in Lebanon, created the Accelerate conference, and has had a leading role in building Lebanon's [[startup company|startup]] ecosystem and promoting, advising, mentoring, and investing in startup ecosystems across the world. He is considered to be "probably the most influential tech person across the [[Middle East]] [[North Africa]] ([[MENA]]) region."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web|title=From bombs to bytes: How Beirut's tech scene is thriving|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38663134 |website=BBC |date=2017-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and activism==

Karam created Blogging Beirut, a citizens' [[photojournalism]] website, in 2004. During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], it became one of the most visited [[blog]]s in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="GULF" /&gt; In 2007, he founded his first tech company, Wunbox,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Livetwitting: un homme, trois start-up|url=https://www.lecommercedulevant.com/article/17057-livetwitting-un-homme-trois-start-up |website=Le Commerce du Levant |date=2010-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a concept similar to [[Apache Wave|Google Wave]].&lt;ref name="FAIR" /&gt; He also started a couple of businesses based on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="GULF"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Building a career on the web|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/media/building-a-career-on-the-web-1.660812 |website=Gulf News |date=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=LiveTweeting, Real-Time Event Coverage With Crowdsourced Translation|url=http://www.startuparabia.com/2009/12/livetweeting-real-time-event-coverage-with-crowdsourced-translation/ |website=Startup Arabia |date=2009-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, Karam co-authored scientific papers on community information and location technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Geographic 'place' and 'community information' preferences|url=https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/geographic-place-and-community-information-preferences|website=University of Minnesota |date=2008-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sharing the big apple: a survey study of people, place and locatability|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1056928|website=ACM Digital Library |date=2005-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his campaign "Flip the Switch", Karam lobbied the Lebanese minister of communications into tackling the nation's stifling connection speeds. During the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]], he kept a real-time online register of missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Le who’s who de la blogosphère libanaise|url=https://www.lecommercedulevant.com/article/19475-le-whos-who-de-la-blogosphre-libanaise|website=Le Commerce du Levant |date=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Google's Wael Ghonim still missing in Egypt; company asks for help|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/02/google-asks-for-the-worlds-help-in-finding-executive-wael-ghonim-missing-in-egypt.html|website=Los Angeles Times |date=2011-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lebanon web suffers from 'world's slowest connection'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-15273510 |website=BBC |date=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Startup initiatives==

In 2010, Karam decided he would assist Lebanese early-stage startups. After a few months of running a collective, he realized that the growing startup scene needed a space. Converting a derelict apartment in [[Hamra, Beirut|Hamra]] into an office and raising $700,000, Karam founded the startup accelerator [[Seeqnce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=From The Heart Of Beirut, Startup Accelerator Seeqnce Plans To Thrive|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/05/from-the-heart-of-beirut-startup-accelerator-seeqnce-plans-to-thrive/ |website=Tech Crunch |date=2012-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeqnce was the first startup accelerator in Lebanon&lt;ref name="FAIR"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sky is the Limit for Lebanese Entrepreneurs|url=https://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/sky-is-the-limit-for-lebanese-entrepreneurs-31291/ |website=Fair Observer |date=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first in [[MENA]], providing investment, mentoring and offices to each startup. Its first two batches of start-ups raised more than $10 million.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

In 2014, Karam turned Seeqnce into Alice, one of the first online accelerators, which was based in [[London]] and supported by [[angel investor]]s. For startups, it offered financial templates, performance metrics, and a global pool of mentors. For investors, it provided a library of startups seeking investment, with financial and business information, investment portfolio management and performance monitoring. Its name was a nod to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', as Karam likened creating a startup to going down the rabbit hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Going Down the Tech Rabbit Hole with Beirut's Alice|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2014/01/20/going-down-the-tech-rabbit-hole-with-beiruts-alice/ |website=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Mobile World Congress]]' 4YFN conference in [[Barcelona]] in 2014, he set up the pavilion featuring 14 leading Arab startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Middle East tech news: What you need to know from February|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/03/03/middle-east-tech-news-what-you-need-to-know-from-february/ |website=The Next Web |date=2014-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[venture capital]] advisor of [[Banque du Liban]] (BDL, the Central Bank of Lebanon) and was a member of the founding steering committee of BDL's Circular 331 startup fund, worth $600 million. Karam created the Accelerate conference, which was one of the 10 biggest tech conferences in the world in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Steve Wozniak Went To Beirut And Wowed 8,000 People|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/montymunford/2016/12/19/steve-wozniak-went-to-beirut-and-wowed-8000-people/#793962542fcc|website=Forbes |date=2016-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Nicolas Sehnaoui]], he created Beirut Angels, an initiative to gather Lebanese angel investors.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Beirut’s Bright Future As A Tech Hub For MENA, If Its Politicians Will Allow It|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/03/beiruts-bright-future-as-a-tech-hub-for-mena-if-its-politicians-will-allow-it/|website=Tech Crunch |date=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His initiative Startup Megaphone has promoted the Lebanese startup ecosystem by holding events abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lebanon a gateway to start-ups’ success|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/lebanon-a-gateway-to-start-ups-success-1.86300|website=The National |date=2015-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Startup Lebanon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=La troisième édition de « Startup Lebanon » se tiendra à la Silicon Valley|url=https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1117536/la-troisieme-edition-de-startup-lebanon-se-tiendra-a-la-silicon-valley.html|website=L'Orient Le Jour |date=2018-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and creating national strategies and guides endorsed by BDL, such as Lebanon’s Startup Ecosystem Roadmap and Startup Guide Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Publications|url=http://www.bdl.gov.lb/downloads/index/9/149/Guides-and-Booklets.html|website=Banque du Liban |date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shareholders in the United Kingdom''' are people and organisations who buy [[share (finance)|share]]s in UK companies. In large companies, such as those on the [[FTSE100]], shareholders are overwhelmingly large institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds or similar foreign organisations. UK shareholders have the most favourable set of rights in the world in their ability to control directors of corporations. [[UK company law]] gives shareholders the ability to,

*remove the board of directors with a simple majority of votes
*change the company constitution with a three quarter vote (unless a higher figure is in the constitution)
*wind up (i.e. liquidate) the company with a three quarter vote
*veto any sale of a significant percentage of company assets
*veto by a majority any restriction on ability to freely trade their shares, such as a [[poison pill]]

Shareholders also owe one another duties, and owe duties under the [[Stewardship Code]] to exercise their voting power.

==Shareholder rights==
Shareholders provide an essential source of capital investment to corporations, and because of the [[inequality of bargaining power|bargaining position]] this confers, shareholders typically gain a comprehensive set of governance rights under a constitution. While not technically required, shareholders invariably possess exclusive voting rights, in contrast to many other European jurisdictions which require that employees [[codetermine]] (i.e. have the right to elect some of) the members of the board.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, the [[Mitbestimmungsgesetz]] 1976 ([[Codetermination Act 1976]])&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, and also because of the additional mandatory rights shareholders enjoy under the [[Companies Act 2006]], the UK is a "shareholder friendly" jurisdiction relative to its European and American counterparts.

===Elections===
Since the ''[[Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment]]'', chaired in 1945 by [[Lionel Cohen, Baron Cohen|Lord Cohen]], led to the [[Companies Act 1947]], as voters in the general meeting of public companies,&lt;ref&gt;In closely held, private companies, the mandatory removal right in [[CA 2006]] s 168 is qualified by the majority House of Lords decision in ''[[Bushell v Faith]]'' [1970] AC 1099, holding that a company's articles could allow a shareholder's votes to triple if facing removal as a director. This followed the Cohen Report's recommendations.&lt;/ref&gt; shareholders have the mandatory right to remove directors by a simple majority, now under [[CA 2006]] section 168.&lt;ref&gt;Previously [[Companies Act 1985]], section 303, implemented in the [[Companies Act 1947]], following recommendations of the [[Cohen Committee]], ''Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment'' (1945) [http://www.takeovers.gov.au/content/Resources/other_resources/Cohen_Committee.aspx Cmd 6659]. See [[EM Dodd]], 'The Cohen Report' (1945) 58 [[Harvard Law Review]] 1258&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Aktiengesetz]] 1965 §76. This is the [[Vorstand]], or the "executive" of the company that carries out all functions of management, rather than the [[Aufsichtsrat]] or supervisory council, which appoints it and is in turn elected by shareholders and employees.&lt;/ref&gt; and in most American companies (predominantly incorporated in [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]]) directors can only be removed for a "good reason".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] s 141(k) and ''[[Campbell v. Loews, Inc]]'' [[s:Campbell v. Loew's, Inc./Opinion of the Court|134 A.2d 852]] (1957); for a comprehensive critique, see [[AA Berle]] and GC Means, ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitution===
Shareholders will habitually have the right to change the company's constitution with a three quarter majority vote, unless they have chosen to entrench the constitution with a higher threshold.&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 s 283 (special resolution definition), ss 21–22 (amending the constitution)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meetings and resolutions===
Shareholders with support of 5 per cent of the total vote can call [[Shareholders' meeting|meetings]],&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 s 303, as amended by Companies (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2009/1632 Pt 2, reg 4&lt;/ref&gt; and can circulate suggestions for resolutions with support of 5 per cent of the total vote, or any one hundred other shareholders holding over £100 in shares each.&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 ss 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive pay===
{{main|Say on pay}}
Shareholder have [[say on pay]] of directors under [[CA 2006]] section 439. For the time being, this is non-binding.

===Significant transactions===
Categories of important decisions, such as large asset sales,&lt;ref&gt;[[UK Listing Authority|UKLA]] [[Listing Rule]] 10.&lt;/ref&gt; approval of mergers, takeovers, winding up of the company, any expenditure on political donations,&lt;ref&gt;CA 2006 ss 366–368 and 378 require a resolution, itemising the money to be donated, be passed by shareholders for any political contributions over £5000 in 12 months, lasting a maximum of four years.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[share repurchase|share buyback]]s. Other transactions where directors have a conflict of interest that require binding approval of shareholders are ratification of corporate opportunities, large self dealing transactions and service contracts lasting over two years.

Companies cannot make political donations without approval of the general meeting.

==Shareholder duties==

===Activism===
{{main|Stewardship Code|Shareholder activism}}
Despite habitually occupying the most privileged position in UK corporate governance, shareholders in large public companies listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] infrequently exercise their governance rights. [[Institutional investors]], including [[pension fund]]s, [[mutual fund]]s and [[insurance fund]]s, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through [[Pensions in the United Kingdom|pensions]], are [[Beneficiary|beneficiaries]] from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. However, institutional investors also often work "behind the scenes" to secure better corporate governance for their members, through informal but direct communication with management.&lt;ref&gt;See BS Black and JC Coffee, 'Hail Britannia?: Institutional Investor Behavior Under Limited Regulation' (1994) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=276991 92 Michigan Law Review 1997–2087]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other peoples' money, are bound by [[fiduciary]] obligations, deriving from the law of [[English trusts law|trusts]] and obligations to exercise care deriving from the [[common law]]. Now the [[Stewardship Code]] 2010, drafted by the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital.

{{Suicide sidebar}}

'''Suicide intervention''' is a direct effort to prevent a person or persons from attempting to take their own life or lives intentionally.

Most countries have some form of [[mental health law|mental health legislation]] which allows people expressing suicidal thoughts or intent to be detained [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily]] for [[psychiatric treatment]] when their judgment is deemed to be impaired.  These laws may grant the [[courts]], [[police]], or a [[medical doctor]] the power to order an individual to be apprehended to hospital for treatment.  This is sometimes referred to as being "[[involuntary commitment|committed]]". The review of ongoing [[involuntary treatment]] may be conducted by the hospital, the courts, or a [[quasi-judicial body]], depending on the jurisdiction. Legislation normally requires police or court authorities to bring the individual to a hospital for treatment as soon as practical and not hold them in locations such as a police station.

Mental health professionals and some other health professionals receive training in [[assessment of suicide risk|assessment]] and treatment  of suicidality. Suicide hotlines are widely available for people seeking help. However, some people may be reluctant to discuss their suicidal thoughts, due to [[social stigma|stigma]], previous negative experiences, fear of said detainment, or other reasons.

== First aid for suicide ideation ==
{{see also|Mental health first aid}}

There are a number of myths about [[suicide]].  It is not usually unpredictable; in 75-80% of cases, the suicidal person has given some sort of warning sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rosenthal H | title=12 Must-Know Myths About Suicidal Clients | journal=Counselor: the Magazine for Addictions Professionals | volume=4 | issue= | year=2003 | pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key myth to dispel is that talking to someone about suicide increases the risk of suicide.  This is simply not true.&lt;ref name=CARMHA&gt;{{Citation| last1=Monk| first1=Lynda| last2=Samra| first2=Joti| editor1-last=Samra| editor1-first=Joti| editor2-last=White| editor2-first=Jennifer| editor3-last=Goldner| editor3-first=Elliot| year=2007| title=Working With the Client Who is Suicidal: A Tool for Adult Mental Health and Addiction Services| publisher=Centre for Applied Research in Mental Health and Addiction| publication-place=Vancouver, British Columbia| isbn=978-0-7726-5746-6| oclc=223281097| url=http://comh.ca//publications/resources/pub_wwcwis/WWCWIS.pdf| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|8}}  If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts, he/she should be encouraged to seek mental health treatment.  Friends and family can provide supportive listening, [[empathy]], and encouragement to develop a safety plan.  Serious warning signs of imminent suicidal risk include  the intent to commit suicide and a specific plan with access to lethal means.&lt;ref name=CARMHA/&gt;{{Rp|30}}  If a person expresses these warning signs, [[emergency service]]s should be contacted immediately.

Safety plans can include sources of support, [[emotional self-regulation|self-soothing]] activities, reasons for living (such as commitment to family, pets, etc.), and safe people to call and places to go.&lt;ref name=CARMHA/&gt;{{Rp|38–39}}  When a person is feeling acutely distressed and overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts, it can be helpful to refer back to the safety plan.

== Mental health treatment ==

Comprehensive approaches to suicidality include stabilization and safety, assessment of [[risk factors]], and ongoing management and [[problem solving#psychology|problem-solving]] around minimizing [[risk factors]] and bolstering [[protective factor]]s.&lt;ref name=CARMHA/&gt;{{Rp|4}}  During the acute phase, admission to a [[psychiatric ward]] or [[involuntary commitment]] may be used in an attempt to ensure client safety, but the least restrictive means possible should be used.&lt;ref name="APA guidelines"&gt;{{Citation| last1=Jacobs| first1=Douglas G.| last2=Baldessarini| first2=Ross J.| last3=Conwell| first3=Yeates| last4=Fawcett| first4=Jan A.| last5=Horton| first5=Leslie| last6=Meltzer| first6=Herbert| last7=Pfeffer| first7=Cynthia R.| last8=Simon| first8=Robert I.| date=November 2003| title=Practice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Patients With Suicidal Behaviors| volume=1| work=American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines| publisher=[[American Psychiatric Publishing]]| publication-place=Arlington, VA| isbn=9780890423363| oclc=71824985| doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.56008| url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&amp;sectionid=1673332| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327212607/http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&amp;sectionid=1673332| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2012-03-27| chapter=Practice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Patients with  Suicidal Behaviors}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment focuses on reducing [[suffering]] and enhancing [[coping skills]], and involves treatment of any underlying illness.

[[DSM-5]] axis I disorders, particularly [[major depressive disorder]], and axis II disorders, particularly [[borderline personality disorder]], increase the risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=CARMHA/&gt;{{Rp|45}}  Individuals with [[dual diagnosis|co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders]] are at increased risk compared to individuals with just one of the two disorders.&lt;ref name="APA guidelines"/&gt;  While [[antidepressant]]s may not directly decrease suicide risk in adults, they are in many cases effective at treating [[major depressive disorder]], and as such are recommended for patients with depression.&lt;ref name="APA guidelines"/&gt;  There is evidence that long-term [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] therapy reduces suicide in individuals with [[bipolar disorder]] or [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name="APA guidelines"/&gt;  [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), or shock therapy, rapidly decreases suicidal thinking.&lt;ref name="APA guidelines"/&gt;  Choice of treatment approach is made based on the patient's presenting symptoms and history.  In cases where a patient is actively attempting suicide even while on a hospital ward, a fast-acting treatment such as [[electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] may be [[first-line treatment|first-line]].

Ideally, family are involved in the ongoing support of the suicidal individual, and they can help to strengthen [[protective factor]]s and problem-solve around risk factors.  Both families and the suicidal person should be supported by health care providers to cope with the societal stigma surrounding mental illness and suicide.

Attention should also be given to the suicidal person's [[culture|cultural]] background, as this can aid in understanding [[protective factor]]s and problem-solving approaches.  [[Risk factors]] may also arise related to membership in an oppressed minority group.  Aboriginal people may benefit from traditional Aboriginal healing techniques that facilitate a change in thinking, connection with tradition, and emotional expression.&lt;ref name=CARMHA/&gt;{{Rp|21–22}}

[[Psychotherapy]], particularly [[cognitive behavioural therapy]], is an important component in the management of suicide risk.&lt;ref name="APA guidelines"/&gt;  According to a 2005 [[randomized controlled trial]] by Gregory Brown, [[Aaron Beck]] and others, [[cognitive therapy]] can reduce repeat suicide attempts by 50%.&lt;ref name="Brown_et_al_2005"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5/563| title=Cognitive Therapy for the Prevention of Suicide Attempts: A Randomized Controlled Trial| last1=Brown |first1=G.K.| author2-link=Thomas Have| last2=Have| first2=T.T.| author3-link=Gregg Henriques| last3=Henriques| first3=G.R.| author4-link=Sharon Xie| last4=Xie| first4=S.X.| author5-link=Judd Hollander| last5=Hollander |first5=J.E.| author6-link=Aaron Beck| last6=Beck| first6=A.T.| journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association| date=3 August 2005| volume=294| issue=5| pages=563–570| pmid=16077050| doi=10.1001/jama.294.5.563}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source-inline|date=August 2014}}

=== Suicide prevention ===
{{Main|Suicide prevention}}

Various [[suicide prevention]] strategies have been suggested by mental-health professionals:
* Promoting mental resilience through [[optimism]] and connectedness.
* Education about suicide, including risk factors, [[warning signs of suicide|warning signs]], and the availability of help.
* Increasing the proficiency of health and welfare services in responding to people in need. This includes better training for health professionals and employing crisis-counseling organizations.
* Reducing [[domestic violence]], [[substance abuse]], and [[divorce]] are long-term strategies to reduce many mental health problems.
* Reducing access to convenient means of suicide (e.g., toxic substances, [[handguns]], ropes/shoelaces).
* Reducing the quantity of dosages supplied in packages of non-prescription medicines e.g., [[aspirin]].
* Interventions targeted at high-risk groups.

===Research on suicide prevention ===
Research into suicide is published across a wide spectrum of journals dedicated to the [[Portal:Biology|biological]], [[Portal:Business and Economics|economic]], [[Portal:Psychology|psychological]], [[Portal:Medicine|medical]], and [[social sciences]]. In addition to those, a few journals are exclusively devoted to the study of suicide (suicidology), most notably, ''[[Crisis (journal)|Crisis]]'', ''[[Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior]]'', and the ''[[Archives of Suicide Research]]''.

==Contents==
The book chronicles a [[hostile takeover]] attempt by [[Jay Pritzker]] to get control over the corporation.

==Review==
{{quote|The book as a whole is a self-serving account of fighting takeover and board-room battles and taking on the French bureaucracy in a joint venture involving ITT`s telecommunications operations in Europe. It is written in a breezy, first-person style, a la [[Lee Iacocca|Iacocca]], that attempts to bring the reader close to the world of business negotiation and intrigue.

There also is an interesting account, skimpy in detail, of how Araskog succeeded in persuading former Defense Secretary [[Caspar Weinberger]] not to deny classified information to an ITT German subsidiary, [[Standard Eletrik Lorenz]]. A Soviet defector had identified the firm as a source of leaks, but Araskog said the information was false. Weinberger was ready to make the ITT firm an example, but backed off when his aide, [[Richard Perle]], launched a probe that supported ITT.}}

The '''Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs'''  is currently the fourth ranking position in the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is intended to help ensure that [[public diplomacy]] is practiced in combination with [[Public administration|public affairs]] and traditional diplomacy to advance U.S. interests and security. The Under Secretary oversees three bureaus at the Department of State: [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|Educational and Cultural Affairs]], [[Bureau of Public Affairs|Public Affairs]], and [[Bureau of International Information Programs|International Information Programs]]. Also reporting to the Under Secretary are the [[Office of Policy, Planning and Resources for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]] and the [[Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy]].

The position was created on October 1, 1999, during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration after Title XIII, Section 1313 of the [[Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998]] (112 Stat. 2681-776). Section 2305 of the Act (112 Stat. 2681-825) increased the number of Under Secretaries of State from five to six.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2118">The '''Walloon Union of Companies''' or '''Union Wallonne des Entreprises''' (UWE) is the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] employers organization.

==History==
About 1965, when economic decentralization was becoming more pronounced in [[Belgium]], Walloon business leaders felt the need for more organisation. The pioneers of the UWE, were, to name a few, Jules Delruelle (Prayon), George Halbart (Magotteaux), George Henry ([[Glaverbel]]), Pierre Holoffe (Asphaltco), Leon Jacques (Carrières de Quenast) Jean Lannoye (Papeteries de Genval), Jules Plaquet (Compagnie des Ciments Belges), Alfred Putzeys (Pieux Franki).

Together they decided, at the end of 1967, to invite a hundred company managers to a meeting, the result of which was to create the ''Walloon Union of Companies'' (rather than the ''Union of Walloon Companies''), in this way allowing the many foreign companies  established in the Walloon Area to join the organization. It is also decided to open the organization to both the industrial and non-industrial sectors. The FEB ([[Federation of Belgian Enterprises|Federation of the Companies of Belgium]]) had not been established at that point and the national organization was based on a ''Federation of the Industrialists of Belgium'' and a ''Federation of the non-industrial companies of Belgium''.

Following this first meeting, it was decided to set up a Board of Directors and gather some initial funding. The new organization was founded on 2 April 1968. The first general meeting, in 1969, took place at the ''Charleroi Institute of Glass''.
