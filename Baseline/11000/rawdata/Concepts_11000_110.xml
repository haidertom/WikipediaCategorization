The endeavor to use 100% [[renewable energy]] for electricity, heating/cooling and transport is motivated by [[global warming]], pollution and other environmental issues, as well as economic and [[energy security]] concerns. Shifting the total global [[primary energy]] supply to renewable sources requires a [[energy transition|transition of the energy system]]. In 2013 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11 /&gt;

In 2014, renewable sources such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[bioenergy|biomass]], and burnt waste provided 19% of the total energy consumed worldwide, with roughly half of that coming from traditional use of biomass.&lt;ref name=Armaroli&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2016 | title = Solar Electricity and Solar Fuels: Status and Perspectives in the Context of the Energy Transition | url = | journal = [[Chemistry – A European Journal]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 32–57 | doi = 10.1002/chem.201503580 | pmid = 26584653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important sector is electricity with a renewable share of 22.8%, most of it coming from hydropower with a share of 16.6%, followed by wind with 3.1%.&lt;ref name=Armaroli/&gt; According to the [[REN21]] 2017 global status report, these figures had increased to 19.3% for energy in 2015 and 24.5% for electricity in 2016. There are many places around the world with grids that are run almost exclusively on renewable energy. At the national level, at least 30 nations already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of the energy supply.

Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H. Socolow]] of Princeton University have developed a series of “[[climate stabilization wedge]]s” that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic [[climate change]], and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges."&lt;ref name="Pacala"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1100103 |pmid=15310891 |pages=968–72 |title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5686 |year=2004 |last1=Pacala |first1=S |last2=Socolow |first2=R |bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P |citeseerx=10.1.1.642.8472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at [[Stanford University]] and director of its Atmosphere and Energy program, says that producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]],  and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible, and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that [[Cost of electricity by source|energy costs]] today with a wind, solar, and water system should be similar to today's energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies.&lt;ref name="enpol2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.045 |pages=1170–90 |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |journal=Energy Policy |volume=39 |issue=3 |year=2011 |last1=Delucchi |first1=Mark A |last2=Jacobson |first2=Mark Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2011 | title = Towards an electricity-powered world | url = | journal = [[Energy and Environmental Science]] | volume = 4 | issue = 9| pages = 3193–3222 [3216] | doi = 10.1039/c1ee01249e }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson's conclusions have been disputed by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608126/in-sharp-rebuttal-scientists-squash-hopes-for-100-percent-renewables/ | title = Scientists Sharply Rebut Influential Renewable-Energy Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States, the independent [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has noted that “sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, [[energy security]], and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| date=2010|page=4|publisher=National Academies of Science|isbn=9780309137089  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low-carbon energy strategies are political rather than technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, [[Sustainable energy|unsustainable energy consumption]], outdated [[energy infrastructure]], and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpd.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Revised.pdf|title=Post Carbon Pathways|author=John Wiseman|date=April 2013|work=University of Melbourne|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] paper&lt;ref name="sorensen-1975"&gt;

published in 1975 by Danish physicist [[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sørensen]], which was followed by several other proposals.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer" /&gt; In 1976 [[energy policy]] analyst [[Amory Lovins]] coined the term "[[soft energy path]]" to describe an alternative future where [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and appropriate [[renewable energy]] sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels.&lt;ref name=joshua2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/the-elusive-green-economy/7554/ |title=The Elusive Green Economy |author=Green, Joshua |date=July–August 2009 |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europe and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor [[Henrik Lund (academic)|Henrik Lund]] published a first paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Henrik | authorlink = Henrik Lund (academic) | year = 2006| title = Large-scale integration of optimal combinations of PV, wind and wave power into the electricity supply | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 503–515 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the [[Energy transition|transition]] to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europe, America, Australia and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer" /&gt;

Even in the early 21st century it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity. However, renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then:&lt;ref name=diesrev /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Solar photovoltaic]] modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price. Current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore [[wind power]] is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. [[Concentrated solar thermal]] power (CST) with [[thermal storage]] has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.&lt;ref name=diesrev&gt;{{cite web |url= http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/another-myth-busted-on-the-road-to-100-renewable-electricity-52178 |title=Another Myth Busted on the Road to 100% Renewable Electricity |author=Mark Diesendorf  |date=4 April 2013 |work=Reneweconomy.com.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11 /&gt; [[Wind turbine]]s generate 39&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Elproduktion|url = https://www.energinet.dk/DA/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Termisk-produktion/Sider/Termisk-produktion.aspx|website = www.energinet.dk|access-date = 2016-02-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302062337/https://www.energinet.dk/DA/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Termisk-produktion/Sider/Termisk-produktion.aspx|archive-date = 2016-03-02|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; percent of Danish electricity, and Denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well. Together, wind and biomass provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country's six million inhabitants. In 2010, Portugal's 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources. Spain's 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy has a history of strong public support. In America, for example, a 2013 [[Gallup survey]] showed that two in three Americans want the U.S. to increase domestic energy production using solar power (76%), wind power (71%), and natural gas (65%). Far fewer want more petroleum production (46%) and more nuclear power (37%). Least favored is coal, with about one in three Americans favouring it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/americans-want-more-emphasis-on-solar-wind-natural-gas |title=Americans Want More Emphasis on Solar, Wind, Natural Gas |author=Dennis Jacobe |date=April 9, 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[REN21]] says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a binding 20% by 2020 target for the European Union. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.ren21.net/Portals/0/REN21_GFR_2013_print.pdf |title=Renewables global futures report 2013 |author=REN21 |date=2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] involves substantial accident risks (e.g., [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], [[Chernobyl disaster]]) and the unsolved problem of safe long-term [[high-level radioactive waste management]], and [[carbon capture and storage]] has rather limited safe storage potentials.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/wene.128 |pages=74–97 |title=Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: A paradigm shift in energy policies |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment |volume=4 |year=2015 |last1=Hohmeyer |first1=Olav H |last2=Bohm |first2=Sönke }}&lt;/ref&gt; These constraints have also led to an interest in 100% renewable energy. A well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade, evaluating scenarios for 100% renewable energy for various geographical areas. In recent years, more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.03.038 |pages=270–82 |title=Least cost 100% renewable electricity scenarios in the Australian National Electricity Market |journal=Energy Policy |volume=59 |year=2013 |last1=Elliston |first1=Ben |last2=MacGill |first2=Iain |last3=Diesendorf |first3=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive to use 100% renewable energy is created by [[global warming]] and ecological as well as economic concerns, post [[peak oil]].

The first country to propose 100% renewable energy was [[Iceland]], in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rio02.com/proceedings/pdf/031_Gissuarson.pdf |title=Implementation of Green Bookkeeping at Reykjavik Energy |publisher=Rio02.com |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617131226/http://www.rio02.com/proceedings/pdf/031_Gissuarson.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyrichjapan.info/en/welcome.html |title=Energy Rich Japan |publisher=Energyrichjapan.info |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Australia in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf |title=Zero Carbon Australia Stationary Energy Plan |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523064256/http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay]] obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal).&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=2&amp;pid=2&amp;aid=12 International energy statistics] data for 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower).&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=NO Norway], updated 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet.

This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh.

Cities like [[Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]] in France, planned to use 100% renewable energy by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Un plan climat met Paris sur la voie de la neutralité carbone |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/climat/article/2018/03/22/un-plan-climat-met-paris-sur-la-voie-de-la-neutralite-carbone_5274533_1652612.html|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=2018-03-21|last1=Roger|first1=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Eurométropole de Strasbourg dévoile son plan climat 2030 |url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/climat-environnement/l-eurometropole-de-strasbourg-devoile-son-plan-climat-2030-1509993398|date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2010/11/101109-peak-oil-iea-world-energy-outlook/ |title=Has the World Already Passed "Peak Oil"? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research that has been published in [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support.

Other changes involve use of [[electric car]]s and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | last2 = Delucchi | first2 = Mark A. | year = 2011| title = Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part I: Technologies, energy resources, quantities and areas of infrastructure, and materials | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 1154–1169 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delucchi | first1 = Mark A. | last2 = Jacobson | first2 = Mark Z. | year = 2011| title = Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 1170–1190 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Paris Agreement]], countries periodically update their climate change targets for the future, by 2018 no [[g20|G20 country]] had committed to a 100% renewable target.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Brown-to-Green-Report-2018_rev.pdf p21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
''[[The Fourth Revolution: Energy]]'' is a German [[documentary film]] released in 2010. It shows the vision of a global society, which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100% with renewable energies, showing a complete reconstruction of the economy, to reach this goal. In 2011, [[Hermann Scheer]] wrote the book ''The Energy Imperative: 100 Percent Renewable Now'', published by Routledge.

''[[Reinventing Fire]]'' is a book by Amory Lovins released in October 2011. By combining reduced energy use with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] gains, Lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy. This can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies, through market forces, led by business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/03/16/amory-lovins-reinventing-fire-convergence-and-innovation?page=full |title=Amory Lovins on 'Reinventing Fire' with convergence and innovation |author=Adam Aston |date=March 16, 2012  |work=Greenbiz }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Clinton]] says the book is a "wise, detailed and comprehensive blueprint".&lt;ref name=nytrf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/fossil-fuels-as-the-whale-oil-of-the-future/ |title=Fossil Fuels as the Whale Oil of the Future |author=Matthew Wald |date=October 27, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first paragraph of the preface says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change. No oil spills, dead coal miners, dirty air, devastated lands, lost wildlife. No energy poverty. No oil-fed wars, tyrannies, or terrorists. Nothing to run out. Nothing to cut off. Nothing to worry about. Just energy abundance, benign and affordable, for all, for ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/reinventing-transforming-capitalism-barriers?newsfeed=true |title=Nine barriers to reinventing capitalism |author=John Elkington |date=21 March 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |date=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] has said that [[solar energy]] technologies, in its many forms, can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf|title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.&lt;ref name=ie11 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the refereed journal ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' published two articles by [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a professor of engineering at [[Stanford University]], and research scientist Mark A. Delucchi, about changing our energy supply mix and "Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power". The articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS), which are safe clean options. In Part I, Jacobson and Delucchi discuss WWS energy system characteristics, aspects of energy demand, WWS resource availability, WWS devices needed, and material requirements.&lt;ref name=enpol2010&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part I: Technologies, energy resources, quantities and areas of infrastructure, and materials |author=Mark Z.

In terms of [[solar power]], an additional 49,000 300 MW [[concentrating solar]] plants, 40,000 300 MW [[solar photovoltaic]] power plants, and 1.7 billion 3&amp;nbsp;kW rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed. Such an extensive WWS infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30%.&lt;ref name=enpol2010 /&gt;  In Part II, Jacobson and Delucchi address variability of supply, system economics, and energy policy initiatives associated with a WWS system. The authors advocate producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Energy costs with a WWS system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name="enpol2011" /&gt;

In general, Jacobson has said wind, water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world's energy, eliminating all [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Galbraith. [http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/100-percent-renewables-by-2030/ 100 Percent Renewables by 2030?] ''Green Inc.'', December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mark Z. |last1=Jacobson |first2=M.A. |last2=Delucchi |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030 |journal=[[Scientific American]]   |volume=301 |issue=5  |pages=58–65 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1109-58 |pmid=19873905  |date=November 2009|bibcode=2009SciAm.301e..58J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[University of Delaware]] for a 72 GW system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective, for the [[PJM Interconnection]], would use 17 GW of solar, 68 GW of [[offshore wind]], and 115 GW of onshore wind, although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided. 0.1% of the time would require generation from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2013/dec/renewable-energy-121012.html|title=Wind, solar power paired with storage could be cost-effective way to power grid|work=UDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Denmark's parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity, heat and fuels from renewables by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/03/a-true-all-of-the-above-energy-policy-denmark-affirms-commitment-to-100-renewable-energy-by-2050 |title=A True 'All of the Above' Energy Policy: Denmark Affirms Commitment to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050 |author=Stephen Lacey |date=29 March 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind, water and sunlight, for New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | year = 2013 | title = Examining the feasibility of converting New York State's all-purpose energy infrastructure to one using wind, water, and sunlight | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 585–601 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.02.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | title = A roadmap for repowering California for all purposes with wind, water, and sunlight | year = 2014 | journal = [[Energy (journal)|Energy]] | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 875–889 | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = A 100% wind, water, sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy plan for Washington State | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 75–88 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states, by 2050.  {{as of|2014}}, a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up, which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states. The 50-state plan is part of [[The Solutions Project]], an independent outreach effort led by Jacobson, actor [[Mark Ruffalo]], and film director [[Josh Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/fifty-states-renewables-022414.html |title=Stanford scientist unveils 50-state plan to transform U.S. to renewable energy |author=Mark Schwarz |date= February 26, 2014  |work=Stanford Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014}}, many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing, can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, hydro, ocean and geothermal energy. Debate over detailed plans remain, but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable, economically feasible, socially viable, and so realisable. This prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by Germany, one of the world's most successful industrial economies, to undertake a major [[energy transition]], [[Energiewende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transforming power |first1=Andy |last1=Stirling |author-link=Andy Stirling |date=2014 |journal=Energy Research and Social Science |doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.02.001 |volume=1 |pages=83–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a study was published in ''[[Energy and Environmental Science]]'' that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass. Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable, as by 2050 it would save about $600 Billion Dollars [[health costs]] a year due to reduced [[air pollution]] and $3.3 Trillion global warming costs. This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway. According to that study, barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political, as most people didn't know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5EE01283J |pages=2093–117 |title=100% clean and renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy roadmaps for the 50 United States |journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=8 |issue=7 |year=2015 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Bazouin |first3=Guillaume |last4=Bauer |first4=Zack A.

In June 2017, twenty-one researchers published an article in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] rejecting Jacobson's earlier PNAS article, accusing him of modeling errors and of using invalid modeling tools.&lt;ref name=NYT21june17&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Eduardo|title=Fisticuffs Over the Route to a Clean-Energy Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/business/energy-environment/renewable-energy-national-academy-matt-jacobson.html|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 June 2017|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1610381114 |pmid=28630353 |pmc=5495221 |title=Evaluation of a proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=114 |issue=26 |pages=6722–6727 |year=2017 |last1=Clack |first1=Christopher T.

=== Grid integration simulation ===
In 2015, Jacobson and Delucchi, together with Mary Cameron and Bethany Frew, examined with computer simulation (LOADMATCH), in more detail how a wind-water-solar (WWS) system can track the energy demand from minute to minute. This turned out to be possible in the United States for 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060 Jacobson, M.Z., M.A. Delucchi, M.A. Cameron, and B.A. Frew, ''A low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem with 100% penetration of intermittent wind, water, and solar for all purposes'', Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 112 (49) 15060-15065 December 8, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, the plan was further developed for 139 countries by a team of 27 researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.joule.2017.07.005 |title=100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World |journal=Joule |volume=1 |pages=108–21 |year=2017 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Bauer |first3=Zack A.F |last4=Goodman |first4=Savannah C |last5=Chapman |first5=William E |last6=Cameron |first6=Mary A |last7=Bozonnat |first7=Cedric |last8=Chobadi |first8=Liat |last9=Clonts |first9=Hailey A |last10=Enevoldsen |first10=Peter |last11=Erwin |first11=Jenny R |last12=Fobi |first12=Simone N |last13=Goldstrom |first13=Owen K |last14=Hennessy |first14=Eleanor M |last15=Liu |first15=Jingyi |last16=Lo |first16=Jonathan |last17=Meyer |first17=Clayton B |last18=Morris |first18=Sean B |last19=Moy |first19=Kevin R |last20=O'Neill |first20=Patrick L |last21=Petkov |first21=Ivalin |last22=Redfern |first22=Stephanie |last23=Schucker |first23=Robin |last24=Sontag |first24=Michael A |last25=Wang |first25=Jingfan |last26=Weiner |first26=Eric |last27=Yachanin |first27=Alexander S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, Jacobson and Delucchi with Mary Cameron and Brian Mathiesen published the LOADMATCH results for 20 regions in which the 139 countries in the world are divided. According to this research, a WWS system can follow the demand in all regions.&lt;ref name="WWS2"&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/WorldGridIntegration.pdf WWS per region]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.009 |title=Matching demand with supply at low cost in 139 countries among 20 world regions with 100% intermittent wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=123 |pages=236–48 |year=2018 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Cameron |first3=Mary A |last4=Mathiesen |first4=Brian V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program LOADMATCH receives as input estimated series, per half minute during 2050-2055, of
* the energy demand
* the intermittent wind and solar energy supply predicted with a 3D global climate / weather model GATOR-GCMOM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/GATOR/GATOR-GCMOMHist.pdf |title=Data |website=web.stanford.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the hydropower, geothermal, tidal and wave energy
and specifications of
* the capacities and maximum loading / unloading speeds of the different types of storage
* losses due to storage, transport, distribution and maintenance
* a demand-supply management system ([[smart grid]]).

The program has been carried out for each region 10-20 times with adapted input for the storage capacities, until a solution was found in which the energy demand was followed, per half minute for 5 years, with low costs.

The WWS system is assumed to connect in the electric network
* geographically dispersed variable energy sources, [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) and hydro power
* storage facilities: [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]], as heat in CSP plants, in batteries, as hydrogen by electrolysis of water, or as compressed air underground.

Although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy; it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases, as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | authorlink = Mark Z.

== Obstacles ==
The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies, at the pace required to prevent [[runaway climate change]], are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are:&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* [[Climate change denial]]
* [[Fossil fuels lobby|Efforts to impede renewable energy by the fossil fuel industry]]
* Political paralysis
* Unsustainable consumption of energy and resources
* Path dependencies and outdated infrastructure
* Financial and governance constraints
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[NASA]] Climate scientist [[James Hansen]] discusses the problem with rapid [[fossil fuel phase-out|phase out of fossil fuels]] and said that while it is conceivable in places such as New Zealand and Norway, "suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the [[Easter Bunny]] and [[Tooth Fairy]]."&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html|title=Nuclear energy and climate change: Environmentalists debate how to stop global warming.|work=Slate Magazine|date=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=James|title=Baby Lauren and the Kool-Aid|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2011/20110729_BabyLauren.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2013|authorlink=James Hansen|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of Jacobson and colleagues, and writing in an issue of ''Spectrum'' prepared by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], he identified numerous points of concern, such as cost, intermittent power supply, growing [[NIMBY]]ism, and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that "History and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed."&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0|title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy|author=Vaclav Smil|work=ieee.org|date=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smil and Hansen are concerned about the [[variable renewable energy|variable output]] of solar and wind power, but American physicist Amory Lovins has said that the [[electricity grid]] can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.&lt;ref name=lovi12&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |issue=March/April 2012 |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |journal=Foreign Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 American academic Dr. Gregory Unruh published a dissertation identifying the systemic barriers to the adoption and diffusion of renewable energy technologies. This theoretical framework was called [[Carbon lock-in|Carbon Lock-in]] and pointed to the creation of self-reinforcing feedbacks that arise through the co-evolution of large technological systems, like electricity and transportation networks, with the social and political institutions that support and benefit from system growth. Once established, these techno-institutional complexes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/pls/portallive/docs/1/7294726.PDF |title=Microsoft Word - Lock-in_Foxon_final.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; become "locked-in" and resist efforts to transform them towards more environmentally sustainable systems based on renewable sources.

[[Lester R. Brown]] founder and president of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, D.C., says a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy is both possible and necessary. Brown compares with the U.S. entry into World War II and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the US industry and economy. A quick transition to 100% renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by Brown to follow an approach with similar urgency.&lt;ref name="Plan B 4.0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_files/pb4book.pdf |title=Plan B 4.0, Mobilizing to Save Civilization  |author=Lester R. Brown |date=2009 |work=Earth Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt; The issue of [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent supply]] applies to popular renewable technologies, mainly [[wind power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]], and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when [[dispatchable generation]] such as hydroelectricity or solar thermal storage is also available. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/so_contribution.pdf|title=Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name=Lovins11&gt;[[Amory Lovins]] (2011). ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the world's leading climate researchers selected by the United Nations, said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17" /&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 22"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |date=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years.&lt;ref name=ipccccc /&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out with their [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|fifth report]], saying that in the absence of any one technology (such as bioenergy, [[carbon dioxide capture and storage]], nuclear, wind and solar), climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent. For example, it may cost 40% more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture. (Table 3.2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/|title=IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|work=ipcc.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google spent $30 million on their RE&lt;C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change|title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change|publisher=|date=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants''', a 1998 protocol on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), is an addition to the 1979 [[Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (LRTAP). The Protocol seeks "to control, reduce or eliminate discharge, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants" in Europe, some former Soviet Union countries, and the United States, in order to reduce their transboundary fluxes so as to protect human health and the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1979|title=PROTOCOL TO THE 1979 CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/full%20text/1998.POPs.e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and promoters of the Protocol were the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE), which at the time housed 53 different country members and alliance.   The protocol was amended on 18 December 2009, but the amended version has not yet come into force.

As of May 2013, the protocol has been ratified by 31 states and the [[European Union]].

In the United States, the protocol is an executive agreement that does not require Senate approval. However, legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of the protocol and existing U.S. laws (specifically the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] and the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]]).

== Substances ==
The following substances are contained in the CLRTAP POPs Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;UNECE: ''[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/Publications/11-22162-Part-C.pdf Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution 2010]'', p. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document focuses on a list of 16 substances that have been singled out according to agreed risk criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 25, 1998|title=CONVENTION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–35|via=UNECE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (comprising eleven pesticides, two industrial chemicals and three by-products/contaminants). The Protocol assigned the arrangements for proper disposal of waste products deemed banned and limited, including medical supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/pops_h1.html|title=Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) - Air Pollution - Environmental Policy - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the Latin phrase|the musical group|Ad Infinitum (band)|the logic fallacy|Ad nauseam}}
'''''Ad infinitum''''' is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "to [[infinity]]" or "forevermore".

==Description==
In context, it usually means "continue forever, without limit" and this can be used to describe a non-terminating process, a non-terminating ''repeating'' process, or a set of instructions to be repeated "forever," among other uses. It may also be used in a manner similar to the Latin phrase ''[[et cetera]]'' to denote written words or a concept that continues for a lengthy period beyond what is shown. Examples include:

*"The [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] '''1, 2, 3, ...''' continues ''ad infinitum''."
*"The perimeter of a [[fractal]] may be iteratively drawn ''ad infinitum''."
*The 17th-century writer [[Jonathan Swift]] incorporated the idea of [[self-similarity]] in the following lines from his satirical poem ''On Poetry: a Rhapsody'' (1733):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The vermin only teaze and pinch
Their foes superior by an inch.
So, naturalists observe, a flea
Has smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller still to bite 'em,
And so proceed ''ad infinitum''.
Thus every poet, in his kind,
Is bit by him that comes behind&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14353/14353-8.txt |title=On Poetry: a Rhapsody |last=Swift |first=Jonathan |year=1733 |access-date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*The mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]] included similar lines in his rhyme ''[[Siphonaptera (poem)|Siphonaptera]]''.&lt;ref name="Budget"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26408/26408-h/26408-h.htm |title=A Budget of Paradoxes |last=De Morgan |first=Augustus |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=David Eugene |edition=2nd |volume=II |publication-date=1915 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alvin Plantinga's free will defense''' is a [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical argument]] developed by American [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]], the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and published in its final version in his 1977 book ''God, Freedom, and Evil''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will Defense", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument is a defense against the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]] as formulated by philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] beginning in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|issue=210|pages=455–465|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ''The Miracle of Theism,'' though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Miracle of Theism.|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Oxford:|pages=154|quote=Since this defense is formally [that is, logically] possible, and its principle involves no real abandonment of our ordinary view of the opposition between good and evil, we can concede that the problem of evil does not, after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another. But whether this offers a real solution of the problem is another question.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mackie's logical argument from evil ==

The logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:
# God is omniscient (all-knowing)
# God is omnipotent  (all-powerful)
# God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect)
# There is evil in the world
Most orthodox Christian theologians agree with the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and agree with the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|year=1955|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|pages=200–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=H. J.|year=1960|title=God and Evil|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|volume=10|pages=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.

== Plantinga's free will defense ==
Plantinga's [[free will]] defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an ''explicit'' logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's ''implicit'' unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an ''explicit'' contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

First, Plantinga pointed out that God, though [[omnipotent]], could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil.&lt;sup&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Plantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="Howard-Snyder"&gt;"It used to be widely held by philosophers that God and evil are incompatible. Not any longer. Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense is largely responsible for this shift."{{cite journal|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|year=1999|title=Transworld Sanctity and Plantinga's Free Will Defense|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|journal=International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–351|author2=John O’Leary-Hawthorne|access-date=2013-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091750/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meister"&gt;"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil.

In addition to Plantinga's free will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Plantinga's free will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in ''God, Freedom, and Evil.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Further details ==
As opposed to a [[theodicy]] (a ''justification'' for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a ''defense'', offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, [[prima facie]] plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it.&lt;ref name="Surin1995p193"&gt;{{harvnb|Surin|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is "positively irrational".&lt;ref name="Mackie200"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1955|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Plantinga summarised his defense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1974|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't ''cause'' or ''determine'' them to do only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right ''freely''. To create creatures capable of ''moral good'', therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of [[moral evil]]. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is ''possible'' that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument relies on the following propositions:
# There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize.
# A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world.
Plantinga refers to the first statement as "Leibniz's lapse" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms ''strongly actualize'', a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby ''weakly actualizing'' a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from "transworld depravity".

== Reception ==
According to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]], most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted.&lt;ref name="Meister134"/&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] says that "it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of [[God and evil]]."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|Howard-Snyder|O'Leary-Hawthorne|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alston]] has said that "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|Alston|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Rowe]] has written "granted [[incompatibilism]], there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1979|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Arguing about Gods'', [[Graham Oppy]] offers a dissent, acknowledging that "[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" but continuing "I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppy|2006|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.”&lt;ref name="Weisberger 1999 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Weisberger|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the [[problem of evil]] presently revolves around the ''evidential'' problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.&lt;ref name="BeebeIEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional objections and responses ==

=== Incompatibilist view of free will === 
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|alt=A diagram. At the top, an orange box labeled "Determinism?" with two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to an orange box labeled "Free will?", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Libertarianism". The box labeled "Free will?" has two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to a light-blue box labeled "Compatibilism", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Hard determinism". The two light-blue boxes labeled "Hard determinism" and "Libertarianism" are surrounded by a grey ellipse labeled "Incompatibilism".|A simplified taxonomy of the main positions on the nature of free will.]]
Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as philosopher [[Antony Flew]], have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"/&gt;

Plantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating "this objection... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transworld depravity ===
Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a ''world segment'', meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, ''transworld depravity'' is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
A person ''P suffers from transworld depravity'' if and only if the following holds: for every world ''W'' such that ''P'' is significantly free in ''W'' and ''P'' does only what is right in ''W'', there is an action ''A'' and a maximal world segment ''S´'' such that
# ''S´'' includes ''A'' 's being morally significant for ''P''
# ''S´'' includes ''P'' 's being free with respect to ''A''
# ''S´'' is included in ''W'' and includes neither ''P'' 's performing ''A'' nor ''P'' 's refraining from performing ''A''
# If ''S´'' were actual, ''P'' would go wrong with respect to ''A''.}}
Less formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong.

Plantinga responds that "What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong—that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil"&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48" /&gt; and that it is logically ''possible'' that every person suffers from transworld depravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal2.jpg|thumb|300px|Mockup of booster at the [[Paris Air Show]].]]

The '''Baikal booster''' (russ. Байкал) was a proposed reusable flyback [[Booster (rocketry)|booster]] for the [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]] rocket family based on the Angara [[Universal Rocket Module]] in 2001. It was designed by the Molniya Research and Industrial Corporation ([[NPO Molniya]]) for the [[Khrunichev]] Space centre, reusing the flyback and control system for the reusable [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] orbiter.

== Description ==

The booster would be equipped with an [[RD-191]] rocket engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to provide approximately 200 tons of thrust.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In addition, it would be equipped with a folding wing stored parallel to the fuselage of the vehicle during the booster stage of the flight. After separation from the Angara launcher's second stage at an altitude of about 75 kilometers and a speed of {{convert|5.6|Mach|246,000|sigfig=2}}, the Baikal's wing would rotate 90 degrees and the booster glides in upside down position reducing speed. Once the booster reaches subsonic speeds a U turn is performed and an air-breathing [[RD-33]] jet engine in its nose section is started to fly back to its launching site and make a powered horizontal landing on a runway. Apart from economic advantages, this procedure
greatly reduces the risk of falling space debris. Reducing this risk was important as the Angara
rockets will be launched from the deep inland [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Development ==

A full-size engineering mock-up of the Baikal was exhibited at the [[Paris Air Show]] in July 2001. Similar mockups were tested in wind tunnels of the Central Aero- and Hydrodynamics Institute [[TsAGI]], at speeds of 0.5 - 10 Mach. However, according to unofficial statements by Khrunichev Center representatives, there would have been a long development program to the production of models for captive tests, and the mock-up demonstrated at Le Bourget differs greatly in appearance and design from the Baikal that will actually be launched.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

As in June 2016, the development was essentially complete, but funding for the manufacture of the flying prototype of the recoverable booster was absent due to the low expected launch rate.&lt;ref name="iz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iz.ru/news/619896|publisher=iz.ru|title="Роскосмос" готовится к созданию многоразовой ракеты &amp;#124; Статьи &amp;#124; Известия|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty sidebar}}
'''Belief''' is the state of [[mind]] in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being [[empirical evidence]] to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a [[mental representation]] of an [[Intentionality|attitude positively oriented]] towards the [[likelihood]] of something being [[truth|true]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Primmer |first= Justin |editor-last= Primmer |editor-first= Justin |contribution= Belief |title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab |location= Stanford, CA |year= 2018|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek thought]], two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: ''[[Pistis#Pistis in rhetoric|pistis]]'' and ''[[doxa]]''. Simplified, we may say that ''pistis'' refers to "trust" and "confidence", while ''doxa'' refers to "opinion" and "acceptance".  The English word "[[orthodoxy]]" derives from ''doxa''.  Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Primmer|first1= Justin|title= The nature and purpose of belief|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|date= 2018|volume= 29|issue= 3|pages= 219–239|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/LEITNA|accessdate= 3 June 2018 | quote = The purpose of belief is to guide action, not to indicate truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to personal attitudes
associated with [[truth value|true or false]] ideas and concepts. However, "belief" does not require active [[introspection]] and circumspection. For example, we never ponder whether or not the sun will rise. We simply assume the sun will rise. Since "belief" is an important aspect of mundane life, according to Eric Schwitzgebel in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', a related question asks: "how a physical organism can have beliefs?"&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/] – "The 'mind-body problem', for example, so central to philosophy of mind, is in part the question of whether and how a purely physical organism can have beliefs." Retrieved 01 July 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Classical_definition_of_Kno.svg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|A [[Venn diagram|Venn]]/[[Euler diagram]] which grants that [[truth]] and well-justified belief may be distinguished and that their [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] is [[knowledge]]{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}]]

==Knowledge and epistemology==
[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries – [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as "[[justified true belief]]". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa – common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orthé), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm – Copyright (c) 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato has been credited for the "''justified true belief''" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gettier |first=E. L. |year=1963 |title=Is justified true belief knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–123 |doi= 10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]] (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=A. I. |year=1967 |title=A causal theory of knowing |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=357–372 |doi= 10.2307/2024268|jstor=2024268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the "justified true belief" definition, and challenged the "sophists" of their time.

==As a psychological phenomenon==
Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and ''[[dispositional belief]]s'' (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P. W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H. D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-853010-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.

Philosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her controversial book ''Saving Belief'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |location= |isbn=0-691-07320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct - Sometimes called the "mental sentence theory," in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] is one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says "I believe that snow is white" and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Most notably, philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science hasn't provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both [[eliminativism|eliminativists]] in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they don't go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
(1) Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.
(2) Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
(3) Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3–13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological belief compared to religious belief==
Historically ''belief-in'' belonged in the realm of religious thought, ''belief-that'' instead belonged to epistemological considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = H. H. | year = 1965 | title = Belief 'In' and Belief 'That' | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2400996 | journal = Religious Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 01| pages = 5–27 | doi = 10.1017/S0034412500002304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief-in===
To "believe in" someone or something is a distinct concept from "believing-that." There are at least these types of belief-in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacIntosh |first=J. J. |year=1994 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-15948893/belief-revisited-reply-williams.html |title=Belief-in Revisited: A Reply to Williams |journal=Religious Studies |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=487–503 |doi=10.1017/S0034412500023131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commendatory''' / '''[[Faith]]''' - we may make an expression of 'faith' in respect of some performance by an agent X, when without prejudice to the truth value of the factual outcome or even confidence in X otherwise, we expect that specific performance. In particular [[self-confidence]] or faith in one's self is this kind of belief.
* '''Existential claim''' – to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenomenon in a general way with the implied need to justify its claim to existence. It is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. "He believes in witches and ghosts" or "many children believe in Santa Claus" or "I believe in a deity" are typical examples.&lt;ref name="belief-in"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macintosh |first=Jack |chapter=Belief-in |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] |page=86 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic form is distinct from the assertion of the truth of a proposition since verification is either considered impossible/irrelevant or a [[counterfactual]] situation is assumed.

===Belief-that===
====Economical belief====
Economic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Taylor-Gooby – [https://www.issa.int/html/pdf/jeru98/theme3/3-1a.pdf ECONOMIC BELIEFS AND SOCIAL POLICY BEHAVIOUR] [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (Economic Beliefs and behaviour research programme) [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from  existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Arena"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWtuUnc1u4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMI1N-8qfSbxwIVzLUUCh0tuwX3&amp;q=economic%20beliefs|author=R. Arena &amp; A. Festré|title=Knowledge, Beliefs and Economics|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing 1 Jan 2006, 288 pages, |ISBN=1847201539|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delusion====
Insofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential  and propositional form we are using the sense of ''belief-that'' rather than ''belief-in''. [[Delusion]] arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.&lt;ref name="L. Bortolotti"&gt;{{cite book |author=L. Bortolotti|title=Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs|publisher=OUP Oxford 2010, 299 pages, ''International Perspectives in Philosophy &amp; Psychiatry'' |ISBN=0199206163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/ ''Tarski's Truth Definitions''], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ ''LOTH''] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" Alfred Tarski Dover 1995/41, Ch. I, &amp;sect; 2 ''Expressions containing variables—sentential and designatory functions'' and Ch. II ''On the Sentential Calculus'' in its entirety&lt;/ref&gt;

Delusions are defined as beliefs in [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria&lt;ref&gt;[http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2013/06/delusions-in-dsm-5.html ''Delusions in the DSM 5''] A blog by Lisa Bortolotti &amp; Ema Sullivan-Bissett&lt;/ref&gt; (for example in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''). Psychiatrist and historian [[G.E. Berrios]] has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts," where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.

In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] says, "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to [[Credo quia absurdum|entertain beliefs contrary to fact]].

==Formation==
[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:

===The conditional inference process===
When people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate a) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and b) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false (respectively). Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"&gt;Wyer, R. S., &amp; Albarracin, D. (2005). Belief formation, organization, and change: Cognitive and motivational influences. In D. Albarracin, B. T. Johnson, &amp; M. P. Zanna, The Handbook of Attitudes (273–322). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models of belief formation===
Unlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R.

===Information processing models of belief formation and change===
These models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

Some influences on people's belief formation include:
* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape our beliefs in different domains. [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Andrew Gelman |first=Andrew |last=Gelman |first2=David |last2=Park |first3=Boris |last3=Shor |first4=Joseph |last4=Bafumi |first5=Jeronimo |last5=Cortina |title=Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals believe the [[religion]] they were taught in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Argyle |title=The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-12330-5 |page=25 |quote=Religion, in most cultures, is ascribed, not chosen. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charismatic leaders can form and/or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hoffer |title=The True Believer |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2002 |isbn=0-06-050591-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is belief voluntary? Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using [[cognitive dissonance]].
* [[Advertising]] can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, and association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Kilbourne |first2=Mary |last2=Pipher |title=Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-684-86600-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the [[sleeper effect]], instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement's ability to persuade viewer's beliefs if a discounting cue is present.&lt;ref&gt;see Kumkale &amp; Albarracin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Babette |last=Rothschild |title=The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-393-70327-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, Leadership Therapy, she states "You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you." This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Anna |title=Leadership Therapy: Inside the Mind of Microsoft |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=69 |isbn=1-4039-8403-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justified true belief&lt;!--'Justified true belief' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Justified true belief'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a definition of [[knowledge]] that gained approval during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], 'justified' standing in contrast to 'revealed'. There have been attempts to trace it back to [[Plato]] and his dialogues.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;The received view holds it that Plato's theory presents knowledge as remembering eternal truths and justification reawakens memory, see {{cite book |last=Fine |first=G. |chapter=Introduction |title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-924558-4 |pages=5–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; believes that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, and
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is justified in believing that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of [[Gettier problem]]s, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chisholm | first = Roderick | title = The Foundations of Knowing | chapter=Knowledge as Justified True Belief |publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8166-1103-3 |authorlink=Roderick Chisholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Nozick]] suggested{{Year needed|date=April 2017}} a [[Gettier problems#Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking|clarification]] of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that "no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernecker |first=Sven|last2= Dretske|first2= Fred|date= 2000|title= Knowledge. Readings in contemporary epistemology|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|isbn= 978-0198752615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the Justified True Belief account is the "standard, widely accepted" definition of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter2, p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
{{see also|Belief revision}}
An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.
Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision.  One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity.  However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]].   Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as  [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.
Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes.  Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence.  This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification.  Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

==Partial==
Without qualification, "belief" normally implies a lack of [[doubt]], especially insofar as it is a designation of a [[life stance]]. In practical everyday use however, belief is normally partial and retractable with varying degrees of certainty.

A copious literature exists in multiple disciplines to accommodate this reality. In mathematics [[probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[fuzzy set theory]], and other topics are largely directed to this.

==Prediction==
Different psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100–120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., "It will rain tomorrow"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by "and" or "or" do not follow the model as well.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg" /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Religion collage updated.jpg|thumb]]
Religious belief refers to attitudes towards [[mythological]], [[supernatural]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of a [[religion]].{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Religious belief is distinct from [[religious ritual|religious practice]] and from [[religious behaviour]]s – with some believers not practicing [[religion]] and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a [[deity]] or deities, to the idea of [[Miracle|divine intervention]] in the [[universe]] and in [[human life (disambiguation)|human life]], or to the [[deontological]]  explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a [[spiritual leader]] or of a [[spiritual group]]. In contrast to other [[belief system]]s, religious beliefs are usually [[Codification (law)|codified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief | publisher = University of California Press | author = Wittgenstein, Ludwig | year = 2007 | pages = 53 | isbn = 0520251814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of religious belief===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or [[creed]]s, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by [[religious authority|religious authorities]] do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An empiricist's view of the nature of religious belief | publisher = Norwood Editions  (Norwood, Pa.) | author = Braithwaite, R. B. | year = 1975 | isbn = 088305955X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Religious fundamentalism}}
First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist [[Protestants]] in the United States of America,&lt;ref name="A.C. Dixon"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2012-11-27 |url = http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |title = 'The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth' |accessdate = 2012-11-28 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203144842/http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |archivedate = 3 December 2012 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "fundamentalism" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Religious fundamentalism has been identified{{by whom|date=November 2017}} in the media as being associated with [[fanaticism|fanatical]] or [[zealotry|zealous]] political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====Orthodoxy====
{{Main|Orthodoxy (disambiguation)}}
First used in the context of [[Early Christianity]], the term "orthodoxy" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, [[apologetics|apologies]], and [[hermeneutics]] of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term "[[Magisterium]]". The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism – now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of "orthodox" is "[[heterodox]]", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].

====Modernism/reform====
The [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophe]]s'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.

====Superstition====
{{Main|Superstition}}
A term signifying derogation that is used by the religious and non-religious alike, "superstition" refers to a  deprecated belief in supernatural causation. Those who deny the existence of the supernatural generally attribute all beliefs associated with it to be superstitious, while a typical religious critique of superstition holds that it either encompasses beliefs in non-existent supernatural activity or that the supernatural activity is inappropriately feared or held in improper regard (see [[idolatry]]). Christian Churches strongly condemned [[occultism]], [[animism]], [[paganism]], and other [[folk religion]]s as mean forms of superstition, though such condemnation did not necessarily eliminate the beliefs among the common people, and many such religious beliefs persist {{as of | 2018 | lc = on | alt = today}}.

====Systemization====
In Buddhism, practice and progress along the [[spiritual path]] happens when one follows the system of [[Buddhist practice]]. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system includes bad aspects too.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a "bad" religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha:
{{quote|"O Gotama, there are [[Shramana|Samana]]s (wandering monks) and [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and [[Mahavira|Nigantha Nataputta]]. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"}}

The Buddha replied:
{{quote|"Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], neither in it is there found a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|first stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Once-returner|second stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|third stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Arahant|fourth stage]]."}}

As a religious tradition, [[Hindu]]ism has experienced many attempts at systemization. In medieval times, [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] advocated for the [[Advaita]] system of philosophy. In recent times, [[Tamala Krishna Gosvami]] has researched the systemization of [[Krishna]] theology as expounded by [[Srila Prabhupada]]. (See [[Krishnology]])

====Universalism====
Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern [[Western culture|Western]] cultures do.

Some [[anthropologist]]s{{Who|date=July 2010}} report cultures in which gods are involved in every aspect of [[human condition|life]] – if a cow goes dry, a god has caused this, and must be propitiated; when the sun rises in the morning, a god has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.

People with such a [[worldview]] often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} regard the influence of [[Western culture]] as inimical. Others with this worldview resist the influence of [[science]], and believe that science (or "so-called science") should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief, written into the constitutions of many{{which|date=November 2017}} [[Islam]]ic nations,  is shared by some [[fundamentalist Christians]].

In addition, beliefs about the [[supernatural]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as [[nature]] and non-nature, nor between science and what most educated people believe. In the view of some historians{{Who|date =September 2013}}, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] [[Athenian]]s saw [[science]], political [[tradition]], [[culture]] and religion as not easily distinguishable, but as all part of the same body of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] available to a [[community]].

===Approaches to the beliefs of others===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.  All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

====Exclusivism====
{{See also|Exclusivism}}
People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founder]]s or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the "correct" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Inclusivism====
People with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.

Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.

====Pluralism====
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}
People with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.  Examples include:

* Extracts from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji (Sikh Holy Scriptures), "There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all" (Pannaa 45). "By His Power the [[Vedas]] and the [[Purana]]s exist, and the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions. By His Power all deliberations exist." (Pannaa 464). "Some call Him, '[[Lord Rama|Ram]], Ram', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1|| He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us amen." (Pannaa 885).

====Syncretism====
{{Main|Syncretism}}
People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretistic faith.

===Adherence===
{{See also|Existence of God}}
Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:

* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Compare: {{cite web | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | publisher = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many{{quantify|date= November 2017}} people regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher =  SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organized religions promote a sense of [[Community (disambiguation)|community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].&lt;ref name="repa"&gt;{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J. Theodore | date = 1998-10-18 | url = http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | title = Building Community: The Marriage of Religion and Education | accessdate = 2006-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907172411/http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | archive-date = 7 September 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Note for example the concept of a [[cultural Christian]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with [[spiritual power]]. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom.  It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice.  Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), "[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful."&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S. Larson |author3 = Harold G. Koenig  |date = October 2000 | title = Research Findings on Religious Commitment and Mental Health | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p001078.html | accessdate= 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, "a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation," an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |authorlink1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostasy===
{{Main|Apostasy}}
{{See also|Existence of God#Arguments against belief in God}}
Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |authorlink = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927-03-06 |url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and empases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christian]]s share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few
** the slaughter of the [[Huguenot]]s by French [[Catholics]] in the sixteenth century
** [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s killing each other when [[Pakistan]] separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of [[Shiite]] Muslims by [[Sunni]] Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of [[Protestant]]s by [[Catholics]] and vice versa in [[Ireland]] (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that continues {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}. - According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Philip (pseudonym of Jeremy Bentham) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=qiRQAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Natural+Religion+on+the+Temporal+Happiness+of+Mankind&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sGJSbzT4Ts&amp;sig=pzV-WU5Jx0cpsVXX08ZU17mL-BE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 ''Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind''], 1822, R. Carlile, London, at page 76: "Of all human antipathies, that which the believer in a God bears to the unbeliever is the fullest, the most unqualified, and the most universal"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.
* The maintenance of [[Human life (disambiguation)|life]] and the achievement of [[self-esteem]] require of a person the fullest exercise of reason{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}—but morality (people are taught{{by whom|date=November 2017}}) rests on and requires faith.&lt;ref&gt;Faith is the commitment of one's consciousness to beliefs for which one has no sensory evidence or rational proof. When a person rejects reason as their standard of judgment, only one alternative standard allegedly remains to them: feelings. A mystic is a person who treats feelings as tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with knowledge. To practice the "virtue" of faith, one must (we are told) be willing to suspend one's sight and one's judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, with that which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one's knowledge, and to induce a trance like illusion of understanding. One must allegedly be willing to repress one's critical faculty and hold it as one's guilt; one must be willing to drown any questions that rise in protest—to strangle any trust of [[reason]] convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the protector of one's life and cognitive integrity. The presumed human need for self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control over reality—but no control is possible in a universe which, by one's own concession, contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a universe in which one is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one must deal, not with the unknown, but with the unknowable; no control is possible if a person proposes, but a ghost disposes; no control is possible if the universe is a haunted house. A person's life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of his or her consciousness be reality and this earth—but morality, people are taught, consists of scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, and of contemplating, instead, a "different" and "higher" reality, a realm inaccessible to reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by revelation, by special dialectical processes, by that superior state of intellectual lucidity known to Zen-Buddhists as "No-Mind," or by death. A person's life and self-esteem require that this person take pride in their power to think, pride in their power to live—but morality, people are taught, holds pride, and specifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, people are taught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the smallness, the impotence of one's mind. A person's life and self-esteem purportedly require the person to be loyal to their values, loyal to their mind and its judgments, loyal to their life—but the essence of morality, people are taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one's mind to some higher authority, and the sacrifice of one's values to whoever may claim to require it. A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher value in favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which one does not value in order to obtain that which one does value—or if one gives up a lesser value in order to  obtain a greater one—this is not a sacrifice, but a gain. Remember further that all of a person's values allegedly exist in a hierarchy; people value some things more than others; and, to the extent that a person is rational, the hierarchical order of the person's values is rational: that is, the person values things in proportion to their importance in serving this person's life and well-being. That which is inimical to their life and well-being, that which is inimical to their nature and needs as a living being, the person disvalues. Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted value structure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objective merit, in relation to the person's nature and needs; they frequently value the very things that will lead them to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, they are engaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice. But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational person who must be “cured”. They must learn to do violence to their own rational judgment—to reverse the order of their value hierarchy—to surrender that which their mind has chosen as the good—to turn against and invalidate their own consciousness.{{cite book

==Systems==
A '''belief system''' is a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be classified as [[Religious belief|religious]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[politics|political]], [[Ideology|ideological]], or a combination of these. Philosopher [[Jonathan Glover]] says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth A. Minton, Lynn R. Khale|title=Belief Systems, Religion, and Behavioral Economics|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=Business Expert Press LLC|isbn=978-1-60649-704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert, sociological perspectives===
A collective belief is referred to when people speak of what 'we' believe when this is not simply elliptical for what 'we all' believe.

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all '[[social fact]]s', 'inhered in' social [[Group (sociology)|groups]] as opposed to individual persons. Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure.

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Margaret Gilbert]] has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons to accept a certain belief as a body. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it themselves.  Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

===Glover===
Jonathan Glover believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.

[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (e.g., it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;]]
Glover suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. It always implicates and relates to other beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; (e.g., with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (e.g., some people may not realize they have racist belief systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[René Descartes]], saying about Descartes that "[h]e starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman." To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: "Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating."&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more deeply held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more openmindedly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html "Jonathan Glover on systems of belief", Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GloverBeliefs&gt;[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
The British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as "[[wiktionary:claptrap|claptrap]]" and said that they "draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves to victory... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again".&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">A '''Bioeffector'''  is a viable [[microorganism]] or active natural compound which directly or indirectly affects plant performance ([[Biofertilizer]]), and thus has the potential to reduce [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]] use in crop production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpg.phytomedizin.org/fileadmin/tagungen/03_PPPHE/Doku/2014/MinutesPPPHE2014.pdf Minutes of the 6th International Symposium Plant Protection and Plant Health in Europe, May 2014 Braunschweig, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Bioeffectors have a direct or indirect effect on plant performance by influencing the functional implementation or activation of biological mechanisms, particularly those interfering with soil-plant-microbe interactions.&lt;ref&gt;V. Römheld, G. Neumann (2006): ''The Rhizosphere: Contributions of the soil-root interface to sustainable soil systems''. In: N. Uphoff, N., N. A. S. Ball et al. (Hg.), ''Biological Approaches to Sustainable Soil Systems'', S. 92–107, CRC-Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to conventional fertilizers and pesticides, the effectiveness of bioeffectors is not based on a substantial direct input of mineral plant nutrients, either in inorganic or organic forms.

*Products in use are:
** Microbial residues,
** Composting and fermentation products,
** Plant and algae extracts
*Bioeffector-preparations (''bio-agents'') as ready-formulated products are applied:
** with the purpose of stimulating plant growth (bio-stimulants),
** to improve plant nutrient acquisition (bio-fertilizers),
** to protect plants from [[pathogens]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]] ([[Biological pest control|bio-control agents]])
** or generally to advance cropping efficiency; they can contain one or more bio-effectors along with other substances”&lt;ref&gt;Bakonyi N., Donath S., Weinmann M., Neumann G., [[Torsten Müller (agroscientist)|Müller T.]], [[Volker Roemheld|Römheld V.]] (2008): Assessing commercial bio-fertilisers for improved phoshorus availability. Use of rapid screening tests. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pflanzenernährung 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well established bioeffectors with documented positive results in the field level are:
** [[Rhizobia]] strains for soil or seed inoculation as a prerequisite for symbiotic N2-fixation when establishing new legume species or varieties.
** positive effects of [[mycorrhiza]] inoculation for soils with a (temporarily) low potential for natural root mycorrhization.
** sufficient mycorrhization enhances nutrient (P) and water uptake and increases resistance to pathogenic fungi.
*Further mechanisms for the positive impact of bioeffectors on plant growth have postulated, promising a high potential for resource preservation due to reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use:
** Active nutrient mobilisation by exudation of acids and carboxylates (e.g. P-mobilisation),
** exudation of micro-nutrient mobilising siderophores/chelates (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;),
** reduction of trace elements from less soluble oxidised to highly soluble reduced forms (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;),
** associative/non-symbiotic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixation, protective antagonism to plant pathogens,
** enhancement of mycorrhizal infection and growth, and stimulating hormonal effects.

== Research and Public Dissemination ==
Under the Acronym ''Biofector'' the European Union supports the Research of Bioeffectors under the leadership of the [[University of Hohenheim]] (Coordinator [[Guenter Neumann (agricultural scientist)|Guenter Neumann]]).
The results of the project will be evaluated by the members of the [[Association Biostimulants in Agriculture]] (ABISTA) and provided agriculture for use and EU institutions for the legislative and registration procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biostimulants.info/ Webpage Biostimulants Association]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other Biostimulants Organisations are [[European Biostimulant Industry Council]], [[International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association]] and [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting]].

This contrasts with [[exponential growth]], which is constantly increasing at an accelerating rate, and therefore approaches infinity in the limit.

An example of bounded growth is the [[logistic function]].

The '''City of the Caesars''' (Spanish '''Ciudad de los Césares'''), also variously known as ''City of Patagonia'', ''the Wandering City'', ''Trapalanda'' or ''Trapananda'', ''Lin Lin'' or ''Elelín'', is a [[mythical city]] of South America. It was supposedly located somewhere in [[Patagonia]], in a valley of the [[Andes]] between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Despite being searched for during the [[colonization]] of South America, no evidence proves that it ever existed, although reports of it circulated for two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez S, 2004, ''Southern Chronicles: from the colonisation to the foundation of Ushuaia'', Rubí Ediciones, Ushuaia, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766 a Jesuit, Father José García Alsue, explored the area now part of [[Queulat National Park]] in [[Aysén Region]], Chile, searching unsuccessfully for the City of the Caesars.

==Myth==
The city is described as prosperous and rich, full of gold, silver and diamonds. At least one description says it was located in between two mountains, somewhere in the Andes mountains, one of gold and another of diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/mchilena01/temas/index.asp?id_ut=labusquedadelaciudaddeloscesares |title=La búsqueda de la Ciudad de los Césares |accessdate=19 February 2010 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430214545/http://www.memoriachilena.cl/mchilena01/temas/index.asp?id_ut=labusquedadelaciudaddeloscesares |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is described as an enchanted city that appears in certain moments; or such that those who come upon it by chance in their travels forget the encounter; or such that hunters of it will walk away with mountains of fortune and treasure. Its purported founders include survivors of a Spanish shipwreck in the [[Strait of Magellan]], survivors in exile of the [[Disaster of Curalaba]], [[ghost]]s,  [[Patagon|Patagonian giants]] and survivors of the [[Inca Empire]]; indeed, one explanation of the legend is that it derived from stories told to sailors by aborigines describing the Empire of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez S, 2004, ''Southern Chronicles: from the colonisation to the foundation of Ushuaia'', Rubí Ediciones, Ushuaia, p. 51, referring to 'the de Angelis collection put together by the Argentine state press in 1835'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
[[Charles Sheffield]]'s science fiction story "Trapalanda" (in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]],'' June, 1987) is built around a quest to find Trapalanda.

'''Cradle-to-cradle design''' (also referred to as '''Cradle to Cradle''', '''C2C''', '''cradle 2 cradle''', or '''[[regenerative design]]''') is a [[biomimetic]] approach to the design of products and systems that models human industry on nature's processes viewing materials as nutrients circulating in healthy, safe [[metabolism]]s. The term itself is a play on the popular corporate phrase "Cradle to Grave," implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations (i.e. from the birth, or "cradle," of one generation to the next versus from birth to death, or "grave," within the same generation.)

C2C suggests that industry must protect and enrich [[ecosystem]]s and nature's biological metabolism while also maintaining a safe, productive technical metabolism for the high-quality use and circulation of [[organic compound|organic]] and technical nutrients.&lt;ref name="Cradle 2002"&gt;''Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the way we make things'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[holistic]] economic, industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that are not only efficient but also essentially waste free.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;Lovins, L. Hunter (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW08_chapter_3.pdf Rethinking production] in ''State of the World 2008'', pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The model in its broadest sense is not limited to [[industrial design]] and [[manufacturing]]; it can be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as [[urban environment]]s, buildings, economics and [[social systems]].

The term Cradle to Cradle is a registered trademark of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry (MBDC) consultants. Cradle to Cradle product certification began as a proprietary system; however, in 2012 MBDC turned the certification over to an independent non-profit called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute.  Independence, openness, and transparency are the Institute's first objectives for the certification protocols.&lt;ref name="treehugger.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/ask-experts-why-hasnt-cradle-to-cradle-design-caught-on-yet.html|title=Ask the Experts: Why Hasn't Cradle-to-Cradle Design Caught On Yet?|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "cradle to cradle" itself was coined by [[Walter R. Stahel]] in the 1970s. The current model is based on a system of "lifecycle development" initiated by [[Michael Braungart]] and colleagues at the ''Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency'' (EPEA) in the 1990s and explored through the publication ''A Technical Framework for [[life-cycle assessment|Life-Cycle Assessment]]''.

In 2002, Braungart and [[William McDonough]] published a book called ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'', a [[manifesto]] for cradle to cradle design that gives specific details of how to achieve the model. The model has been implemented by a number of companies, organizations and governments around the world, predominantly in the [[European Union]], [[China]] and the [[United States]]. Cradle to cradle has also been the subject of many documentary films, including the critically acclaimed ''Waste=Food''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/films/500068530/|title=Waste = Food|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In the cradle to cradle model, all materials used in industrial or commercial processes—such as metals, [[fiber]]s, [[dye]]s—fall into one of two categories: "technical" or "biological" nutrients. ''Technical nutrients'' are strictly limited to non-toxic, non-harmful synthetic materials that have no negative effects on the natural environment; they can be used in continuous cycles as the same product without losing their integrity or quality. In this manner these materials can be used over and over again instead of being "[[Downcycling|downcycled]]" into lesser products, ultimately becoming waste.

''Biological Nutrients'' are [[organic material]]s that, once used, can be disposed of in any natural environment and decompose into the soil, providing food for small life forms without affecting the natural environment. This is dependent on the ecology of the region; for example, organic material from one country or landmass may be harmful to the ecology of another country or landmass.&lt;ref name="Cradle 2002"/&gt;

[[File:Biological and technical nutrients (C2C).jpg|thumb|Biological and Technical Cycles]]

[[Image:Operation of Regenerative economy.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Biological and technical cycle]]
The two types of materials each follow their own cycle in the regenerative economy envisioned by Keunen and Huizing.

===Structure===
Initially defined by McDonough and Braungart, the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute's five certification criteria are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c2ccertified.org/index.php/product_certification/program_details|title=Resources - Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute|website=c2ccertified.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Material health, which involves identifying the chemical composition of the materials that make up the product. Particularly hazardous materials (e.g. heavy metals, pigments, halogen compounds etc.) have to be reported whatever the concentration, and other materials reported where they exceed 100 ppm. For wood, the forest source is required. The risk for each material is assessed against criteria and eventually ranked on a scale with green being materials of low risk, yellow being those with moderate risk but are acceptable to continue to use, and red for materials that have high risk and need to be phased out. Grey for materials with incomplete data. The method uses the term 'risk' in the sense of hazard (as opposed to consequence and  likelihood).
*Material reutilization, which is about recovery and recycling at the end of product life.
*Assessment of energy required for production, which for the highest level of certification needs to be based on at least 50% renewable energy for all parts and subassemblies.
*Water, particularly usage and discharge quality.
*Social responsibility, which assesses fair labor practices.
The certification is available at several levels: basic, silver, gold, platinum, with more stringent requirements at each. Prior to 2012, MBDC controlled the certification protocol.

===Health===

Currently, many human beings come into contact or consume, directly or indirectly, many harmful materials and chemicals daily. In addition, countless other forms of plant and animal life are also exposed. C2C seeks to remove dangerous ''technical nutrients'' (synthetic materials such as [[mutagenic]] materials, [[heavy metals]] and other dangerous chemicals) from current life cycles. If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects, then the health of the overall system can be better maintained. For example, a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful ''technical nutrients'' by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer base chemicals.&lt;ref name="Cradle 2002"/&gt;

===Economics===
The use of a C2C model often lowers the financial cost of systems. For example, in the redesign of the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]], the planting of Sedum (stonecrop) vegetation on assembly plant roofs retains and cleanses rain water. It also moderates the internal temperature of the building in order to save energy. The roof is part of an $18 million rainwater treatment system designed to clean {{convert|20|e9USgal|m3}} of rainwater annually. This saved Ford $50 million that would otherwise have been spent on mechanical treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/features/bwarAwards/archives/04b_fordRouge.asp|title=Architectural Record - News, Continuing Ed, Products, Green Bldg|website=archrecord.construction.com|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If products are designed according to C2C design principles, they can be manufactured and sold for less than alternative designs. They eliminate the need for waste disposal such as landfills.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Definitions===
*'''Cradle to Cradle''' a play on the phrase "Cradle to Grave", implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations.
*'''Technical nutrients''' are basically [[inorganic]] or synthetic materials manufactured by humans—such as plastics and metals—that can be used many times over without any loss in quality, staying in a continuous cycle.
*'''Biological nutrients''' and materials are [[organic material]]s that can decompose into the natural environment, soil, water, etc. without affecting it in a negative way, providing food for bacteria and microbiological life.
*'''Materials''' are usually referred to as the building blocks of other materials, such as the dyes used in colouring fibers or rubbers used in the sole of a shoe.
*'''Downcycling''' is the reuse of materials into lesser products.  For example, a plastic computer case could be downcycled into a plastic cup, which then becomes a park bench, etc.; this may eventually lead to waste.  In conventional understanding, this is no different from [[recycling]] that produces a supply of the same product or material.
*'''Waste = Food''' is a basic concept of organic waste materials becoming food for bugs, insects and other small forms of life who can feed on it, decompose it and return it to the natural environment which we then indirectly use for food ourselves.

===Existing synthetic materials===
The question of how to deal with the countless existing ''technical nutrients'' (synthetic materials) that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in C2C design. The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more difficult to deal with, such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean.

==Hypothetical examples==
One effective example is a shoe that is designed and mass-produced using the C2C model. The sole might be made of "biological nutrients" while the upper parts might be made of "technical nutrients". The shoe is mass-produced at a manufacturing plant that utilises its waste material by putting it back into the cycle; an example of this is using off-cuts from the rubber soles to make more soles instead of merely disposing of them (this is dependent on the technical materials not losing their quality as they are reused). Once the shoes have been manufactured, they are distributed to retail outlets where the customer buys the shoe at a fraction of the price they would normally pay for a shoe of comparable aspects; the customer is only paying for the use of the materials in the shoe for the period of time that they will be using the shoe. When they outgrow the shoe or it is damaged, they return it to the manufacturer. When the manufacturer separates the sole from the upper parts (separating the technical and biological nutrients), the biological nutrients are returned to the natural environment while the technical nutrients are used to create the sole of another shoe.

Another example of C2C design is a disposable cup, bottle, or wrapper made entirely out of biological materials. When the user is finished with the item, it can be disposed of and returned to the natural environment; the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is eliminated. The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again.

==Implementation==
The C2C model can be applied to almost any system in modern society: [[urban environment]]s, buildings, [[manufacturing]], [[social systems]]. 5 steps are outlined in ''Cradle to Cradle – Remaking the way we make things'':&lt;ref name="Cradle 2002"/&gt;
*Get "free of" known culprits
*Follow informed personal preferences
*Create "passive positive" lists – lists of materials used categorised according to their safety level
:The X List – substances that must be phased out, such as [[teratogenic]], [[mutagenic]], [[carcinogenic]].
:The Gray List – problematic substances that are not so urgently in need of phasing out
:The P List – the "positive" list, substances actively defined as safe for use
*Activate the positive list
*Reinvent – the redesign of the former system

Products that adhere to all steps can generally be granted a certification. Two certifications used for cradle-to-cradle products include [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) and [[BRE Environmental Assessment Method]] (BREEAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=66|title=BREEAM : 404|website=www.breeam.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C2C principles were first applied to systems in the early 1990s by Braungart's [[Hamburger Umweltinstitut]] (HUI) and [[The Environmental Institute]] in Brazil for biomass nutrient recycling of effluent to produce agricultural products and clean water as a byproduct.

In 2005, William McDonough helped found the Center for Eco-Intelligent Management at Instituto de Empresa Business School. The center's research produced the [[The Biosphere Rules|Biosphere Rules]], a set of five implementation principles that facilitate the adoption of closed loop production approaches with a minimum of disruption for established companies.

In 2007, MBDC and the EPEA formed a strategic partnership with global materials consultancy [[Material ConneXion]] to help promote and disseminate C2C design principles by providing greater global access to C2C material information, certification and product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/sep2007/id20070919_689774.htm|title="New Clout for Cradle to Cradle Design," BusinessWeek, September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2008, Material ConneXion's Materials Libraries in New York, [[Milan]], [[Cologne]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Daegu]], [[Korea]] started to feature C2C assessed and certified materials and, in collaboration with MBDC and EPEA, the company now offers C2C Certification, and  C2C product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greensource.construction.com/news/080115MaterialConneXion.asp|title="Materials Innovators Engage Cradle to Cradle Protocol", GreenSource, January 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209223355/http://greensource.construction.com/news/080115MaterialConneXion.asp|archivedate=9 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the C2C model has influenced the construction or redevelopment of many smaller buildings, several large companies, organisations and governments have also implemented the C2C model and its ideas and concepts:

===Major implementations===
*The [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] incorporates cradle to cradle systems throughout the center. The use of the term C2C is replaced with Regenerative.
*The [[China|Chinese Government]] is constructing many cities like [[Huangbaiyu]] based on C2C principles, utilising the rooftops for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/chinas-first-ecovillage-proves-a-hard-sell/2006/08/25/1156012740582.html?page=fullpage Article from ''The Age'', August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordination with other models==
The Cradle to Cradle model can be viewed as a framework that considers systems as a whole or [[holistic]]ally. It can be applied to many aspects of human society, and is related to [[Life cycle assessment]]. See for instance the LCA based model of the [[Eco-costs]], which has been designed to cope with analyses of recycle systems.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer, Ch. F. Hendriks, J.C. Brezet; [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r7248g565215804t/ Allocation in recycle systems: an integrated model for the analyses of environmental impact and economic value], Int. J. of LCA, Vol. 6 (6) , pp 344–355,&lt;/ref&gt; The Cradle to Cradle model in some implementations is closely linked with the [[Car-free movement]], such as in the case of large-scale building projects or the construction or redevelopment of urban environments. It is closely linked with [[passive solar design]] in the building industry and with [[permaculture]] in agriculture within or near urban environments. An [[earthship]] is a perfect example where different re-use models are used, cradle to cradle and permaculture.

In 2005, IE Business School in Madrid launched the Center for Eco-Intelligent Innovation in collaboration with William McDonough to study the implementation of Cradle to Cradle design approaches in pioneering businesses. The academic research of companies lead to the elaboration of the [[The Biosphere Rules|Biosphere Rules]], a set of five principles derived from nature that guide the implementation of circular models in production. 

==Constraints==
A major constraint in the optimal recycling of materials is that at civic amenity sites, products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin, but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin.

This makes the extraction of rare earth elements and other materials uneconomical (at recycling sites, products typically get crushed after which the materials are extracted by means of magnets, chemicals, special sorting methods, ...) and thus optimal recycling of, for example metals is impossible (an optimal recycling method for metals would require to sort all similar alloys together rather than mixing plain iron with alloys).

Obviously, disassembling products is not feasible at currently designed civic amenity sites, and a better method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer, so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product. These disassembled product can then be used for making new products or at least to have the components sent separately to recycling sites (for proper recycling, by the exact type of material). At present though, few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to [[Ecoleasing|take back their products for disassembly]], nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle-to-cradle products. One process where this is happening is in the EU with the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]].

== Criticism and response==
Criticism has been advanced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duurzaamgebouwd.nl/index.php?pageID=3946&amp;messageID=1751|title="Cradle to Cradle urgently needs a Dutch private partnership"|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228233446/http://www.duurzaamgebouwd.nl/index.php?pageID=3946|archivedate=28 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/danielle-sacks/ad-verse-effect/william-mcdonough-must-change|title=Green Guru William McDonough Must Change, Demand His Biggest Fans|date=26 February 2009|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the fact that McDonough and Braungart previously kept C2C consultancy and certification in their inner circle. Critics argued that this lack of competition prevented the model from fulfilling its potential. Many critics pleaded for a public-private partnership overseeing the C2C concept, thus enabling competition and growth of practical applications and services.

McDonough and Braungart responded to this criticism by giving control of the certification protocol to a non-profit, independent Institute called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. McDonough said the new institute "will enable our protocol to become a public certification program and global standard."&lt;ref name="treehugger.com"/&gt; The new Institute announced the creation of a Certification Standards Board in June 2012. The new board, under the auspices of the Institute, will oversee the certification moving forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/articles/method-steelcase-join-new-standards-board-cradle-cradle|title=Method, Steelcase Join New Standards Board at Cradle to Cradle  - Sustainable Brands|website=sustainablebrands.com|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts in the field of environment protection have questioned the practicability of the concept. [[Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek]], head of the German [[Wuppertal Institute]] called his assertion, that the "old" environmental movement had hindered innovation with its pessimist approach "pseudo-psychological humbug".

''I can feel very nice on Michael's seat covers&lt;ref&gt;He is referring to Cradle-to-Cradle seat cushions Braungart developed for the Airbus 380.&lt;/ref&gt; in the airplane. Nevertheless I am still waiting for a detailed proposal for a design of the other 99.99 percent of the [[Airbus 380]] after his principles.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 Schmidt-Bleek stated that it is out of the question that the concept can be realized on a bigger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/konsum/artikel/1/der-kluegste-mensch-den-seine-frau-kennt/|title=Ökologisch-industrielle Revolution: Der Umweltretter Michael Braungart|first=Peter|last=Unfried|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017|via=taz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that C2C certification may not be entirely sufficient in all [[eco-design]] approaches. Quantitative methodologies (LCAs) and more adapted tools (regarding the product type which is considered) could be used in tandem. The C2C concept ignores the use phase of a product. According to [[Life-cycle assessment#Variants|the Variants of Life Cycle Assessment]] the entire life cycle of a product or service has to be evaluated, not only the material itself. For many goods e.g. in transport, the use phase has the most influence on the environmental footprint. E.g. the more lightweight a car or a plane the less fuel it consumes and consequently the less impact it has. Braungart fully ignores the use phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lca-net.com/publications/critical_review/|title=Guidelines for critical review of life cycle assessments - 2.-0 LCA consultants|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/83829123/Version%202.1/C2CPII%20v2.pdf|title="Cradle to Cradle Certification"|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is safe to say that every production step or resource-transformation step needs a certain amount of energy.

The C2C concept foresees an own certification of its analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c2ccertified.org/index.php/product_certification|title=C2C Product Certification Overview - Get Certified - Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute|website=c2ccertified.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore is in contradiction to international ISO standards [[SO 14000|14040 and 14044]] for [[Life Cycle Assessment]] whereas an independent and critical review is needed in order to obtain comparative and resilient results. Independent external review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/ILCD-Handbook-Review-schemes-LCA-online-12March2010.pdf|title="ILCD Handbook Review schemes p6f"|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821150531/http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/ILCD-Handbook-Review-schemes-LCA-online-12March2010.pdf|archivedate=21 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spurious correlations - spelling bee spiders.svg|thumb|An example of data produced by data dredging, showing a correlation between the number of letters in a spelling bee's winning word and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders.]]
'''Data dredging''' (also '''data fishing''', '''data snooping''', '''data butchery''', and '''''p''-hacking''') is the misuse of [[data analysis]] to find patterns in data that can be presented as [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] when in fact there is no real underlying effect. This is done by performing many [[statistical test|statistical tests]] on the data and only paying attention to those that come back with significant results, instead of stating a single hypothesis about an underlying effect before the analysis and then conducting a single test for it.

The process of data dredging involves automatically testing huge numbers of hypotheses about a single [[data set]] by [[exhaustive search|exhaustively searching]]—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a [[correlation]], and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.

Conventional tests of [[statistical significance]] are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis).  This level of risk is called the [[statistical significance|''significance'']]. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type, hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses turn out to be significant at the 5% level, 1% turn out to be significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be statistically significant but misleading, since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.

The [[multiple comparisons]] hazard is common in data dredging. Moreover, subgroups are sometimes explored without alerting the reader to the number of questions at issue, which can lead to misinformed conclusions.&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawing conclusions from data==

The conventional [[frequency probability|frequentist]] [[statistical hypothesis testing]] procedure is to formulate a research hypothesis, such as "people in higher social classes live longer", then collect relevant data, followed by carrying out a statistical [[significance test]] to see how likely such results would be found if chance alone were at work. (The last step is called testing against the [[null hypothesis]].)

A key point in proper statistical analysis is to test a hypothesis with evidence (data) that was not used in constructing the hypothesis. This is critical because every [[data set]] contains some patterns due entirely to chance. If the hypothesis is not tested on a different data set from the same [[statistical population]], it is impossible to assess the likelihood that chance alone would produce such patterns. See [[testing hypotheses suggested by the data]].

Here is a simple example. [[coin throw|Throwing a coin]] five times, with a result of 2 heads and 3 tails, might lead one to hypothesize that the coin favors tails by 3/5 to 2/5. If this hypothesis is then tested on the existing data set, it is confirmed, but the confirmation is meaningless. The proper procedure would have been to form in advance a hypothesis of what the tails probability is, and then throw the coin various times to see if the hypothesis is rejected or not. If three tails and two heads are observed, another hypothesis, that the tails probability is 3/5, could be formed, but it could only be tested by a new set of coin tosses. It is important to realize that the statistical significance under the incorrect procedure is completely spurious – significance tests do not protect against data dredging.

== Hypothesis suggested by non-representative data ==

{{main article|Testing hypotheses suggested by the data}}

Suppose that a study of a random sample of people includes exactly two people with a birthday of August 7: Mary and John. Someone engaged in data snooping might try to find additional similarities between Mary and John. By going through hundreds or thousands of potential similarities between the two, each having a low probability of being true, an unusual similarity can almost certainly be found. Perhaps John and Mary are the only two people in the study who switched minors three times in college. A hypothesis, biased by data snooping, could then be "People born on August 7 have a much higher chance of switching minors more than twice in college."

The data itself very strongly supports that correlation, since no one with a different birthday had switched minors three times in college. However, if (as is likely) this is a spurious hypothesis, this result will most likely not be [[reproducibility|reproducible]]; any attempt to check if others with an August 7 birthday have a similar rate of changing minors will most likely get contradictory results almost immediately.

==Bias==

{{main article|Bias}}
Bias is a systematic error in the analysis. For example, doctors directed HIV patients at high cardiovascular risk to a particular HIV treatment, [[abacavir]], and lower-risk patients to other drugs, preventing a simple assessment of abacavir compared to other treatments. An analysis that did not correct for this bias unfairly penalised abacavir, since its patients were more high-risk so more of them had heart attacks.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt; This problem can be very severe, for example, in the [[observational study]].&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj02"&gt;
{{Cite journal

|pmid=12493654
|issue=7378
|pages=1437–1438}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing factors, unmeasured confounders, and loss to follow-up can also lead to bias.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;
By selecting papers with a significant [[p-value|''p''-value]], negative studies are selected against—which is the [[publication bias]]. This is also known as File Cabinet Bias, because less significant p-value results are left in the file cabinet and never published.

==Multiple modelling==

Another aspect of the conditioning of [[statistical test]]s by knowledge of the data can be seen while using the frequency of data flow in a system or machine in the data analysis [[linear regression]]. A crucial step in the process is to decide which [[covariate]]s to include in a relationship explaining one or more other variables. There are both statistical (see [[Stepwise regression]]) and substantive considerations that lead the authors to favor some of their models over others, and there is a liberal use of statistical tests. However, to discard one or more variables from an explanatory relation on the basis of the data, means one cannot validly apply standard statistical procedures to the retained variables in the relation as though nothing had happened. In the nature of the case, the retained variables have had to pass some kind of preliminary test (possibly an imprecise intuitive one) that the discarded variables failed. In 1966, Selvin and Stuart compared variables retained in the model to the fish that don't fall through the net—in the sense that their effects are bound to be bigger than those that do fall through the net. Not only does this alter the performance of all subsequent tests on the retained explanatory model—it may introduce bias and alter [[mean square error]] in estimation.&lt;ref name="Selvin"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in meteorology and epidemiology==

In [[meteorology]], hypotheses are often formulated using weather data up to the present and tested against future weather data, which ensures that, even subconsciously, future data could not influence the formulation of the hypothesis. Of course, such a discipline necessitates waiting for new data to come in, to show the formulated theory's [[predictive power]] versus the [[null hypothesis]]. This process ensures that no one can accuse the researcher of hand-tailoring the [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] to the data on hand, since the upcoming weather is not yet available.

As another example, suppose that observers note that a particular town appears to have a [[cancer cluster]], but lack a firm hypothesis of why this is so. However, they have access to a large amount of [[demographic data]] about the town and surrounding area, containing measurements for the area of hundreds or thousands of different variables, mostly uncorrelated. Even if all these variables are independent of the cancer incidence rate, it is highly likely that at least one variable correlates significantly with the cancer rate across the area. While this may suggest a hypothesis, further testing using the same variables but with data from a different location is needed to confirm. Note that a [[p-value|''p''-value]] of 0.01 suggests that 1% of the time a result at least that extreme would be obtained by chance; if hundreds or thousands of hypotheses (with mutually relatively uncorrelated independent variables) are tested, then one is likely to obtain a ''p''-value less than 0.01 for many null hypotheses.

==Remedies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Looking for patterns in data is legitimate. Applying a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical test of significance]], or hypothesis test, to the same data that a pattern emerges from is wrong. One way to construct hypotheses while avoiding data dredging is to conduct [[randomized]] [[out-of-sample test]]s. The researcher collects a data set, then randomly partitions it into two subsets, A and B. Only one subset—say, subset A—is examined for creating hypotheses. Once a hypothesis is formulated, it must be tested on subset B, which was not used to construct the hypothesis. Only where B also supports such a hypothesis is it reasonable to believe the hypothesis might be valid.  (This is a simple type of [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] and is often termed training-test or split-half validation.)

Another remedy for data dredging is to record the number of all significance tests conducted during the study and simply divide one's criterion for significance ("alpha") by this number; this is the [[Bonferroni correction]].  However, this is a very conservative metric. A family-wise alpha of 0.05, divided in this way by 1,000 to account for 1,000 significance tests, yields a very stringent per-hypothesis alpha of 0.00005. Methods particularly useful in analysis of variance, and in constructing simultaneous confidence bands for regressions involving basis functions are the [[Scheffé test|Scheffé method]] and, if the researcher has in mind only pairwise comparisons, the [[Tukey range test|Tukey method]]. The use of Benjamini and Hochberg's [[false discovery rate]] is a more sophisticated approach that has become a popular method for control of multiple hypothesis tests.

When neither approach is practical, one can make a clear distinction between data analyses that are [[Statistical hypothesis testing|confirmatory]] and analyses that are [[exploratory data analysis|exploratory]]. Statistical inference is appropriate only for the former.&lt;ref name="BerkBrownZhao" /&gt;

Ultimately, the statistical significance of a test and the statistical confidence of a finding are joint properties of data and the method used to examine the data. Thus, if someone says that a certain event has probability of 20% ± 2% 19 times out of 20, this means that if the probability of the event is estimated ''by the same method'' used to obtain the 20% estimate, the result is between 18% and 22% with probability 0.95. No claim of statistical significance can be made by only looking, without due regard to the method used to assess the data.

Academic journals increasingly shift to the [[registered report]] format, which aims to counteract very serious issues such as data dredging and [[HARKing|{{abbr|HARKing|Hypothesizing After Results are Known}}]], which have made theory-testing research very unreliable: For example, [[Nature Human Behaviour]] has adopted the registered report format, as it “shift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promoting reproducibility with registered reports|author=|date=10 January 2017|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=1|issue=1|pages=0034|doi=10.1038/s41562-016-0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[European Journal of Personality]] defines this format: “In a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ejp-blog.com/blog/2017/2/3/streamlined-review-and-registered-reports-coming-soon|title=Streamlined review and registered reports soon to be official at EJP|author=|date=|website=ejp-blog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods and results can also be made publicly available, as in the [[open science]] approach, making it yet more difficult for data dredging to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=P-Hacker Confessions: Daryl Bem and Me |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=25-27 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805142806/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/p-hacker_confessions_daryl_bem_and_me |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disarmament''' is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing [[weapons]]. Disarmament generally refers to a country's [[military]] or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of [[weapons of mass destruction]], such as [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]. General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security.”&lt;ref name="UN First Special Session on Disarmament"&gt;UN General Assembly, [https://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/SSOD/A-S-10-4.pdf Final Document of the First Special Session on Disarmament] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117222949/http://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/SSOD/A-S-10-4.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}, para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before [[World War I]] at the Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907 government delegations debated about disarmament and the creation of an international court with binding powers. The court was considered necessary because it was understood that nation-states could not disarm into a vacuum.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} After the war revulsion at the futility and tremendous cost of the war was widespread. A commonly held belief was that the cause of the war had been the escalating buildup of armaments in the previous half century among the [[great power]]s (see [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]). Although the [[Treaty of Versailles]] effectively disarmed Germany, a clause was inserted that called on all the great powers to likewise progressively disarm over a period of time. The newly formed [[League of Nations]] made this an explicit goal in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|covenant of the league]], which committed its signatories to reduce armaments ‘to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations’.

[[Image:Scrapping Battleships 1923.jpg|thumb|Battleships being dismantled for scrap in [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], after the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] imposed limits on capital ships]]
[[File:Martin Kobler addresses a ceremony.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Kobler]] addresses attendees at a disarmament ceremony in [[Goma]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]]]
One of the earliest successful achievements in disarmament was obtained with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, it prevented the continued construction of [[capital ship]]s and limited ships of other classification to under 10,000 tons displacement. The size of the three country's navies (the [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]) was set at the ratio 5-5-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marriott|first=Leo|title=Treaty Cruisers: The First International Warship Building Competition|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword|place=Barnsley|year=2005|ISBN=1-84415-188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments was set up by the League of Nations to explore possibilities for disarmament.  Proposals ranged from abolishing [[chemical warfare]] and [[strategic bombing]] to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks.  A draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by the British, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police the [[British Empire|empire]].
 
A further commission in 1926, set up to explore the possibilities for the reduction of army size, met similar difficulties, prompting the French [[Foreign Minister]] [[Aristide Briand]] and US [[Secretary of State]] [[Frank Kellogg]] to draft a treaty known as the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], which denounced war of aggression. Although there were 65 signatories to the pact, it achieved nothing, as it set out no guidelines for action in the event of a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm|title=Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928|publisher=[[Yale University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509201753/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final attempt was made at the [[Geneva Disarmament Conference]] from 1932–37, chaired by former British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Henderson]]. Germany demanded the revision of the Versailles Treaty and the granting of military parity with the other powers, while France was determined to keep Germany demilitarised for its own security. Meanwhile, the British and Americans were not willing to offer France security commitments in exchange for conciliation with Germany. The talks broke down in 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] withdrew Germany from the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations4_disarmament.htm|title= The League And Disarmament: A Story Of Failure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear disarmament===
{{Main article|Nuclear disarmament}} 
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb| [[United States]] and [[USSR]]/[[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945-2006. These numbers include warheads not actively deployed, including those on reserve status or scheduled for dismantlement. Stockpile totals do not necessarily reflect nuclear capabilities since they ignore size, range, type, and delivery mode.]]

Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapons]] and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.) ''The CND Story'', Alison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention. The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] was organised by the CND and took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.

In 1961, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] gave a speech before the UN General Assembly where he announced the US "intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved." He went on to call for a global general and complete disarmament, offering a rough outline for how this could be accomplished:
{{cquote|&lt;blockquote&gt;The program to be presented to this assembly - for general and complete disarmament under effective international control - moves to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement. It would create machinery to keep the peace as it destroys the machinery of war. It would proceed through balanced and safeguarded stages designed to give no state a military advantage over another. It would place the final responsibility for verification and control where it belongs, not with the big powers alone, not with one's adversary or one's self, but in an international organization within the framework of the United Nations. It would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament - true inspection - and apply it in stages proportionate to the stage of disarmament. It would cover delivery systems as well as weapons. It would ultimately halt their production as well as their testing, their transfer as well as their possession. It would achieve under the eyes of an international disarmament organization, a steady reduction in force, both nuclear and conventional, until it has abolished all armies and all weapons except those needed for internal order and a new United Nations Peace Force. And it starts that process now, today, even as the talks begin. In short, general and complete disarmament must no longer be a slogan, used to resist the first steps. It is no longer to be a goal without means of achieving it, without means of verifying its progress, without means of keeping the peace. It is now a realistic plan, and a test - a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/io/potusunga/207241.htm|title=Address by President John F.

==Definitions of disarmament==
In his definition of "disarmament", [[David Carlton]] writes in the Oxford University Press Political dictionary, "But confidence in such measures of arms control, especially when unaccompanied by extensive means of verification, has not been strengthened by the revelation that [[Soviet program of biological weapons|the Soviet Union in its last years successfully concealed]] consistent and systematic cheating on its obligations under the [[Biological Weapons Convention]]."  He also notes, "Now a freeze or a mutually agreed increase is not strictly speaking disarmament at all. And such measures may not even be intended to be a first step towards any kind of reduction or abolition. For the aim may simply be to promote stability in force structures. Hence a new term to cover such cases has become fashionable since the 1960s, namely, arms control."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/disarmament?cat=technology disarmament: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book by [[Seymour Melman]], ''[[Inspection for Disarmament]]'', addresses various problems related to the problem of inspection for disarmament, evasion teams, and capabilities and limitations of aerial inspection. Gradually, as the idea of arms control displaced the idea of disarmament, the weaknesses of the present arms control paradigm have created problems for the idea of disarmament itself. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

&lt;/noinclude&gt;'''Environmental niche modelling''', alternatively known as '''species distribution modelling''', '''(ecological) niche modelling''', '''predictive habitat distribution modelling''', and '''climate envelope modelling''' refers to the process of using [[computer]] [[algorithm]]s to predict the distribution of species in [[geography|geographic]] space on the basis of a mathematical representation of their known distribution in [[Natural environment|environmental]] space (= realized [[ecological niche]]). The environment is in most cases represented by climate data (such as temperature, and precipitation), but other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover can also be used. These models allow for interpolating between a limited number of species occurrence and they are used in several research areas in [[conservation biology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]].

The extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], geologic history, or [[biotic interaction]]s, that increase the difference between the [[realized niche]] and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of [[biodiversity informatics]].

== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==
Environmental niche models are in origin correlative models. Given a handful of geographically-referred observed presences of a species and climate maps, they find the most likely environmental ranges where a species lives. For these algorithms to be effective, it is required to also gather observations of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often "random background" or "pseudo-absence" data are used to fit these models. Disagreement in the literature exists over whether environmental niche models portray the [[realized niche]], which is the environments where a species '''is''' found or the [[fundamental niche]], which is where a species '''can''' be found, that is, where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival of a species. If there are incomplete records of the occurrences of a species, there is a bias introduced by pseudo-absences, or the species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitations, environmental niche models might often reflect the [[realized niche]] instead of the [[fundamental niche]].

In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic (or process-based) models assess the bio-physiological aspects of a species to generate the conditions in which the species can ideally persist, based on observations made in controlled field or laboratory studies. As such it aims at modelling the fundamental niche of the species. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=X.|author2=Thuiller|title=Comparing niche- and process-based models to reduce prediction uncertainty in species range shifts under climate change.|journal=Ecology|year=2009|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1301–13|doi=10.1890/08-0134.1|pmid=19537550}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a comparison between mechanistic and correlative models.

== Niche modelling algorithms ==
Niche modelling algorithms include "profile methods", simple statistical techniques that use e.g. environmental distance to known sites such as [http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/publications/software/anuclim/doc/bioclim.html BIOCLIM],&lt;ref name="Nix1986a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nix HA|year=1986|title=BIOCLIM — a Bioclimatic Analysis and Prediction System|journal=Research report, CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources|volume=1983–1985|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nix1986b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nix HA|editor=Longmore|title=Atlas of Elapid Snakes of Australia. Australian Flora and Fauna Series 7|publisher=Bureau of Flora and Fauna, Canberra|year=1986|pages=4–15|chapter=A biogeographic analysis of Australian elapid snakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOMAIN; "regression" (e.g. forms of generalized linear models); and "[[machine learning]]" methods such as [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy]] (MAXENT).  An incomplete list of algorithms that have been used for niche modelling includes:

===Profile techniques===
*[[BIOCLIM]]
*[[DOMAIN]]
*[[Ecological Niche Factor Analysis]] (ENFA)
*[[Mahalanobis distance]]

===Regression-based techniques===
*[[Generalized linear model]] (GLM)
*[[Generalized Additive Model]] (GAM)
*[[Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines]] (MARS)

===Machine learning techniques===
*[[MAXENT]]
*[[Artificial Neural Networks]] (ANN)
*[[Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production]] (GARP)
*[[Boosted Regression Trees]] (BRT)/Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
*[[Random Forest]] (RF)
*[[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM)

Furthermore, [[ensemble models]] can be created from several model outputs to create a model that captures components of each.  Often the mean or median value across several models is used as an ensemble.  Similarly, [[consensus models]] are models that fall closest to some measure of central tendency of all models—consensus models can be individual model runs or ensembles of several models.

== Niche modelling software ==

'''Final Utility''' is the [[utility]] of a [[good (economics)|good]] when applied to our least desirable use of it. It is the estimated utility of the last use of a supply, i.e., the least important use of that supply. For example, if a ''use'' of a good must be given up, it will logically be the ''last'' use of the good we would choose. This is because we give up the least important of our satisfactions first—which would be the uses satisfied by the last good since we satisfy our more important needs first.

For example, if we lost a unit of a good, the ''[[value (economics)|value]]'' of the loss would be the value of the least important use of the good. This last good, which represents its final utility, was being applied to our least important wants. In the case of the lost good, it is replaced and the value to which we can assign the loss is not the value of the first most important use of the good, but the least important—what we call the final utility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Böhm-Bawerk]], Eugen von. "The Law of Final Utility - Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk - Mises Daily ." The Ludwig von Mises Institute . http://mises.org/daily/4637 (accessed April 29, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the law of [[marginal utility]], the value of each good in a stock of identical goods is [[utility]] of the last and most easily dispensable unit.&lt;ref&gt;von Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen, trans. George Reisman. "Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk’s “Value, Cost, and Marginal Utility”." Ludwig von Mises Institute. mises.org/pdf/asc/2002/asc8-reisman.pdf (accessed April 30, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; That is why price is said to be determined by supply and demand: the price reflects the (approximate and average) value of the good, but most closely reflects the value of the last use. If there is a shortage of supply, the good will cease being applied to its least important uses. All else being equal, the price will increase and the increase in price represents, so to speak, the value we attribute to the ''new'' last use. Before, with a larger supply, the last use was of less value to us. With a smaller supply the value of the last use is necessarily more important because we always satisfy our more important wants first. Therefore, the increase in price can be seen as a reflection of the increase in value we attribute to the last use of the supply.

[[Ludwig von Mises]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When face with the problem of the value to be attached to one unit of a homogeneous supply, man decides on the basis of the value of the least important use he makes of the units of the whole supply; he decides on the basis of marginal utility."&lt;ref name="humanaction_ch7sec1"&gt;[[Ludwig von Mises]]. [http://mises.org/humanaction/chap7sec1.asp VII. Action Within The World], 1. The Law of Marginal Utility, ''[[Human Action]]'', online version, referenced 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Example==

If a hurricane struck Florida and there was a shortage of water, everything else equal, the [[price]] of bottled water would increase. Water in Florida, before this [[shortage]], was used for drinking water, cooking, watering plants, and bathing. With the tap off, the price of bottled water has increased to such an extent that bottled water will surely not be purchased for watering plants or bathing. That is, the increase in price reflects the increase in the value we attribute to the last use of the last unit in the [[supply (economics)|supply]] of the [[good (economics)|good]]. To explain, before the hurricane, water was valued according to the fact that it would be used for bathing and watering plants. Now, with a shortage, it is valued according to its ability to quench thirst and cook food. The latter uses importance is "approximated" in the price of the good. The bottled water which now costs, say, $20 a bottle, is an approximation of the [[value (economics)|value]] attribute to drinking water, cooking water, and whatever else it might be used for at the higher price—given that previous uses are not considered due to the shortage of supply and its corollary, the increase in price. That is why it is said that a homogeneous stock of goods is valued according to its final utility—according to its last use of a stock of a good.

A supply of a good will be applied to most important wants first and least important wants last. When there is a shortage, all else being equal, the price increases. The smaller supply is being used for the most important wants, but is not being used for the least important wants. In this sense, we can say the increase in price represents the increase in value which the last unit of the supply is filling. Before water cost very little and was used for washing and watering plants. Now, since there is not enough for washing and watering plants and it is instead being used exclusively to drink and cook—the value we attribute to those activities is, in a sense, communicated through the higher price. The price reflects that importance of the last use of a supply—and in this case the supply was truncated to only allow for the more important uses.

Final utility is the logical conclusion of [[marginal utility]] and a corner stone of [[price]] theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3872">A '''gift registry''' is a particular type of wish list in Western countries....

==Description==
Typically, when a recipient compiles a list of items they wish to receive and then distributes it to family and friends, they have created a wish list. A registry, on the other hand, is made public, and the retailer or registry system provider removes items from the list as they are purchased.{{cn|date=August 2015}}  Registry managers will often not divulge who has purchased the registered items.{{cn|date=August 2015}} In the [[United Kingdom]], a gift registry is frequently referred to as a '''"gift list"''' and has become an established part of British weddings,  with the service often provided by most [[department stores]].&lt;ref name = "Gift Lists in UK"&gt;{{cite news | title = Royal wedding: What's the point of a gift list? | date = 2011-04-27 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13003916 | work = bbc.co.uk | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Retailer-specific versus multiple retailers==
Traditionally, registries were limited to the stock of a given retailer, which maintained the list for the registrant and ensured that items were removed from the list as they were purchased. 

However, online gift registries that are not specific to any retailer have become an increasingly popular alternative to retailer-specific registries, as the former offers more flexible means of adding gifts and coordinating purchases, as well as social networking capabilities. In 2004, North American [[shopping center]]s (notably [[Galleria Edina]]) began to extend this concept by offering registries that had access to multiple shops within individual centers.&lt;ref name=icsc1&gt;{{cite news | title = MALL LANDLORDS TEST CENTERWIDE GIFT REGISTRATION | date = 2004-05-01 | url = http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct0504/page232.php | work = icsc.org | accessdate = 2011-08-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110518205508/http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct0504/page232.php | archivedate = 2011-05-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals ==
A managed registry system has several goals:
#It facilitates communication between gift givers and receivers. Recipients can compile a gift registry and make it available to anyone who will present them with a gift. Gift givers can then be certain they are purchasing items the receiver will appreciate.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#An efficiently-managed registry can prevent gift givers from giving duplicating gifts. To accomplish this, the retailer should remove each item from the registry as it is purchased.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#The registry process should allow gift purchasers to be discreet about what they have bought. This is so the gift's recipient will not know who purchased which items until they are surprised at the time of gift giving.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#The registry system should benefit the retailer by bringing customers to their store or website, to purchase products the merchant carries.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#The store is often able to deliver all of the gifts to the recipients at a mutually convenient time before or after the event, for the convenience of both the givers and the recipient.

==Examples==
Gift registries are often used for a variety of occasions, such as [[anniversaries]], [[baby shower]]s, [[birthdays]], civil ceremonies, [[graduation]]s, and [[Housewarming party|housewarming parties]].{{cn|date=August 2015}} 
* For example, engaged couples use a [[bridal registry]] to indicate the pattern(s) and item(s) they desire for such product lines as china and silverware, so gift-givers will know which items to buy as wedding gifts.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* Similarly, those purchasing a new home may register the furniture and domestic items, such as appliances, they desire for their [[Housewarming party|housewarming]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">The '''Grit, not grass hypothesis''' is an evolutionary hypothesis that explains the evolution of high-crowned teeth, particularly in New World mammals. The hypothesis is that the ingestion of gritty [[soil]] is the primary driver of [[hypsodont]] tooth development, not the [[silica]]-rich composition of [[grass]], as was previously thought.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jardine|first1=Phillip E.|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Sahney|first3=Sarda|last4=Benton|first4=Michael J.|authorlink4 = Michael Benton|title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2012|volume=365-366|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Coevolution Hypothesis==
Since the morphology of the hypsodont tooth is suited to a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of [[grasslands]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]] which began to recede during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (abrasive granules), which wear away dental tissue more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Modern Evolutionary Hypothesis==
===Early Evidence===
In 2006 Strömberg examined the independent acquisition of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in several ungulate lineages (e.g., [[camelid]]s, [[equid]]s, rhinoceroses) from the early to middle Miocene of North America, which had been classically linked to the spread of grasslands She showed habitats dominated by [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 grasses]] (cool-season grasses) were established in the [[Central Great Plains]] by early late [[Arikareean]] (≥21.9 Million years ago), at least 4 million years prior to the emergence of hypsodonty in [[Equidae]].&lt;ref name="Stromberg2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Caroline A. E. Strömberg | year=2006 | title=Evolution of hypsodonty in equids: testing a hypothesis of adaptation | journal=Paleobiology | volume=32 | pages=236–258|url=http://depts.washington.edu/strmbrgl/StrombergLab_website/Publications_files/Stromberg_2006.pdf | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2006)32[236:eohiet]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Mendoza and Palmqvist determined the relative importance of grass consumption and open habitat foraging in the development of hypsodont teeth using a dataset of 134 species of [[artiodactyl]]s and [[perissodactyl]]s. The results suggested that high-crowned teeth represent are adapted for a particular feeding environment, not diet preference. &lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=M.|last2=Palmqvist|first2=P.|title=Hypsodonty in ungulates: an adaptation for grass consumption or for foraging in open habitat?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=February 2008|volume=274|issue=2|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00365.x|url=http://webpersonal.uma.es/de/ppb/Hypsodonty%20in%20ungulates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Further, examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes.&lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"&gt;{{Citation | author=Billet, Blondel, and Muizon | title=Dental microwear analysis of notoungulates (Mammalia) from Salla (Late Oligocene, Bolivia) and discussion on their precocious hypsodonty| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of dental microwear patterns of hypsodont [[notoungulates]] from the Late Oligocene Salla Beds of Bolivia showed shearing movements are associated with a diet rich in tough plants, not necessarily grasses. That the relationship between high-crowned mammals and the source of tooth wear in the fossil record may not be straightforward, hence the spread of grasslands in South America, traditionally linked with the development of notoungulate hypsodonty, is in question.&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009" /&gt;

Observations of hypsodonty development in Cenozoic mammals is also supported by the evolution of hypsodonty in other groups. For example, [[hadrosaurs]], a group of herbivorous [[dinosaurs]], likely grazed on low-lying vegetation and microwear patterns show that their diet contained an abrasive material, such as grit or silica. Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous, but were not particularly common, so this study concluded that grass probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet.&lt;ref name="AP0629"&gt;{{Citation  |title=Hadrosaur chowdown — grind, grind, grind |journal=Associated Press | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal Discontinuity===
Most importantly, evidence has shown, that the development of hypsodonty is out of sync with the flourishing of grasslands both in North America and South America, where grasslands spread 10 millions years earlier.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"/&gt;

==Hypsodonty==
Hypsodonty is observed both in the fossil record and the modern world. It is a characteristic of large [[clades]] (equids) as well as subspecies level specialization. For example, the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and the [[Javan rhinoceros]] both have [[brachydont]], lophodont cheek teeth whereas the [[Indian rhinoceros]], has hypsodont dentition. A mammal may have exclusively hypsodont molars or have a mix of dentitions. Hypsodont dentition is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John J.|last2=Wyss|first2=André R.|last3=Charrier|first3=Reynaldo|author-link3=Reynaldo Charrier|title=South America's Missing Mammals|journal=Scientific American|date=May 2007|volume=296|issue=5|pages=68–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-68|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n5/full/scientificamerican0507-68.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwan-Tufts"&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68114">{{Race}} 
The concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] as a rough division of [[anatomically modern human]]s (''Homo sapiens'') has a long and complicated history. The word ''race'' itself is modern and was used in the sense of "[[nation]], [[ethnic group]]" during the 16th to 19th century, and only acquired its modern meaning in the field of [[physical anthropology]] from the mid 19th century. The politicization of the field under the concept of [[racism]] in the 20th century led to a decline in racial studies during the 1930s to 1980s, culminating in a [[poststructuralist]] [[deconstruction]] of [[Race and society|race as a social construct]].

==Etymology==
The word "race", interpreted to mean an identifiable group of people who share a [[common descent]], was introduced into [[English language|English]] in about 1580, from the Old French ''{{wiktfra|rasse}}'' (1512), from Italian ''{{wiktita|razza}}''{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. An earlier but etymologically distinct word for a similar concept was the Latin word ''{{wiktlat|genus}}'' meaning a group sharing qualities related to birth, descent, origin, race, stock, or family; this Latin word is [[cognate]] with the Greek words "genos", ({{wiktell|γένος}}) meaning "race or kind", and "gonos", which has meanings related to "birth, offspring, stock ...".&lt;ref name=OEDHarper&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=genus | title= Online Etymology Dictionary | work= genus | publisher= Douglas Harper | accessdate = March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
In many ancient civilizations, individuals with widely varying physical appearances became full members of a [[society]] by growing up within that society or by adopting that society's [[culture|cultural]] [[norm (sociology)|norms]]. (Snowden 1983; Lewis 1990).

[[Classical civilization]]s from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] to [[History of China#Ancient China|China]] tended to invest the most importance in [[family|familial]] or tribal affiliation than an individual's physical appearance (Dikötter 1992; Goldenberg 2003){{Citation needed|reason=references given do not appear in the bibliography|date=February 2018}}. Societies still tended to equate physical characteristics, such as hair and eye colour, with psychological and moral qualities, usually assigning the highest qualities to their own people and lower qualities to the "Other", either lower classes or outsiders to their society. For example, an historian of the 3rd century [[Han Dynasty]] in the territory of present-day China describes [[barbarian]]s of blond hair and green eyes as resembling "the monkeys from which they are descended".&lt;ref name=Gossett&gt;Gossett, Thomas F. New Edition, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-509778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Gossett, pp.&amp;nbsp;4).

Dominant in ancient Greek and Roman conceptions of human diversity was the thesis that physical differences between different populations could be attributed to environmental factors. Though ancient peoples likely had no knowledge of evolutionary theory or genetic variability, their concepts of race could be described as malleable. Chief among environmental causes for physical difference in the ancient period were climate and geography. Though thinkers in ancient civilizations recognized differences in physical characteristics between different populations, the general consensus was that all non-Greeks were barbarians. This barbarian status, however, was not thought to be fixed; rather, one could shed the 'barbarian' status simply by adopting Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44066982|title=The Emperor's new clothes : biological theories of race at the millennium|last=1955-|first=Graves, Joseph L.,|date=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813533025|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=44066982}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Graves 2001)

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Hippocrates rubens.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Hippocrates of Cos]].]]
[[Hippocrates of Cos]] believed, as many thinkers throughout early history did, that factors such as geography and climate played a significant role in the physical appearance of different peoples. He writes, "the forms and dispositions of mankind correspond with the nature of the country". He attributed physical and temperamental differences among different peoples to environmental factors such as climate, water sources, elevation and terrain. He noted that temperate climates created peoples who were "sluggish" and "not apt for labor", while extreme climates led to peoples who were "sharp", "industrious" and "vigilant". He also noted that peoples of "mountainous, rugged, elevated, and well-watered" countries displayed "enterprising" and "warlike" characteristics, while peoples of "level, windy, and well-watered" countries were "unmanly" and "gentle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.24.24.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - On Airs, Waters, and Places by Hippocrates|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] factored in the constitutions, laws, capacities, and character of peoples:

{{quote|"Come, tell me why it is that the Celts and the Germans are fierce, while the Hellenes and Romans are, generally speaking, inclined to political life and humane, though at the same time unyielding and warlike? Why the Egyptians are more intelligent and more given to crafts, and the Syrians unwarlike and effeminate, but at the same time intelligent, hot-tempered, vain and quick to learn? For if there is anyone who does not discern a reason for these differences among the nations, but rather declaims that all this so befell spontaneously, how, I ask, can he still believe that the universe is administered by a providence?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_galileans_1_text.htm "Against the Galilaeans"] Book I, translated by Wilmer Cave Wright, PH.D.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Middle Ages===
European [[medieval]] models of race generally mixed [[Graeco-Roman|Classical]] ideas with the notion that humanity as a whole was descended from [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Japheth]], the three [[sons of Noah]], producing distinct [[Semitic people|Semitic]] ([[Asia]]tic), [[Hamitic]] ([[Africa]]n), and [[Japhetites|Japhetic]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) peoples. This theory dates back to the Babylonian ''[[Talmud]]'', which states, "the descendants of Ham are cursed by being [[Black people|black]], and [it] depicts Ham as a sinful man and his progeny as degenerates."

In the 9th century, [[Al-Jahiz]], an [[Afro-Arab]] [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], attempted to explain the origins of different [[human skin color]]s, particularly [[Black people|black skin]], which he believed to be the result of the environment. He cited a stony region of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] as evidence for his theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence I. Conrad (1982), "Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'' '''25''' (3): 268–307 [278]:"[It] is so unusual that its gazelles and ostriches, its insects and flies, its foxes, sheep and asses, its horses and its birds are all black. Blackness and whiteness are in fact caused by the properties of the region, as well as by the God-given nature of water and soil and by the proximity or remoteness of the sun and the intensity or mildness of its heat."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, the [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Islamic sociologist]] [[Ibn Khaldun]], dispelled the Babylonian ''Talmud'''s account of peoples and their characteristics as a myth. He wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and not due to the descendants of Ham being cursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title='Race', slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco|first=Chouki|last=El Hamel|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=7|issue=3|year=2002|pages=29–52 [39–42]|doi=10.1080/13629380208718472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of Ibn Kaldun's work, the question of whether skin colour is heritable or a product of the environment is raised in 17th to 18th century European anthropology. 
[[Georgius Hornius]] (1666) inherits the rabbinical view of heritability, while [[François Bernier]] (1684) argues for at least partial influence of the environment. 
Ibn Khaldun's work was later{{year needed|date=March 2018}} translated into French, especially for use in Algeria, but in the process, the work was "transformed from local knowledge to colonial categories of knowledge"{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--what does this even mean? whose opinion and/or terminology are we citing?--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hannoum"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3590803 Abdelmajid Hannoum, "Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist"], ''History and Theory'', Vol. 42, Feb 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Desborough Cooley]]'1s ''The Negro Land of the Arabs Examined and Explained'' (1841) has excerpts of translations of Khaldun's work that were not affected by French colonial ideas.&lt;ref name="Cooley" /&gt; For example, Cooley quotes Khaldun's describing the great African civilization of Ghana (in Cooley's translation):

:"When the conquest of the West (by the Arabs) was completed, and merchants began to penetrate into the interior, they saw no nation of the Blacks so mighty as Ghánah, the dominions of which extended westward as far as the Ocean. The King's court was kept in the city of Ghánah, which, according to the author of the 'Book of Roger' (El Idrisi), and the author of the 'Book of Roads and Realms' (El Bekri), is divided into two parts, standing on both banks of the Nile, and ranks among the largest and most populous cities of the world.
:The people of Ghánah had for neighbours, on the east, a nation, which, according to historians, was called Súsú; after which came another named Máli; and after that another known by the name of Kaǘkaǘ; although some people prefer a different orthography, and write this name Kághó. The last-named nation was followed by a people called Tekrúr. The people of Ghánah declined in course of time, being overwhelmed or absorbed by the Molaththemún (or muffled people; that is, the Morabites), who, adjoining them on the north towards the [[Berber people|Berber]] country, attacked them, and, taking possession of their territory, compelled them to embrace the [[Mohammedan]] religion. The people of Ghánah, being invaded at a later period by the Súsú, a nation of Blacks in their neighbourhood, were exterminated, or mixed with other Black nations." &lt;ref name="Cooley"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6swTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 William Desborough Cooley, ''The Negro Land of the Arabs Examined and Explained''], London: J. Arrowsmith, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Khaldun suggests a link between the rise of the Almoravids and the decline of Ghana. But, historians have found virtually no evidence for an Almoravid conquest of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~amcdouga/Hist446/readings/conquest_in_west_african_historiography.pdf Pekka Masonen, ''Not Quite Venus from the Waves: The Almoravid Conquest of Ghana in the Modern Historiography of Western Africa''], Humphrey J. Fisher, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Conrad and Humphrey Fisher, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3171598 "The Conquest That Never Was: Ghana and the Almoravids, 1076, Vol. I: The External Arabic Sources"], ''History of Africa'', Vol. 9 (1982), African Studies Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern period==
Scientists who were interested in natural history, including biological and geological scientists, were known as "[[naturalists]]". They would collect, examine, describe, and arrange data from their explorations into categories according to certain criteria. People who were particularly skilled at organizing specific sets of data in a logically and comprehensive fashion were known as classifiers and systematists. This process was a new trend in science that served to help answer fundamental questions by collecting and organizing materials for systematic study, also known as [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"&gt;Smedley, Audrey. Race in North America: Origin and Evolution of a Worldview. Boulder: Westview Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the study of natural history grew, so did society's effort to classify human groups. Some zoologists and scientists wondered what made humans different from animals in the primate family. Furthermore, they contemplated whether homo sapiens should be classified as one species with multiple varieties or separate species. In the 16th and 17th century, scientists attempted to classify ''Homo sapiens'' based on a geographic arrangement of human populations based on skin color, others simply on geographic location, shape, stature, food habits, and other distinguishing characteristics. Occasionally the term "race" was used but most of the early taxonomist used classificatory terms such as "peoples", "nations", "types", "varieties", and "species".

Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548–1600) and [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), French philosopher, attempted a rudimentary geographic arrangement of known human populations based on skin color. Bodin's color classifications were purely descriptive, including neutral terms such as "duskish colour, like roasted quinze", "black", "chestnut", and "farish white".&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"/&gt;

===17th century===
German and English scientists, [[Bernhard Varen]] (1622–1650) and [[John Ray]] (1627–1705) classified human populations into categories according to stature, shape, food habits, and skin color, along with any other distinguishing characteristics.&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"/&gt;
Ray was also the first person to produce a biological definition of [[species]].

[[François Bernier]] (1625–1688) is believed to have developed the first comprehensive classification of humans into distinct races which was published in a French journal article in 1684, ''Nouvelle division de la terre par les différentes espèces ou races l'habitant'', New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it. (Gossett, 1997:32–33). Bernier advocated using the "four quarters" of the globe as the basis for providing labels for human differences.&lt;ref name="Smedley, Audrey 1999"/&gt; The four subgroups that Bernier used were Europeans, Far Easterners, Negroes (blacks), and Lapps.&lt;ref name="C. Loring, Brace 2005"&gt;C. Loring, Brace. ''"Race" is a Four-Letter Word: the Genesis of the Concept''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
{{see also|Scientific Racism#Origins of scientific racism}}
As noted earlier, scientists attempted to classify ''Homo sapiens'' based on a geographic arrangement of human populations. Some based their hypothetical divisions of race on the most obvious physical differences, like skin color, while others used geographic location, shape, stature, food habits, and other distinguishing characteristics to delineate between races. However, [[Cultural relativism|cultural notions]] of racial and gender superiority tainted early scientific discovery. In the 18th century, scientists began to include behavioral or psychological traits in their reported observations—which traits often had derogatory or demeaning implications—and researchers often assumed that those traits were related to their race, and therefore, innate and unchangeable. Other areas of interest were to determine the exact number of races, categorize and name them, and examine the primary and secondary causes of variation between groups.

The [[Great Chain of Being]], a medieval idea that there was a hierarchical structure of life from the most fundamental elements to the most perfect, began to encroach upon the idea of race. As taxonomy grew, scientists began to assume that the human species could be divided into distinct subgroups. One's "race" necessarily implied that one group had certain character qualities and physical dispositions that differentiated it from other human populations. Society assigned different values to those differentiations, as well as other, more trivial traits (a man with a strong chin was assumed to possess a stronger character than men with weaker chins). This essentially created a gap between races by deeming one race superior or inferior to another race, thus creating a hierarchy of races. In this way, science was used as justification for unfair treatment of different human populations.

The systematization of race concepts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period brought with it the conflict between [[monogenism]] (a single origin for all human races) and [[polygenism]] (the hypothesis that races had separate origins). This debate was originally cast in [[creationist]] terms as a question of one versus many creations of humanity, but continued after [[evolution]] was widely accepted, at which point the question was given in terms of whether humans had split from their ancestral species one or many times.

====Johann Friedrich Blumenbach====
[[File:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]
[[File:Blumenbach's five races.JPG|thumb|right|Blumenbach's five [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]].]]
[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] (1752–1840) divided the human [[species]] into five [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in 1779, later founded on crania research (description of human skulls), and called them (1793/1795):&lt;ref&gt;Blumenbach, J. F. 1779. ''Handbuch der Naturgeschichte'' vol. 1, pp. 63f. The names of Blumenbach's five groups are introduced in his 1795 revision of ''De generis humani varietate nativa'' (pp. 23f.) as ''Caucasiae, Mongolicae, Aethiopicae, Americanae, Malaicae''. 
see also: Kowner and Skott in: R. Kowner, W. Demel (eds.), ''Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Interactions, Nationalism, Gender and Lineage'' (2015), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Caucasian race]]
* the [[Mongoloid|Mongolian race]]
* the [[Negroid|Aethiopian race]]
* the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American race]]
* the [[Malay race|Malayan race]]

Blumenbach's classification of the Mongolian race included all [[East Asian]]s and some [[Central Asian]]s as well as the Inuit (Eskimos) of the American arctic, excluding  peoples of Southeast Asian islands and Pacific Islanders, which were categorized in a separate Malayan race. Blumenbach's American race comprised most peoples of the Americas (excepting the polar region) and of the Caribbean.

Blumenbach argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., were depended on geography and nutrition and custom.
Blumenbach's work included his description of sixty [[Human cranium|human crania]] (skulls) published originally in fascicules as ''Decas craniorum'' (Göttingen, 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists in the field of [[craniometry]].

Further anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other individual Africans as Europeans differ from Europeans'. Furthermore, he concluded that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities'.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hitt, "Mighty White of You: Racial Preferences Color America's Oldest Skulls and Bones", ''Harper's'', July 2005, pp. 39–55&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Finally, I am of opinion that after all these numerous instances I have brought together of negroes of capacity, it would not be difficult to mention entire well-known provinces of Europe, from out of which you would not easily expect to obtain off-hand such good authors, poets, philosophers, and correspondents of the Paris Academy; and on the other hand, there is no so-called savage nation known under the sun which has so much distinguished itself by such examples of perfectibility and original capacity for scientific culture, and thereby attached itself so closely to the most civilized nations of the earth, as the Negro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9QKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA312#PPA312|title=The Anthropological Treatises of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach ...|first1=Johann Friedrich|last1=Blumenbach|first2=Thomas|last2=Bendyshe|date=26 October 1865|publisher=Anthropological Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These five groups saw some continuity in the various classification schemes of the 19th century, in some cases augmented, e.g. by the [[Australoid race]]&lt;ref&gt;subsumed under "Aethiopian" ("black") by Blumenbach; introduced by [[Thomas Huxley]], ''On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind'' (1870).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Capoid race]]&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Coon, ''[[The Origin of Races]]'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases the Mongolian (East Asian) and American collapsed into a single group.

==Racial anthropology (1850–1930)==
{{Main|racial anthropology}}
{{further|biological anthropology}}
Among the 19th century naturalists who defined the field were [[Georges Cuvier]], [[James Cowles Pritchard]], [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]] (''Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution'', 1848). Cuvier enumerated three races, Pritchard seven, Agassiz twelve, and Pickering eleven.

The 19th century saw attempts to change race from a taxonomic to a biological concept. For example, using [[anthropometrics]], invented by Francis Galton and [[Alphonse Bertillon]], they measured the shapes and sizes of skulls and related the results to group differences in intelligence or other attributes (Lieberman 2001).

These scientists made three claims about race: first, that races are objective, naturally occurring divisions of humanity; second, that there is a strong relationship between biological races and other human phenomena (such as [[forms of activity and interpersonal relations]] and culture, and by extension the relative [[materialism|material success]] of cultures), thus biologizing the notion of "race", as Foucault demonstrated in his historical analysis; third, that race is therefore a valid scientific category{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} that can be used to explain and predict individual and group behavior. Races were distinguished by [[human skin color|skin color]], [[facial type]], [[Human cranium|cranial]] profile and size, texture and color of hair. Moreover, races were almost universally considered to reflect group differences in moral character and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

Stefan Kuhl wrote that the [[eugenics]] movement rejected the racial and national hypotheses of [[Arthur Gobineau]] and his writing ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]''. According to Kuhl, the eugenicists believed that nations were political and cultural constructs, not race constructs, because nations were the result of race mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Springer | title=For the Betterment of the Race: The Rise and Fall of the International Movement for Eugenics and Racial Hygiene | author=Stefan Kühl| date=2013 | isbn=9781137286123 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=4T4hAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=An+Essay+on+the+Inequality+of+the+Human+Races+eugenics#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Essay%20on%20the%20Inequality%20of%20the%20Human%20Races%20eugenics&amp;f=false | access-date=June 9, 2016 | quote=Eugenicist were clear that nations were political and cultural constructs, not race constructs. In this, they consciously turned away from the race theory of Arthur de Gobineau, who in an essay on the "Inequality of the Human Races", had claimed that a people's cultural assets and its ability to develop historically were determined by a people's "race substance". According to Gobineau, every "nation" is therefore the result of racially determined abilities and lack of abilities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vacher de Lapouge]]'s "anthroposociology", asserted as self-evident the biological inferiority of particular groups (Kevles 1985). In many parts of the world, the idea of race became a way of rigidly dividing groups by culture as well as by physical appearances (Hannaford 1996). Campaigns of oppression and [[genocide]] were often motivated by supposed racial differences (Horowitz 2001{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}).

During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the tension between some who believed in hierarchy and innate superiority, and others who believed in human equality, was at a paramount. The former continued to exacerbate the belief that certain races were innately inferior by examining their shortcomings, namely by examining and testing intelligence between groups. Some scientists claimed that there was a [[biological]] determinant of race by evaluating one's [[genes]] and [[DNA]]. Different methods of eugenics, the study and practice of human selective breeding often with a race as a primary concentration, was still widely accepted in Britain, Germany, and the United States.&lt;ref name="Sarich, Vincent 2004"&gt;Sarich, Vincent, and Miele Frank. Race: the Reality of Human Differences. Boulder: Westview Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many scientists understood race as a [[social construct]]. They believed that the [[phenotypical]] expression of an individual were determined by one's genes that are inherited through reproduction but there were certain social constructs, such as [[culture]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], and [[language]] that were primary in shaping behavioral characteristics. Some advocated that race 'should centre not on what race explains about society, but rather on the questions of who, why and with what effect social significance is attached to racial attributes that are constructed in particular political and socio-economic contexts', and thus, addressing the "folk" or "mythological representations" of race.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Les, and Solomos John. Theories of Race and  Racism: A Reader. New York: Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis Agassiz's racial definitions===
After [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807–1873) traveled to the United States, he became a prolific writer in what has been later termed the genre of scientific racism. Agassiz was specifically a believer and advocate in [[polygenism]], that races came from separate origins (specifically separate creations), were endowed with unequal attributes, and could be classified into specific climatic zones, in the same way he felt other animals and plants could be classified.

These included Western American Temperate (the indigenous peoples west of the Rockies); Eastern American Temperate (east of the Rockies); Tropical Asiatic (south of the Himalayas); Temperate Asiatic (east of the Urals and north of the Himalayas); South American Temperate (South America); New Holland (Australia); Arctic (Alaska and Arctic Canada); Cape of Good Hope (South Africa); and American Tropical (Central America and the West Indies).

Agassiz denied that species originated in single pairs, whether at a single location or at many. He argued instead multiple individuals in each species were created at the same time and then distributed throughout the continents where God meant for them to dwell. His lectures on polygenism were popular among the slaveholders in the South, for many this opinion legitimized the belief in a lower standard of the Negro.

His stance in this case was considered to be quite radical in its time, because it went against the more orthodox and standard reading of the Bible in his time which implied all human stock descended from a single couple (Adam and Eve), and in his defense Agassiz often used what now sounds like a very "modern" argument about the need for independence between science and religion; though Agassiz, unlike many polygeneticists, maintained his religious beliefs and was not anti-Biblical in general.

In the context of ethnology and anthropology of the mid-19th century, Agassiz's polygenetic views became explicitly seen as opposing Darwin's views on race, which sought to show the common origin of all human races and the superficiality of racial differences. Darwin's second book on evolution, The Descent of Man, features extensive argumentation addressing the single origin of the races, at times explicitly opposing Agassiz's theories.

===Arthur de Gobineau===
[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|Gobineau in 1876]]
[[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882) was a successful diplomat for the [[French Second Empire]]. Initially he was posted to Persia, before working in Brazil and other countries. He came to believe that race created culture, arguing that distinctions between the three "black", "white", and "yellow" races were natural barriers, and that "race-mixing" breaks those barriers and leads to chaos. He classified the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, and southern France as racially mixed.

Gobineau believed the white race was superior to the others. He thought it corresponded to the ancient Indo-European culture, also known as "[[Aryan]]". Gobineau originally wrote that white race miscegenation was inevitable. He attributed much of the economic turmoils in France to pollution of races. Later on in his life, he altered his opinion to believe that the white race could be saved.

To Gobineau, the development of empires was ultimately destructive to the "superior races" that created them, since they led to the mixing of distinct races. This he saw as a degenerative process.

According to his definitions, the people of Spain, most of France, most of Germany, southern and western Iran as well as Switzerland, Austria, northern Italy, and a large part of Britain, consisted of a degenerative race arising from miscegenation. Also according to him, the whole of north India consisted of a yellow race.

Huxley states: 'It is to the Xanthochroi and Melanochroi, taken together, that the absurd denomination of "Caucasian" is usually applied'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley, T. H.]] [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html "On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind"] (1870) ''Journal of the Ethnological Society of London''&lt;/ref&gt; He also indicates that he has omitted certain areas with complex ethnic compositions that do not fit into his racial paradigm, including much of the Horn of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Huxley1873/&gt; Huxley's Melanochroi eventually comprised various other dark Caucasoid populations, including the Hamites and Moors.&lt;ref name="JWGregory"/&gt;]]

[[Thomas Huxley]] (1825 –1895) wrote one paper, "On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind" (1870), in which he proposed a distinction within the human species ('races'), and their distribution across the earth. He also acknowledged that certain geographical areas with more complex ethnic compositions, including much of the Horn of Africa and the India subcontinent, did not fit into his racial paradigm. As such, he noted that: "I have purposely omitted such people as the Abyssinians and the Hindoos, who there is every reason to believe result from the intermixture of distinct stocks."&lt;ref name=Huxley1873&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Thomas|title=Critiques and Addresses by Thomas Henry Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S|year=1873|publisher=Macmillan and Company|page=153|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=V8cArGfZfNgC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late nineteenth century, Huxley's Xanthochroi group had been redefined as the [[Nordic race]], whereas his Melanochroi became the [[Mediterranean race]]. His Melanochroi thus eventually also comprised various other dark Caucasoid populations, including the [[Hamitic|Hamites]] (e.g. Berbers, Somalis, northern Sudanese, ancient Egyptians) and [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="JWGregory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=John Walter|title=Race as a Political Factor|date=1931|publisher=Watts &amp; Company|page=19|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=uU8oAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's paper was rejected by the [[Royal Society]], and this became one of the many theories to be advanced and dropped by the early exponents of [[evolution]].

Despite rejection by Huxley and the science community, the paper is sometimes cited in support of racialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Di Gregorio | first=Mario A | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=T.H. Huxley's place in natural science | publisher= | year=1984 | location=New Haven | pages= | url= | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Darwin, Huxley was a monogenist, the belief that all humans are part of the same species, with morphological variations emerging out of an initial uniformity. (Stepan, p.&amp;nbsp;44). This view contrasts polygenism, the theory that each race is actually a separate species with separate sites of origin.

Despite Huxley's monogenism and his abolitionism on ethical grounds, Huxley assumed a hierarchy of innate abilities, a stance evinced in papers such as "Emancipation Black and White" and his most famous paper, "Evolution and Ethics".

In the former, he writes that the "highest places in the hierarchy of civilization will assuredly not be within the reach of our dusky cousins, though it is by no means necessary that they should be restricted to the lowest". (Stepan, p.&amp;nbsp;79–80).

===Charles Darwin and race===
Though [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theory was set forth in 1859 upon publication of ''On the Origin of Species'', this work was largely absent of explicit reference to Darwin’s theory applied to man. This application by Darwin would not become explicit until 1871 with the publication of his second great book on evolution, ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''.

Darwin's publication of this book occurred within the heated debates between advocates of monogeny, who held that all races came from a common ancestor, and advocates of polygeny, who held that the races were separately created. Darwin, who had come from a family with strong abolitionist ties, had experienced and was disturbed by cultures of slavery during his voyage on the Beagle years earlier. Noted Darwin biographers [[Adrian Desmond]] and [[James Moore (biographer)|James Moore]] argue that Darwin's writings on evolution were not only influenced by his abolitionist tendencies, but also his belief that non-white races were equal in regard to their intellectual capacity as white races, a belief which had been strongly disputed by scientists such as Morton, Agassiz and Broca, all noted polygenists.

By the late 1860s, however, Darwin's theory of evolution had been thought to be compatible with the polygenist thesis (Stepan 1982). Darwin thus used ''Descent of Man'' to disprove the polygenist thesis and end the debate between polygeny and monogeny once and for all. Darwin also used it to disprove other hypotheses about racial difference that had persisted since the time of ancient Greece, for example, that differences in skin color and body constitution occurred because of differences of geography and climate.

Darwin concluded, for example, that the biological similarities between the different races were "too great" for the polygenist thesis to be plausible. He also used the idea of races to argue for the continuity between humans and animals, noting that it would be highly implausible that man should, by mere accident acquire characteristics shared by many apes.

Darwin sought to demonstrate that the physical characteristics that were being used to define race for centuries (i.e. skin color and facial features) were superficial and had no utility for survival. Because, according to Darwin, any characteristic that did not have survival value could not have been naturally selected, he devised another hypothesis for the development and persistence of these characteristics. The mechanism Darwin developed is known as [[sexual selection]].

Though the idea of sexual selection had appeared in earlier works by Darwin, it was not until the late 1860s when it received full consideration (Stepan 1982). Furthermore, it was not until 1914 that sexual selection received serious consideration as a racial theory by naturalist thinkers.

Darwin defined sexual selection as the "struggle between individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex". Sexual selection consisted of two types for Darwin: 1.) The physical struggle for a mate, and 2.) The preference for some color or another, typically by females of a given species. Darwin asserted that the differing human races (insofar as race was conceived phenotypically) had arbitrary standards of ideal beauty, and that these standards reflected important physical characteristics sought in mates.

Broadly speaking, Darwin's attitudes of what race was and how it developed in the human species are attributable to two assertions, 1.) That all human beings, regardless of race share a single, common ancestor and 2.) Phenotypic racial differences are superficially selected, and have no survival value.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Given these two beliefs, some believe Darwin to have established monogenism as the dominant paradigm for racial ancestry, and to have defeated the scientific racism practiced by Morton, Knott, Agassiz et. Al, as well as notions that there existed a natural racial hierarchy that reflected inborn differences and measures of value between the different human races.
Nevertheless, he stated: "The various races, when carefully compared and measured, differ much from each other – as in the texture of hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body, the capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even the convolutions of the brain. But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of difference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatization and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotion, but partly in their intellectual faculties." (''The Descent of Man'', chapter VII).

In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted the great difficulty naturalists had in trying to decide how many "races" there actually were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Man has been studied more carefully than any other animal, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity amongst capable judges whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as two (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenbach), six (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven (Pickering), fifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins), twenty-two (Morton), sixty (Crawfurd), or as sixty-three, according to Burke. This diversity of judgment does not prove that the races ought not to be ranked as species, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and that it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decline of racial studies after 1930==
Several social and political developments that occurred at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century led to the transformation in the discourse of race. Three movements that historians have considered are: the coming of mass [[democracy]], the age of [[Imperialism|imperialist expansion]], and the impact of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"&gt;Malik, Kenan. The Meaning of Race. New York: New York University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; More than any other, the violence of [[Nazi]] rule, the [[Holocaust]], and [[World War II]] transformed the whole discussion of race. Nazism made an argument for racial superiority based on a biological basis. This led to the idea that people could be divided into discrete groups and based on the divisions, there would be severe, tortuous, and often fatal consequence. The exposition of racial theory beginning in the [[Third Reich]], up to the [[Final Solution]], created a popular moral revolution against racism.&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"/&gt; In 1950, and as a response to the genocide of Nazism, UNESCO was formed and released a statement saying that there was no biological determinant or basis for race.

Consequently, studies of human variation focused more on actual patterns of variation and evolutionary patterns among populations and less about classification. Some scientists point to three discoveries. Firstly, African populations exhibit greater genetic diversity and less linkage disequilibrium because of their long history. Secondly, genetic similarity is directly correlated with geographic proximity. Lastly, some loci reflect selection in response to environmental gradients. Therefore, some argue, human racial groups do not appear to be distinct ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, Barbara A., Lee Sandra Soo-Jin, and Richardson Sarah S. Revisiting Race in a Genomic Age. Piscataway: Rutgers University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Boas===
[[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942) was a German American anthropologist and has been called the "Father of American Anthropology". Boas made significant contributions within [[anthropology]], more specifically, [[physical anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. His work put an emphasis on cultural and environmental effects on people to explain their development into adulthood and evaluated them in concert with human biology and evolution. This encouraged academics to break away from static taxonomical classifications of race. It is said that before Boas, anthropology was the study of race, and after Boas, anthropology was the study of culture.

===Julian Huxley and A. C. Haddon===
[[Sir Julian Sorell Huxley]] (1887–1975) was an English evolutionary biologist, humanist and internationalist. After returning to England from a tour of the United States in 1924, Huxley wrote a series of articles for the ''Spectator'' which he expressed his belief in the drastic differences between "negros" and "whites".&lt;ref name="Barkan, Elazar 1992"&gt;Barkan, Elazar. The Retreat of Scientific Racism. New York: Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the color of "blood" – percentage of 'white' and 'black' blood – that a person had would determine a person's mental capacity, moral probity, and social behavior. "Blood" also determined how individuals should be treated by society. He was a proponent of racial inequality and segregation.&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"/&gt;

By 1930, Huxley's ideas on race and inherited intellectual capacity of human groups became more liberal. By the mid-1930s, Huxley was considered one of the leading [[Anti-racism|antiracist]] and committed much of his time and efforts into publicizing the fight against Nazism.&lt;ref name="Barkan, Elazar 1992"/&gt;

[[Alfred Cort Haddon]] (1855–1940) was a British anthropologist and ethnologist.

In 1935, Huxley and A. C. Haddon wrote, ''We Europeans'', which greatly popularized the struggle against racial science and attacked the Nazis' abuse of science to promote their racial theories. Although they argued that 'any biological arrangement of the types of European man is still largely a subjective process', they proposed that humankind could be divided up into "major" and "minor subspecies". They believed that races were a classification based on [[hereditary]] traits but should not by nature be used to condemn or deem inferior to another group. Like most of their peers, they continued to maintain a distinction between the social meaning of race and the scientific study of race. From a scientific stand point, they were willing to accept that concepts of superiority and inferiority did not exist, but from a social stand point, they continued to believe that racial differences were significant. For example, they argued that genetic differences between groups were functionally important for certain jobs or tasks.&lt;ref name="Malik, Kenan 1996"/&gt;

[[Carleton Stevens Coon]] (1904–1981) was an American [[biological anthropology|physical anthropologist]], Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], lecturer and professor at [[Harvard]], and president of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collopy.net/projects/2009/race.html|title={{"'}}Race' Relations: Montagu, Dobzhansky, Coon, and the Divergence of Race Concepts"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723045713/http://collopy.net/projects/2009/race.html|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Coon published ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'', in which he concluded:&lt;ref name=racesofeurope&gt;[http://www.snpa.nordish.net/racesofeurope.htm The Races of Europe by Carleton Coon 1939] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050225133107/http://www.snpa.nordish.net/racesofeurope.htm |date=2005-02-25 }} (Hosted by the Society for Nordish Physical Anthropology)&lt;/ref&gt;

#The Upper Paleolithic peoples are the truly indigenous peoples of Europe.
#Mediterraneans invaded Europe in large numbers during the Neolithic period and settled there.
#The racial situation in Europe today may be explained as a mixture of Upper Paleolithic survivors and Mediterraneans.
#When reduced Upper Paleolithic survivors and Mediterraneans mix, then occurs the process of [[dinaric race|dinarization]], which produces a hybrid with non-intermediate features.
#The Caucasian race encompasses the regions of [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]].
#The Nordic race is part of the Mediterranean racial stock, being a mixture of Corded and Danubian Mediterraneans.

In 1962, Coon also published ''The Origin of Races'', wherein he offered a definitive statement of the [[polygenist]] view. He also argued that human fossils could be assigned a date, a race, and an evolutionary grade. Coon divided humanity into five races and believed that each race had ascended the ladder of human evolution at different rates.&lt;ref name="Sarich, Vincent 2004"/&gt;

===Ashley Montagu===
[[Ashley Montagu|Montague Francis Ashley Montagu]] (1905–1999) was a British-American anthropologist. In 1942, he made a strong effort to have the word "race" replaced with "[[ethnic group]]" by publishing his book, ''Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race''. He was also selected to draft the initial 1950 UNESCO Statement on Race.&lt;ref name="Sarich, Vincent 2004"/&gt;

Montagu would later publish ''An Introduction to Physical Anthropology'', a comprehensive treatise on human diversity. In doing so, he sought to provide a firmer scientific framework through which to discuss biological variation among populations.&lt;ref name=Montagu&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Montagu|title=An Introduction to Physical Anthropology - Second Edition|date=1951|publisher=Charles C. Thomas Publisher|pages=302–12|url=https://archive.org/download/introductiontoph033240mbp/introductiontoph033240mbp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
{{Main|The Race Question}}
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) was established November 16, 1945, in the wake of the genocide of Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sack (1986) Unesco: From Inherent Contradictions to Open Crisis, ''Comparative Education Review'', Vol. 30, No. 1 (Feb. 1986), pp. 112–19&lt;/ref&gt; The UNESCO 1945 constitution declared that, "The great and terrible war which now has ended was made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15244&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Constitution|website=portal.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1978 the UNESCO issued five statements on the issue of race.

The first of the UNESCO statements on race was "[[The Race Question]]" and was issued on July 18, 1950. The statement included both a rejection of a scientific basis for theories of racial hierarchies and a moral [[anti-racism|condemnation of racism]]. Its first statement suggested in particular to "drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of '[[ethnic groups]]{{'"}}, which proved to be controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Barkan, Elazar.

It did not reject the idea of a biological basis to racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton. Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=The statement was primarily concerned with the use of race in the sense of species, but in referring to "the biological fact of race", it touched on the use of the word to signify inheritance.|page=1096 or 1098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it defined the concept of race in terms as a population defined by certain anatomical and physiological characteristics as being divergent from other populations; it gives the examples of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]] and [[Negroid race|Negroid]] races. The statements maintain that there are no "pure races" and that biological variability was as great within any race as between races. It argued that there is no scientific basis for believing that there are any innate differences in intellectual, psychological or emotional potential among races.

The statement was drafted by [[Ashley Montagu]] and endorsed by some of the leading researchers of the time, in the fields of [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[ethnology]]. The statement was endorsed by [[Ernest Beaglehole]], [[Juan Comas]], L. A. Costa Pinto, [[Franklin Frazier]], sociologist specialised in race relations studies, [[Morris Ginsberg]], founding chairperson of the [[British Sociological Association]], [[Humayun Kabir]], writer, philosopher and Education Minister of India twice, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], one of the founders of [[ethnology]] and leading theorist of [[structural anthropology]], and [[Ashley Montagu]], anthropologist and author of ''[[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity]]'', who was the [[wikt:rapporteur|rapporteur]].

As a result of a lack of representation of [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologists]] in the drafting committee the 1950 publication was criticized by biologists and physical anthropologists for confusing the biological and social senses of race and for going beyond the scientific facts, although there was a general agreement about the statements conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton. Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|quote=Because of last-minute withdrawals, biological science was not adequately represented in the committee. Many biologists, though not rejecting the statement's general spirit or its main conclusions, believed that it went beyond the scientific facts (e.g., in the reference to “drives towards co-operation”) and that it confused the biological and social uses of the word race.|page=1096 or 1098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO assembled a new committee with better representation of the physical sciences and drafted a new statement released in 1951. The 1951 statement, published as "[[The Race Concept]]", focused on race as a biological heuristic that could serve as the basis for evolutionary studies of human populations. It considered the existing races to be the result of such evolutionary processes throughout human history. It also maintained that "equality of opportunity and equality in law in no way depend, as ethical principles, upon the assertion that human beings are in fact equal in endowment."

As the 1950 and 1951 statements generated considerable attention, in 1964 a new commission was formed to draft a third statement titled "[[Proposals on the Biological Aspects of Race]]". According to [[Michael Banton]] (2008), this statement broke more clearly with the notion of race-as-species than the previous two statements, declaring that almost any genetically differentiated population could be defined as a race.&lt;ref name="Banton. Michael 2008 1096"&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton. Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. (ed.)|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|page=1096 or 1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement stated that "Different classifications of mankind into major stocks, and of those into more restricted categories (races, which are groups of populations, or single populations) have been proposed on the basis of hereditary physical traits. Nearly all classifications recognise at least three major stocks" and "There is no national, religious, geographic, linguistic or cultural group which constitutes a race ipso facto; the concept of race is purely biological." It concluded with "The biological data given above stand in open contradiction to the tenets of racism. Racist theories can in no way pretend to have any scientific foundation."

The 1950, '51 and '64 statements focused on the dispelling the scientific foundations for racism but did not consider other factors contributing to racism. For this reason, in 1967 a new committee was assembled, including representatives of the social sciences (sociologists, lawyers, ethnographers and geneticists), to draft a statement "covering the social, ethical and philosophical aspects of the problem". This statement was the first to provide a definition of [[racism]]: "antisocial beliefs and acts which are based upon the fallacy that discriminatory intergroup relations are justifiable on biological grounds". The statement continued to denounce the many negative social affects of racism.&lt;ref name="Banton. Michael 2008 1096"/&gt;

In 1978 the general assembly of the UNESCO considered the four previous statements and published a collective "[[Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/webworld/peace_library/UNESCO/HRIGHTS/107-116.HTM|title=DECLARATION ON RACE AND RACIAL PREJUDICE, 1978|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration included [[Apartheid]] as one of the examples of racism, an inclusion which caused [[South Africa]] to step out of the assembly. It declared that a number of public policies and laws needed to be implemented. It stated that:
* "All human beings belong to a single species."
:*"All peoples of the world possess equal faculties for attaining the highest level in intellectual, technical, social, economic, cultural and political development."
:*"The differences between the achievements of the different peoples are entirely attributable to geographical, historical, political, economic, social and cultural factors."
:*"Any theory which involves the claim that racial or ethnic groups are inherently superior or inferior, thus implying that some would be entitled to dominate and eliminate others, presumed to be inferior, or which bases value judgements on racial differentiation, has no scientific foundation and is contrary to the moral and ethical principles of humanity."

===Criticism of racial studies (1930s–1980s)===

The 20th-century criticism of racial anthropology were significantly based on the school of [[Franz Boas]], professor of anthropology at Columbia University from 1899, who beginning in 1920 strongly favoured the influence of social environment over heritability. As a reaction to the rise of [[Nazi Germany]] and its prominent espousing of [[Nazism and race|racist ideologies]] in the 1930s, there was an outpouring of popular works by scientists criticizing the use of race to justify the politics of "superiority" and "inferiority". An influential work in this regard was the publication of ''We Europeans: A Survey of "Racial" Problems'' by [[Julian Huxley]] and [[A. C. Haddon]] in 1935, which sought to show that [[population genetics]] allowed for only a highly limited definition of race at best. Another popular work during this period, "The Races of Mankind" by [[Ruth Benedict]] and Gene Weltfish, argued that though there were some extreme racial differences, they were primarily superficial, and in any case did not justify political action.

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''Race and History'' ([[UNESCO]], 1952) was another critique of the biological "race" notion, arguing in favor of [[cultural relativism]] through a metaphor of cultures as different trains crossing each other in various directions and speed, thus each one seeming to [[wikt:progress|progress]] to himself while others supposedly kept immobile. This, in his view, clearly showed that "race" was no longer a useful indicator of cultural superiority.

In his 1984 article in the ''Essence'' magazine, "On Being 'White' ... and Other Lies",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwsworkshop.org/pdfs/CARC/Family_Herstories/2_On_Being_White.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baldwin]] reads the history of [[racialization]] in America as both figuratively and literally violent, remarking that "race" only exists as a social construction within a network of force relations: "America became white&amp;nbsp;— the people who, as they claim, 'settled' the country became white&amp;nbsp;— because of the necessity of denying the Black presence, and justifying the Black subjugation. No community can be based on such a principle&amp;nbsp;— or, in other words, no community can be established on so genocidal a lie. White men from Norway, for example, where they were Norwegians&amp;nbsp;— became white: by slaughtering the cattle, poisoning the well, torching the houses, massacring Native Americans, raping Black women.... Because they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers."

Apart from its function as a vernacular term, the term "race"&amp;nbsp;– as Nancy Stepan notes in her 1982 book, ''The Idea of Race in Science, Great Britain 1800–1960''&amp;nbsp;– varied widely in its usage, even in science, from the 18th century through the 20th; the term referred "at one time or another" to "cultural, religious, national, linguistic, ethnic and geographical groups of human beings"&amp;nbsp;— everything from "Celts" to "Spanish Americans" to "Hottentots" to "Europeans" (p.&amp;nbsp;xvii).

In the 1979 preface to ''Blackness: Text and Pretext'', [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], describes the elusive element of "blackness" in Afro-American literature as lacking an "essence", defined instead "by a network of relations that form a particular aesthetic unity" (p.&amp;nbsp;162). Continuing his poststructuralist-inflected negation of blackness as an essence, in his 1985 introduction to a special issue of the journal ''Critical Inquiry'', Gates goes even further, calling race itself a "dangerous trope" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). He argues that "race has become a trope of the ultimate, irreducible difference between cultures, linguistic groups, or adherents of specific belief systems which&amp;nbsp;— more often than not&amp;nbsp;— also have fundamentally opposed economic interests" (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

[[Linda Gottfredson]], on the other hand, has argued that denying (or trying to conceal) real biological differences between groups on average IQ instead cause people to seek something to blame for the differing average group achievements, causing resentment and hostility. She argues that "virtually all the victim groups of [[genocide]] in the Twentieth Century had relatively ''high'' average levels of achievement."&lt;ref name=G2005&gt;What if the Hereditarian Hypothesis Is True?

The '''International Berthing and Docking Mechanism''' (IBDM) is the European androgynous low impact [[Docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking mechanism]] that is capable of docking and berthing large and small spacecraft. The development of the IBDM is under [[European Space Agency|ESA]] contract with [[Qinetiq|QinetiQ Space]] as prime contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Marco|last1=Caporicci|title=IBDM: THE INTERNATIONAL BERTHING DOCKING MECHANISM FOR HUMAN MISSIONS TO LOW EARTH ORBIT AND EXPLORATION|journal=IAC|date=2010|url=http://www.iafastro.net/iac/archive/browse/IAC-10/C2/7/8486/|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qinetiq.com/services-products/space/Pages/space-exploration-technology.aspx|title=QinetiQ Space wins contract with European Space Agency to develop International Berthing Docking Mechanism |publisher=[[QinetiQ ]]|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The IBDM development was initiated as a joint development programme with [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA JSC]]. The first application of the IBDM was intended to be the ISS [[Crew Return Vehicle|Crew Return Vehicle (CRV)]]. In the original Agency to Agency agreement, it was decided to develop an Engineering Development Unit (EDU) to demonstrate the feasibility of the system and the associated technologies.  NASA JSC were responsible for the system and avionics designs and ESA for the mechanical design. However, since the cancellation of the CRV program, the two Agencies have independently progressed with the docking system development.

The IBDM is now designed to be compatible with the [[International Docking System Standard]]&lt;ref name=IDSS&gt;{{cite book|title=International Docking System Standard|date=November 20, 2013|edition=Rev. C|url=http://www.internationaldockingstandard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IDSS) and is hence compatible with the future [[International Space Station|ISS]] International Docking Adapters ([[International Docking Adapter|IDA]]) on the US side of the [[International Space Station|ISS]].

The [[European Space Agency]] has now started a cooperation with [[Sierra Nevada Corporation|SNC]] to provide the IBDM for attaching this new vehicle to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in the future.&lt;ref name="spaceref.biz"&gt;{{cite web|title=QinetiQ Space Wins ESA Contract for International Berthing Docking Mechanism|url=http://spaceref.biz/company/qinetiq-space-wins-esa-contract-for-international-berthing-docking-mechanism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After SNC was selected as a commercial contractor to resupply the International Space Station in January 2016, ESA decided to spend 33 million euros ($36 million) to complete the design of the IBDM and build a flight model for Dream Chaser’s first mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/europe-to-invest-in-sierra-nevadas-dream-chaser-cargo-vehicle/|title=Europe to invest in Sierra Nevada’s Dream Chaser cargo vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=Space News|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The IBDM provides both docking and berthing capability. The docking mechanism comprises a Soft Capture Mechanism (SCS), and a structural mating system called the Hard Capture System (HCS), explained in more detail below. The IBDM avionics runs in hot redundancy.

=== Soft Capture System ===
 
The SCS utilizes active control using 6 servo-actuated legs from [[RUAG Space|RUAG Space (Switzerland)]] which are coordinated to control the SCS ring in its 6 degrees of freedom. The leg forces are measured to modify the compliance of the SCS ring to facilitate alignment of the active platform during capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dirk|last1=Claessens|title=DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BERTHING AND DOCKING MECHANISM COMPATIBLE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL DOCKING SYSTEM STANDARD|journal=IAC|date=2012|url=http://www.iafastro.net/iac/archive/browse/IAC-12/B3/7/15451/|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large range of vehicle mass properties can be handled. Mechanical latches achieve soft capture.

=== Hard Capture System ===
 
The HCS uses structural hook mechanisms to close the sealed mated interface. QinetiQ Space has developed several generations of latches and hooks to come to the final hook design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= K. De Vriendt|author2=H. Dittmer|author3=D. Vrancken|author4=P. Urmston|author5=O. Gracia|author6=M. Caporicci |title= Evolution of the IBDM Structural Latch Development into a Generic Simplified DesignEvolution of the IBDM Structural Latch Development into a Generic Simplified Design |url=http://www.esmats.eu/amspapers/searchpapers.php?s=15&amp;q=motor|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sener Aeronáutica|SENER]] (Spain) will be responsible for the further development and qualification of the HCS subsystem.

=== Advantages ===

The key feature of IBDM is that it is a fully computer controlled mechanism having in the following '''SAFE''' advantages:

# '''S'''mooth: IBDM provides the capability for low impact docking and berthing. Low impact docking means that the contact forces during mating are greatly reduced and as a result this alleviates the large loads that the structure is required to withstand and it eliminates the need for impact energy to achieve spacecraft interface alignment and capture. Low impact berthing means that the SCS mating forces are smaller than the IDSS requirement, making it possible to perform berthing within the force limits of the robotic arm on station.
# '''A'''utonomous: the IBDM comprises autonomous fast switch-over from primary to redundant lane in case of a single failure and from redundant lane to safe mode (described below) in case of two failures. This switch-over is performed at IBDM level and does not require the vehicle avionics to be in the loop.
# '''F'''lexible: a large range of vehicle mass properties can be handled, as the SCS uses configurable active control, making it possible to be used for a wide variety of applications ranging from explorations to resupply missions.
# '''E'''ffective: a very high capture success rate (&gt; 98%), enabled by an agile force-sensing controlled capture mode. As a result, IBDM can cope with the full range of initial conditions specified in the IDSS.
# '''SAFE''': the IBDM comprises a backup or safe mode in which the Steward platform behaves like an electro-magnetic damper. This mode is used if two failures have occurred in the IBDM avionics - or on command by the hosting vehicle - or in case no electrical power is applied to the IBDM, and hence provides a safe situation for both the vehicle and the ISS, even during the docking phase.

[[File:Dream Chaser pre-drop tests.6.jpg|300x300px|thumb|right|upright|Dream Chaser]]
The American company [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] (SNC) is developing the [[Dream Chaser]], which is a small reusable spacecraft that is selected to transport cargo and/or crew to the [[International Space Station|ISS]]. The [[European Space Agency]] has started a cooperation with [[Sierra Nevada Corporation|SNC]] to potentially provide the IBDM for attaching this new vehicle to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in the future.&lt;ref name="spaceref.biz"/&gt; The IBDM will be mounted to the unpressurised cargo module, which will be ejected before reentry.

== Status == 
The IBDM development has successfully passed the Critical Design Review (December 2015). 
An engineering model of the mechanism and its hot-redundant avionics has been developed and successfully tested (March 2016). The performance of the system has been verified at the certified SDTS docking test facility at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA JSC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dittmer|first1=Helder|last2=Paijmans|first2=Bart|title=The International Berthing Docking Mechanism (IBDM):Demonstrating full compliance to the International Docking System Standard (IDSS)|journal=66th International Astronautical Congress|date=16 Oct 2016|url=http://www.iac2015.org/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318001142/http://www.iac2015.org/|archivedate=2015-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A proposal for the qualification and flight manufacturing of the complete IBDM system has been submitted to ESA (April 2016).

'''Irrationality''' is [[cognition]], thinking, talking, or acting without inclusion of [[rationality]]. It is more specifically described as an action or opinion given through inadequate use of [[reason]], or through emotional distress or cognitive deficiency. The term is used, usually pejoratively, to describe thinking and actions that are, or appear to be, less useful, or more illogical than other more rational alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Margaret. Male and Female: The Classic Study of the Sexes (1949) Quill (HarperCollins) 1998 edition: {{ISBN|0-688-14676-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=Joyce |title=Castrating the Female Advantage: Feminist Standpoint Research and Management Science |journal=Journal of Management Inquiry 3 |number=1 |date=March 1994 |pages=74–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrational behaviors of individuals include taking offense or becoming angry about a situation that has not yet occurred, expressing emotions exaggeratedly (such as crying hysterically), maintaining unrealistic expectations, engaging in irresponsible conduct such as problem intoxication, disorganization, and falling victim to [[confidence trick]]s. People with a [[mental illness]] like [[schizophrenia]] may exhibit irrational [[paranoia]].

These more contemporary normative conceptions of what constitutes a manifestation of irrationality are difficult to demonstrate empirically because it is not clear by whose standards we are to judge the behavior rational or irrational.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Explanation of occurrence==
The study of irrational behavior is of interest in fields such as [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[economics]], [[game theory]], and [[evolutionary psychology]], as well as of practical interest to the practitioners of [[advertising]] and [[propaganda]].

Theories of irrational behavior include:
* People's actual [[Interest (emotion)|interests]] differ from what they [[Belief|believe]] to be their interests.
* Mechanisms that have evolved to give optimal behavior in normal conditions lead to irrational behavior in abnormal conditions.
* Situations are outside of one's ordinary circumstances, where one may experience [[panic|intense levels]] of fear, or may regress to a [[fight-or-flight]] mentality.
* People fail to realize the irrationality of their actions and believe they are acting perfectly rationally, possibly due to flaws in their reasoning.
* Apparently irrational decisions are actually optimal, but made [[unconsciously]] on the basis of "hidden" interests that are not known to the conscious [[mind]].
* People have the inability to comprehend the social consequences of one's own actions, possibly due in part to a lack of [[empathy]].
* Some people find themselves in this condition by living "double" lives. They try to put on one "mask" for one group of people and another for a different group of people. Many will become confused as to which they really are or which they wish to become.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Factors which affect rational behavior include:
* [[Stress (medicine)|Stress]], which in turn may be emotional or physical
* The introduction of a new or unique situation
* Intoxication
* Peers who convey irrational thoughts as necessary standards for social acceptance.

==Intentional==
Irrationality is not always viewed as a negative. [[Dada]] [[Surrealist]] art movements embraced irrationality as a means to "reject reason and logic". [[André Breton]], for example, argued for a rejection of pure logic and reason which are seen as responsible for many contemporary social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screensite.org/courses/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm |title=Manifesto of Surrealism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401002841/http://www.screensite.org/courses/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm |archivedate=2009-04-01 |website=ScreenSite |year=1999 |origyear=First published 1924 |first=André |last=Breton |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In science fiction literature, the progress of pure rationality is viewed as a quality which may lead civilization ultimately toward a scientific future dependent on technology. Irrationality in this case, is a positive factor which helps to balance excessive reason.

In psychology, excessive rationality without creativity may be viewed as a form of [[self-control]] and protection. Certain problems, such as death and loss, may have no rational solution when they are being experienced.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} We may seek logical explanations for such events, when in fact the proper emotional response is grief.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Irrationality is thus a means of freeing the mind toward purely imaginative solutions, to break out of historic patterns of dependence into new patterns that allow one to move on.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Irrationalist==
''Irrationalist'' is a wide term. It may be applied to mean "one without [[rationality]]", for their beliefs or ideas. Or, more precisely, it may mean someone who openly rejects some aspect of [[rationalism]], variously defined.  It can be seen as either a negative quality, used pejoratively, or a positive quality: For example, [[religious faith]] may variably be seen by some as a virtue which doesn't need to be rational (see [[fideism]]), while others (even of the same religious tradition) may view their faiths as being rational, favoring [[rationalism]].

Also, it might be considered irrationalist to gamble or buy a [[lottery ticket]], on the basis that the [[expected value]] is negative.

Irrational thought was seen in Europe as part of the reaction against [[Continental rationalism]]. For example, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] is sometimes classified as an irrationalist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==In philosophy==
[[Ancient Greek philosophy]] established a fundamental differentiation between logical "true" assumptions of the universe and irrational "false" statements or mere opinions based on emotion or sensorial experience. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta has shown that Greek philosophy thus founded a dual cultural system based on rationality as the domain of philosophy and science versus "irrational" emotion and sensuality as domains of literature and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalität. Eine Weltgeschichte. Europäische Kulturgeschichte und Globalisierung|publisher=Fink|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the irrational emotions as stirred up in literature threaten the rationality of human beings, in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' [[Plato]] expelled poets from the state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In the later history of philosophy this opposition of rationality and the irrational was renewed as a methodological differentiation by [[Descartes]], but reversed by Pascal in his statement: “Le coeur a ses raisons, que la raison ne connait point” (“The heart has its reasons which reason does not know”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pensées, Nr. 277|author=Pascal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal thus asserted a specific rationality of the "irrational" emotions. The philosophy of [[sensualism]] ([[John Locke]], among others) underlined the importance of the senses as the source of human perception and cognition.

The 19th-century German philosopher [[Julius Bahnsen]] asserted that all thought processes, desires and actions ultimately led to irresolvable contradictions which stem from the inherent irrationality of being. Years earlier, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] had theorized that despite some traces of rationality in the world, the "dark ground" of being itself rested in an irrational will that could not be explained, only described in an [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] manner. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] picked up on this idea and completely fleshed out the concept of an irrational will as a cause of existence, by founding his entire metaphysics and explaining the variety of physical phenomena precisely with this underlying, unconscious and dynamic notion of [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|will]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] gave some remit to irrationality in his ''Concluding Scientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments'', where he claimed that 'Subjectivity is Truth'. Rather than allowing reason to do our choosing for us, Kierkegaard argued that irrational leaps of faith could be more useful, as they were more [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] (although, he never used the word 'authentic'), and thus gave more meaning to life. Objectivity, like reason, was opposed to subjectivity, and thus could not be said to give any meaning to anyone's life. Although he never dismissed rationality in its entirety, Kierkegaard argued that we could not allow rationality to make our decisions for us. In this, and to some degree, he offers a vindication of irrationality.

==In literature==
Much subject matter in literature can be seen as an expression of human longing for the irrational. The [[Romanticism|Romantics]] valued irrationality over what they perceived as the sterile, calculating and emotionless philosophy which they thought to have been brought about by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven |last=Kreis |url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture16a.html |title=Lecture 16: The Romantic Era |publisher=Historyguide.org |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dadaists and Surrealists later used irrationality as a basis for their art. The disregard of reason and preference for dream states in [[Surrealism]] was an exaltation of the irrational and the rejection of logic.

Mythology nearly always incorporates elements of fantasy and the supernatural; however myths are largely accepted by the societies that create them, and only come to be seen as irrational through the spyglass of time and by other cultures. But though mythology serves as a way to rationalize the universe in symbolic and often anthropomorphic ways, a pre-rational and irrational way of thinking can be seen as tacitly valued in mythology's supremacy of the imagination, where rationality as a philosophical method has not been developed.

On the other side the irrational is often depicted from a rational point of view in all types of literature, provoking amusement, contempt, disgust, hatred, awe, and many other reactions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== In psychotherapy ==
{{See also|Cognitive distortions}}
The term ''irrational'' is often used in [[psychotherapy]] and the concept of irrationality is especially known in [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] originated and developed by American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. In this approach, the term ''irrational'' is used in a slightly different way than in general. Here irrationality is defined as the tendency and leaning that humans have to act, emote and think in ways that are inflexible, unrealistic, absolutist and most importantly self-defeating and socially defeating and destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One psychotherapist describes the overlapping of irrationality and psychotherapy:  &lt;blockquote&gt;I didn't understand enough about them [patients] or how they thought even to begin to reach them. Listening to their stories, I wanted to offer advice. Why don't you escape from such a relationship? Leave your home, don't submit! Seek out others, expect more for yourself, I wanted to say. But I came to realize that they could not really hear me. They heard my words, perhaps even agreed with my recommendations. They had brain compartments to which new information, my suggestions for example, had easy access. But habits, learned emotional responses, and remembered expectations were buried deep in their brains that dictated the course of their lives. These patients, like victims of encephalitis, could not be awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memory's Voice|last=Alkon|first=D.

Seda has described the themes of her work as the quotidian, location, and individual storytelling, stating that "In all my public actions, I try to create an exchange between people in their everyday spaces" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.artsy.net/artist/katerina-seda&lt;/ref&gt;. Her projects often involve members of her family or people from small villages and encourage communication between people, combining urban planning, everyday life, politics, and private relationships through social investigations.

==Projects==
* There's Nothing There (2003) - Seda asked the people in a small town in the [[Czech Republic]] to repeat their everyday rituals all at the same time together. The people of the town went to the grocery store, ate meals, and watched evening TV with their families all at the same time for a day. This project highlighted the similarities between people and how we might not realize how much of our lives intersect with others &lt;ref&gt;https://www.domusweb.it/en/interviews/2011/01/16/acting-as-a-director-katerina-seda.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Mirror Hill (2010) - Seda asked 600 families from [[Mirror Hill]], a community on the outskirts of [[Budapest]], to take part in this project. Mirror Hill has no center or common meeting space and most people don't know their neighbors, so Seda set up a competition to foster relationships between them. The families were each asked to submit a drawing of their view from their front door, and then a catalogue was distributed to all of the community members. Seda offered a prize to the family that could correctly identify the most houses in the catalogue, and described the results: "It was amazing to see the streets full of people with their books open, looking at the buildings and searching for the houses... in the evening, they all gathered to discuss the day spent together" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.domusweb.it/en/interviews/2011/01/16/acting-as-a-director-katerina-seda.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Kenshō'''{{refn|group=note|{{CJKV|j=見性|t=見性|l=see [one's] [[Buddha-nature|nature]]{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=115}}}}}} (見性) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term from the [[Japanese Zen|Zen tradition]]. ''Ken'' means "seeing," ''shō'' means [[Buddha-nature|"nature, essence"]].{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}} It is usually translated as "seeing one's (true) nature," that is, the [[Buddha-nature]].

Kenshō is an ''initial'' insight or awakening, not full [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=226}} It is to be followed by further training to deepen this insight, and learn to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida (translator)|1996}}{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}

The term kenshō is often used interchangeably with [[satori]], which is derived from the verb [[satoru]],{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A|p=88}} and means "comprehension; understanding".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://jisho.org/words?jap=&amp;eng=satori&amp;dict=edict Denshi Jisho – Online Japanese dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Fischer-Schreiber, ''kenshō'' and ''[[satori]]'' are nearly synonymous, with a customary distinction of using ''kenshō'' for an initial enlightenment experience that still requires deepening, and ''satori'' for the [[Buddhahood]] enlightenment of a Buddha or Zen patriarch.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|1991|p=115}} Hakuin uses the word "satori" for initial insight, synonymous with kensho.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}{{refn|group=note|The Japanese Zen-tradition has a rich vocabulaire of terms related to "enlightenment": awakenening (''kaku''), true awakening (''shōgaku''), perfect awakening (''engaku''), insight (''sei''), attaining the Way (''jōdō''), becoming Buddha (''jōbutsu''), opening the eye (''kaigen''), liberation (''gedatsu''), aythetication (''shō''), the great death (''daishi''), self-enlightenment without a teacher (''mushi dokugo''), great satori with full penetration (''taigo tettei''), and peerless perfect enlightenment (''anokutara sanmyaku sanbodai'').{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=90}} The list is not exhausted with these terms.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=90}} Another term for deep awakening is [[Daigo (Zen)|daigo]].}}

==Terminology==
The Chinese Buddhist term ''jianxing'' ({{zh|s=见性|t=見性|p=jiànxìng |w=chien-hsing}}) [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]]:
* ''jian'' [[wikt:見|見]] "see, observe, meet with, perceive";
* ''xing'' [[wikt:性|性]] "(inborn) nature, character, personality, disposition, property, quality,gender".

===History===
Buddhist monks who produced [[Chinese Buddhism#Early translation methods|Sanskrit-Chinese translations]] of sutras faced many linguistic difficulties:
* They chose Chinese ''jian'' 見 to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''dṛś'' [[wikt:दृश्|दृश्]] "see, look", and the central Buddhist idea of ''[[View (Buddhism)|dṛṣṭi]]'' [[wikt:दृष्टि|दृष्टि]] "view, seeing (also with the mind's eye), wisdom, false view".
* Translators used ''xing'' 性 or ''zixing'' 自性 "self-nature" for Sanskrit ''[[svabhava|svabhāva]]'' [[wikt:स्वभाव|स्वभाव]] "intrinsic nature, essential nature".
Thus, ''jianxing'' was the translation for ''dṛṣṭi-svabhāva'', "view one's essential nature".

The (c. 8th century) Chinese ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' (2, [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajñā]] "wisdom, understanding") first records ''jianxing''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hanyu Da Cidian]] 汉语大词典, vol. 10, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciations===
The [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation ''jianxing'' historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] ''kien&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;sjäŋ&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] of this term exist:
* ''kenshō''  見性 or ケンショウ (''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'') in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]
* {{Korean|hangul=견성|rr=gyeonseong}} in [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]]
* ''kiến tính'' in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]].{{sfn|Muller|year unknown}}

==Meanings of kenshō==
{{See also|Bodhi|Wisdom in Buddhism{{!}}Prajna|Buddha-nature|Sunyata|Suchness|Dharmakaya|Alayavijnana}}

Translating ''kenshō'' into English is semantically complex.

===Encyclopedic and dictionary definitions===
Some encyclopedia and dictionary definitions are:
* Soothill (1934): "To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan (Zen) or Intuitive School."{{sfn|Soothill|1934|p=244}}
* Fischer-Schreiber (1991): Lit. "seeing nature"; Zen expression for the experience of awakening (enlightenment). Since the meaning is "seeing one's own true nature," ''kenshō'' is usually translated "self-realization." Like all words that try to reduce the conceptually ungraspable experience of enlightenment to a concept, this one is also not entirely accurate and is even misleading, since the experience contains no duality of "seer" and "seen" because there is no "nature of self' as an object that is seen by a subject separate from it.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|1991|p=115}}
* Baroni (2002): "Seeing one's nature," that is, realizing one's own original Buddha Nature. In the Rinzai school, it most often refers more specifically to one's initial enlightenment attained through [[kōan]] practice.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}
* Muller (year unknown): To see one's own originally enlightened mind. To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan school, as seen for example, in the phrase 'seeing one's nature, becoming Buddha'  見性成佛.{{sfn|Muller|year unknown}}

===Definitions by Buddhist scholars===
Buddhist scholars have defined ''kenshō'' as:
* D.T. Suzuki: "Looking into one's nature or the opening of satori";{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-B|p=259}} "This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students 'satori' (''wu'' in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi]]'')".{{sfn|Suzuki-1994-B|p=229}}{{refn|group=note|D.T. Suzuki has been criticized for his highly idealized and inaccurate picture of Japanese Zen.{{sfn|MacRae|2003}} [[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi]] is the highest state of realization and awakening. Satori, or kensho, is a first glimpse into "nature", to be followed by further training.}}
* Dumoulin (1988/2005): "Enlightenment is described here as an insight into the identity of one's own nature with all of reality in an eternal now, as a vision that removes all distinctions. This enlightenment is the center and the goal of the Zen way. Hakuin prefers the term "seeing into one's nature", which for him means ultimate reality. The Buddha nature and the [[Dharmakaya|cosmic Buddha body]], wisdom (''prajna''), and emptiness (''sunyata''), [[Original face|the original countenance one had before one was born]], and other expressions from the rich palette of Mahayana terms were all familiar to him from his continued study of the sutras and [[Zen#Zen literature|Zen literature]]."{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}}
* Peter Harvey (1990): "It is a blissful realization where a person's inner nature, the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|originally pure mind]], is directly known as an illuminating [[Sunyata|emptiness]], a [[Tathatā/Dharmatā|thusness]] which is dynamic and [[Five Ranks|immanent in the world]]."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}
* G. Victor Sogen Hori (2000): "The term consists of two characters: ''ken'', which means "see" or "seeing", and ''sho'', which means "nature", "character", "quality." To "see one's nature" is the usual translation for ''kensho''".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}

===Definitions by Buddhist teachers and practitioners===
Buddhist teachers and practitioners have defined ''kenshō'' as:
* [[Jiyu-Kennett]]: "To see into one's own nature. The experience of enlightenment, satori."{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005b|p=263}}
* Myodo Ni Satomi, a student of [[Hakuun Yasutani]] (1993): "Seeing the-self, that is, the true self or Buddha nature."{{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=203}}

===Further notions===
The term ''kenshō'' refers to the realization of non-duality of subject and object in general,{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}} but the term ''kenshō'' may also be applied in other contexts:{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=290}} "How do you ''kenshō'' this?"{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}

''Kenshō'' is not a single experience, but refers to a whole series of realizations from a beginner's shallow glimpse of the nature of mind, up to a vision of emptiness equivalent to the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous|'Path of Seeing']] or to Buddhahood itself. In all of these, the same 'thing' is known, but in different degrees of clarity and profundity.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=31}}

"Kenshō" is commonly translated as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], a word that is also used to translate [[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], [[satori]] and [[buddhahood]]. Western discourse tends to use these terms interchangeably, but there is a distinction between a first insight, and the further development toward Buddhahood.

==Insight versus experience==
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

Kensho is insight, an understanding of reality as-it-is.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}}{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}}{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}} Contemporary understanding also describes kensho as an ''experience'', as in "enlightenment experience"; the term "enlightenment experience" is itself a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: "Kensho (enlightenment) is an enlightenment (kensho)-experience".

The notion of "experience" fits in a popular set of dichotomies: pure (unmediated) versus mediated, noncognitive versus cognitive, experiential versus intellectual, intuitive versus intellectual, nonrational versus rational, nondiscursive versus discursive, nonpropositional versus propositional.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}

The notion of ''pure experience'' (''junsui kuiken'') to interpret and understand kensho was introduced by [[Nishida Kitaro]] in his [[An Inquiry into the Good]] (1911), under influence of "his somewhat idiosyncratic reading of western philosophy",{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=248}} especially [[William James]], who wrote [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].{{refn|group=note|Victor Sogen Hori notes that Nishida Kitaro, although using a western terminology, tried to express basic Mahayana Teachings: "He borrowed, for example, the term, junsui keiken, "pure experience", from William James, but then went on to say that, while for James the individual preceded pure experience, for him, pure experience preceded the individual. That reversal makes Nishida’s notion of pure experience resemble less the psychology of William James and more the Mahayana notion of sunyata.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for western interpretations and expectations regarding kensho, similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimization of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}} [[D.T. Suzuki]], who introduced Nishida Kitaro to western philosophy, took over this notion of ''pure experience'', describing it as the essence of all religions,{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=248}} but best represented in the [[Nihonjinron|superior Japanese culture and religion]].{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}

The influence of western psychology and philosophy on Japanese Buddhism was due to the persecution of Buddhism at the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the subsequent efforts to construct a [[Buddhist modernism|New Buddhism]] (''shin bukkyo''), adapted to the modern times.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=246-248}}{{sfn|Victoria|2006}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It was this New Buddhism which has shaped [[Zen#Zen Narratives|the understanding of Zen in the west]],{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}} especially through the writings of D.T. Suzuki{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=247-248}}{{sfn|Borup|Year unknown}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and the [[Sanbo Kyodan]], an exponent of the Meiji-era opening of Zen-training for lay-followers.{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference pont for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", where-as the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception"{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}}, would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}
The notion of "experience" also over-emphasises kensho, as if it were the single goal of Zen-training, where-as the Zen-tradition clearly states that "the stink of Zen"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=143}} has to be removed and the "experience" of kensho has to be integrated into daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}} In the Rinzai-school this post-satori training includes the study and mastering of great amounts of classical Chinese poetry, which is far from "universal" and culture-transcending. On the contrary, it demands an education in culture-specific language and behaviour, which is measured by specific and strict cultural norms.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=50-53}} Emphasising "experience" "reduces the sophisticated dialectic of Ch'an/Zen doctrine and praxis to a mere "means" or set of techniques intended to inculcate such experiences".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=266}}

==Kenshō "experiences"==

===Classical accounts===
The classical Zen-texts, such as the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks) and the transmission lists, called "Transmission of the Lamp"{{refn|group=note|A literary device to establish a lineage. Both [[Tiantai|T'ien Tai]] and Chán took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|McRae|p=2-9}}  Notable examples are the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's ''A History of Zen'' to be a modern example of this genre, disguished as scientific history;{{sfn|McRae|2005}}}} the ''yü-lü'' genre{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=192}} (the recorded sayings of the masters, such as the [[Linji Yixuan#Linji yü lü|Linji yü lü]]); and the various koan-collections,{{refn|group=note|The two best known koan-collections (in the west) are the "Gateless Gate" and the "Blue Cliff Record". ''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (Chinese: 無門關 Wumenguan; Japanese: Mumonkan) is a collection of 48 kōans and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk [[Wumen]] (無門) (1183–1260). The title may be more accurately rendered as ''Gateless Barrier'' or ''Gateless Checkpoint''. The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: 碧巖錄 Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku) is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (圜悟克勤 1063–1135).}} contain accounts of "enlightenment experiences". These accounts are not verbatim recordings of such "experiences", but well-edited texts, written down decades or even decennia after the supposed sayings and meetings.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown}}

''The [[Denkōroku]]'', "The Record of the Transmission of the Light", written by [[Keizan Jōkin]] 瑩山紹瑾 (1268–1325), is an example of the "Transmission of the Lamp" genre. It contains literary accounts of the patriarchs of the Soto-lineage, from [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] to [[Koun Ejō]], in which kensho plays a central role. They are not to be taken as literal accounts of awakening, but as stories underpinning the legitimacy of the [[Sōtō|Dogen-shu]], which in its early history had seen a fierce internal conflict over the correct lineage during the [[Sandai sōron]].{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=xi-xii}}{{sfn|Faure|2000}}{{refn|group=note|Cook: "It is probably safe to say that few if any reputable modern scholars, and probably not many even within the Soto priesthood itself, believe that many of the central events and characters in the ''Denkoroku'' are based on historical fact [...] The origins and early developments of Chinese Zen are just now becoming clearer, and the gradually emerging picture is very different from the traditional Zen history found in such works as Keizan's record".{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=15}}}}

The Denkoroku gives the following account of Dogen's awakening:
{{quote|Once, during late-night zazen, [[Rujing]] told the monks, "Studying Zen is the dropping off of body and mind." Hearing this, the master was suddenly greatly awakened. He went at once to the Abbott's room and burned incense. Rujing asked him, "Why are you burning incense?" The master answered, "Body and mind have dropped off." Rujing said, "Body and mind have dropped off, the dropped-off body and mind." The master said, "This is a temporarily ability; you must not approve me without reason." Rujing replied, "I am not approving you without reason." The master asked, "Why are you not approving me without reason?" Rujing said, "You dropped off body and mind." The master bowed. Rujing said, "You have dropped off dropping off."{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=255}}}}

===Contemporary accounts===
Although the Zen tradition is reluctant to speak openly about the 'experience' of kensho,{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}} personal accounts can be found in Zen-texts.

[[Hakuin]] gives this description of his first kensho, when he was 21:{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}
{{quote|At around midnight on the seventh and final night of my practice, the boom of a bell from a distant temple reached my ears: suddenly, my body and mind dropped completely away. I rose clear of even the finest dust. Overwhelmed with joy, I hollered out at the tops of my lungs, "Old Yen-t'ou is alive and well! [...] After that, however, I became extremely proud and arrogant".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=23}}}}

Hakuin's ''kensho'' was not approved by Shoju Rojin, who subjected Hakuin to more koan-training. This resulted in a second kensho, where-after Hakuin left Shoju Rojin. It was only when he was 41 that he attained "his final great enlightenment":{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}
{{quote|[W]hen Shoju had asked his reason for becoming a monk, his reply – that he had done it because he was afraid of falling into hell – had brought the scornful retort: "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!" Not until eighteen years later, upon attainment of his final great enlightenment at the age of forty-one, would Hakuin fully grasp the significance of Shoju's reproach and with it the true meaning of "post-satori" practice. Years later, when Hakuin asked his student Torei the same question, Torei's answer – "To work for the salvation of my fellow beings" – brought a laugh from Hakuin. "A much better reason than mine", he said.{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}}}

Keido Fukushima, a 20th-century Rinzai abbott, gives the following description:
{{quote|At Nanzenji there is a small hill. I used to walk near there, look at it, and often smile at the high school students who walked by there as well. One day as I walked by, I looked at the hill and it was truly amazing. i was totally lost as if there was no 'me'. I stood gazing at the hill. Some students walked by and one of them said something like 'look at that crazy monk'. Finally I came out of it. Life was never the same for me. I was free.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Harris: "After this experience Gensho still had two more years of ''koan'' study".{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}}}}}}

===Spontaneous kenshō===
Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher. For example, Richard Clarke (1933), who studied with [[Philip Kapleau]], states that he had a spontaneous kensho when he was 13.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud040421.htm Japanischer Buddhismus in Amerika. Chronik Ab 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]] states he had what he described as an "awakening experience" in 1971:&lt;ref group=web name=Genpo&gt;[http://www.kripalu.org/article/313/ Big Mind: An Interview with Genpo Roshi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701071517/http://kripalu.org/article/313/ |date=2014-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was in February of that year, and I was 26 years old. My second serious relationship was ending, and I was feeling very confined and conflicted. I needed to get some space, so I went out to the Mojave desert for a three-day camping weekend with two friends. On the Friday, I hiked up a mountain alone. I knew nothing about meditation or spiritual practice. I was just sitting there, thinking about my life and the things going on. I felt I had gotten pretty screwed up for such a young age.&lt;br/&gt;
I could see my VW camper, my home for the weekend, parked a few miles away, . But at the same time, I was aware that my home was back in Long Beach, California. And a natural koan came to me: Where is home? All of a sudden, I had a kind of breakthrough. I felt myself fall away, and I became one with the cosmos, one with the universe, one with all things. I knew in that moment that wherever I am, that is home; home is everywhere. I also knew who I was, beyond description, but let’s call it Big Mind.&lt;br/&gt;
That experience completely changed my life.&lt;ref group=web name=Genpo /&gt;}}

More descriptions of "spontaneous kensho" can be found throughout the Zen-literature,{{refn|group=note|Sekida gives the example of a woman, who's "strong internal pressure (''gidan'') never stopped knocking from within at the door of her mind, demanding to be resolved [...] One day, when she was about to take a bath, a certain change occurred in her. Although this was later confirmed as kensho by a teacher, she had no idea what it was.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138-139}} Philip Kapleau describes a man who had kensho, which was explained as a "conversion experience" by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Kapleau|1980|p=52}} Flora Courtois gives an extensive account of her spontaneous kensho,{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=111-136}} on which Yasutani comments.{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=137-140}}}} while a classic example may be [[Ramana Maharshi#Awakening|Ramana Maharshi]]'s awakening.

==Training towards kenshō==
{{See also|Zen#Zen practice|l1=Zen practice}}

According to Harris, working towards kensho is usually a lengthy process stretched out over years or even decades.{{sfn|Harris|2004}} Contrary to this, Victor Hori notes that with koan-study kensho may appear within six months.
{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a western [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|sei-kyoshi]]{{sfn|Bluck|2006|p=66}} or soto-priest, also is reported to have attained kensho after six months of tarining in a Soto-monastery.{{sfn|Bluck|2006|p=65}}}}

[[Sōtō]] tends towards a gradual approach, preferring to let the experiences happen on their own. [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] tends toward the use of [[Koan]]s as a technique to unroot the habitual workings of the mind.{{sfn|Kasulis|2003}}

During intensive zazen various [[hallucination]]s and psychological disturbances may arise. These are referred to as [[makyo]]. Distinguishing these delusions from actual kensho is the primary function of the teacher, as the student may be erroneously convinced they have realized kensho.

===Rinzai===
In the [[Rinzai school]], kensho is seen as indispensable:
{{quote|At some point in time we pass from imprisonment in ignorance and delusion to a true vision of Zen realization: "Our enlightenment is timeless, yet our realization of it occurs in time." According to this belief experiencing a moment of awakening in this life is of central importance.{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=4}}}}

In the Rinzai-training, the student is expected to pour oneself totally into both koan-study and daily activities 'to become one' with it.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=290}} Kenshō is used to describe the first breakthrough in [[kōan]] study.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}{{refn|group=note|See {{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=106}} for a description of 'becoming one with'.}}

===Sōtō===
In the [[Sōtō]] school there are two kinds of awakening.{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28}} One is the practice of [[shikantaza]], which is the "actual enlightened activity of the Buddha".{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28}} The other is the accumulation of little bits of understanding, which come together, giving way to a deeper intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28-29}}

The "[[Genjōkōan|genjo-koan]]", or the "koan of everyday life" which "appears naturally in daily life",{{sfn|Dogen|year unknown}} is emphasized. Students are not encouraged to actively seek out kenshō experiences. In Sōtō practice kenshōs "are allowed to occur naturally, as a by-product of practice. Meditative training is seen as the unfolding of one great ''kenshō'':{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}
{{quote|According to the tradition of Soto Zen, although working on a koan is one way of attaining kensho, the best way is zazen. Indeed, [[Dogen]], the founder of Soto Zen, expounded that zazen itself is enlightenment, and as long as the adept maintains a pure state of non-thinking in Zen, he is a Buddha.{{sfn|Kit|2002|p=145}}}}

===Sanbō Kyōdan===
Kenshō also plays a central in the [[Sanbō Kyōdan]], a Japanese Zen organisation which played a decisive role in the transmission of Zen to the [[Zen in the United States|United States]].{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}} Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, was disappointed about the lack of interest in kensho in the Soto school. Yasutani's emphasis on koan training and the importance of kensho was transmitted to his American students:{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}}
{{quote|He was especially vocal concerning the point of kenshō, seeing one's true nature. He spoke more openly about it then anyone of his times, going so far as to have a public acknowledgement of those who had experienced kensho in a post-sesshin ceremony of bowing in gratitude to the three treasures.{{sfn|Jaffe|1979}}}}

It is also reflected in the inclusion of a relative great amount of kensho stories in "The Three Pillars of Zen", written by [[Philip Kapleau]], a student of Yasutani.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

==Training after kenshō==
{{See also|Bodhicitta|Karuṇā|Ten Bulls|Sahaja}}

Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=54, 140}} According to the contemporary Chan Master [[Sheng Yen]]:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}}}

And the contemporary western Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett:
{{quote|One can easily get the impression that realization, kenshō, an experience of enlightenment, or however you wish to phrase it, is the end of Zen training. It is not. It is, rather, a new beginning, an entrance into a more mature phase of Buddhist training. To take it as an ending, and to "dine out" on such an experience without doing the training that will deepen and extend it, is one of the greatest tragedies of which I know. There must be continuous development, otherwise you will be as a wooden statue sitting upon a plinth to be dusted, and the life of Buddha will not increase.{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005|p=225}}}}

To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by [[Linji Yixuan]] in his [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]]{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} which detail the steps on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Path]].

===Seitai choyo===
Post-awakening practice is called ''seitai choyo'', the "long nurturing of the sacred fetus".{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kraft, one of the earliest expressions of this term is found in a 5th-century Chinese translation of the ''Prajnaparamitra Sutra on Benevolent Kings Protecting Their Countries''.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41}} In Chán-texts the term is first used by [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]] (709-788), and in Japan it was introduced by [[Dogen]] who learned it from his teacher T'ien t'ung Ju-ching (1163-1228).{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41}} See also Muso Soseki, ''Dialogues in a Dream translation'', translated by Thomas Yuho Kirchner, for its meaning and application.}} According to Spiegelberg,
{{quote|[I]t means a return to the purely secular life, a complete submersion in work and in the changing events of the world. Thus, for decades, many Zenists, after their awakening, went among the people, living among beggars and leading an existence of hard physical labor. Thus it was proved whether or not the truth received was of permanent value, or whether it would vanish among mundane affairs.{{sfn|Spiegelberg|1957}}}}

During the T'ang-era, the term became associated with the ideal of the recluse who leaves the world.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41-42}} An ideal period of "twenty years" was taken for it, echoing a story from the ''Lotus Sutra'' about a prodigal son who wandered in poverty for twenty years before returning home.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}} References to these twenty years are found throughout the Chán-tradition, for example Linji, who is reported to have studied under Huang-po for twenty years,{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}} and Daito, the founder of [[Daitoku-ji]], who famoulsy spent twenty years living under a bridge with beggars.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}}

===Cultivating bodhicitta===
According to Hakuin, the main aim of [[Dharma transmission#Further practice|"post-satori practice"]]{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxv-xxvii}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Hisamatsu|2002|p=22}} (''gogo no shugyo''{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}} or ''kojo'', "going beyond"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=144}}) is to cultivate the [[Bodhicitta|"Mind of Enlightenment"]],{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=33}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}} "benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching".{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=34}}{{refn|group=note|Shinkichi Takahashi: "After satori, teach."{{sfn|Takahashi|2000|p=165}}}} According to [[Yamada Koun]], "if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho".{{sfn|MacInnes|2007|p=75}} And according to Barry 
{{quote|Post-satori practice for Hakuin meant finally ceasing to be preoccupied with his own personal condition and attainment and to devote himself and his practice to helping and teaching others. Finally, at long last, he realized that true enlightenment is a matter of endless practice and compassionate functioning, not something that occurs once and for all in one great moment on the cushion.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/enlightenmentandnirvana/a/What-Is-Enlightenment.htm Barbara O'Brien, ''What Is Enlightenment? And How Do You Know When You've "Got" It?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also Katsuhiro Yoshizawa, ''The Religious Art of Zen Master Hakuin'', pp.41-45, "Constant practice of the Four Universal Vows".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41-45}}}}}}

===Further practice===
One also has to purify oneself by ongoing practice,{{sfn|Low|2006|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Glassman|2007|p=54}} since 
{{quote|Kensho does not eradicate our unhealthy habits [...] There is a sudden awakening to the fact of "no-self" and then this insight has to be integrated into one's life which means that it has to be embodied and not just be a memory.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/great-heart-zen/entering-heart-zen Gerry Reply by Gerry Shishin Wick]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And "experience" has to be supplemented by intellectual understanding and study of the Buddhist teachings;{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=295-297}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35-37}}{{sfn|Kim|2007|p=115}} otherwise one remains a ''zen temma'', a "Zen devil".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=297}} Finally, these efforts are to result in a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=37-39}}

==Sudden insight==
{{Main|Subitism}}

Kenshō is described as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Sudden and gradual|appearing suddenly]], upon an interaction with someone else, at hearing or reading some significant phrase, or at the perceiving of an unexpected sound or sight.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} The idea of "sudden insight" has been [[Chinese Chán#Shenhui and Huineng|hotly debated]] in the history of Zen. It became part of the [[Zen#Traditional Zen Narrative (TZN)|Traditional Zen Narrative]] in the 8th century.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. The contemporary Korean Seon master [[Seongcheol]] opposed this, emphasizing [[Seongcheol#Sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation|"sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation"]]. But Jiyu-Kennett, a contemporary western teacher, warns that attaining kenshō does not mean that a person is free from morality, the laws of karma, or the consequences of ones actions.{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|1979|p=51}} This warning is reflected in the [[Wild fox koan]].

==Mushi-dokugo and mushi-dokkaku==
{{Main|Mushi-dokugo}}

Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher,{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138-139}} as in the case of [[mushi-dokugo]]{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=48}} or (mushi-)dokkaku, a self-awakened [[pratyeka-buddha]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sanbo-zen.org/kyosho_350_e.pdf Kyosho. The Awakening Gong. No.350, September/October 2011. Pages 14-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628090745/http://www.sanbo-zen.org/kyosho_350_e.pdf |date=2013-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the literal meaning is self-awakened, or awakened on one's own, the emphasis in Zen, when using these terms, lies in the ultimate reliance on one's own insight, instead of the authority of a teacher:
{{quote|It is awakening that is one's true master.  With Shakyamuni, the awakening was his master.  In other words, the awakened self is one's master.  Apart from getting awakened to that master, there is no awakening.  Here practitioner and master are of one body, not two.  Instead of having another verify or confirm one's awakening, one does so for oneself.  Of course in this case the self that is verified and the master who does verification are undivided.  In their being completely identical is the autonomous, independent, or ultimate nature of the authenticity.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.fas.x0.com/writings/hisamatsu/onmutuallygoingintothematterofself.htm Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, ''On Mutually Going Into The Matter Of Self'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Similarities with other traditions==
While the Japanese term "kenshō" is generally used by practitioners of Zen Buddhism, the insight it refers to is not limited to Japanese Zen Buddhism, or even to Buddhism in general.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2000}}{{sfn|Grimstone|1985|p=13}}

===Theravada===
{{Main|Theravada|Vipassana|Vipassana movement}}

The [[Theravada]] tradition, which is best known in the west through the modern [[Vipassana movement]], discerns [[four stages of enlightenment]], in which [[Nirvana]] is being reached in four succeeding sudden steps of insight.

===Dzogchen===
{{Main|Dzogchen|Rigpa}}

The Dzogchen-traditions states that the ultimate nature of all sentient beings is ''pure, all-encompassing, primordial awareness'', or ''naturally occurring timeless awareness''. This intrinsic awareness has no form of its own, and yet is capable of perceiving, experiencing, reflecting, or expressing all form. It does so without being affected by those forms in any ultimate, permanent way.

The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. [[Rigpa]] is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity,{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}} which cannot be found by searching nor identified.{{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} One ''knows'' that there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=144-145}}

===Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Advaita}}

In Advaita Vedanta [[moksha]] is attained by [[jnana]], insight-knowledge. In [[Shankaracharya|Shankara's]] philosophical synthesis insight [[samadhi]] is used as a subsidiary to this goal. [[Swami Vivekananda]] emphasized the ''experience'' of nirvikalpa samadhi as a means to validate religious, transcendental knowledge.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

'''''Khôra''''' (also '''''chora'''''; {{lang-grc|χώρα}}) was the territory of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] ''[[polis]]'' outside the city proper. The term has been used in [[philosophy]] by [[Plato]] to designate a receptacle (as a “third kind” [''triton genos'']; ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 48e4), a space, a material substratum, or an interval. In Plato's account, ''khôra'' is neither being nor nonbeing but an interval between in which the "[[Theory of Forms|forms]]" were originally held; it "gives space" and has maternal overtones (a womb, matrix). [[Jacques Derrida]] has written a short text with the title ''Khôra'',&lt;ref&gt;Derrida J., ''Khôra'', Paris: Galilée 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; using his [[deconstruction]]ist approach to investigate Plato's word usage. It is the origin for the recent interest in this rather obscure Greek term.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Overview==
Key authors addressing ''khôra'' include [[Martin Heidegger]], who refers to a "clearing" in which being happens or takes place. [[Julia Kristeva]] deploys the term as part of her analysis of the difference between the semiotic and symbolic realms, in that Plato's concept of "''khora''" is said to anticipate the emancipatory employment of semiotic activity as a way of evading the allegedly phallocentric character of symbolic activity (signification through language), which, following [[Jacques Lacan]], is regarded as an inherently limiting and oppressive form of ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]''.

Julia Kristeva articulates the ''khôra'' in terms of a presignifying state: "Although the ''khôra'' can be designated and regulated, it can never be definively posited: as a result, one can situate the ''khôra'' and, if necessary, lend it a topology, but one can never give it axiomatic form."&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, J. 1984 ''Revolution in Poetic Language''. New York, Columbia University Press. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Derrida uses ''khôra'' to name a radical otherness that "gives place" for being. [[Nader El-Bizri]] builds on this by more narrowly taking ''khôra'' to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings.&lt;ref&gt;([[Nader El-Bizri]], 2004, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  El-Bizri's reflections on "''khôra''" are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on ''dwelling'' and on ''being and space'' in [[Heidegger]]'s thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in [[architectural theory]] and in history of philosophy and science, with a focus on geometry and optics.&lt;ref&gt;([[Nader El-Bizri]], 2001, 2004, 2011, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida argues that the [[subjectile]] is like Plato’s ''khôra'', Greek for space, receptacle or site. Plato proposes that the ''khôra'' rests between the sensible and the intelligible, through which everything passes but in which nothing is retained. For example, an image needs to be held by something, just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida, ''khôra'' defies attempts at naming or either/or logic,  which he "deconstructs". See also Derrida's collaborative project with architect [[Peter Eisenmann]], in ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Chora-Works-Jacques-Derrida-Eisenman/dp/1885254407 ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman'']&lt;/ref&gt; The project proposed the construction of a garden in the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, which included a sieve, or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the ''khôra''. The concept of the ''khôra'', distinguished by its elusive properties, would have become a physical reality had the project been realised.

Following Derrida, [[John Caputo]] describes ''khôra'' as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
neither present nor absent, active or passive, the good nor evil, living nor nonliving  - but rather atheological and nonhuman - ''khôra'' is not even a receptacle. ''Khôra'' has no meaning or essence, no identity to fall back upon.  She/it receives all without becoming anything, which is why she/it can become the subject of neither a philosopheme nor mytheme.  In short, the ''khôra'' is tout autre [fully other], very.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caputo|1997|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt; If, as one contributor concludes, "''khôra''" means "space", it is an interesting space that "at times appears to be neither this nor that, at times both this and that," wavering "between the logic of exclusion and that of participation." (Derrida, ''The Name'', 89).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">'''Laboratoire Agit'Art''' was an art collective founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1973 by writer and performer [[Youssouf John]] with goal of revitalising artistic production and critique institutional frameworks and the philosophy of [[Negritude]] in particular. John soon left for Martinique and the group/workshop was handed on to [[Issa Samb]].&lt;ref&gt;p.106, In Senghor′s Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960–1995. Author(s): Elizabeth Harney: Published: 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other key members included {{Interlanguage link multi|El Hadj Sy|fr}} (El Sy), {{Interlanguage link multi|Bouna Medoune Seye|fr}}, [[Djibril Diop Mambéty]], and Youssoupha Dione.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary |title=Glossary of art terms |publisher= [[Tate]] |location=UK |accessdate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MMA-afu11&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=afu#/Key-Events |title= Western and Central Sudan, 1900 A.D.–present: Key Events |work= Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |location=New York |accessdate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group consisting of artists, writers, film-makers, performance artists and musicians. The group was based at Dakar's squatted [[Village des Arts]] until the squatted village was evicted by the army ion 23 September 1983&lt;ref&gt;p. 143, In Senghor′s Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960–1995. Author(s): Elizabeth Harney: Published: 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective made work in a variety of medium, including paint, found objects, sculpture, performance art and street art. Their exhibitions were organised around satyrical theatrical productions of [[Leopold Senghor]] and [[Aime Cesaire]]'s works. The collective marked a move away from [[Negritude]] philosophy of Senghor and Cesaire and towards a more avant-garde critique of both modernism and traditional ideas while still drawing from both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1077">'''Mancuerda''' was a method of [[torture]].  A tight cord was wound around the [[arm]]s of the condemned. The executioner would then throw his entire weight backwards, or the pressure would be exerted by a lever.   

The cord cut through [[skin]] and [[muscle]] directly to the [[bone]].  Additional [[pain]] was produced by the fact that the body of the prisoner was stretched as in a rack, and the belt or girdle attached to the waist also contributed further to the suffering.

The procedure was repeated six or eight times, on different parts of the arms.  People subjected to such torture usually fainted from its effects.

[[Giovanni II Bentivoglio]], tyrant of [[Bologna]], is said to have subjected the astrologer [[Luca Gaurico]] to this method of torture after he was unhappy with a prediction that Gaurico had made.

In [[economics]] and in particular [[neoclassical economics]], the '''marginal product''' or '''marginal physical productivity''' of an input ([[factor of production]]) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm's labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Making of the Classical Theory of Economic Growth|last=Brewer

The marginal product of a given input can be expressed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

as:
:&lt;math&gt;MP =  \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the firm's use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of the "product" is typically defined ignoring [[externalities|external costs and benefits]].

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal "units" are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical [[derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to that input. Suppose a firm's output ''Y'' is given by the production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' and ''L'' are inputs to production (say, capital and labor). Then the marginal product of capital (''MPK'') and marginal product of labor (''MPL'') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MPL=\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}&lt;/math&gt;

In the "law" of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]], the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has ''decreased'' the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing [[marginal productivity of labor]].

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the [[total product]] curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of [[perfect competition|competitive markets]], the [[marginal product of labor]] equals the [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good,  the [[marginal product of capital]] equals its [[rate of profit|rate of return]]. As was shown in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

'''Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP)'''

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

A '''Mars cycler''' (or '''Earth–Mars cycler''') is a special kind of spacecraft [[trajectory]] that encounters [[Earth]] and [[Mars]] on a regular basis. The term '''Mars cycler''' may also refer to a spacecraft on a Mars cycler trajectory. The '''Aldrin cycler''' is an example of a Mars cycler.

Cyclers are potentially useful for transporting people or materials between those bodies using minimal propellant (relying on [[Gravity assist|gravity-assist]] flybys for most trajectory changes), and can carry heavy radiation shielding to protect people in transit from [[cosmic rays]] and [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]].

==Earth–Mars cyclers==
A cycler is a [[Interplanetary spaceflight#Cyclers|trajectory]] that encounters two or more bodies on a regular basis. Once the orbit is established, no propulsion is required to shuttle between the two bodies on a regular basis, although some minor corrections may be necessary due to small perturbations in the orbit. The use of cyclers was considered in 1969 by Walter M. Hollister, who examined the case of an Earth-Venus cycler.{{sfn|Hollister|1969|p=366}}  

Cycler trajectories between Earth and Mars occur in whole-number multiples of the [[synodic period]] between the two planets, which is about 2.135 Earth years. A Martian year is 1.8808 Earth years, so Mars makes eight orbits of the Sun in about the same time as Earth makes 15.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|p=334}} In 1985, [[Buzz Aldrin]] presented an extension of his earlier Lunar cycler work which identified a Mars cycler corresponding to a single synodic period.{{sfn|Aldrin|1985|pp=3-10}} The Aldrin cycler (as it is now known) makes a single eccentric loop around the Sun. It travels from Earth to Mars orbit in 146 days, spends the next 16 months beyond the orbit of Mars, and another 146 days from the Martian orbit back to Earth.{{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=6}}

The existence of the now-eponymous Aldrin Cycler was calculated and confirmed by scientists at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] later that year, along with the VISIT-1 and VISIT-2 cyclers proposed by John Niehoff in 1985.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}} {{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=1}} For each Earth–Mars cycler that isn't a multiple of 7 synodic periods, an outbound cycler intersects Mars on the way out from Earth while an inbound cycler intersects Mars on the way in to Earth. The only difference in these trajectories is the date in the synodic period in which the vehicle is launched from Earth. Earth–Mars cyclers with a multiple of 7 synodic periods return to Earth at nearly the same point in its orbit and may encounter Earth and/or Mars multiple times during each cycle. VISIT 1 encounters Earth 3 times and Mars 4 times in 15 years. VISIT 2 encounters Earth 5 times and Mars 2 times in 15 years.{{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=6}} Some possible Earth–Mars cyclers include the following:{{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=6}}

A detailed survey of Earth–Mars cycler trajectories was conducted by Russell and Ocampo. They identified 24 Earth-Mars cyclers with periods of two to four synodic periods, and 92 cyclers with periods of five or six synodic periods. They also found hundreds of non-ballistic cyclers, ones which would require some powered maneuvers.{{sfn|Russell|Ocampo|2004|p=321}}

==Physics==
[[File:Aldrin Cycler.gif|thumb|right|A Mars cycler is an elliptical orbit (green) that crosses the orbits of Earth (blue) and Mars (red), and encounters both planets at the points where it crosses their orbits, although not necessarily on every orbit. (Not to scale)]]
[[File:Gravity assist velocity diagram.png|thumb|Gravity assist velocity diagram.]]

The shape of the cycler can be obtained from the [[conic equation]]:

Earth orbits the Sun in one Earth year, Mars in 1.0888. Neither orbit is perfectly circular; Earth has an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.0168, and Mars of 0.0934. The two orbits are not quite coplanar either, as the orbit of Mars in inclined by 1.85 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] to that of Earth. The effect of the gravity of Mars on the cycler orbits is almost negligible, but that of the far more massive Earth needs to be considered. If we ignore these factors, and approximate Mars's orbital period as 1.875 Earth years, then 15 Earth years is 8 Martian years. In the diagram opposite, a spacecraft in an Aldrin cycler orbit that starts from Earth at point E1 will encounter Mars at M1. When it gets back to E1 just over two Earth years later, Earth will no longer be there, but it will encounter Earth again at E2, which is 51.4 degrees, {{frac|1|7}} of an Earth orbit, further round.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}
:&lt;math&gt;r = a(1 - \epsilon^2)/(1 + \epsilon \cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;
Where r is 1 [[astronomical unit]], a is the [[semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]], ''&amp;epsilon;'' is the orbital eccentricity and ''&amp;theta;'' is -25.7 (half of -50.4). We can obtain a by solving [[Lambert's problem]] with 50.4 as the initial and final transfer angle. This gives us:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 1.60&lt;/math&gt;
Solving the [[quadratic equation]] gives us:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0.393&lt;/math&gt;
with an orbital period of 2.02 years.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}

The angle at which the spacecraft flies past Earth, ''&amp;gamma;'', is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \gamma = (\epsilon r/(a(1 - \epsilon^2))) \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;
Substituting the values given and derived above gives us a value for ''&amp;gamma;'' of 7.18 degrees. We can calculate the [[gravity assist]] from Earth:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = 2 V \sin \gamma&lt;/math&gt;
where V is the heliocentric flyby velocity. This can be calculated from:
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_E (2 - r/a)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{SubSup|V|E}} is the velocity of Earth, which is 29.8 km/s. Substituting gives us V = 34.9 km/s, and {{DELTA}}V = 8.73 km/s.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}

The excess speed is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\infty = (V^2 + V_E^2 -2 V V_E \cos \gamma)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
Which gives us a value for {{SubSup|V|∞}} of 6.54 km/s. The turn angle {{delta}} can be calculated from:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = 2 V_\infty \sin \delta&lt;/math&gt;
Which gives us {{delta}} = 41.9 degrees, meaning that we have an 83.8 degree turn. The radius of closest approach to Earth {{SubSup|r|p}}will be given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \delta = 1 / (1 + (r_p V_\infty^2 / \mu_E)&lt;/math&gt;
Where {{SubSup|μ|E}} is the [[gravitational constant]] of the Earth. Substituting the values gives us {{SubSup|r|p}} = {{convert|4640|km}}, which is bad because the radius of the Earth is {{convert|6371|km}}. A correction would therefore be required to comfortably avoid the planet.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}

==Theoretical usage==
[[File:Aldrin Cycler 2.gif|thumb|Rather than wait for the cycler to come around again, Aldrin proposed using a second cycler to make the return trip. (Not to scale)]]
Aldrin proposed a pair of Mars cycler vehicles providing regular transport between Earth and Mars.{{sfn|Aldrin|1985|pp=3-10}} While the astronauts traveling to the Moon could do so in a small spacecraft, a mission to Mars would require something much larger. Astronauts would need a much larger facility with life support, living space and radiation shielding for the much longer journey.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}}&lt;ref name="Roadmap"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Aldrin |first1= Buzz |author-link1=Buzz Aldrin |first2= David |last2= Noland |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a333/2076326/ |title= Buzz Aldrin's Roadmap To Mars - A PM Exclusive |magazine= Popular Mechanics |date= 13 December 2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 NASA study estimated that a mission to Mars would require lifting about {{convert|437|t|ST|sp=us}} into space, of which {{convert|250|t|ST|sp=us}} was propellant. At the going rate of around $20 million per ton, this would cost $8.4 billion.&lt;ref name="Damn Interesting" /&gt;

Aldrin proposed that the costs of Mars missions could be greatly reduced by use of large space stations, called "castles", in cyclic orbits. Once established in their orbits, they would make regular trips between Earth and Mars without requiring any propellant. Items other than consumables would therefore have to be launched only once.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}}&lt;ref name="Roadmap" /&gt; Two castles would be used, an outbound one on an Aldrin cycler with a fast transfer to Mars and long trip back, and an inbound one with fast trip to Earth and long return to Mars,{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|p=334}} which Aldrin called up and down escalators.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}}

The astronauts would meet up with the cycler in Earth orbit and later Mars orbit in specialised craft called "taxis". One cycler would travel an outbound route from Earth to Mars in about five months. Another Mars cycler in a complementary trajectory would travel from Mars to Earth, also in about five months. Taxi and cargo vehicles would attach to the cycler at one planet and detach upon reaching the other.&lt;ref name="Damn Interesting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=960 |last=Bellows |first=Alan |title=The Martian Express |publisher=Damn Interesting |date=10 April 2008 |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycler concept would therefore provide for routine safe and economic transport between Earth and Mars.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=114}}

A significant drawback of the cycler concept was that the Aldrin cycler flies by both planets at high speed. A taxi would need to accelerate to {{convert|15000|mph}} around Earth, and {{convert|22000|mph}} near Mars. To get around this, Aldrin proposed what he called a "semi-cycler", in which the castle would slow down around Mars, orbiting it, and later resuming the cycler orbit. This would require fuel to execute the braking and re-cycling maneivers.&lt;ref name="Roadmap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Damn Interesting" /&gt;

The problem of getting the castles into cycler orbits was also considered. It was found that this could be accomplished with considerable savings in fuel by performing a series of low thrust maneuvers.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=114}} Upon launch, the castle would be placed into an interim orbit, and then use the Earth's mass to assist it into the cycler orbit.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|pp=120-121}} Assuming the use of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] fuel, which has a [[specific impulse]] of about 450 s, in the vicinity of Earth, and [[monomethylhydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fuel, as was  employed by the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft for deep space maneuvers, which has a specific impulse of 300 s, it is possible to estimate the fuel required to establish a cycler obit.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=123}}  

In the case of the Aldrin cycler, use of a gravity assist reduces the fuel requirement by about {{convert|24.3|t|ST|sp=us}}, or 15 percent. Other cyclers showed less impressive improvement, due to the shape of their orbits, and when the they encounter the Earth. In the case of the VISIT-1 cycler, the benefit would be around {{convert|0.2|t|ST|sp=us}}, less than one percent, which would hardly justify the additional three years required to establish the orbit.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=123}}

'''Pig Latin''' is a [[language game]] or [[argot]] in which words in [[English language|English]] are altered, usually by adding a fabricated [[suffix]] or by moving the [[Syllable#Onset|onset]] or initial [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]] of a word to the end of the word and adding a [[vocalic]] [[syllable]] to create such a suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/pig-latin/|title=What exactly is Pig Latin, is it a language? And how is it a mystery? - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2010-10-05|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

==Origins and history==
Early mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.&lt;br&gt;
'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | Love's Labour's Lost, William Shakespeare}}

An 1866 article describes a "hog latin" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, "He adds as many new letters as the boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative, says, 'No-ge, I-ge wo-ge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA638&amp;lpg=PA638&amp;dq=%22He+adds+as+many+new+letters+as+the+boys+in+their+%22hog+latin,%22%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=llFXqy226B&amp;sig=s89ZY3kpFsimFFr2f3F-gbN5KdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjegITDjtrJAhWNoYMKHfmGACIQ6AEIGzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20adds%20as%20many%20new%20letters%20as%20the%20boys%20in%20their%20%22hog%20latin%2C%22%22&amp;f=false|work=The Galaxy: A Magazine of Entertaining Reading, Volume 1|page=638|title=Sound and Sense|date=1886|author=Wakeman, George|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is similar to [[Língua do Pê]].

Another early mention of the name was in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]'' in May 1869 "I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing," although the jargon is dog Latin.

''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: "They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with."

The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day".&lt;ref&gt;'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?]&lt;br/&gt;The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing “Pig Latin Love”. The Subtitle “I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day” indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, “(I love you dearie)”, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn’t taken root among the general public yet.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).  The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. [[Merle Travis]] ends his song ''When My Baby Double Talks To Me'' with the phrase, "What a aybybay", where the last word is Pig Latin for "baby".

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today.

Two Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English are "{{lang|en|[[wikt:ixnay|ixnay]]}}" or "icksnay", the Pig Latin version of "{{lang|en|[[wikt:nix#English|nix]]}}" (itself a borrowing of [[German language|German]] ''nichts''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/127424 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;), which is used as a general [[Negative (language)|negative]]; and "{{lang|en|[[wikt:amscray|amscray]]}}", Pig Latin for "{{lang|en|[[wikt:scram#English|scram]]}}", meaning "go away" or "get out of here".&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Barry J.|title=Secret Language: Codes, Tricks, Spies, Thieves, and Symbols|date=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAhYqpnC2H8C&amp;pg=PR48-IA149&amp;dq=ixnay+pig+latin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiputrKgrnUAhUJOz4KHTRJBlUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ixnay%20pig%20latin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicogenesis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

==Rules==
For words that begin with [[consonant]] sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/piglatin.htm|title=Useful phrases in Pig Latin (IgpaAtinlay)|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"pig" = "igpay"
*"latin" = "atinlay"
*"banana" = "ananabay"  
*"happy" = "appyhay"
*"duck" = "uckday"
*"me" = "emay"
*"too" = "ootay"
*"will" = "illway"
*"real" = "ealray"
*"simple" = "implesay"
*"say" = "aysay"
*"bagel" = "agelbay"
*"fail" = "ailfay"
*"poo" = "oopay"
*"party" = "artypay"
*"lonely" = "onelylay"
*"friends" = "iendsfray"
*"Lauren"" = "aurenlay"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin|title=How to Speak Pig Latin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"smile" = "ilesmay"
*"string" = "ingstray"
*"stupid" = "upidstay"
*"glove" = "oveglay"
*"trash" = "ashtray"
*"floor"= "oorflay"
*"store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:
*"eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
*"omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
*"are" = "areway" or "areay"
*"egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
*"explain" = "explainway"
*"always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
*"ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"
*"honest" = "honestway"
*"I"= "Iway"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:
*"every" = "eryevay"
*"another" = "otheranay"
*"under" = "erunday"
*"island" = "andislay"
*"elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.&lt;!--emma  = emmway
Please do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra). Do not add examples of language games that generate words through different patterns (such as, for example, adding nonsense syllables in between vowels or after words, shuffling the order of syllables, or systematically replacing certain phonemes with others. The preceding list is not exhaustive). Such examples should instead be added to the [[Language game]] article.--&gt;

==Current usage==
Pig Latin is mainly used in fun.{{cn|date=September 2018}} It is also used by children or young adults to hide conversation from older people. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: "ehay isay eryvay illysay" = "he is very silly".{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==In other languages==

--&gt;
In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include [[Kedelkloppersprook]], which originated around [[Hamburg]] harbour, and [[Mattenenglisch]] that was used in the ''Matte'', the traditional [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood of [[Bern]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by [[voluntary association]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by ''i'', in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ''ee''.

The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket ("Fig language" – see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game § List of common language games]]).

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli ("container language"). After each word you add the word kontti "container", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,"wikipedia" --&gt; "wikipedia kontti" --&gt; "kokipedia wintti". So converting the sentence "I love you" ("Minä rakastan sinua") would result in "konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti".

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called "Šatra" (/sha-tra/)or "[[Šatrovački]]" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for [[marijuana]] (trava - meaning "grass") turns to "vutra"; the Balkan slang name for [[cocaine]] (belo - meaning "white") turns to lobe, a [[pistol]] (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, [[brother|bro]] (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.

[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louchébem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louchébem'', or ''largonji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : Définition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larlépem largomuche du louchébem. Parler l'argot du boucher''|author=Françoise Robert l'Argenton|publisher=Parlures argotiques|pages=113–125|language=fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|volume=90 n° 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''loucherbem'', the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and replaced by an ''L'', and then a suffix is added at the end of the word (-''oche'', -''em'', -''oque'', etc., depending on the word). Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienquès''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louchébem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en loucedé''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.

Verlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;sw=w&amp;u=umpqua&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA90553064&amp;asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

'''''{{lang|la|Primum non nocere}}''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈpriːmʊ̃n noːn nɔˈkeːrɛ|classical}}) is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "'''first, to do no harm'''." The phrase is sometimes recorded as '''''{{lang|la|primum nil nocere}}'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan%201_2%201800,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201970&amp;tbo=p&amp;q=%22primum+nil+nocere%22&amp;num=10 Google book search, 1800–1970]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-maleficence''', which is derived from the maxim, is one of the principal precepts of [[bioethics]] that all medical students are taught in school and is a fundamental principle throughout the world. Another way to state it is that, "given an existing problem, it may be better not to do something, or even to do nothing, than to risk causing more harm than good." It reminds physicians to consider the possible harm that any intervention might do. It is invoked when debating the use of an intervention that carries an obvious risk of harm but a less certain chance of benefit.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Non-maleficence is often contrasted with its [[corollary]],{{vague|reason=the word is rare, and IMO more often has the meaning "trivial implication", which feels like pretentious chatter in this 'pediac context|date=March 2018}} [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence&lt;!-- $15 word! --&gt;]].

== Origin ==

The origin of the phrase is uncertain. The [[Hippocratic Oath]] includes the promise "to abstain from doing harm" ({{lang-el|ἐπὶ δηλήσει δὲ καὶ ἀδικίῃ εἴρξειν}}) but does not include the precise phrase. Perhaps the closest approximation in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] is in ''Epidemics'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.eastridges.com/wesley/primum.html Primum non nocere]'' &amp;ndash; Tells why "''primum non nocere''" is not actually from Hippocrates, but is a phrase in the ''Epidemics''&lt;/ref&gt; "The physician must ... have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm" (book I, sect. 11, trans. Adams, {{lang-el|ἀσκέειν, περὶ τὰ νουσήματα, δύο, ὠφελέειν, ἢ μὴ βλάπτειν}}).

According to Gonzalo Herranz, Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of Navarre, ''Primum non nocere'' was introduced into American and [[UK|British]] medical culture by [[Worthington Hooker]] in his 1847 book ''Physician and Patient''. Hooker attributed it to the [[Paris]]ian pathologist and clinician [[Auguste François Chomel]] (1788&amp;ndash;1858), the successor of [[René Laennec|Laennec]] in the chair of medical pathology, and the preceptor of [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis|Pierre Louis]]. Apparently, the axiom was part of Chomel's oral teaching.&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of ''primum non nocere''." ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' electronic responses and commentary, 1 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooker, however, was quoting an earlier work by Elisha Bartlett &lt;ref&gt;An Essay on the Philosophy of Medical Science, Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1844 &lt;/ref&gt; who, on pages 288-289, says "The golden axiom of Chomel, that it is only the second law of therapeutics to do good, its first law being this – not to do harm – is gradually finding its way into the medical mind, preventing an incalculable amount of positive ill.”

However,  Hooker used neither the specific expression, nor the traditional Latin phrase. A detailed investigation of the origins of the [[aphorism]] was reported by the clinical pharmacologist Cedric M. Smith in the April 2005 issue of ''[[The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=C. M. |year=2005 |title=Origin and Uses of ''Primum Non Nocere'' – Above All, Do No Harm! |journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=371–77 |doi=10.1177/0091270004273680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the questions of the origin and chronology of appearance of the maxim. Rather than being of ancient origin as usually assumed, the specific expression, and its even more distinctive associated Latin phrase, has been traced back to an attribution to [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624&amp;ndash;1689) in a book by [[Thomas Inman]] (1860), ''Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine''.  Inman's book and his attribution were [[Academic journal#Book reviews|review]]ed by an author who signed simply as "H. H." in ''[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]]'', also in 1860.&lt;ref name="TAJMS"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=[[The American Journal of the Medical Sciences]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QEHAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA450&amp;dq=inman+The+American+Journal+of+the+Medical+Sciences+page+450&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=frwjUaefDIro9ATG1YHgDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inman%20The%20American%20Journal%20of%20the%20Medical%20Sciences%20page%20450&amp;f=false |editor-last=Hays |editor-first=Isaac |editor-link=Isaac Hays |year =1860 |title=Book review of ''Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine'' |author=Inman, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Inman |volume= XL |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=450–58 |publisher=Blanchard and Lea}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An American surgeon, [[L.A. Stimson|L. A. Stimson]], used the expression in 1879 and again in 1906 (in the same journal). That it was in common use by the 20th century is apparent from later mentions, such as by the prominent [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] [[J. Whitridge Williams]] in 1911, as well as detailed discussion of its use in a popular book authored by [[Dr. Morris Fishbein]], editor of ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1930.

The article also reviews the various uses of the now popular aphorism, its limitations as a moral injunction, and its increasingly frequent use in a variety of contexts.

A '''scrap metal shredder''', also sometimes referred to as a metal scrap shredder, is a machine used for reducing the size of scrap metal. Scrap metal shredders come in many different variations and sizes.

==Applications==
Some examples of scrap metal materials that are commonly shredded are:

[[Automotive shredder residue|Auto shredders]] are large machines that turn a car into a large bucket of scrap steel and the rest of the car into non-ferrous materials, plastics and waste. The glass, fabric, plastic, and all other non ferrous materials are separated by eddy current magnets in place of heavy media separation. The non-ferrous materials may be referred to as "zorba."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/07/12/albany-scrap-metal-processor-to-install-massive-shredder|title=Albany scrap metal processor to install massive shredder|last=Cropley|first=John|date=July 12, 2018|website=The Daily Gazette|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the profit from the non ferrous materials covers the operating cost for the auto-shredder.

Metal scrap recycling, also called secondary metal processing, is a large industry that processes, in the U.S. alone, 56 million tons of scrap iron and steel (including 10 million tons of scrap automobiles), 1.5 million tons of scrap copper, 2.5 million tons of scrap aluminum, 1.3 million tons of scrap lead, 300,000 tons of scrap zinc and 800,000 tons of scrap stainless steel, and smaller quantities of other metals, on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/recycling/recycling_scrap_metal.html|title=Recycling - Scrap Metal Recycling|last=|first=|date=|website=US Occupational Safety and Health Administration|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Scrap metal shredders can be equipped with different types of cutting systems: horizontal shaft, vertical shaft, single-shaft, two-shaft, three-shaft and four-shaft cutting systems. These shredder designs can be high speed, medium speed and sometimes slow-speed systems, they always include hammermills of a vertical and horizontal shaft design, and can also include in contrast to hammer mills slow speed technology which are also used to process or shred metal and plastic and other waste materials encountered in the scrap metal industry.
 
The largest scrap metal shredders in the world often have 10,000 hp and are made by a wide range of companies which all originated their designs from the 1966 patent applications of the Newell Group and the Williams Group as the first patented vertical and horizontal designs for auto shredding or scrap metal shredding. Often cited is the 9,200 hp shredder from the Lynxs group at the Sims plant at the mouth of the [[River Usk]] in Newport [[Wales]] with access by [[road]], [[rail transport|rail]] and [[sea]]. This Lynxs shredder can eat 350 cars per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/5893440/the-worlds-biggest-auto-shredder-eats-450-cars-an-hour/|title=The World's Biggest Auto Shredder Eats 450 Cars an Hour|last=Tarantola|first=Andrew|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lynxs shredders are not unique in this high hp range design. Historically the Schnitzer Steel group installed a 10,000 hp unit that they made on their own in 1980, and there are many Newell Shredders that have these high hp designs. A 9,000 horsepower Mega Shredder at Sims Metal Management's Claremont Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey processes 4,000 tons of metal a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/04/behold_the_mega_shredder_jerse.html|title=Behold the Mega Shredder: Jersey City recycling plant turns cars to confetti in seconds|last=|first=|date=April 28, 2013|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-objectification''' is when people view themselves as objects for use instead of as [[Human beings|human being]]s. Self-objectification is a result of [[objectification]], and is commonly discussed in the topic of sex and gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both men and women struggle with self-objectification, but it is most commonly seen among women. According to Calogero, self-objectification explains the psychological process by which women internalise people’s objectification of their bodies, resulting in them constantly criticizing their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://doi.org/10.1007/511199.005.1192-9|title=Sex Roles|last=Calogero|first=R.M|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to objectification ==
Objectification and self-objectification are two different topics, but are closely intertwined. Objectification looks at how society views people (in this case, women) as bodies for someone else's pleasure. This occurs in advertisements where the body but not the face of a woman is shown. These messages put an unrealistic standard on women's bodies, dehumanizing them to an object of visual pleasure,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Arroyo|first = Analisa|last2 = Segrin|first2 = Chris|last3 = Harwood|first3 = Jake|date = 2014-10-01|title = Appearance-Related Communication Mediates the Link Between Self-Objectification and Health and Well-Being Outcomes|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hcre.12036/abstract|journal = Human Communication Research|language = en|volume = 40|issue = 4|pages = 463–482|doi = 10.1111/hcre.12036|issn = 1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-objectification occurs in response. Women start to internalize the message that they are not individual human beings, but objects of beauty, pleasure, and play for men, and they start to look at themselves and their bodies as such.

The perpetuation of self-objectification can be described as a cycle. Objectification causes self-objectification which perpetuates objectification, or causes it to continue, and the cycle goes on. Both [[media (communication)|media]] and [[social interaction]] factor into that cycle as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = McKay|first = Tanjare'|date = 2013|title = Female Self-Objectification: Causes, consequences and prevention|url =http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;context=mcnair|journal = McNair Scholars Research Journal|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media is everywhere, plastering seemingly perfect women across billboards, in music videos, and on covers of magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Aubrey|first = Jennifer Stevens|last2 = Henson|first2 = Jayne R.|last3 = Hopper|first3 = K. Megan|last4 = Smith|first4 = Siobhan E.|date = 2009-11-13|title = A Picture is Worth Twenty Words (About the Self): Testing the Priming Influence of Visual Sexual Objectification on Women's Self-Objectification|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090903293551|journal = Communication Research Reports|volume = 26|issue = 4|pages = 271–284|doi = 10.1080/08824090903293551|issn = 0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideals cause people to put on an unrealistic lens, thinking that they should look and act like the women in the media are portrayed, perpetuating the cycle of self-objectification. Social interactions affect this cycle as well, as the way people communicate with each other subconsciously furthers objectification as well. This type of talk is known as appearance related communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two types of appearance related communication that have had an effect on the existence of self-objectification are fat talk and old talk.

== Appearance-related communication ==
Fat talk, a term coined by Mimi Nichter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nedic.ca/fat-talk |title=Fat Talk |last=Royal |first=Sarah |date=2012 |website=National Eating Disorder Information Centre |access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to women making comments about their own weight, dieting, or justifications of one's eating or exercising habits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It includes comments such as, "I'm out of shape", or "I'm just eating everything today".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who engage in fat talk are more likely to struggle with body dissatisfaction, self-objectification, depression, [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], [[bulimia]], and other [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Old talk refers to negative statements about wrinkles, skin tone, yellowing teeth, and other physical aspects of the natural aging process. Women who engage in old talk are more likely to be dissatisfied with their bodies, engage in self-objectification, suffer from depression and anxiety, and it may even decrease their quality of life and actual lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both fat and old talk result in higher self-objectification, as women measure themselves against and attempt to reach an unrealistic standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In different generations ==
One period of time in a woman's life where self-objectification happens excessively is during pregnancy. Magazines offer pictures of pregnant celebrities with golden skin, toned legs, and a perfectly rounded, "cute" pregnant belly. The photo-editing makes it seem real, and people start to think that is how they ought to look when they are pregnant. Looking at these perfect pictures results in pregnant women feeling worse about themselves and being incredibly self-conscious about their weight even though their weight gain is normal and necessary. They see themselves as not good enough, again, objectifying their identity to a body that needs to be perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hopper|first = K. Megan|last2 = Aubrey|first2 = Jennifer Stevens|date = 2013-12-01|title = Examining the Impact of Celebrity Gossip Magazine Coverage of Pregnant Celebrities on Pregnant Women’s Self-Objectification|url = http://crx.sagepub.com/content/40/6/767|journal = Communication Research|language = en|volume = 40|issue = 6|pages = 767–788|doi = 10.1177/0093650211422062|issn = 0093-6502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also been done on adolescent girls, and what heightens self-objectification at an early age. With the amount of over-sexualized media that children are exposed to, young girls start to identify themselves as a "prize" to be used and given away at an early age. This objectification is fueled heavily by media and the fact that it is highly sexualized. The more a young girl is exposed to media that sexually objectifies women, the more they will internalize those beliefs and ideals and objectify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Vandenbosch|first = Laura|last2 = Eggermont|first2 = Steven|date = 2012|title = Media exposure and girls’ internalization of beauty ideals, self-objectification and body surveillance|url =|journal =|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women as objects ==
[[Social media]] is a battleground for self-objectification. People maintain a social media presence that is different from their real lives. Women are able to filter what they put on their social media sites, weeding out all the less than flattering photos so that they seem to have effortless beauty, infinite happiness, and a life that is all put together. Studies show that women who do this tend to have a higher self-esteem than those who don't because they see their site and see themselves as beautiful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Britt|first = Rebecca|date = 2015|title = Effects of Self-presentation and Social Media Use in Attainment of Beauty Ideals|url =|journal = RedFame|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not necessarily a good thing, however. They feel that their social media site is something that they can control and make themselves beautiful. This is women viewing themselves as an object; an object that has good sides and bad sides; an object for someone else's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her book ''[[The Beauty Myth|Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] talks about how beauty has become a negative, hurtful thing instead of a positive thing. Instead of women having natural beauty, beauty is what men give them. A woman is only beautiful if a man tells her she is beautiful, and women slave away to make themselves beautiful in the eyes of men. That could look like working out before a wedding day or getting up early and putting on make-up before he wakes up. These are examples of women thinking they're not good enough and their beauty comes from the man's opinion and his praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Beauty Myth|last = Wolf|first = Naomi|publisher = William Morrow and Company, INC|year = 1991|isbn =|location = New York|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; These thoughts become subconscious to women, as they internalize them so much that they don't notice them anymore. Most women wouldn't even be able to recognize that they feel the need to look nice for men or view their bodies as an object for men. It is something that is being planted in women's minds by objectification, and then cultivated into self-objectification.

[[File:Likir Gompa monk with injured sparrow.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monk protecting injured sparrow. [[Likir Monastery]], [[Ladakh]], India]]
In [[Buddhism]], '''sentient beings''' are beings with [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], or in some contexts [[life]] itself.&lt;ref name="Getz"&gt;Getz, Daniel A. (2004). "Sentient beings"; cited in Buswell, Robert E. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Volume 2. New York, USA: Macmillan Reference USA. {{ISBN|0-02-865720-9}} (Volume 2): pp.760&lt;/ref&gt; Sentient beings are composed of the five aggregates, or [[skandha]]s: matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. In the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'', the Buddha is recorded as saying that "just as the word 'chariot' exists on the basis of the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of 'being' exists when the five aggregates are available."&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; While distinctions in usage and potential subdivisions or classes of sentient beings vary from one school, teacher, or thinker to another, it principally refers to beings in contrast with [[buddhahood]]. That is, sentient beings are characteristically ''not'' [[bodhi|enlightened]], and are thus confined to the death, rebirth, and [[dukkha]] (suffering) characteristic of [[saṃsāra]].&lt;ref name="Kimura"&gt;Kimura, Kiyotaka (1991). [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/kiyota1.htm The Self in Medieval Japanese Buddhism: Focusing on Dogen]; cited in ''Philosophy East and West''; Volume 41, Number 3, July 1991. University of Hawaii Press: pp.327–340. Accessed 22 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] simultaneously teaches that sentient beings also contain [[Buddha-nature]]—the intrinsic potential to transcend the conditions of saṃsāra and attain [[bodhi|enlightenment]], thereby obtaining [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |title=The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa |accessdate=2008-10-21 |last=Muller |first=Charles A. |year=1995 |work=Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University |quote=In Buddhism, ''t&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;i'' [體] is regarded as the fundamentally enlightened Buddha-mind that is present in all beings, whereas ''yung'' [用] is the manifestation of that mind in actual practice—whether it be a full manifestation (enlightened Buddha) or limited manifestation (ignorant sentient being). |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072632/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=23em|"Those who greatly enlighten illusion are Buddhas; those who are greatly deluded about enlightenment are sentient beings."|—[[Dōgen]]&lt;ref name="Kimura" /&gt;}}

In Mahayana Buddhism, it is to sentient beings that the [[Bodhisattva vow]] of compassion is pledged. Furthermore, and particularly in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''all'' beings (including plant life and even inanimate objects or entities considered "spiritual" or "metaphysical" by conventional Western thought) are or may be considered sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Keiji, Nishitani (ed.)(1976).

These are conceived in terms of various spirits, ancestors, demigods, demons, and so on. One of the ways Tibetans recognize a spirit is through the energy that collects in a perceptual moment. A crescendo of energetic "heat" given off by something indicates a spirit. It is something like when we might say that a rock, a tree, or a cloud formation is "striking" or "dramatic" or "compelling." A rock outcropping that has a strange and arresting shape, that perhaps seems strong and menacing, will indicate the existence of some kind of non-human presence. Likewise, a hollow in a grove of trees where a spring flows and the flora are unusually lush and abundant, that has a particularly inviting and nurturing atmosphere, will likewise present itself as the home of a spirit. The unusual behavior of a natural phenomenon or an animal will suggest the same as will the rain that ends a drought or the sudden irruption of an illness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Getz (2004: p.&amp;nbsp;760) provides a generalist Western Buddhist encyclopedic definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Sentient beings'' is a term used to designate the totality of living, conscious beings that constitute the object and audience of Buddhist teaching. Translating various Sanskrit terms (''jantu, bahu jana, jagat, sattva''), ''sentient beings'' conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion, suffering, and rebirth (Saṃsāra). Less frequently, ''sentient beings'' as a class broadly encompasses all beings possessing consciousness, including Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Getz"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classification==
Early scriptures in the [[Pāli Canon]] and the conventions of the Tibetan ''[[Bhavacakra]]'' classify sentient beings into five categories—divinities, humans, animals, tormented spirits, and denizens of hell—although sometimes the classification adds another category of beings called [[asura (Buddhism)|asura]]s between divinities and humans.&lt;ref name="Getz" /&gt;

[[File:Example of a set.svg|thumb|A set of polygons in an [[Euler diagram]]]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''set''' is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an [[object (mathematics)|object]] in its own right. For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three, written {2,4,6}. The concept of a set is one of the most fundamental in mathematics. Developed at the end of the 19th century, [[set theory]] is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics, and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived. In [[mathematics education]], elementary topics from set theory such as [[Venn diagram]]s are taught at a young age, while more advanced concepts are taught as part of a university degree.

The German word ''Menge'', rendered as "set" in English, was coined by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in his work ''[[The Paradoxes of the Infinite]]''.

==Definition==
[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage with a translation of the original set definition of Georg Cantor. The German word ''Menge'' for ''set'' is translated with ''aggregate'' here.]]
A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. The objects that make up a set (also known as the set's ''[[element (mathematics)|element]]s'' or ''members'') can be anything: numbers, people, letters of the alphabet, other sets, and so on. [[Georg Cantor]], one of the founders of set theory, gave the following definition of a set at the beginning of his ''[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=pdf&amp;no_cache=1&amp;IDDOC=36218 Beiträge zur Begründung der transfiniten Mengenlehre]'':&lt;ref&gt;"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens – welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden – zu einem Ganzen." {{cite web |url=http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610133240/http://brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception [Anschauung] or of our thought—which are called elements of the set.}}

Sets are conventionally denoted with [[capital letters]]. Sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equal [[if and only if]] they have precisely the same elements.&lt;ref name="Stoll"&gt;
{{Cite book  | last = Stoll  | first = Robert  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Sets, Logic and Axiomatic Theories  | publisher = W. H.

For technical reasons, Cantor's definition turned out to be inadequate; today, in contexts where more rigor is required, one can use [[axiomatic set theory]], in which the notion of a "set" is taken as a [[primitive notion]] and the properties of sets are defined by a collection of [[axiom]]s. The most basic properties are that a set can have elements, and that two sets are equal (one and the same) if and only if every element of each set is an element of the other; this property is called the ''extensionality of sets''.

==Describing sets==
{{Main article|Set notation}}
There are two ways of describing, or specifying the members of, a set. One way is by [[intensional definition]], using a rule or semantic description:

:''A'' is the set whose members are the first four positive [[integer]]s.
:''B'' is the set of colors of the [[Flag of France|French flag]].

The second way is by [[extension (semantics)|extension]] – that is, listing each member of the set.  An [[Extensional and intensional definitions|extensional definition]] is denoted by enclosing the list of members in [[curly bracket]]s:

:''C'' = {4, 2, 1, 3}
:''D'' = {blue, white, red}.

One often has the choice of specifying a set either intensionally or extensionally.  In the examples above, for instance, ''A'' = ''C'' and ''B'' = ''D''.

In an extensional definition, a set member can be listed two or more times, for example, {11, 6, 6}.  However, per extensionality, two definitions of sets which differ only in that one of the definitions lists members multiple times define the same set.  Hence, the set {11, 6, 6} is identical to the set {11, 6}. Moreover, the order in which the elements of a set are listed is irrelevant (unlike for a [[sequence]] or [[tuple]]).  We can illustrate these two important points with an example:
:{6, 11} = {11, 6} = {11, 6, 6, 11} .

For sets with many elements, the enumeration of members can be abbreviated. For instance, the set of the first thousand positive integers may be specified extensionally as

:{1, 2, 3, ..., 1000},

where the [[Ellipsis#In mathematical notation|ellipsis]] ("...") indicates that the list continues in the obvious way.

The notation with braces may also be used in an intensional specification of a set.  In this usage, the braces have the meaning "the set of all ...". So, ''E'' = {playing card suits} is the set whose four members are {{nowrap|♠, ♦, ♥, and ♣.}}  A more general form of this is [[set-builder notation]], through which, for instance, the set ''F'' of the twenty smallest integers that are four less than [[square number|perfect square]] can be denoted

:''F'' = {''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4 : ''n'' is an integer; and 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 19}.

In this notation, the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (":") means "such that", and the description can be interpreted as "''F'' is the set of all numbers of the form ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4, such that ''n'' is a whole number in the range from 0 to 19 inclusive." Sometimes the [[vertical bar]] ("|") is used instead of the colon.

==Membership==
{{Main article|Element (mathematics)}}
If ''B'' is a set and ''x'' is one of the objects of ''B'', this is denoted ''x'' ∈ ''B'', and is read as "x belongs to B", or "x is an element of B". If ''y'' is not a member of ''B'' then this is written as ''y'' ∉ ''B'', and is read as "y does not belong to B".

For example, with respect to the sets ''A'' = {1,2,3,4}, ''B'' = {blue, white, red}, and ''F'' = {''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4 : ''n'' is an integer; and 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 19} defined above,
:4 &amp;isin; ''A'' and 12 &amp;isin; ''F''; but
:9 &amp;notin; ''F'' and green &amp;notin; ''B''.

===Subsets===
{{Main article|Subset}}
If every member of set ''A'' is also a member of set ''B'', then ''A'' is said to be a ''subset'' of ''B'', written ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' (also pronounced ''A is contained in B''). Equivalently, we can write ''B'' ⊇ ''A'', read as ''B is a superset of A'', ''B includes A'', or ''B contains A''. The [[relation (mathematics)|relationship]] between sets established by ⊆ is called ''inclusion'' or ''containment''.

If ''A'' is a subset of, but not equal to, ''B'', then ''A'' is called a ''proper subset'' of ''B'', written ''A'' ⊊ ''B'' (''A is a proper subset of B'') or ''B'' ⊋ ''A'' (''B is a proper superset of A'').

The expressions ''A'' ⊂ ''B'' and ''B'' ⊃ ''A'' are used differently by different authors; some authors use them to mean the same as ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' (respectively ''B'' ⊇ ''A''), whereas others use them to mean the same as ''A'' ⊊ ''B'' (respectively ''B'' ⊋ ''A'').

[[File:Venn A subset B.svg|thumb|150px|{{center|''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B''}}]]

Examples:
:* The set of all men is a proper [[subset]] of the set of all people.
:* {1, 3} &amp;sube; {1, 2, 3, 4}.
:* {1, 2, 3, 4} &amp;sube; {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The [[empty set]] is a subset of every set and every set is a subset of itself:
:* &amp;empty; &amp;sube; ''A''.
:* ''A'' &amp;sube; ''A''.

Every set is a subset of the [[universal set]]:
:* ''A'' &amp;sube; ''U''.

An obvious but useful identity, which can often be used to show that two seemingly different sets are equal:
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' = ''B''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} and {{nowrap|''B'' &amp;sube; ''A''}}.

A [[partition of a set]] ''S'' is a set of nonempty subsets of ''S'' such that every element ''x'' in ''S'' is in exactly one of these subsets.

===Power sets===
{{Main article|Power set}}
The power set of a set ''S'' is the set of all subsets of ''S''. The power set contains ''S'' itself and the empty set because these are both subsets of ''S''. For example, the power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1}, {2}, {3}, &amp;empty;}. The power set of a set ''S'' is usually written as ''P''(''S'').

The power set of a finite set with ''n'' elements has 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; elements. For example, the set {1, 2, 3} contains three elements, and the power set shown above contains 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 elements.

The power set of an infinite (either [[countable]] or [[uncountable]]) set is always uncountable. Moreover, the power set of a set is always strictly "bigger" than the original set in the sense that there is no way to pair every element of ''S'' with exactly one element of ''P''(''S''). (There is never an onto map or [[surjection]] from ''S'' onto ''P''(''S'').)

Every partition of a set ''S'' is a subset of the powerset of ''S''.

==Cardinality==
{{Main article|Cardinality}}

The cardinality |&amp;thinsp;''S''&amp;thinsp;| of a set ''S'' is "the number of members of ''S''." For example, if  {{nowrap|1=''B'' = {''blue, white, red''} }}, then {{nowrap|1={{!}}&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;{{!}} = 3.}}

There is a unique set with no members, called the ''[[empty set]]'' (or the ''null set''), which is denoted by the symbol ∅ (other notations are used; see [[empty set]]).  The cardinality of the empty set is zero. For example, the set of all three-sided squares has zero members and thus is the empty set. Though it may seem trivial, the empty set, like the [[0 (number)|number zero]], is important in mathematics. Indeed, the existence of this set is one of the fundamental concepts of [[axiomatic set theory]].

Some sets have [[Infinite set|infinite]] cardinality.  The set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s, for instance, is infinite. Some infinite cardinalities are greater than others.  For instance, the set of [[real number]]s has greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers. However, it can be shown that the cardinality of (which is to say, the number of points on) a [[straight line]] is the same as the cardinality of any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, of the entire [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and indeed of any [[dimension (mathematics)|finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]].

==Special sets==
There are some sets or kinds of sets that hold great mathematical importance and are referred to with such regularity that they have acquired special names and notational conventions to identify them. One of these is the [[empty set]], denoted {} or ∅. A set with exactly one element, x, is a [[unit set]], or singleton, {x}.&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt;

Many of these sets are represented using [[blackboard bold]] or bold typeface. Special sets of numbers include
* '''P''' or ℙ, denoting the set of all [[prime number|primes]]: '''P''' = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...}.
* '''N''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the set of all [[natural number]]s: '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} (sometimes defined excluding 0).
* '''Z''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the set of all [[integer]]s (whether positive, negative or zero): '''Z''' = {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...}.
* '''Q''' or ℚ, denoting the set of all [[rational number]]s (that is, the set of all [[proper fraction|proper]] and [[improper fraction]]s): '''Q''' = {''a''/''b'' : ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''Z''', ''b'' ≠ 0}. For example, 1/4 ∈ '''Q''' and 11/6 ∈ '''Q'''. All integers are in this set since every integer ''a'' can be expressed as the fraction ''a''/1 ('''Z''' ⊊ '''Q''').
* '''R''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the set of all [[real number]]s. This set includes all rational numbers, together with all [[irrational number|irrational]] numbers (that is, [[algebraic number]]s that cannot be rewritten as fractions such as {{radic|2}}, as well as [[transcendental numbers]] such as [[Pi|&amp;pi;]], [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]).
* '''C''' or ℂ, denoting the set of all [[complex number]]s: '''C''' = {''a'' + ''bi'' : ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''R'''}. For example, 1 + 2''i'' ∈ '''C'''.
* '''H''' or ℍ, denoting the set of all [[quaternion]]s: '''H''' = {''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk'' : ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' ∈ '''R'''}. For example, 1 + ''i'' + 2''j'' − ''k'' ∈ '''H'''.

Positive and negative sets are denoted by a superscript - or +. For example, ℚ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; represents the set of positive rational numbers.

Each of the above sets of numbers has an infinite number of elements, and each can be considered to be a proper subset of the sets listed below it. The primes are used less frequently than the others outside of [[number theory]] and related fields.

==Basic operations==
There are several fundamental operations for constructing new sets from given sets.

===Unions===
[[File:Venn0111.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''union''' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted {{nowrap|''A'' ∪ ''B''}}&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main article|Union (set theory)}}
Two sets can be "added" together. The ''union'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''B'', is the set of all things that are members of either ''A'' or ''B''.

Examples:
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2}. }}
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}. }}
:* {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

'''Some basic properties of unions:'''
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''B'' = ''B'' ∪ ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ (''B'' ∪ ''C'') = (''A'' ∪ ''B'') ∪ ''C''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' &amp;sube; (''A'' ∪ ''B'').}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''A'' = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''U'' = ''U''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ &amp;empty; = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''B'' = ''B''.}}

===Intersections===
{{Main article|Intersection (set theory)}}
A new set can also be constructed by determining which members two sets have "in common". The ''intersection'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by {{nowrap|''A'' ∩ ''B'',}} is the set of all things that are members of both ''A'' and ''B''. If {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''B'' = ∅,}} then ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be ''disjoint''.
[[File:Venn0001.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''intersection''' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted {{nowrap|''A'' ∩ ''B''.}}&lt;/div&gt;]]

Examples:
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∩ {1, 2} = {1, 2}.}}
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} ∩ {2, 3} = {2}.}}

'''Some basic properties of intersections:'''
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''B'' = ''B'' ∩ ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ (''B'' ∩ ''C'') = (''A'' ∩ ''B'') ∩ ''C''.}}
:* {{nowrap|''A'' ∩ ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''A'' = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''U'' = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ &amp;empty; = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|    1=''A'' ∩ ''B'' = ''A''.}}

===Complements===
[[File:Venn0100.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''relative complement'''&lt;br/&gt;of ''B'' in ''A''&lt;/div&gt;]]
[[File:Venn1010.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''complement''' of ''A'' in ''U''&lt;/div&gt;]]
[[File:Venn0110.svg|thumb|&lt;div class="center"&gt;The '''symmetric difference''' of ''A'' and ''B''&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main article|Complement (set theory)}}
Two sets can also be "subtracted". The ''relative complement'' of ''B'' in ''A'' (also called the ''set-theoretic difference'' of ''A'' and ''B''), denoted by {{nowrap|''A'' \ ''B''}} (or {{nowrap|''A'' − ''B''}}), is the set of all elements that are members of ''A'' but not members of ''B''. Note that it is valid to "subtract" members of a set that are not in the set, such as removing the element ''green'' from the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, 3};}} doing so has no effect.

In certain settings all sets under discussion are considered to be subsets of a given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]] ''U''. In such cases, {{nowrap|''U'' \ ''A''}} is called the ''absolute complement'' or simply ''complement'' of ''A'', and is denoted by ''A''&amp;prime;.
:* {{nowrap|1=''A''&amp;prime; = ''U'' \ ''A''}}

Examples:
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} \ {1, 2} = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1={1, 2, 3, 4} \ {1, 3} = {2, 4}.}}
:* If ''U'' is the set of integers, ''E'' is the set of even integers, and ''O'' is the set of odd integers, then ''U'' \ ''E'' = ''E''&amp;prime; = ''O''.

Some basic properties of complements:
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''B'' ≠ ''B'' \ ''A''}} for {{nowrap|1=''A'' ≠ ''B''}}.
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∪ ''A''&amp;prime; = ''U''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' ∩ ''A''&amp;prime; = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=(''A''&amp;prime;)&amp;prime; = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=&amp;empty; \ ''A'' = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ &amp;empty; = ''A''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''A'' = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''U'' = &amp;empty;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''A''&amp;prime; = ''A''}} and {{nowrap|1=''A''&amp;prime; \ ''A'' = ''A''&amp;prime;.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''U''&amp;prime; = &amp;empty;}} and {{nowrap|1=&amp;empty;&amp;prime; = ''U''.}}
:* {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''B'' = ''A'' ∩ ''B''&amp;prime;}}.
:* if {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''}} then {{nowrap|1=''A'' \ ''B'' = &amp;empty;.}}

An extension of the complement is the [[symmetric difference]], defined for sets ''A'', ''B'' as
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\Delta\,B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A).&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the symmetric difference of {7,8,9,10} and {9,10,11,12} is the set {7,8,11,12}. The power set of any set becomes a [[Boolean ring]] with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring (with the empty set as neutral element) and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.

===Cartesian product===
{{Main article|Cartesian product}}
A new set can be constructed by associating every element of one set with every element of another set.  The ''Cartesian product'' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by ''A'' × ''B'' is the set of all [[ordered pairs]] (''a'', ''b'') such that ''a'' is a member of ''A'' and ''b'' is a member of ''B''.

Examples:
* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} × {red, white, green} = {(1, red), (1, white), (1, green), (2, red), (2, white), (2, green)}.}}
* {{nowrap|1={1, 2} × {1, 2} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}.}}
* {{nowrap|1={a, b, c} × {d, e, f} = {(a, d), (a, e), (a, f), (b, d), (b, e), (b, f), (c, d), (c, e), (c, f)}.}}

Some basic properties of Cartesian products:
* {{nowrap|1=''A'' × [[∅]] = ∅.}}
* {{nowrap|1=''A'' × (''B'' ∪ ''C'') = (''A'' × ''B'') ∪ (''A'' × ''C'').}}
* {{nowrap|1=(''A'' ∪ ''B'') × ''C'' = (''A'' × ''C'') ∪ (''B'' × ''C'').}}
Let ''A'' and ''B'' be finite sets; then the [[Set (mathematics)#Cardinality|cardinality]] of the Cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities:
* |&amp;thinsp;''A'' × ''B''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''B'' × ''A''&amp;thinsp;| = |&amp;thinsp;''A''&amp;thinsp;| × |&amp;thinsp;''B''&amp;thinsp;|.

==Applications==
Set theory is seen as the foundation from which virtually all of mathematics can be derived. For example, [[Algebraic structure|structures]] in [[abstract algebra]], such as [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], are sets [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under one or more operations.

One of the main applications of naive set theory is constructing [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]].  A relation from a [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''A'' to a [[codomain]] ''B'' is a subset of the Cartesian product ''A'' × ''B''.  Given this concept, we are quick to see that the set ''F'' of all ordered pairs (''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''x'' is real, is quite familiar.  It has a domain set '''R''' and a codomain set that is also '''R''', because the set of all squares is subset of the set of all real numbers.  If placed in functional notation, this relation becomes ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The reason these two are equivalent is for any given value, ''y'' that the function is defined for, its corresponding ordered pair, (''y'', ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a member of the set ''F''.

==Axiomatic set theory==
{{Main article|Axiomatic set theory}}
Although initially [[naive set theory]], which defines a set merely as ''any [[well-defined]]'' collection, was well accepted, it soon ran into several obstacles. It was found that this definition spawned [[:Category:Paradoxes of naive set theory|several paradoxes]], most notably:
*[[Russell's paradox]]—It shows that the "set of all sets that ''do not contain themselves''," i.e. the "set" { ''x'' : ''x'' is a set and ''x'' ∉ ''x'' } does not exist.
*[[Cantor's paradox]]—It shows that "the set of all sets" cannot exist.

The reason is that the phrase ''well-defined'' is not very well-defined. It was important to free set theory of these paradoxes because nearly all of mathematics was being redefined in terms of set theory. In an attempt to avoid these paradoxes, set theory was axiomatized based on [[first-order logic]], and thus '''[[axiomatic set theory]]''' was born.

For most purposes, however, [[naive set theory]] is still useful.

==Principle of inclusion and exclusion==
{{Main|Inclusion–exclusion principle}}
[[Image:A union B.svg|thumb|The inclusion-exclusion principle can be used to calculate the size of the union of sets: the size of the union is the size of the two sets, minus the size of their intersection.]]

The inclusion–exclusion principle is a counting technique that can be used to count the number of elements in a union of two sets, if the size of each set and the size of their intersection are known. It can be expressed symbolically as
:&lt;math&gt; |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|.&lt;/math&gt;

A more general form of the principle can be used to find the cardinality of any finite union of sets:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left|A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3}\cup\ldots\cup A_{n}\right|=&amp; \left(\left|A_{1}\right|+\left|A_{2}\right|+\left|A_{3}\right|+\ldots\left|A_{n}\right|\right) \\
&amp;{} - \left(\left|A_{1}\cap A_{2}\right|+\left|A_{1}\cap A_{3}\right|+\ldots\left|A_{n-1}\cap A_{n}\right|\right) \\
&amp;{} + \ldots \\
&amp;{} + \left(-1\right)^{n-1}\left(\left|A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3}\cap\ldots\cap A_{n}\right|\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== De Morgan's laws ==
[[Augustus De Morgan]] stated [[De Morgan's laws|two laws]] about sets.

If A and B are any two sets then,

* '''(A ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B′'''
The complement of A union B equals the complement of A intersected with the complement of B.

* '''(A ∩ B)′ = A′ ∪ B′'''
The complement of A intersected with B is equal to the complement of A union to the complement of B.

{{Jainism}}
'''Skandha''' (Sanskrit) means "heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings". In contrast to [[Buddhism]] that says Skandha is without any underlying substance or identity, [[Jainism]] posits that all Skandhas are ultimately backed by a combination of  [[Paramanu|Paramanus]] or elementary particles that are indestructible and uncreatable. Skandha is nothing but a combination of [[Paramanu|Paramanus]] (elementary particles). Jainism doesn't include the last four types of aggregates of Buddhism because those phenomena are explained in Jainism by the groupings between fine matter called ([[Karma in Jainism|karma particles]], second last from the list below) and [[Atman (Jainism)|Atman]] [[Dravya|Substance]] (unified individual whose existence is denied in Buddhism). A grouping between matter and Atman is not considered a Skandha but is considered a [[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha (bondage)]].

Each Paramanu has "intensity points" of aridness or cohesiveness that, because of transformation, can increase or decrease between one and infinity. These Paramanus can combine with each other to create Skandhas or Aggregates when there is a difference of two "intensity points", whether it is arid or cohesive or whether having even or odd "intensity points" except the minimum (one) "intensity point". For example, a paramanu with two points of cohesiveness can combine with a [[paramanu]] of four points of cohesiveness or aridness; and that of three points with that of five points and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=545–546|title=Pravachansaara|url=https://ia801904.us.archive.org/1/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.321516/2015.321516.Pravachanasara.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given in [[Pravachanasara]].

Skandhas and Paramanus are two types of [[Pudgala]]s (Matter).

Skandha are of six types: Gross-gross, gross, gross-fine, fine-gross, fine, and fine-fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=27|title=Niyamsara|url=https://ia600209.us.archive.org/27/items/Niyamsara/Niyamsara%20%28The%20Perfect%20Law%29_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is given in [[Niyamsara]].
# Gross-gross: Solids, such as stone and wood, that when broken cannot be united again by themselves.
# Gross: Milk, water, etc. separated but can unite without any help.
# Gross-fine: The sunlight, shade, moon light, darkness etc. One is not able to split them. One is not able to  grab them with his hands.
# Fine-gross: The objects of the four senses of touch, taste, smell, and hearing are even though are known by skin, tongue, nose and ears but still cannot be perceived by eyes and that is why they are fine-gross in nature.
# Fine: The matter particles of the [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] are fine in nature and cannot be perceived by any of the physical senses.
# Fine-fine: Finer than the karma particles are extremely fine in nature. They are finer than karma particles.

A '''skull cup''' is a drinking vessel or eating bowl made from an inverted human [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]] that has been cut away from the rest of the [[skull]].  The use of a [[human skull]] as a drinking [[cup]] in ritual use or as a trophy is reported in numerous sources throughout history and among various peoples, and among Western cultures is most often associated with the historically nomadic cultures of the [[Eurasia]]n [[steppe]].

==Asia==
According to Herodotus' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]], [[Scythians]] killed their enemies and made their skulls into drinking cups.  The oldest record in the Chinese annals of the skull-cup tradition dates from the last years of the [[Spring and Autumn period]], when the victors of the [[Battle of Jinyang]] in 453 BC made the skull of their enemy into a winecup.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian [[s:zh:史記/卷086|vol.86]]: 趙襄子最怨智伯，漆其頭以為飲器。&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' recorded the practice among the ancient [[Xiongnu]] of present-day [[Mongolia]]. [[Laoshang Chanyu|Laoshang]] (or Jizhu), son of the Xiongnu chieftain [[Modu Chanyu]], killed the king of the [[Yuezhi]] around 162 BC, and in accordance with their tradition, "made a drinking cup out of his skull".&lt;ref&gt;[[Shiji]] 123.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biography of the envoy [[Zhang Qian]] in ''[[Book of Han|Han shu]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Han shu'', 94B, p.&amp;nbsp;3a; Yu Yingshi, ''Trade and Expansion in Han China'', 1967:218.&lt;/ref&gt; the drinking cup made from the skull of the Yuezhi king was later used when the Xiongnu concluded a treaty with two Han ambassadors during the reign of Emperor Yuan (49-33 BC). To seal the convention, the Chinese ambassadors drank blood from the skull cup with the Xiongnu chiefs.

In 1510, Shah [[Ismail I]] defeated and slew [[Muhammad Shaybani]] in battle, founder of the [[Shaybanid Empire]] in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]. The Shah had his enemy's body dismembered and the parts were sent to various areas of the empire for display, while his skull was coated in gold and made into a jewelled drinking goblet.

In [[Japan]], the famed warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]] led a number of campaigns against the Azai and Asakura clans beginning in 1570. Following his victories at the [[siege]]s of [[Siege of Odani Castle|Odani]] and [[Siege of Ichijōdani Castle|Ichijōdani Castle]]s in 1573, he took the skulls of [[Azai Nagamasa]], his father [[Azai Hisamasa|Hisamasa]], and [[Asakura Yoshikage]] and had them prepared for display and for use as ''[[sake]]'' cups (''[[sake set|o-choko]]'').&lt;ref name=west143&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weston |first= Mark|title= Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women|publisher= Kodansha International|place= NYC |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike skull cups of other cultures, which might resemble a bowl or a [[chalice]] in the finished form, the Japanese artisans excised a shallow, saucer-shaped portion from the top of the each skull, then [[lacquer]]ed the skulls, covered them in [[gold leaf]], and each cup was set in the aperture from which it had been cut, [[wikt: concave|concave]] side up. Nobunaga then presented the three skulls to his vassals and drank ''sake'' from the cups, in order to demonstrate the fate of those who would oppose or betray him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuwata |first= Tadachika | script-title=ja:信長公記 | year= 1997 | publisher= Shinjinbutsu| location= Tokyo |language= Japanese |trans-title=[[Shinchō kōki]] (Chronicle of Nobunaga) |isbn= 4-404-02493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three skulls were probably lost when [[Azuchi Castle]] was destroyed in 1582.

In India and Tibet the skull cup is known as a ''[[Kapala]]'', and is used in [[Buddhist]] [[tantra|tantric]] and [[Hindu]] [[tantra|tantric]] rituals. The skull does not belong to an enemy, and indeed the identity of the skull's original owner is not considered significant, as ritual purity in death has divested the human soul from its corporeal form. Hindu deities such as [[Kali]] are sometimes depicted holding a ''kapala'' full of human blood. Many carved and elaborately mounted ''kapalas'' survive, mostly in Tibet.

The [[Scythia]]ns are reported by [[Herodotus]] (ca.484 – ca.425 BC) and later [[Strabo]] (63/64 BC&amp;nbsp;– ca.24 AD) to have drunk from the skulls of their enemies.

According to [[Paul the Deacon]]'s ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'', when the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]] defeated the [[Gepids]], hereditary enemies of his people, in 567 AD, he then slew their new king Cunimund, fashioned a drinking-cup from his skull, and took his daughter Rosamund as a wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924027767593  |title=''History of the Langobards'' |author= [[Paul the Deacon]]|year= 1907 | publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press| location= [[Philadelphia]] |accessdate= |others=translator: [[William Dudley Foulke]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krum]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] was said by [[Theophanes the Confessor]], [[Joannes Zonaras]], Mannases Chronicle, and others, to have made a jeweled cup from the skull of the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Nicephorus I]] (811 AD) after killing him in the [[Battle of Pliska]].

The [[Russian Primary Chronicle]] reports that the skull of [[Svyatoslav I]] of [[Kiev]] was made into a chalice by the [[Pecheneg]] [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] in 972 AD. He likely intended this as a compliment to Sviatoslav; sources report that Kurya and his wife drank from the skull and prayed for a son as brave as the deceased Rus warlord.

According to [[George Akropolites]] the skull of [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] was made into a drinking cup by the Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] (c.  1205).

According to legend, after the Pirate [[Blackbeard]] was killed and beheaded in 1718, his skull was made into a drinking cup.

In 19th century [[England]], the poet [[Lord Byron]] used a skull his gardener had found at [[Newstead Abbey]] as a drinking vessel. "There had been found by the gardener, in digging,  a skull that had probably belonged to some jolly monk or friar of the Abbey, about the time it was demonasteried. Observing it to be of giant size, and in a perfect state of preservation, a strange fancy seized me of having it set and mounted as a drinking cup. I accordingly sent it to town, and it returned with a very high polish and of a mottled colour like tortoiseshell".  Byron even wrote a darkly witty drinking poem as if inscribed upon it,  “Lines Inscribed upon a Cup Formed from a Skull”.&lt;ref&gt;Newstead, 1808&lt;/ref&gt; The cup, filled with [[claret]], was passed around "in imitation of the [[Goths]] of old", among the Order of the Skull that Byron founded at Newstead, "whilst many a grim joke was cut at its expense", Byron recalled to Thomas Medwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Thomas |first= Medwin| title= Conversations of Lord Byron: noted during a residence with his lordship |year= 1824 |page= 70f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''spin network''' is a type of diagram which can be used to represent [[Quantum state|states]] and interactions between [[Particle physics|particles]] and [[Quantum field theory|fields]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. From a [[mathematical]] perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent [[multilinear function]]s and functions between [[representation theory|representations]] of [[matrix group]]s. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. 

[[Roger Penrose]] is credited with the invention of spin networks in 1971,&lt;ref name=Penrose71/&gt; although similar diagrammatic techniques existed before his time. Spin networks have been applied to the theory of [[Quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] by [[Carlo Rovelli]], [[Lee Smolin]], [[Jorge Pullin]], [[Rodolfo Gambini]] and others. 

Spin networks can also be used to construct a particular [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[connection (mathematics)|connections]] which is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.

== Definition ==

=== Penrose's original definition ===
A spin network, as described in Penrose (1971),&lt;ref name=Penrose71&gt;R. Penrose (1971a), "Angular momentum: an approach to combinatorial spacetime," in T. Bastin (ed.), ''Quantum Theory and Beyond'', Cambridge University Press (this paper can be found online on [[John C. Baez]]'s [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/penrose/ website]); and R. Penrose (1971b), "Applications of negative dimensional tensors," in D. J. A. Welsh (ed.), ''Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications'' ([[Proceedings|Proc.]] [[Academic conference|Conf.]], Oxford, 1969), Academic Press, pp. 221–244, esp. p. 241 (the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to Roger Penrose, [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tweb/00001/#05 "On the Origins of Twistor Theory"] in: ''Gravitation and Geometry, a Volume in Honour of [[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|I. Robinson]]'', Biblipolis, Naples 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the [[world line]] of a "unit" (either an [[elementary particle]] or a compound system of particles). Three line segments join at each vertex. A vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit. Diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called ''closed spin networks''. Time may be viewed as going in one direction, such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram, but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations.

Each line segment is labelled with an integer called a [[spin number]]. A unit with spin number ''n'' is called an ''n''-unit and has [[angular momentum]] ''nħ/2'', where ''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. For [[boson]]s, such as [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s, ''n'' is an even number. For [[fermion]]s, such as [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s, ''n'' is odd.

Given any closed spin network, a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the ''norm'' of the spin network. Norms can be used to calculate the [[probabilities]] of various spin values. A network whose norm is zero has zero probability of occurrence. The rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article. However, they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm, two requirements must be met at each vertex. Suppose a vertex joins three units with spin numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. Then, these requirements are stated as:
* [[Triangle inequality]]: ''a'' must be less than or equal to ''b'' + ''c'', ''b'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''c'', and ''c'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''b''.
* Fermion conservation: ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be an even number.
For example, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 is odd, and ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 9 is impossible since 9 &gt; 3 + 4. However, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 5 is possible since 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 is even, and the triangle inequality is satisfied. 
Some conventions use labellings by half-integers, with the condition that the sum ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be a whole number.

=== Formal definition ===
More formally, a spin network is a (directed) [[graph theory|graph]] whose [[graph theory|edges]] are associated with [[Irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[Representations of Lie groups/algebras|representations]] of a [[Compact group|compact]] [[Lie group]] and whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are associated with [[intertwiner#Representation_theory|intertwiner]]s of the edge representations adjacent to it.

A spin network, immersed into a manifold, can be used to define a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] on this manifold. One computes [[holonomy|holonomies]] of the connection along every link (closed path) of the graph, determines representation matrices corresponding to every link, multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together, and contracts indices in a prescribed way. A remarkable feature of the resulting functional is that it is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.

== Usage in physics ==

=== In the context of loop quantum gravity ===
In [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG), a spin network represents a "quantum state" of the [[gravitational field]] on a 3-dimensional [[hypersurface]]. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, "[[s-knot]]s" - that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under [[diffeomorphisms]]) is [[countable]]&lt;!-- inaccurate - diffeomorphism class? --&gt;; it constitutes a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of LQG [[Hilbert space]].

One of the key results of loop quantum gravity is [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of areas: the operator of the area ''A'' of a two-dimensional surface Σ should have a discrete [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]]. Every '''spin network''' is an [[eigenstate]] of each such operator, and the area eigenvalue equals

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\Sigma} = 8\pi \ell_\text{PL}^2\gamma
\sum_i  \sqrt{j_i(j_i+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum goes over all intersections ''i'' of Σ with the spin network. In this formula,
*{{ell}}&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Planck length]],
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Immirzi parameter]] and
*''j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] associated with the link ''i'' of the spin network.  The two-dimensional area is therefore "concentrated" in the intersections with the spin network.

According to this formula, the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation. Assuming an [[Immirzi parameter]] on the order of 1, this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−66&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices, as with anomalous diffusion models.  Also, the eigenvalues of the area operator ''A'' are constrained by [[ladder symmetry]].

Similar quantization applies to the volume operator. The volume of 3D submanifold that contains part of spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it. One can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary "quantum of volume" and every link is a "quantum of area" surrounding this volume.

=== More general gauge theories ===
Similar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact Lie group G and a [[connection form]]. This is actually an exact [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] over a lattice. Over a [[manifold]] however, assumptions like [[diffeomorphism invariance]] are needed to make the duality exact (smearing [[Wilson loop]]s is tricky). Later, it was generalized by [[Robert Oeckl]] to representations of [[quantum group]]s in 2 and 3 dimensions using the [[Tannaka–Krein duality]].

[[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] have also defined [[string-net]]s using [[tensor category|tensor categories]] that are objects very similar to spin networks. However the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet. [[String-net condensation]] produces [[topological order|topologically ordered]] states in condensed matter.

== Usage in mathematics ==
In mathematics, spin networks have been used to study [[skein module]]s and [[character variety|character varieties]], which correspond to spaces of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]].

'''Teresita Fernández''' (born May 12, 1968) is a visual artist best known for her prominent public sculptures and unconventional use of materials. Fernández's work is characterized by an interest in perception and the psychology of looking. Her experiential, large-scale works are often inspired by landscape and natural phenomena as well as diverse historical and cultural references.&lt;ref name=ArchitecturalDigest-AsAboveSoBelow-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slenske|first1=Michael|title=Teresita Fernández Artworks at Lehman Maupin, Hong Kong, and Mass MoCA|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/teresita-fernandez-brooklyn-artist-installations|work=[[Architectural Digest]]|date=30 September 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's work has explored issues in contemporary art related to perception and the fabrication of the natural world. Often her sculptures present spectacular optical illusions and evoke natural phenomena, land formations, and water in its infinite forms.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roffino|first1=Sara|title=Teresita Fernández with Sara Roffino|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2014/07/art/teresita-fernndez-with-sara-roffino|work=[[The Brooklyn Rail]]|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Fernández was born in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], to Cuban parents in exile. Her family fled [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime in July 1959, six months after the [[Cuban Revolution]]. As a child, she spent much of her time making things in the atelier of her great aunts and grandmother, all whom had been trained as highly skilled couture seamstresses in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Vogue-NuevoNewYork-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Patricia|title=Can Someone Mail a Copy of Nuevo New York to Donald Trump?|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/nuevo-new-york-book-latino-culture|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=23 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Fernández graduated from [[Southwest Miami High School]]. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from [[Florida International University]] in 1990, and a Masters of Fine Art from [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in 1992.

== Career ==
In 1996, Fernández had her first solo exhibition in New York at [[Deitch Projects]], where she transformed the gallery into an empty, indoor swimming pool that was in part inspired by a house designed for [[Josephine Baker]] in 1920's Paris. The following year she was included in an exhibition at [[New Museum]] and in a group show titled "The Crystal Stopper" at [[Lehmann Maupin]] curated by [[Carlos Basualdo]]. Her first solo museum show was at the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia]] in 1999. Soon after that she had solo exhibitions at [[Site Santa Fe]], [[Castello di Rivoli]], and The Centro de Arte Contemporaneo, in [[Málaga]], Spain.

In 2000, Fernández's site-specific project titled "Hothouse" was installed at [[The Museum of Modern Art]]. The work was commissioned as part of "Open Ends," the third and final cycle of "MoMA2000," on view September 28, 2000 through January 2, 2001. The installation, a sprawling vine-like pattern (white on the front and green on the back), meandered across the glass looking out to [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden]].

The [[Public Art Fund]] commissioned Fernández's "Bamboo Cinema" (2001) in New York's [[Madison Square Park]]. The sculpture, a maze-like form made of concentric circles that functioned like an early cinematic device, was made of translucent elements that optically shifted the surroundings like an animated filmstrip. The vertical elements of the sculpture were made of extruded polycarbonate tubes of different diameters that had a green-hued stripe pattern embedded into them. The transparent tubes allowed different degrees of visibility from every angle. As in the earliest examples of cinematic devices, the vertical lines acted as a continuous shutter, constantly interrupting any movement so that it appeared to flicker.

In 2005, she created a piece called "Fire" during her residency at [[The Fabric Workshop and Museum]] that was constructed using thousands of silk threads from [[Franco Scalamandré]]. The dyed silk threads were held taut between two rings and suspended from the ceiling, creating a unique optical illusion of transparency and dense color that appeared to vibrate when experienced by the moving viewer.

In 2006, at the age thirty-five, she became the youngest artist commissioned by the [[Seattle Art Museum]] for the museum's [[Olympic Sculpture Park]]. Her permanently installed work, "[[Seattle Cloud Cover]]" (2006), allows visitors to walk under a block-long covered skyway while viewing the city's skyline appearing through tiny holes in color-saturated glass.

Fernández has made many sculptures out of raw, mined graphite as a way of looking at the intersection between drawing, land art and landscape painting. Her sculpture "Borrowdale (Drawn Waters)" (2009) is a reference to [[Cumbria]], England, the location where graphite was first discovered and mined in the 1500s.

{{quote|1=You can rephrase blindness in terms of the varieties of not-seeing:shadows, darkness, inaccessibility, denial, cloaking, peeking, squinting, hiding, camouflaging. These, too, are degrees of blindness, though less specific to the physicality of the eye and more inextricably linked to thinking, dreaming, and imagining. In my new "Nocturnal" series, I am in fact trying to amplify seeing by dimming it.&lt;ref name=BlindLandscape-USF-Blanton-2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Margaret|last2=Stringfield|first2=Anne|last3=Hickey|first3=Dave|last4=Norr|first4=David Louis|last5=Volk|first5=Gregory|last6=DiMeo Carlozzi|first6=Annette|editor1-last=Norr|editor1-first=David Louis|title=Teresita Fernández: Blind Landscape|date=2009|publisher=JRP Ringier|location=Zurich|isbn=978-3-037-64049-4|format=Exhibition catalog|oclc=466657380}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fernández's "Blind Blue Landscape" (2009) at the renowned Bennesee Art Site in [[Naoshima, Kagawa]] consists of over thirty thousand hand-made mirrored glass cubes installed on a curved wall in the Tadao Ando designed building. Each mirror becomes like a miniature portrait reflecting the dramatic landscape of the [[Seto Inland Sea]] outside.

In 2009, the [[Blanton Museum of Art]], commissioned the large permanent work titled "Stacked Waters" that occupies the museum's Rapoport Atrium. "Stacked Waters" consists of 3,100 square feet of custom-cast acrylic that covers the walls in a striped pattern. The work's title alludes to artist [[Donald Judd]]'s "stack" sculptures—series of identical boxes installed vertically along wall surfaces—as well as to his sculptural explorations of box interiors. Fernández noticed how The Blanton's atrium functions like a box, and given its architectural nods to the arches of Roman baths and cisterns, she sought to fill its spatial volume with an illusion of water.&lt;ref name=Blanton-StackedWaters-Vid-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernández|first1=Teresita|title=Teresita Fernández, Stacked Waters|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2veik-avFNw|work=[[Blanton Museum of Art]]|date=11 August 2011|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanton-StackedWaters-2009&gt;{{cite news|title=Teresita Fernández: Stacked Waters – Austin's Blanton Museum of Art|url=http://blantonmuseum.org/collection/teresita-fernandez-stacked-waters/|work=[[Blanton Museum of Art]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, Fernández had a piece called "Starfield" made up of mirrored glass cubes on anodized aluminum in the [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] in Arlington, Texas.&lt;ref name=CowboysStadiumArt-2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheek|first1=Lawrence W.|last2=Daniels|first2=Brett|last3=Pagel|first3=David|title=Dallas Cowboys Art Collection: Art + Architecture at AT&amp;T Stadium|date=2010|location=Arlington, TX|page=23|url=https://attstadium.com/sites/default/files/dc-content-files/ArtBook.pdf|oclc=657077503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Fernández installed a show at Lehmann Maupin [[Chrystie Street]] titled "Night Writing," which consisted of an installation and a series of large works on paper created at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute. The work explored the idea of how humans have always looked up at the night sky for information, guidance, navigation and time-keeping. The title of the piece comes from an early form of [[braille]] which Fernández used to translate text that became a constellation pattern of perforated holes backed by mirrors – making the work a dynamic, reflective surface.

Fernández's largest solo exhibition to date, "As Above So Below" was recently on view at [[MASS MoCA]] in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]]. Describing a universe in balance, the phrase "as above, so below" originates from the [[Vedas]] and is an idea central to ancient alchemy, in which every action occurring on one level of reality (physical, emotional, or mental) correlates to every other. Fernández applied this concept to scale, suggesting that the vast is present in the tiny and vice versa, a kind of "intimate immensity". Responding to MASS MoCA's massive and light-filled first-floor galleries, Fernández created landscape-like large-scale installations alongside palm-sized sculptures that embodied this expression. The show featured exploration of two-mined, subterranean minerals, gold and graphite, to depict cosmic and light-filled images that refer to the heavens, thus suggesting both the space above and below the viewer.

In 2013, Fernández was featured in a contemporary art installation in the [http://www.thealfondinn.com/about/art_at_the_inn/ Alfond Inn] in [[Winter Park, FL]], as a part of the [[Cornell Fine Arts Museum]]. The work on display is titled "Nocturnal (Cobalt Panorama), c. 2012."&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CubanArtNews-Nocturnal-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=DiazCasas|first1=Rafael|title=Close-Up: Nocturnal (Navigation) by Teresita Fernández|url=http://www.cubanartnews.org/news/close-up-nocturnal-navigation-by-teresita-fernandez/3037|work=Cuban Art News|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2015, "Fata Morgana" opened in New York's [[Madison Square Park]]. The [[Madison Square Park Conservancy]] presented the outdoor sculpture consisting of 500 running feet of golden, mirror-polished discs that create canopies above the pathways around the park's central Oval Lawn.&lt;ref name=WSJ-FataMorgana-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kino|first1=Carol|title=Artist Teresita Fernández Transforms New York's Madison Square Park|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/artist-teresita-fernandez-transforms-new-yorks-madison-square-park-1427814775|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1=In "Fata Morgana" I wanted to invert the traditional notion of outdoor sculpture by addressing all of the active walkways of the park to create an experiential, ambulatory art experience. By hovering over the park in a horizontal canopy, "Fata Morgana" becomes a ghost-like, sculptural, luminous mirage that distorts the landscape and becomes a reflective portrait of urban activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/things-to-do/calendar/mad-sq-art-teresita-fernandez Things to Do: Mad. Sq. Art: Teresita Fernández]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2017, Fernández, in collaboration with [[Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]], created a site-specific installation called "OVERLOOK: Teresita Fernández confronts Frederic Church at Olana" at [[Olana State Historic Site]].&lt;ref name=Olana-OVERLOOK-2017&gt;{{cite web|title=OVERLOOK: Teresita Fernández confronts Frederic Church at Olana A collaboration with the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros|url=http://www.olana.org/overlook/|website=Olana NY State Historic Site|date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olana-OVERLOOK-PressRelease-2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasbrook|first1=Melanie|last2=Barrera Pieck|first2=Mariana|title="OVERLOOK" Exhibition at Olana Features a Groundbreaking Site-Specific Installation by Artist Teresita Fernández|url=http://www.olana.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OVERLOOK-Exhibition-at-Olana-FINAL.pdf|format=Press release|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the work, Fernández juxtaposes the works of landscape artists like [[Frederic Church]], [[Marianne North]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], among others, with images of indigenous people and their fellow travellers in order to examine and illustrate the context of the world that made up their images.&lt;ref name=ArtNewspaper-OUTLOOK-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halperin|first1=Julia|title=Teresita Fernandez wants to change the way you think about American landscapes|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/teresita-fernandez-wants-to-change-the-way-you-think-about-american-landscapes/|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and medium ==
At the core of Teresita Fernández's work is a paradox: she captures the essence of formless elements such as fire, water, and air using undeniably physical materials.&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawrence Alfond|first1=Barbara|last2=Ross Goodman|first2=Abigail|last3=Heller|first3=Ena|editor1-last=Ross Goodman|editor1-first=Abigail|title=Art for Rollins: The Alfond Collection of Contemporary Art. Volume I|date=2013|publisher=Cornell Fine Arts Museum|location=Winter Park, FL|isbn=978-0-979-22802-5|format=Exhibition catalog|oclc=903361166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresita Fernández is an artist well known for large-scale public sculptures and installations made from such diverse materials as thread, aluminum, acrylic, plastic, and glass beads. Although these are industrial materials, Fernández transforms them into forms and shapes that suggest natural phenomena such as waterfalls or sand dunes. This places her along a lineage of artist who explore the relationship between the power of nature and the development of technology.&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013 /&gt;

In her sculptures and drawings, Fernández often leverages non-traditional media to create optical illusions of motion, dissolution, and illumination. Fernández pairing of a conventional subject with an unconventional material reinforces her interest in combining the natural with the industrial or mass-produced.&lt;ref name=ArtForRollins-CornellFineArtsMuseum-2013 /&gt;

== Japanese influences ==
In 1997, Fernández lived in [[Moriya, Ibaraki]], during an artist's residency with [[Arcus Project]]. Fernández cites Japanese culture and sensibility as the greatest inspiration to her work as an artist.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014 /&gt; Fernández states,

{{quote|1=I think a huge part of me must be from Japan and it plays into my work, [particularly with] light and dark. [Like] light and shadows [or] seeing and not seeing. In fact most of my work [is what] that's all about – the idea that darkness, the revered beauty of shadows, is not really "just" dark emptiness, but that darkness is actually very much alive, dynamic. So it's about that reciprocity where darkness only exists where there's light and light only exists where there's darkness—they exist in tandem with one another, they define one another much more than being distant opposites.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014 /&gt;}}

Fernández continues to visit [[Japan]] regularly during the last 18 years and cites her ongoing relationship with Japan as having a significant impact on her and her artwork:

{{quote|1=There is something very particular in Japan that I recognized as oddly familiar and important. For me, the presence that inanimate objects have there is very similar to what art does. As a sculptor, it's very hard to make ordinary, physical materials that very much just want to be what they are, transcend themselves and have a charged presence that affects viewers on a visceral level.&lt;ref name=BrooklynRail-AsAboveSoBelow-2014 /&gt;}}

== Recognition ==
In 2007, established curator [[Lisa Corrin]] of [[Northwestern University]] called Fernández "one of the best-kept secrets in the contemporary-art world."&lt;ref name=Vogue-Profile-2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stringfield|first1=Anne|title=People Are Talking About: Art. The Dazzle: Teresita Fernández makes art that is structurally elegant, thoughtfully compelling, and absolutely luminous|url=http://images.exhibit-e.com/www_lehmannmaupin_com/b719931f.pdf|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=April 2007|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[President Obama]] appointed Fernández to the serve on the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]], a federal panel that advises the President, Congress, and governmental agencies on national matters of design and aesthetics. She is the first Latina to serve on the Commission, and the second person of Latino heritage to serve on the CFA in its over 100-year history. Forty years before her appointment, the last Cuban Ambassador to the United States [[Nicolas Arroyo]] sat on the panel from 1971 to 1976.

In May 2013, Fernández gave the keynote commencement speech at her alma mater, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. Fernández's address was called "On Amnesia, Broken Pottery, and the Inside of a Form." to the graduating class at her alma mater, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]'s School of the Arts, was cited by [[Maria Popova]]'s blog [[Brain Pickings]] as one of the greatest commencement addresses of all time.

Fernández's speech highlighted the values of not giving up, accepting failure and change as a positive, and keeping integrity with accompanied success. Fernandez also offered ten tips for the graduates for help on the creative journey, including 1) Art requires time; 4) Not every project will survive; and 6) "When people say your work is good, do two things: first, don't believe them. Second, ask them, 'why?'"&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014 /&gt;
One of the more significant quotes of the keynote speech helped provide insight into Fernández's philosophy that governs her artwork:

{{quote|1=I was enamored with the idea of how what seemed broken, discarded, useless was transformed into a meaningful gesture… We are conditioned to think that what is broken is lost, or useless or a setback, and so when we set out with big ambitions we don't necessarily recognize what the next graduation is supposed to look like. Unlearning everything you learned in college is just an exercise in learning to recognize how the fragments and small bits lead to something that is much more than the sum of its parts.&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=What It Really Takes to Be an Artist: MacArthur Genius Teresita Fernández's Magnificent Commencement Address|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/29/teresita-fernandez-commencement-address/|work=[[Brain Pickings]]|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fernández parting point could also be considered her most poignant – a reminder that being human is the wider circle within which being an artist resides, and that our art is always the combinatorial product of the fragments of who we are, of our combinatorial character.&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014 /&gt;

{{quote|1=Being an artist is not just about what happens when you are in the studio. The way you live, the people you choose to love and the way you love them, the way you vote, the words that come out of your mouth… will also become the raw material for the art you make.&lt;ref name=BrainPickings-BlindLandscape-2014 /&gt;}}

A '''thematic map''' is a type of [[map]] specifically designed to show a particular theme connected with a specific [[geographic area]].

A 'Thematic map' is a map that focuses on a specific theme or subject area. This is in contrast to ''general reference maps'', which regularly show the variety of phenomena—geological, geographical, political—together.&lt;ref name="Thr07"&gt;{{harvnb|Thrower|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&amp;pg=PA95 95]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fundamentals of Mapping|url = http://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/maps_general.html|website = www.icsm.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast between them lies in the fact that thematic maps use the base data, such as coastlines, boundaries and places, only as points of reference for the phenomenon being mapped. General maps portray the base data, such as landforms, lines of transportation, settlements, and political boundaries, for their own sake.&lt;ref name="Thr07"/&gt; 

Thematic maps emphasize spatial variation of one or a small number of geographic distributions. These distributions may be physical phenomena such as [[climate]] or human characteristics such as [[population density]] and [[health]] issues. Barbara Petchenik&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartz Petchenik |first=Barbara |title=From Place to Space: The Psychological Achievement of Thematic Mapping |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |date=April 1979 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cagis/cagis/1979/00000006/00000001/art00001 |doi=10.1559/152304079784022763}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the difference as "in place, about space." While general reference maps show where something is in space, thematic maps tell a story about that place&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.unomaha.edu/Peterson/funda/Notes/Notes_Exam1/Maps&amp;GIS.htm Maps and GS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312045425/http://maps.unomaha.edu/Peterson/funda/Notes/Notes_Exam1/Maps%26GIS.htm |date=2009-03-12 }}. Accessed 28 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[city map]]).

Thematic maps are sometimes referred to as graphic essays that portray spatial variations and interrelationships of geographical distributions. Location, of course, is important to provide a reference base of where selected phenomena are occurring.

== History ==
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s cholera map about the cholera deaths in London in the 1840s, published 1854.]]
An important cartographic element preceding thematic mapping was the development of accurate base maps.  Improvements in accuracy proceeded at a gradual pace, and even until the mid-17th century, general maps were usually of poor quality.  Still, base maps around this time were good enough to display appropriate information, allowing for the first thematic maps to come into being.

One of the earliest thematic maps was a map entitled ''Designatio orbis christiani'' (1607) by [[Jodocus Hondius]] showing the dispersion of major religions, using [[Map symbolization|map symbols]] in the French edition of his ''Atlas Minor'' (1607).&lt;ref name="Van der Dussen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van der Dussen|first=Jan and Kevin Wilson|title=The History of the Idea of Europe|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by a thematic globe (in the form of a six-[[Gore (segment)|gore]] map) showing the same subject, using Hondius' symbols, by [[Franciscus Haraeus]], entitled: ''Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus'' (1614)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus 1614|url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/agencypubdetail.jsp?agency=85&amp;publicationId=9202&amp;categoryid=15&amp;subcategoryid=67|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early contributor to thematic mapping in England was the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]] (1656–1742).&lt;ref name="Thr07"/&gt; His first significant cartographic contribution was a [[star chart]] of the constellation of the Southern Hemisphere, made during his stay on [[St. Helena]] and published on 1686. In that same year he also published his first [[terrestrial map]] in an article about trade winds, and this map is called the first [[meteorological chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thrower|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701 he published the "New and Correct Chart Shewing the Variations of the Compass", see first image, the first chart to show lines of equal [[magnetic variation]]. 

Another example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]].  Though disease had been mapped thematically, Snow’s cholera map in 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis.  Essentially, his technique and methodology anticipate principles of a geographic information system ([[GIS]]). Starting with an accurate base map of a [[London]] neighborhood which included streets and [[water pump]] locations, Snow mapped out the incidents of [[cholera]] death.  The emerging pattern centered around one particular [[Soho#Broad Street pump|pump on Broad Street]].  At Snow’s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once.  Further investigation of the area revealed the Broad Street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak's first cholera victim.

Another 19th-century example of thematic maps, according to Friendly (2008), was the earliest known [[choropleth map]] in 1826 created by [[Charles Dupin]]. Based on this work [[Louis-Léger Vauthier]] (1815–1901) developed the population [[contour map]], a map that shows the [[population density]] of Paris in 1874 by contours or [[isolines]].&lt;ref name = "MF08"&gt;[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

[[File:A-ZStreet.jpg|thumb|Section of a Street/City map from a [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] Atlas ]]
Thematic maps serve three primary purposes. 
# They provide specific information about particular locations. 
# They provide general information about spatial patterns. 
# They can be used to compare patterns on two or more maps. 
Common examples are maps of demographic data such as population density. When designing a thematic map, cartographers must balance a number of factors in order to effectively represent the data. Besides spatial accuracy, and aesthetics, quirks of human [[visual perception]] and the presentation format must be taken into account.

In addition, the audience is of equal importance. Who will “read” the thematic map and for what purpose helps define how it should be designed. A political scientist might prefer having information mapped within clearly delineated county boundaries ([[choropleth map]]s). A state biologist could certainly benefit from county boundaries being on a map, but nature seldom falls into such smooth, man-made delineations. In which case, a [[dasymetric map]] charts the desired information underneath a transparent county boundary map for easy location referencing.

== Data terminology ==

A thematic map is '''univariate''' if the non-location data is all of the same kind.  Population density, cancer rates, and annual rainfall are three examples of univariate data.

[[Bivariate map]]ping shows the geographical distribution of two distinct sets of data.  For example, a map showing both rainfall and cancer rates may be used to explore a possible correlation between the two phenomena.

More than two sets of data leads to '''multivariate''' mapping.  For example, a single map might show population density in addition to annual rainfall and cancer rates.

== Mapping methods ==
[[Image:choropleth.gif|thumb|Choropleth map of water use.]]
[[Image:January 17 1982 500-Millibar Height Contours.png|thumb|Isarithmic map of [[barometric pressure]].]]
[[Image:USDA Hardiness zone map.jpg|thumb|Map of climate and plant [[hardiness zones]].]]
Cartographers use many methods to create thematic maps, but five techniques are especially noted.

=== Choropleth ===
[[Choropleth map]]ping shows statistical data aggregated over predefined regions, such as counties or states, by coloring or shading these regions. For example, countries with higher rates of infant mortality might appear darker on a choropleth map. This technique assumes a relatively even distribution of the measured phenomenon within each region. Generally speaking, differences in [[hue]] are used to indicate qualitative differences, such as land use, while differences in saturation or lightness are used to indicate quantitative differences, such as population.

=== Proportional symbol ===
The proportional symbol technique uses symbols of different sizes to represent data associated with different areas or locations within the map. For example, a disc may be shown at the location of each city in a map, with the area of the disc being proportional to the population of the city.

=== Isarithmic or  Isoline===
Isarithmic maps, also known as [[contour line|contour map]]s or isoline maps depict smooth continuous phenomena such as precipitation or elevation. Each line-bounded area on this type of map represents a region with the same value. For example, on an elevation map, each elevation line indicates an area at the listed elevation. An Isarithmic map is a planimetric graphic representation of a 3-D surface. Isarithmic mapping requires 3-D thinking for surfaces that vary spatially.

=== Dot ===
A [[dot distribution map]] might be used to locate each occurrence of a phenomenon, as in the map made by [[John Snow|Dr. Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]], where each dot represented one death due to cholera. Where appropriate, the dot distribution technique may also be used in combination the proportional symbol technique

=== Dasymetric ===
A [[dasymetric map]] is an alternative to a choropleth map. As with a choropleth map, data are collected by enumeration units. But instead of mapping the data so that the region appears uniform, ''ancillary information'' is used to model internal distribution of the phenomenon. For example, population density will be much lower in forested area than urbanized area, so in a common operation, land cover data (forest, water, grassland, urbanization) may be used to model the distribution of population reported by census enumeration unit such as a tract or county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Terry A. |last1=Slocum |first2=Robert B. |last2=McMaster |first3=Fritz C. |last3=Kessler |first4=Hugh H. |last4=Howard |title=Thematic cartography and geovisualization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_URAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-229834-6 |edition=3rd}} Ch. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tyrus Raymond Cobb''' (December 18, 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ty Cobb|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ty-Cobb|website=Encylopaedia Britannica|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – July 17, 1961), nicknamed '''The Georgia Peach''', was an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[outfielder]]. He was born in rural [[Narrows, Georgia]]. Cobb spent 22 seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]], the last six as the team's [[player-manager]], and finished his career with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|Baseball Hall of Fame ballot]], receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes (98.2%); no other player received a higher percentage of votes until [[Tom Seaver]] in 1992.  In 1999, [[editor]]s at the ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranked Ty Cobb third on their list of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml|title=Baseball's 100 greatest players|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Cobb was born in 1886 in [[Narrows, Georgia]], a small rural community of farmers that was unincorporated. He was the first of three children born to William Herschel Cobb (1863–1905) and Amanda Chitwood Cobb (1871–1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uSbqUm8hSAC&amp;pg=PA358|title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|first=Bill|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=358|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-2722-3|last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb's father was a state senator.&lt;ref name="leerhsen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/who-was-ty-cobb-the-history-we-know-thats-wrong/2/ |title=Who was Ty Cobb?The history we know that's wrong|first=Charles|last=Leerhsen|publisher=Hillsdale College|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was still an infant, his parents moved to nearby Royston, where he was raised.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Salsinger. "Ty Cobb Not Extraordinary Ballplayer as Boy." ''Bridgeport (CT) Telegram'', November 5, 1924, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; By most accounts, he became fascinated with baseball as a child, and decided he wanted to play professional ball one day; his father was vehemently opposed to this idea, but by his teen years, he was trying out for area teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/sports-outdoor-recreation/ty-cobb-1886-1961|title=Ty Cobb (1886-1961)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston Rompers, the semi-pro Royston Reds, and the Augusta Tourists of the [[South Atlantic League]] who released him after only two days.&lt;ref name=StumpPage57&gt;Stump (1994), page 57&lt;/ref&gt; He then tried out for the [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]] Steelers of the semipro [[Tennessee–Alabama League]], with his father's stern admonition ringing in his ears: "Don't come home a failure!"&lt;ref name=Kanfer&gt;{{cite news |last=Kanfer|first=Stefan| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050490-1,00.html |title=Failures Can't Come Home |date=April 18, 2005 |publisher=Time |accessdate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StumpPage63&gt;Stump (1994), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50,&lt;ref name=StumpPage64&gt;Stump (1994), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to [[Grantland Rice]], the sports editor of the ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Journal]]''.

In 1911, Cobb moved to Detroit's architecturally significant and now historically protected [[Woodbridge, Detroit|Woodbridge]] neighborhood, from which he would walk with his dogs to the ballpark prior to games. The [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] duplex in which Cobb lived still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6784662/ty-cobb-detroit |title=Ty Cobb as Detroit|work= Grantland.com |accessdate=July 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major league career==

===Early years===
Three weeks after his mother killed his father, Cobb debuted in [[center fielder|center field]] for the Detroit Tigers. On August 30, 1905, in his first major league at bat, he doubled off of [[Jack Chesbro]] of the [[New York Highlanders]]. Chesbro had won a record 41 games the previous season. Cobb was 18 years old at the time, the youngest player in the league by almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1905-other-leaders.shtml |title=1905 American League Awards, All-Stars, &amp; More Leaders|work= Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he hit only .240 in 41 games, he signed a $1,500 contract to play for the Tigers in 1906.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although rookie hazing was customary, Cobb could not endure it in good humor and soon became alienated from his teammates. He later attributed his hostile temperament to this experience: "These old-timers turned me into a snarling wildcat."&lt;ref name=NGECobb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-733 |title=Ty Cobb (1886–1961) |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |last=Hill |first=John Paul |date=November 18, 2002 |publisher= [[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tigers manager [[Hughie Jennings]] later acknowledged that Cobb was targeted for abuse by veteran players, some of whom sought to force him off the team. "I let this go for a while because I wanted to satisfy myself that Cobb has as much guts as I thought in the very beginning", Jennings recalled. "Well, he proved it to me, and I told the other players to let him alone. He is going to be a great baseball player and I won't allow him to be driven off this club."&lt;ref name="kashatus72-73"&gt;Kashatus (2002), pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cobbsign.jpg|left|thumb|Cobb signs a $5,000 contract in 1908 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|5,000|1908|r=-3}}}} today) after a holdout]]

The following year, 1906, Cobb became the Tigers' full-time center fielder and hit .316 in 98 games, setting a record for the highest batting average (minimum 310 plate appearances) for a 19-year-old (later bested by [[Mel Ott]]'s .322 average in 124 games for the 1928 [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_19_bat.shtml |title=Batting Leaders Before, During and After Age 19 |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930031332/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_19_bat.shtml |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He never hit below that mark again. After being moved to right field, he led the Tigers to three consecutive [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennants]] in 1907, 1908 &amp; 1909. Detroit would lose each [[World Series]] (to the Cubs twice and then the Pirates), however, with Cobb's [[World Series|postseason]] numbers far below his career standard. Cobb did not get another opportunity to play on a pennant-winning team.

In 1907, Cobb reached first and then stole second, third and home. He accomplished the feat four more times during his career.&lt;ref name=GeorgiaEncyc&gt;{{cite web|title=Ty Cobb|publisher=The New Georgia Encyclopedia|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-733|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ty Cobb – Baseball Legend|publisher=BBC|date=July 22, 2003|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1118648|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 1907 season with a league-leading .350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBI).&lt;ref name="BaseballRefCobbCareerStats"/&gt; At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a [[list of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championship]] and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger [[Al Kaline]] won the batting title twelve days younger than Cobb when he did it.&lt;ref name=GeorgiaEncyc/&gt;&lt;ref name=BaseballDigest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_11_59/ai_66010628 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803081922/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_11_59/ai_66010628 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-03 |title=Facts and Figures – Baseball batting champions |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Baseball Digest |date=November 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told [[Grantland Rice]], "The biggest thrill I ever got came in a game against the Athletics in 1907 [on September 30]... The Athletics had us beaten, with [[Rube Waddell]] pitching.  They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score. This game went 17 innings to a tie, and a few days later, we clinched our first pennant. You can understand what it meant for a 20-year-old country boy to hit a home run off the great Rube, in a pennant-winning game with two outs in the ninth."&lt;ref name="baseballspast.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballspast.com/film/cobb.html |title=Film from Baseball's Past |publisher=Baseballspast.com |date=March 19, 1930 |accessdate=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1909 Ty Cobb Honus Wagner.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cobb and [[Honus Wagner]], 1909]]
Despite great success on the field, Cobb was no stranger to controversy off it. As described in [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]], "In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb's hand or pat him on the shoulder."&lt;ref name="The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back"/&gt; The "overly familiar greeting infuriated" Cobb, who attacked Cummings. When Cummings' wife tried to defend him, Cobb allegedly choked her. The assault was only stopped when catcher [[Boss Schmidt|Charles "Boss" Schmidt]] knocked Cobb out.&lt;ref&gt;''When Cobb Met Wagner: The Seven-Game World Series of 1909'' by David Finoli, McFarland, 2010, page 230.&lt;/ref&gt; However, aside from Schmidt's statement to the press, no other corroborating witnesses to the assault on Cummings ever came forward and Cummings himself never made a public comment about it. Author Charles Leerhsen speculates that the assault on Cummings and his wife never occurred and that Schmidt likely made it up completely. Cobb had spent the previous year defending himself on several occasions from assaults by Schmidt, with Schmidt often coming out of nowhere to blindside Cobb. On that day, several reporters did see Cummings, who appeared to be "partially under the influence of liquor", approach Cobb and shout "Hello, Carrie!" (the meaning of which is unknown) and go in for a hug. Cobb then pushed him away, which was the last interaction that anyone saw between Cobb and Cummings. Shortly thereafter, hearing a fight, several reporters came running and found Cobb and Schmidt wrestling on the ground. When the fight was broken up and Cobb had walked away, Schmidt remained behind and told the reporters that he saw Cobb assaulting Cummings and his wife and had intervened. Leerhsen speculates that this was just another one of Schmidt's assaults on Cobb and that once discovered, Schmidt made up a story that made him sound like he had assaulted Cobb for a noble purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Cobb attacked a black laborer in Detroit who complained when Cobb stepped into freshly poured asphalt; Cobb was found guilty of battery but the sentence was suspended.&lt;ref name="The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back"/&gt;

In September 1907, Cobb began a relationship with [[The Coca-Cola Company]] that lasted the remainder of his life. By the time he died, he  held over 20,000 shares of stock and owned [[bottling company|bottling plants]] in [[Santa Maria, California]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], and [[Bend, Oregon]]. He was also a celebrity spokesman for the product.&lt;ref name=HallofFameCoke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/history/2002/021218_cobb_ty.htm |title=Ty Cobb Sold Me a Soda Pop: Hall of Fame Outfielder Ty Cobb and Coca-Cola |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |last=Holmes |first=Dan |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206111050/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/history/2002/021218_cobb_ty.htm |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the offseason between 1907 and 1908, Cobb negotiated with [[Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina]], offering to coach baseball there "for $250 a month, provided that he did not sign with Detroit that season". This did not come to pass, however.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, Wright, "Clemson: An Informal History of the University 1889–1979", The R. L. Bryan Company, Columbia, South Carolina, 1979, Library of Congress card number 79-56231, {{ISBN|0-934870-01-2}}, page 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, the Tigers finished ahead of the [[Chicago White Sox]] for the pennant. Cobb again won the batting title with a .324 average, but Detroit suffered another loss in the World Series. In August 1908, Cobb married Charlotte ("Charlie") Marion Lombard, the daughter of prominent [[Augusta, Georgia|Augustan]] Roswell Lombard.&lt;ref name=StumpPage158_160&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 158–160&lt;/ref&gt; In the offseason, the couple lived on her father's Augusta estate, ''The Oaks'', until they moved into their own house on Williams Street in November 1913.&lt;ref name=Price1996&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/history/cobb.html |title=Aggressive play defined Ty Cobb |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |last=Price |first=Ed |authorlink= |date=June 21, 1996 |publisher=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209235657/http://chronicle.augusta.com/history/cobb.html |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers won the AL pennant again in 1909. During that World Series, Cobb's last, he stole home in the second game, igniting a three-run rally, but that was the high point for him, finishing with a lowly .231, as the Tigers lost to Honus Wagner and the powerful Pirates in seven games. Although he performed poorly in the postseason, he won the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] by hitting .377 with 107 RBI and nine home runs, all [[inside-the-park home run|inside the park]], thus becoming the only player of the modern era to lead his league in home runs in a season without hitting a ball over the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr1909a.shtml|title=Year in Review: 1909 American League|accessdate=May 28, 2007|publisher=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910: Chalmers Award controversy===
{{Main|1910 Chalmers Award}}
Going into the final days of the 1910 season, Cobb had a .004 lead on [[Nap Lajoie]] for the American League batting title. The prize for the winner of the title was a [[Chalmers automobile]]. Cobb sat out the final games to preserve his average. Lajoie hit safely eight times in a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], but six of those hits were [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] singles. Later it was rumored that the opposing manager had instructed his third baseman to play extra deep to allow Lajoie to win the batting race over the generally disliked Cobb.  Although Cobb was credited with a higher batting average, it was later discovered that one game had been counted twice so that Cobb actually lost to Lajoie.

As a result of the incident, AL president [[Ban Johnson]] was forced to [[arbitrate]] the situation. He declared Cobb the rightful owner of the title, but car company president Hugh Chalmers chose to award one to both Cobb and Lajoie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=Gary|author2=Palmer, Pete|title=The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia|publisher=Sterling Publishing Co|location=New York|year=2007|edition=Fourth|pages=1764–1765|isbn=978-1-4027-4771-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1911-1914===
[[File:Cobb jackson.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Cobb and Joe Jackson in Cleveland]]
Cobb regarded baseball as "something like a war", future Tiger second baseman [[Charlie Gehringer]] said. "Every time at bat for him was a crusade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honig|first=Donald|title=Baseball When the Grass Was Real|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=1975|page=42|isbn=0-8032-7267-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baseball historian [[John Thorn]] said in the book "Legends of the Fall", "He is testament to how far you can get simply through will... Cobb was pursued by demons."

Cobb was having a tremendous year in 1911, which included a 40-game [[hitting streak]]. Still, [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|"Shoeless" Joe Jackson]] led him by .009 points in the batting race late in the season. Near the end of the season, Cobb's Tigers had a long series against Jackson's [[Cleveland Naps]]. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly both on and off the field. Cobb used that friendship to his advantage. Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson tried to say anything to him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to "fall off" to a final average of .408, twelve points lower than Cobb's .420, a twentieth-century record which stood until [[George Sisler]] tied it and [[Rogers Hornsby]] surpassed it with .424, the record since then except for Hugh Duffy's .438 in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote="I often tried plays that looked recklessly daring, maybe even silly.

Cobb led the AL that year in numerous other categories, including 248 hits, 147 runs scored, 127 RBI, 83 stolen bases, 47 doubles, 24 triples and a .621 [[slugging percentage]]. Cobb hit eight home runs but finished second in that category to [[Frank Baker]], who hit eleven. He was awarded another Chalmers car, this time for being voted the AL MVP by the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]].

[[File:Outing (1885) (14753422496).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cobb in 1911]]
On May 12, 1911, Cobb's play illustrated his combination of skill and cunning. Playing against the [[New York Highlanders]], he scored from first base on a single to right field, then scored another run from second base on a wild pitch. In the seventh inning, he tied the game with a two-run double. The Highlanders catcher vehemently argued the safe call at second base with the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in question, going on at such length that the other Highlanders infielders gathered nearby to watch. Realizing that no one on the Highlanders had called time, Cobb strolled unobserved to third base, and then casually walked towards home plate as if to get a better view of the argument. He then suddenly broke into a run and slid into home plate for the eventual winning run.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; It was performances like this that led [[Branch Rickey]] to say later that Cobb "had brains in his feet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/history/first5/default.htm |title=First Five: The Original Members of the Hall of Fame |last=Holmes |first=Dan |accessdate=June 15, 2007 |publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608145751/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/history/first5/default.htm |archivedate=June 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing his gameplay strategy in 1930, he said, "My system was all offense. I believed in putting up a mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I'd try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles I could think of, to keep them guessing and hurrying."&lt;ref name="baseballspast.com"/&gt; In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman [[Hal Chase]], but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own [[baserunning]] tendencies, he was able to surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.

On May 15, 1912, Cobb assaulted a heckler, Claude Lucker (often misspelled as Lueker), in the stands in New York's [[Hilltop Park]] where his Tigers were playing the Highlanders. Lucker and Cobb had traded insults with each other through the first couple of innings. Cobb at one point went to the Highlander dugout to look for the Highlander's owner to try to have Lucker ejected from the game, but his search was in vain.&lt;ref&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, page 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation finally climaxed when Lucker allegedly called Cobb a "half-nigger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Dm3hqzbyYkC|first=Dan |last= Holmes|title=Ty Cobb: a biography |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| location=Westport, Connecticut | page= 58|isbn=978-0-313-32869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb, in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography,&lt;ref name=CobbAutoBio_1313&gt;Cobb &amp; Stump, pp. 131–135&lt;/ref&gt; avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lucker's epithet by saying he was "reflecting on my mother's color and morals". He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager [[Harry Wolverton]] that if something wasn't done about that man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates [[Sam Crawford]] and [[Jim Delahanty]] to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident). When onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands, he reportedly retorted, "I don't care if he got no feet!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=ESPN.com's 10 infamous moments |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/infamous.html |accessdate=August 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though extremely rare in the 21st century, attacking fans was not so unusual an activity in the early years of baseball. Other notable baseball stars who assaulted heckling fans include [[Babe Ruth]], [[Cy Young]], [[Rube Waddell]], [[Kid Gleason]], [[Sherry Magee]], and [[Fred Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, pages 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ty Cobb 1916-restore.jpeg|thumb|right|Cobb in 1916]]
The league suspended him, and his teammates, though not fond of Cobb, went on strike to protest the suspension, and the lack of protection of players from abusive fans, before the May 18 game in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=StumpPages208_209&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; For that one game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of hastily recruited college and sandlot players plus two Tiger coaches and lost 24–2, thereby setting some of Major League Baseball's modern-era (post-1900) negative records, notably the 26 hits in a nine-inning game allowed by [[Allan Travers]], who pitched one of the sport's most unlikely [[complete game]]s.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTravers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Al_Travers_1892&amp;page=chronology|title=Al Travers from the Chronology|last=Charlton|first=James|accessdate=June 15, 2007|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182449/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Al_Travers_1892&amp;page=chronology|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-1901 record for the most hits and runs given up in a game is held by the [[Cleveland Blues (NL)|Cleveland Blues]]' [[Dave Rowe (baseball)|Dave Rowe]]. Primarily an outfielder, Rowe pitched a complete game on July 24, 1882, giving up 35 runs on 29 hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1882 Year in Review|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr1882n.shtml|publisher=Baseball Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current post-1900 record for most hits in a nine-inning game is 31, set in 1992 by the Milwaukee Brewers against Toronto; however, the Blue Jays used six pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milwaukee gets 31 hits|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TOR/TOR199208280.shtml|publisher=Baseball Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike ended when Cobb urged his teammates to return to the field. According to him, this incident led to the formation of a players' union, the "Ballplayers' Fraternity" (formally, the Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America), an early version of what is now called the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]], which garnered some concessions from the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Baseball Players’ Fraternity|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/54781/Baseball-Players-Fraternity|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StumpPages209_210&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb, during his career, was involved in numerous other fights, both on and off the field, and several profanity-laced shouting matches. For example, Cobb and umpire [[Billy Evans]] arranged to settle their in-game differences through fisticuffs under the grandstand after the game. Members of both teams were spectators, and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down, pinned him and began choking him. In 1909, Cobb was arrested for assault for an incident that occurred in a Cleveland hotel. Cobb got into an argument with the elevator operator around 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. when the man refused to take him to the floor where some of his teammates were having a card game. The elevator operator stated that he could only take Cobb to the floor where his room was. As the argument escalated, a night watchman approached and he and Cobb eventually got into a physical confrontation. During the fight, Cobb produced a pen knife and slashed the watchman across the hand. Cobb later claimed that the watchman, who had the upper hand in the fight, had his finger in Cobb's left eye and that Cobb was worried he was going to have his sight ruined. The fight finally ended when the watchman produced a gun and struck Cobb several times in the head, knocking him out.&lt;ref&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, pages 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb would later plead guilty to simple assault and pay a $100 fine. This incident has often been retold with the elevator operator and the watchman both being black. However, recent scholarship has shown that all parties involved were white.&lt;ref&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915–1921===
In 1915, Cobb set the single-season record for stolen bases with 96, which stood until Dodger [[Maury Wills]] broke it in 1962.&lt;ref name=BaseballRefSeasonSB&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_season.shtml |title=Single-Season Leaders for Stolen Bases |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |publisher=Sports Reference, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cobbruth.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Babe Ruth]] (left) and Ty Cobb ]] That year, he also won his ninth consecutive batting title, hitting .369.
In 1917, Cobb hit in 35 consecutive games, still the only player with two 35-game hitting streaks (including his 40-game streak in 1911).&lt;ref name=BaseballAlmanacLongHitStreaks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats-streak.shtml|title=Consecutive Games Hitting Streaks |accessdate=June 6, 2007|publisher=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had six hitting streaks of at least 20 games in his career, second only to [[Pete Rose]]'s seven.&lt;ref name=BaseballPageRose&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/rosepe01.php |title=Player Pages: Pete Rose |accessdate=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This reference says Rose had eight hitting streaks of 20 or more consecutive hits, not seven. --&gt;

Also in 1917, Cobb starred in the motion picture ''[[Somewhere in Georgia]]'' for a sum of $25,000 plus expenses (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1917|r=0}}}} today {{inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name=StumpPage254_255&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a story by sports columnist [[Grantland Rice]], the film casts Cobb as "himself", a small-town Georgian bank clerk with a talent for baseball.&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158971/ |title=Somewhere in Georgia |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=February 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] critic [[Ward Morehouse]] called the movie "absolutely the worst flicker I ever saw, pure hokum".&lt;ref name=StumpPage254_255/&gt;

In October 1918, Cobb enlisted in the [[Chemical Corps]] branch of the [[United States Army]] and was sent to the [[American Expeditionary Force|Allied Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters in [[Chaumont, Haute-Marne|Chaumont, France]].&lt;ref name=ChemicalCorps&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurtowski |first=Richard |authorlink= |date=July 2005 |title=Remembering baseball hall of famers who served in the Chemical Corps |journal=CML Army Chemical Review |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IUN/is_2005_July/ai_n15730920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222165016/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IUN/is_2005_July/ai_n15730920 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served approximately 67 days overseas before receiving an [[honorable discharge]] and returning to the United States.&lt;ref name=ChemicalCorps/&gt; He was given the rank of captain underneath the command of Major [[Branch Rickey]], the president of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].

On August 19, 1921, in the second game of a doubleheader against [[Elmer Myers]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]], Cobb collected his 3,000th hit. Aged 34 at the time, he is still the youngest ballplayer to reach that milestone, and in the fewest at-bats (8,093).&lt;ref name=SportingNews08061999&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/exhibits/online_exhibits/3000_hit_club/cobb_ty.htm |title=The 3000 Hit Club: Ty Cobb |accessdate=February 10, 2007 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209031106/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/exhibits/online_exhibits/3000_hit_club/cobb_ty.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HallofFameCobb3000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/172730.html |date=August 6, 1999 |title=Inside the numbers: 3,000 hits |accessdate=February 10, 2007 |publisher=[[Sporting News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211195538/http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/numbers/172730.html |archivedate=February 11, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, [[Babe Ruth]], newly sold to the newly named [[New York Yankees]] from the [[Boston Red Sox]], had established himself as a power hitter, something Cobb was not considered to be. When his Tigers showed up in New York to play the Yankees for the first time that season, writers billed it as a showdown between two stars of competing styles of play. Ruth hit two homers and a triple during the series, compared to Cobb's one single.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

As Ruth's popularity grew, Cobb became increasingly hostile toward him. He saw the Babe not only as a threat to his style of play, but also to his style of life. While Cobb preached ascetic self-denial, Ruth gorged on hot dogs, beer and women.&lt;ref name=Nation05082006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060522/zirin |last=Zirin |first=Dave |title=Bonding With the Babe |work=[[The Nation]] |date=May 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MF112006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_9_20/ai_n6244977 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050120092744/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_9_20/ai_n6244977 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-01-20 |last=Kalish |first=Jacob |title=Fat phenoms: are hot dogs and beer part of your training regimen?

After enduring several years of seeing his fame and notoriety usurped by Ruth, Cobb decided that he was going to show that swinging for the fences was no challenge for a top hitter. On May 5, 1925, he began a two-game hitting spree better than any even Ruth had unleashed. Sitting in the Tiger [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]], he told a reporter that, for the first time in his career, he was going to swing for the fences. That day, he went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double and three home runs.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibMay1925&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1925MAY.stm |title=May 1925 |accessdate=February 8, 2007 |publisher=Baseballlibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224657/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1925MAY.stm |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16 total bases set a new AL record, which stood until May 8, 2012 when [[Josh Hamilton]] of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] hit four home runs and a double for a total of 18 bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/total_bases_records.shtml|title= Total Bases Records|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he had three more hits, two of which were home runs. The single his first time up gave him nine consecutive hits over three games. His five homers in two games tied the record set by [[Cap Anson]] of the old Chicago NL team in 1884.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibMay1925/&gt; Cobb wanted to show that he could hit home runs when he wanted, but simply chose not to do so. At the end of the series, the 38-year-old veteran superstar had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases and then went happily back to his usual bunting and hitting-and-running. For his part, Ruth's attitude was that "I could have had a lifetime .600 average, but I would have had to hit them singles. The people were paying to see me hit home runs."&lt;ref name=BaseballLibFrommer&gt;{{cite web |last=Frommer |first=Harvey |date=July 13, 2004 |url=http://www.travel-watch.com/bbhalloffame61.htm |title=The 90th Anniversary of Babe Ruth's Major-League Debut |accessdate=February 10, 2007 |publisher=Harvey Frommer on Sports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231075226/http://www.travel-watch.com/bbhalloffame61.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, when asked in 1930 by [[Grantland Rice]] to name the best hitter he'd ever seen, Cobb answered, "You can't beat the Babe. Ruth is one of the few who can take a terrific swing and still meet the ball solidly. His timing is perfect. [No one has] the combined power and eye of Ruth."&lt;ref name="baseballspast.com"/&gt;

===Cobb as player/manager===
[[File:Ty Cobb sliding2-edit1.jpg|thumb|Cobb slides into third base, August 16, 1924]]
Tiger owner [[Frank Navin]] tapped Cobb to take over for Hughie Jennings as manager for the 1921 season, a deal he signed on his 34th birthday for $32,500 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|32500|1921|r=0}}}} in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}). The signing surprised the baseball world. Although Cobb was a legendary player, he was disliked throughout the baseball community, even by his own teammates; and he expected as much from his players since he set a standard most players couldn't meet.&lt;ref name=ngeorgiacobb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngeorgia.com/people/cobbt.html |title=Tyrus Raymond "Ty" Cobb: a North Georgia Notable |publisher=About North Georgia |accessdate=February 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest Cobb came to winning another pennant was in 1924, when the Tigers finished in third place, six games behind the pennant-winning [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]]. The Tigers had also finished third in 1922, but 16 games behind the Yankees. Cobb blamed his lackluster managerial record (479 wins against 444 losses) on Navin, who was arguably even more frugal than he was, passing up a number of quality players Cobb wanted to add to the team. In fact, he had saved money by hiring Cobb to both play and manage.

In 1922, Cobb tied a batting record set by [[Willie Keeler|Wee Willie Keeler]], with four five-hit games in a season. This has since been matched by [[Stan Musial]], [[Tony Gwynn]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]]. On May 10, 1924, Cobb was honored at ceremonies before a game in Washington, D.C., by more than 100 dignitaries and legislators. He received 21 books, one for each year in professional baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salsinger|first=H.G.|title=Ty Cobb|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6546-0|page=162|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6546-0|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128090001/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6546-0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1925 Cobb was once again embroiled in a batting title race, this time with one of his teammates and players, [[Harry Heilmann]]. In a doubleheader against the [[St. Louis Browns]] on October 4, 1925, Heilmann got six hits to lead the Tigers to a sweep of the doubleheader and beat Cobb for the batting crown, .393 to .389. Cobb and Brownie player-manager [[George Sisler]] each pitched in the final game, Cobb pitching a perfect inning.

===Move to Philadelphia===
Cobb announced his retirement after a 22-year career as a Tiger in November 1926, and headed home to [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Tris Speaker also retired as player-manager of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. The retirement of two great players at the same time sparked some interest, and it turned out that the two were coerced into retirement because of allegations of game-fixing brought about by [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]], a former pitcher managed by Cobb.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/player.php?name=Ty_Cobb_1886|title=Ty Cobb|accessdate=November 24, 2007|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224655/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/player.php?name=Ty_Cobb_1886|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1928 Gehrig Speaker Cobb Ruth.jpg|thumb|left|350px|[[Lou Gehrig]], [[Tris Speaker]], Cobb, and [[Babe Ruth]], 1928]]
Leonard accused former pitcher and outfielder [[Smoky Joe Wood]] and Cobb of betting on a Tiger-Indian game played in Detroit on September 25, 1919, in which they allegedly orchestrated a Tiger victory to win the bet. Leonard claimed proof existed in letters written to him by Cobb and Wood.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] held a secret hearing with Cobb, Speaker and Wood.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; A second secret meeting among the AL directors led to the unpublicized resignations of Cobb and Speaker; however, rumors of the scandal led Judge Landis to hold additional hearings&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; in which Leonard subsequently refused to participate. Cobb and Wood admitted to writing the letters, but claimed that a horse-racing bet was involved and that Leonard's accusations were in retaliation for Cobb's having released him from the Tigers, thereby demoting him to the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]].&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; Speaker denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt;

On January 27, 1927, Judge Landis cleared Cobb and Speaker of any wrongdoing because of Leonard's refusal to appear at the hearings.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; Landis allowed both Cobb and Speaker to return to their original teams, but each team let them know that they were [[free agent]]s and could sign with any club they wanted.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; Speaker signed with the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] for 1927, and Cobb with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. Speaker then joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season. Cobb said he had come back only to seek vindication and say he left baseball on his own terms.

Cobb played regularly in 1927 for a young and talented team that finished second to one of the greatest teams of all time, the 110–44 1927 Yankees, returning to Detroit to a tumultuous welcome on May 11 and doubling his first time up to the cheers of Tiger fans. On July 18, Cobb became the first member of the [[4000 hit club]] when he doubled off former teammate [[Sam Gibson (baseball)|Sam Gibson]], still pitching for the Tigers, at [[Navin Field]].&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt;

1927 was also the final season of [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] pitcher [[Walter Johnson]]'s career.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryJohnson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/J/Johnson_Walter.stm |title=Walter Johnson |accessdate=February 27, 2007 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222929/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/J/Johnson_Walter.stm |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With their careers largely overlapping, Cobb faced Johnson more times than any other batter-pitcher matchup in baseball history. Cobb also got the first hit ever allowed by Johnson. After Johnson hit Detroit's [[Ossie Vitt]] with a pitch in August 1915, seriously injuring him, Cobb realized that Johnson was fearful of hitting opponents. He used this knowledge to his advantage by standing closer to the plate.&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryOssieVitt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/V/Vitt_Ossie.stm |title=Ossie Vitt |accessdate=February 27, 2007 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224652/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/V/Vitt_Ossie.stm |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb returned for the 1928 season, but played less frequently due to his age and the blossoming abilities of the young A's, who were again in a pennant race with the Yankees. On September 3, Ty Cobb [[pinch hitter|pinch-hit]] in the ninth inning of the first game of a doubleheader against the Senators and doubled off [[Bump Hadley]] for his last career hit although his last at-bat wasn't until September 11 against the Yankees, [[types of batted balls in baseball|popping]] [[out (baseball)|out]] off [[Hank Johnson (baseball)|Hank Johnson]] and grounding out to [[shortstop]] [[Mark Koenig]].&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; He then announced his retirement, effective the end of the season,&lt;ref name=BaseballLibraryTyCobb/&gt; after batting .300 or higher in 23 consecutive seasons (the only season under .300 being his rookie season), a major league record not likely to be broken.&lt;ref name=BaseballRefCobbCareerStats/&gt;

He also ended his career with a rather dubious record. When Cobb retired, he led AL outfielders for most errors all-time with 271, which still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Curveballs and Screwballs|first1= Jeffrey |first2=Douglas |last1=Lyons|last2=Lyons|isbn=978-0812933154|publisher=Random House Puzzles &amp; Games|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth-century player [[Tom Brown (center fielder)|Tom Brown]] holds the major league record with 490 errors committed as an outfielder, while the National League record is held by nineteenth-century player [[George Gore]] with 346 errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fielding Errors: Errors Committed as an OF|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/E_of_career.shtml|publisher=BaseballReference.com|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Gore|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gorege01-field.shtml|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb ranks 14th on the all-time list for errors committed by an outfielder.

Cobb retired a very rich and successful man.&lt;ref name=Time1937&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 10, 1937 |title=Champion |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757792,00.html |accessdate=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured Europe with his family, went to [[Scotland]] for some time and then returned to his farm in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=Time1937/&gt; He spent his retirement pursuing his off-season avocations of hunting, golfing, polo and fishing.&lt;ref name=Time1937/&gt; His other pastime was trading stocks and [[bond (finance)|bonds]], increasing his immense personal wealth.&lt;ref name=TyCobbMuseumPhilanthropy&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tycobbmuseum.org/philanthropy.shtml.htm | title=Cobb's philanthropy | publisher=The Ty Cobb Museum | accessdate=February 10, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516162007/http://www.tycobbmuseum.org/philanthropy.shtml.htm | archivedate=May 16, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a major stockholder in the [[Coca-Cola Corporation]], which by itself would have made him wealthy.

In the winter of 1930, Cobb moved into a Spanish ranch estate on Spencer Lane in the affluent town of [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] located south of [[San Francisco, California]] on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]].

Cobb never had an easy time as husband and father. His children found him to be demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. flunked out of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]&lt;ref name=NYTIMES12021994&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=COBB%20(MOVIE)&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=Janet%20Maslin&amp;pdate=19941202&amp;v_id= |title=FILM REVIEW; A Hero Who Was a Heel, Or, What Price Glory? |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times |last=Maslin |first=Janet |date=December 2, 1994 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (where he had played on the varsity tennis team), much to his father's dismay.&lt;ref name=StumpPage405&gt;Stump (1994), p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KossuthCobbHangsemup&gt;{{cite web |last=Kossuth |first=James | url=http://wso.williams.edu/~jkossuth/cobb/race.htm |title=Cobb Hangs 'em Up ...eventually |accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Cobb subsequently traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a [[whip]] to ensure against future academic failure.&lt;ref name=StumpPage405/&gt; Tyrus Raymond, Jr. then entered [[Yale University]] and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics, but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating.&lt;ref name=StumpPage405/&gt; Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems, but then permanently broke off with him.&lt;ref name=StumpPage405/&gt; Even though Tyrus Raymond, Jr. finally reformed and eventually earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[Medical College of South Carolina]] and practiced [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] in [[Dublin, Georgia]], until his premature death at 42 on September 9, 1952, from a [[brain tumor]], his father remained distant.&lt;ref name=StumpPage405_6_12&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 405–406, 412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTJrObit&gt;{{cite news |title=Ty Cobb's Son Dies at 42 |newspaper=The New York Times|page=29 |date=September 10, 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1936, when the first [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] election results were announced, Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected that first year.&lt;ref name=HallofFameVote1936&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/voting_year.jsp?year=1936 |title=Hall of Fame Voting: Baseball Writers Elections 1936 |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829205105/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/voting_year.jsp?year=1936 |archivedate=August 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 98.2 percentage stood as the record until [[Tom Seaver]] received 98.8% of the vote in 1992. Those incredible results show that although many people disliked him personally, they respected the way he had played and what he had accomplished. In 1998, ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranked him as third on the list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml|title=100 Greatest Baseball Players|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of major league stars of the 1940s and 1950s, he had positive things to say about [[Stan Musial]], [[Phil Rizzuto]] and [[Jackie Robinson]], but few others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wso.williams.edu/~jkossuth/cobb/retirement.htm |title=Cobb Hangs 'em Up |accessdate=April 18, 2008 |last=Kossuth |first=James |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, he was known to help out young players. He was instrumental in helping [[Joe DiMaggio]] negotiate his rookie contract with the [[New York Yankees]].

According to sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]], he and Cobb were returning from the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] golf tournament in the late 1940s and stopped at a [[Greenville, South Carolina]], liquor store. Cobb noticed that the man behind the counter was [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|"Shoeless" Joe Jackson]], who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the [[Black Sox scandal]].

===Later life===
At the age of 62, Cobb married a second time in 1949. His new wife was 40-year-old Frances Fairbairn Cass, a [[divorcee]] from [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref name=TimeCobb&gt;{{cite news | date=September 26, 1949 | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800761-1,00.html |title=The Old Gang |publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StumpPage412&gt;Stump (1994), p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Their childless marriage also failed, ending with a divorce in 1956.&lt;ref name=Time05211956&gt;{{cite news | date=May 21, 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808526,00.html |title=Milestones|publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Cobb became generous with his wealth, donating $100,000 in his parents' name for his hometown to build a modern 24-bed hospital, [[Cobb Memorial Hospital]], which is now part of the [[Ty Cobb Healthcare System]]. He also established the Cobb Educational Fund, which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a $100,000 donation in 1953 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1953|r=0}}}} in current year dollars {{inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref name=TyCobbMuseumPhilanthropy/&gt;

He knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set the record straight on him and teach young players how to play. [[John McCallum (author)|John McCallum]] spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography titled ''The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb'' that was published in 1956.&lt;ref name=TigerWoreSpikes&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=McCallum |authorlink= John McCallum (author)|title=The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb |pages=240 pages |publisher=A.

It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, ''My Life in Baseball: The True Record'', with writer Al Stump. Later Stump would claim the collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb's death Stump published two more books and a short story giving what he claimed was the "true story". One of these later books was used as the basis for the 1994 film ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]'' (a box office flop starring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Cobb and directed by [[Ron Shelton]]). In 2010, an article by William R. "Ron" Cobb (no relation to Ty) in the peer-reviewed ''The National Pastime'' (the official publication of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]]) accused Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb-related documents and diaries. The article further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb in his last years, most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light.&lt;ref name="Cobb 2010"/&gt;

===Death===
In his last days, Cobb spent some time with the old movie comedian [[Joe E. Brown]], talking about the choices he had made in his life. He told Brown that he felt that he had made mistakes and that he would do things differently if he could. He had played hard and lived hard all his life, had no friends to show for it at the end, and regretted it. Publicly, however, he claimed to have no regrets: "I've been lucky. I have no right to be regretful of what I did."&lt;ref name=NewsweekJuly1961&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=July 31, 1961 |title= How to Dominate the Diamond|journal=[[Newsweek]] |volume=LVIII |issue= |page=54  |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He checked into Emory Hospital for the last time in June 1961.  His first wife, Charlie, his son Jimmy and other family members came to be with him for his final days. He died a month later, on July 17, 1961, at [[Emory University Hospital]].&lt;ref name=NGECobb/&gt;

Approximately 150 friends and relatives attended a brief service in [[Cornelia, Georgia]], and drove to the Cobb family [[mausoleum]] in Royston for the burial.

Historian Steven Elliott Tripp has explored the reaction of fans—he was “a player fans loved to hate,” so much so that he became the pioneer sports celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Elliott Tripp, ''Ty Cobb, Baseball, and American Manhood'' (2016), pp 256, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the male fans who responded enthusiastically to how Cobb demonstrated in action a new level of modern masculinity. Cobb did that by his performance as a specialist in his art, a man with iron nerve, undaunted, fighting to advance his team and his career by crushing his weaker, less-masculine opponents. Cobb demonstrated raw emotion and encouraged his audience to participate in the manly struggle underway in the stadium by shouting their taunts and jeers at the opposing team.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter M. Hampton, review of ''Ty Cobb, Baseball, and American Manhood'' by Steven Elliott Tripp, in ''The Journal of American Culture'' 41#1 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb has been judged by some historians and journalists as the best player of the [[dead-ball era]], and is generally seen as one of the greatest players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zacharias |first=Patricia |title=Ty Cobb, the greatest Tiger of them all |url=http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=92&amp;category=sports |accessdate=August 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720080112/http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=92&amp;category=sports |archivedate=July 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Povich|first=Shirley|title=Best Player-Not Best Man|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/general/povich/launch/cobb.htm|accessdate = August 25, 2007 | work=The Washington Post | date=July 24, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to create a Ty Cobb Memorial in Royston initially failed, primarily because most of the artifacts from his life were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown, New York]] and the Georgia town was viewed as too remote to make a memorial worthwhile. But ultimately, on July 17, 1998, the 37th anniversary of Cobb's death, the [[Ty Cobb Museum]] and the [[Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame]] opened its doors in Royston. On that day, Cobb was one of the first members to be inducted into the Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame.

On August 30, 2005, his hometown hosted a 1905 baseball game to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Cobb's first major league game. Players in the game included many of Cobb's descendants as well as many citizens from his hometown of Royston. Another early-20th-century baseball game was played in his hometown at Cobb Field on September 30, 2006, with Cobb's descendants and Roystonians again playing. Cobb's personal [[batboy]] from his major league years was also in attendance, and threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch|first pitch]].

In addition to the aforementioned [[Cobb (film)|film]], Ty Cobb's legacy also includes legions of collectors of his early tobacco card issues, as well as game used memorabilia and autographs. Perhaps the most curious item is a 1909 Ty Cobb Cigarettes pack, leaving some to believe Cobb either had, or attempted to have, his own brand of cigarettes. Very little about the card is known other than its similarity to the 1909 T206 Red Portrait card published by the American Tobacco Company, and until 2005 only a handful were known to exist. That year, a sizable cache of the cards was brought to auction by the family of a Royston, Georgia, man who had stored them in a book for almost 100 years.&lt;ref name="Williams.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wso.williams.edu/~jkossuth/cobb/index.html |title=Ty Cobb.

The new baseball stadium at [[Hampden–Sydney College]] is named Ty Cobb Ballpark.

The band [[Soundgarden]] recorded a song "Ty Cobb" in the album ''[[Down on the Upside]]'' in 1996. However, the song wasn't actually written about Ty Cobb, it was given the name because the lyrics reminded their bassist [[Ben Shepherd]] of him.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Charles R. [http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/rs_2-8-96.shtml "The Joys of Noise: Soundgarden Throw a High-Frequency Sludgefest"]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. February 8, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celtic punk|Celtic-Punk]] band [[Flatfoot 56]] composed and recorded a song about Ty Cobb as a part of their album ''Odd Boat'' released in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ty Cobb by Flatfoot 56|url=https://flatfoot56.com/track/1212533/ty-cobb|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry with Sam Crawford==
[[Sam Crawford]] and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of thirteen seasons. They played beside each other in right and center field, and Crawford followed Cobb in the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]] year after year. Despite the physical closeness, the two had a complicated relationship.&lt;ref name=Blaisdell1992&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blaisdell, L.D. | year = 1992 | title = Legends as an Expression of Baseball Memory | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1992/JSH1903/jsh1903c.pdf  | accessdate = April 17, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, they had a student-teacher relationship. Crawford was an established star when Cobb arrived, and Cobb eagerly sought his advice. In interviews with [[Al Stump]], Cobb told of studying Crawford's base stealing technique and of how Crawford would teach him about pursuing fly balls and throwing out base runners. Cobb told Stump he would always remember Crawford's kindness.&lt;ref&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SamCrawford4.jpg|thumb|left|Sam Crawford and Ty Cobb clown around with a camera, c. 1908]]

The student-teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals.&lt;ref name="Richard Bak"&gt;{{cite book |title=Peach: Ty Cobb In His Time And Ours |last=Bak |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Sports Media Group |location= |isbn=1-58726-257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cobb was not popular with his teammates, and as Cobb became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given to Cobb. Cobb was allowed to show up late for spring training and was given private quarters on the road – perks not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on. When it was reported that [[Nap Lajoie]] had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=The Strangest Batting Race Ever |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/history/story1.jsp |accessdate=August 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement, Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for ''[[The Sporting News]]'' accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base. Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a "cheapskate" who never helped his teammates. He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, "so he blamed me." Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, insisting that Cobb had "dreamed that up".&lt;ref&gt;Stump (1994), pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to envy. He felt that Crawford was "a hell of a good player", but he was "second best" on the Tigers and "hated to be an also ran". Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two "only barely tolerated each other" and agreed with Cobb that Crawford's attitude was driven by Cobb's having stolen Crawford's thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Bak (2005), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an uncanny ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They became one of the most successful [[double steal]] pairings in baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;Bak (2005), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on race==
[[File:Ty Cobb Paul Thompson, c1918.jpg|thumb|right|Cobb circa 1918]]

Five years after Jackie Robinson broke the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]], Cobb publicly supported blacks and whites playing baseball together, adding, "Certainly it is okay for them to play. I see no reason in the world why we shouldn't compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility. Let me say also that no white man has the right to be less of a gentleman than a colored man; in my book that goes not only for baseball but in all walks of life."&lt;ref name="The Knife in Ty Cobb's Back"/&gt; Using even stronger language, Cobb told the ''[[Sporting News]]'' in 1952 that "the Negro should be accepted and not grudgingly but wholeheartedly."&lt;ref&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, black newspapers cited his praise for [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]' catcher [[Roy Campanella]], who Cobb said was "among the all-time best catchers" in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the Game's Top Catchers." ''[[Philadelphia Tribune]]'', August 8, 1953, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Campanella's accident that left him paralyzed, the Dodgers staged a tribute game where tens of thousands of spectators silently held lit matches above their heads. Cobb wrote the Dodgers owner to show appreciation "for what you did for this fine man".&lt;ref name="Cobb 2015, page 305"&gt;''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' by Charles Leerhsen, Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb also stated that [[Willie Mays]] was the "only player I'd pay money to see".&lt;ref name="Cobb 2015, page 305"/&gt; In the obituaries that ran in the black press following Cobb's death, he was praised for "[speaking] in favor of racial freedom in baseball".&lt;ref&gt;"Ty Cobb Backed Negroes." ''[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]'', August 3, 1961, B11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, including Wesley Fricks, Dan Holmes, and Charles Leerhsen have defended Cobb against unfair portrayals of him in popular culture since his death. A noted case is the book written by sportswriter [[Al Stump]] in the months after Cobb died in 1961. Stump was later discredited when it became known that he had stolen items belonging to Cobb and also betrayed the access Cobb gave him in his final months. As a result of the movie ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]'' which starred [[Tommy Lee Jones]], there are many myths surrounding Cobb's life, including one that he sharpened his spikes to inflict wounds to opposing players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Dan |title=Five Myths About Ty Cobb|url=https://www.detroitathletic.com/blog/2012/08/30/five-myths-about-ty-cobb/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leerhsen's book ''Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty'' presents primary evidence in contradiction to some of the more negative charges against Cobb.

In 2013, Cobb's grandson, Herschel Cobb, published a book about his grandfather titled ''Heart of a Tiger, Growing Up With My Grandfather, Ty Cobb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/a-different-side-of-ty-cobb/|title=Heart of a Tiger, Growing Up With my Grandfather, Ty Cobb|last=Cobb|first=Herschel|date=2013|website=|publisher=ECW Press|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book, Herschel Cobb provides an inside view of his grandfather's kindness and generosity. It also includes an account of teenaged Herschel Cobb confronting Stump leading to a first-hand account of Stump's dishonesty.

==Regular season statistics==
Both official sources, such as [[Total Baseball]], and a number of independent researchers, including [[John Thorn]], have raised questions about Cobb's exact career totals. Hits have been re-estimated at between 4,189 and 4,191, due to a possible double-counted game in 1910. At-bats estimates have ranged as high as 11,437. The numbers shown below are the figures officially recognized on MLB.com.&lt;ref name="OfficialStats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/individual_stats_player.jsp?c_id=mlb&amp;playerID=112431&amp;HS=True|title=Historical Player Stats: Ty Cobb|accessdate=March 16, 2012|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was adopted at the conclusion of the World Conference on Linguistic Rights held 6–9 June 1996 in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=UDLR&gt;The World Conference on Linguistic Rights,"Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights", Barcelona Spain, June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also presented to the UNESCO Director General in 1996 &lt;ref name=CulturalRights.net&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights, 1996|url=http://www.culturalrights.net/en/documentos.php?c=18&amp;p=184|publisher=Cultural Rights: Culture and Development|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the Declaration has not gained formal approval from UNESCO.&lt;ref name="International PEN page on UNESCO Portal"&gt;{{cite web|title=International PEN: Linguistic Rights and Translation|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17398&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|work=UNESCO's List of NGOs|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===

[[File:Francisco Gomes de Matos(ed).jpg|150px|thumb|right|Francisco Gomes de Matos]]

Although the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) has language as one of its categories for equal rights, it does not explicitly list and elaborate on linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Languages of Israel: Policy, Ideology and Practice|year=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|location=United Kingdom|pages=52|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Xej-BQK9YEcC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=impacts+universal+declaration+of+linguistic+rights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkGb0koIPh&amp;sig=rjqTbxbl35KdVCc4fJEkT-7wML4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JpVT5SwBcPnrAfNtvCNBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author1=Spolsky, B.  |author2=Shohamy, E. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with declarations and rules on protecting specific languages and their rights, there was no binding document at that time that referred to all the languages or to world linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="FCUDLR Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENLLAÇ|url=http://www.linguistic-declaration.org/but-gb.htm|publisher=Linguistic Declaration.org|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there have been attempts to fill this gap by expanding on the importance of linguistic rights in the global scene.

In addition, the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (UDLR) holds regards to several policies that motivated the respect of linguistic rights. Some of the documents include:
* [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities|Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]]
* [[European Convention on Human Rights]]
* [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]
* [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]
* Universal Declaration of the Collective Rights of Peoples

The idea of a Declaration was first proposed in 1984, where a Brazilian by the name of Francisco Gomes de Matos introduced to the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers (FIPLV), a plea for a Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights.&lt;ref name="Plea for UDLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Typologies of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/MatosTwoTypologiesofLinguisticRights.pdf|publisher=Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He listed some of the principal linguistic rights, together with their educational implications.

One of the most significant motivations stemmed from the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication of 1987, held in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], which also recommended the introduction of a declaration for linguistic rights. The Seminar then adopted a preliminary declaration that indexed some fundamental types of linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt;

===Drafting===

The main objective of penning a Declaration was to define equality in linguistic rights, regardless of differences in political or territorial statuses. It serves to promote international commitment in respecting the rights of linguistic groups, especially those of historicity, as well as individuals who do not reside within their native communities.&lt;ref name="WACC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://waccglobal.org/en/19994-language-and-the-right-to-communicate/806-Universal-Declaration-of-Linguistic-Rights.html|publisher=The World Association for Christian Communication (WACC)|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the UDLR does not distinguish among official, non-official, majority, local, regional, and minority languages. There was much complexity tied to the drafting process because it was not easy to come up with equal measures, definitions and reasons, especially since it required an international consensus. For instance, one of the most common problems lie in clarifying concepts and their terminologies.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel" /&gt; Subsequently, follow-up meetings and feedback sessions were held in [[Paris]], [[Portugal]] and [[Frankfurt]].

In 1990, the FIPLV drafted a working document. On August 1991, the FIPLV organised a workshop in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]]. It was there that they managed to consolidate an agenda on fundamental principles for a UDLR. The Declaration was also discussed in December 1993, during a session of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the [[International PEN]].&lt;ref name="Linguistic Human Rights"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Human Rights: Overcoming Linguistic Discrimination|year=1995|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=99–100|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Jo3NobRqFUQC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author=Skutnabb-Kangas, T., Phillipson, R. &amp; Rannut, M.|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1994, a team was rooted to facilitate the process of writing the official document. About 40 experts from different countries and fields were involved in the first 12 drafts of the Declaration.&lt;ref name="CulturalRights.net" /&gt; Progressively, there were continuous efforts in revising and improving the Declaration as people contributed ideas to be included in it.

===Adoption===

It was on 6 June 1996, during the World Conference on Linguistic Rights in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], that the Declaration was acknowledged. The Conference, which was an initiative of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the [[International PEN|International PEN Club]] and the CIEMEN (Escarre International Center for Ethnic Minorities and the Nations), comprised 61 [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], 41 [[International PEN|PEN]] Centers and 40 experts. The document was signed and presented to a representative of the [[UNESCO]] Director General.&lt;ref name="CulturalRights.net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; However, this does not mean that the Declaration has gained approval.

In the same year, the Declaration was published in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It was later translated into other languages, some of which include [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Nynorsk]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].

Even so, there have been continuous efforts to bring the Declaration through as [[UNESCO]] did not officially endorse the UDLR at its General Conference in 1996,&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights" /&gt; and also in subsequent years, although they morally supported it.

As a result, a Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (FCUDLR) was created by the World Conference on Linguistic Rights. The FCUDLR is also represented by the CIEMEN, which is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organisation]].&lt;ref name="CIEMEN"&gt;{{cite news|title=CIEMEN presents a follow-up document before the Chairman of the UN Human Rights Council|url=http://www10.gencat.cat/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/noticies_detall.jsp?id=95&amp;idioma=5|accessdate=10 March 2012|newspaper=Linguamón News|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objectives of having a follow-up committee was to 1) garner support, especially from international bodies, so as to lend weight to the Declaration and see it through to [[UNESCO]], 2) to maintain contact with [[UNESCO]] and take into account the many viewpoints of its delegates, and 3) to spread awareness of the UDLR and establish a web of support.&lt;ref name="FCUDLR Bulletin" /&gt;

Consequently, the committee started a Scientific Council consisting of professionals in Linguistic Law. The duty of the Council is to update and improve the Declaration from time to time by gathering suggestions&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; from those who are keen on the issue of linguistic rights.

The following summarises the progress of the UDLR:

==Contents and Themes==
{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}

===Structure===
The preamble of the Declaration provides six reasons underlying the motivations to promote the stated principles.

To ensure clarity in applicability across diverse linguistic environments, the declaration has included a preliminary title that addresses the definitions of concepts used in its articles (Articles 1-6).&lt;ref name="UDLR Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|location=Orlando (Florida)|url=http://www.linguistic-declaration.org/versions/angles.pdf|author=Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Title One (Articles 7-14) lists general principles asserting equal linguistic rights for language communities and for the individual. Besides the main principles, the second title delves into an overall linguistic régime and is further divided into 6 sections. Section 1 (Articles 15-22) addresses language usage related to public administration and official bodies. Section 2 (Articles 23-30) touches on linguistic rights involving educational fields. 
Section 3 (Articles 31-34) defines linguistic rights concerning [[onomastics|naming]], while Section 4 (Articles 35-40) asserts the entitlement of language groups to mass media resources and new technologies. Section 5 (Articles 41-46) outlines the rights related to cultural artifacts. The last section of the second title, Section 6 (Article 47-52), touches on the individual or language group's rights in the socioeconomic sphere.

The Additional Dispositions call for the obligation of public powers to take measures ensuring the application of these rights and to inform other related bodies of these proclamations. As for the Final Dispositions, the founding of a Council of the Languages within the [[United Nations]] Organization is put forth, as well as the creation of a World Commission for Linguistic Rights, which is to be an unofficial, consultative council composed of experts in non-governmental organizations and those in the field of linguistic law.&lt;ref name="UNESCO's UDLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.unesco.org/cpp/uk/declarations/linguistic.pdf|work=Major Non-Governmental Documents, UNESCO.org|publisher=UNESCO: Culture of Peace Programme|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening Article===
'''Preliminary Title: Article 1'''

1. This Declaration considers as a language community any human society established historically
in a particular territorial space, whether this space be recognized or not, which identifies itself as a
people and has developed a common language as a natural means of communication and cultural
cohesion among its members. The term language specific to a territory refers to the language of the
community historically established in such a space.&lt;ref name="UNESCO's UDLR" /&gt;

==Reactions==

One of the comments made was on the idealistic nature of the Declaration. As the Declaration considers all languages equal, it rejects terms such as ‘official’, ‘regional’ or ‘minority’ languages and strongly advocates the full use of all historic community languages.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"/&gt;

Drawing from the articles pertaining to the educational issues (Articles 25, 26 and 30), it is stated that the education system should fully support the development of their community languages and other languages they wish to know in schools to the point of fluency and capability to use it in all social situations. In addition, research on language and culture of language communities is to be done at the university level. It has been argued that the 'rights' stated in those articles will remain the privilege of powerful language communities.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=543|author=Tove Skutnabb-Kangas|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that since the Declaration requires authorities to issue sanctions in the event of violation of the proclaimed rights, doubts have arisen regarding the likelihood of any government adopting the document.&lt;ref name="Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction|year=2006|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Xej-BQK9YEcC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA&amp;dq=impacts+universal+declaration+of+linguistic+rights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkGb0koIPh&amp;sig=rjqTbxbl35KdVCc4fJEkT-7wML4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JpVT5SwBcPnrAfNtvCNBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author=Tasaku Tsunoda|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governmental groups (other than the regional authorities in [[Spain]] such as [[Catalonia]], [[Menorca]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]]) in most countries find it hard to reconcile these fundamental principles of the Declaration with their current language policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"/&gt;
There is a need to balance between regulations imposed by governments and the protection of the rights of the people in different language communities. Considerations such as acknowledging the primary human rights of minority peoples (e.g. issues of physical survival) are, instead, regarded as more dire than an issue like linguistic rights. Linguistic rights will hence be ignored before primary human rights can be properly attended to. Furthermore, the cost involved in executing sanctions is another cause of concern.&lt;ref name="Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction"/&gt; The main issue, however, is the fact that the article is not legally binding and duty-holders are never specified.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"/&gt;

Other responses include the issue that more rights are given to ‘language communities’ in the Declaration. In the context of education, it is observed that other than language communities (equivalent to ‘national territorially based minorities'), those who do not fit under this category will have to ‘assimilate’, as having the right to education in the language of the territory does not necessarily equate to having the right to an education in one’s own language.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"/&gt;

==Developments==

===Efforts in Ratification===

The Declaration is not [[International law|constitutional]] and has not been ratified by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], unlike the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Despite the Follow-up Committee’s publication of the text in 1998,&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; which was backed by letters of support from world leaders, [[UNESCO]] has not ratified the document.&lt;ref name="International PEN page on UNESCO Portal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fédération Internationale des Professeurs de Langues Vivantes (FIPLV) and Language Rights|url=http://www.atriumlinguarum.org/contenido/langrights.pdf|publisher=Observatorio Atrium Linguarum|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 19 April 2002, CIEMEN and [[International PEN]] convoked a summit during the World Congress on Language Policies in Barcelona. The FIPLV suggested that it would modify the Declaration so that it would be accepted and implemented. There were also further efforts to foster support for the UDLR through proposals and conferences in 2003.&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights" /&gt;

Since 2008, CIEMEN has been lobbying to place linguistic rights on the agenda of the states that are currently members of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC). Despite the positive responses to the document, member states perceived a lack of consensus on the matter and did not wish to be among the first to adopt the proposal. An event organised in Geneva in 2008, entitled ''Linguistic Rights to enhance Human Rights'', which coincided with the Eighth Session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]], aimed to garner support for a draft resolution for the UDLR to be presented at the September session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] conference. Ambassadors from [[Mexico]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Armenia]] and [[Nigeria]] expressed their support in a series of interviews. Later in September, the Advisory Committee of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] was called upon to take steps to present a proposal, in hopes that the UDLR could be added to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Nationalia: Linguistic rights closer to recognition by UN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Linguistic rights closer to being recognized by UN|url=http://www.nationalia.info/en/news/271|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=Nationalia|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girona Manifesto===
The Girona Manifesto was developed by [[International PEN]]'s Translation and Linguistic Rights in May 2011 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Declaration.&lt;ref name=www20.gencat.cat&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalan chapter of the International PEN organization leads revisions to Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/afersexteriors/menuitem.548116b848978a59fea66dfbb0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ae30321283550310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ae30321283550310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall&amp;contentid=eaeac4966c681310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;newLang=en_GB|publisher=gencat|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Girona Manifesto is an updated version that condenses the primary principles of the UDLR to aid its implementation. In September 2011, the manifesto was ratified by the International PEN Assembly of Delegates at the 77th Congress.&lt;ref name=pen-international.org1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girona Manifesto: Encapsulating the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/the-girona-manifesto-encapsulating-the-universal-declaration-of-linguistic-rights/
|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of the manifesto is based on the Universal Declaration’s 10 central principles. In contrast to the comprehensive and complex declaration which plays an important role in the field of linguistics and politics, the manifesto is laid out in a concise and practical way, intended to be ‘translated and disseminated as a tool to defend linguistic diversity around the world'. The goal is to bring attention the issue of language rights back to the international agenda.&lt;ref name="pen-international.org1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pen-international.org" /&gt;

It is thought to be an important step toward protecting and promoting all of the world's languages, including the ones at risk of extinction.&lt;ref name="pen-international.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girona Manifesto Press Release|url=http://www.pen-international.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/15092011.pdf|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[John Ralston Saul]], President of [[International PEN]] mentioned, "[It] could give us a clear public document with which to defend and advance languages with smaller populations as well as endangered languages".&lt;ref name="pen-international.org1" /&gt;

On 5 March 2012, the Girona Manifesto and its translated versions were presented at an event organized by Catalan PEN Centre. It was held at the Palau de la Generalitat, Barcelona.&lt;ref name=pen-international.orgnewsitems&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto translation appeal|url=http://pen-international.org/newsitems/girona-manifesto-translation-appeal/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto has been translated in 32 languages to date.&lt;ref name=pen-international.orgnewsitems1&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto On Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.pen-international.org/who-we-are/translation-linguistic-rights/girona-manifesto/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text of the Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights''':&lt;ref name=pen-international.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights (English)|url=http://pen-international.org/who-we-are/translation-linguistic-rights/girona-manifesto/girona-manifesto-on-linguistic-rights/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Linguistic diversity is a world heritage that must be valued and protected.

2. Respect for all languages and cultures is fundamental to the process of constructing and maintaining dialogue and peace in the world.

3. All individuals learn to speak in the heart of a community that gives them life, language, culture and identity.

4. Different languages and different ways of speaking are not only means of communication; they are also the milieu in which humans grow and cultures are built.

5. Every linguistic community has the right for its language to be used as an official language in its territory.

6. School instruction must contribute to the prestige of the language spoken by the linguistic community of the territory.

7. It is desirable for citizens to have a general knowledge of various languages, because it favours empathy and intellectual openness, and contributes to a deeper knowledge of one’s own tongue.

8. The translation of texts, especially the great works of various cultures, represents a very important element in the necessary process of greater understanding and respect among human beings.

9. The media is a privileged loudspeaker for making linguistic diversity work and for competently and rigorously increasing its prestige.

10. The right to use and protect one’s own language must be recognized by the United Nations as one of the fundamental human rights
