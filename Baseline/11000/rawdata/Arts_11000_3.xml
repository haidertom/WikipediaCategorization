'''An Leabhar Breac''' ("Speckled Book"), now less commonly '''Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre''' (The Great Book of Dun Doighre") or possibly erroneously, '''Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin''' ("The Speckled Book of the [[MacEgans]]"),&lt;ref&gt;The Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin is the title of a book cited by [[Geoffrey Keating]] in Book III of ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', described as an "old book of annals" (''seinleabhar annálach'') and probably now lost. [http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html Irish Script on Screen].&lt;/ref&gt; is a medieval Irish vellum manuscript containing [[Middle Irish]] and [[Hiberno-Latin]] writings. The manuscript is held in the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in Dublin, where it is catalogued as [[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]] MS '''23 P 16''' or '''1230'''.

It was most probably compiled by [[Murchadh Ó Cuindlis|Murchadh (Riabach) Ó Cuindlis]] of Bally Lough Deacker, at Duniry between the years 1408 and 1411. [[Duniry]] — Dún Daighre, Dún Doighre — in eastern [[Clanricarde]] (now east [[County Galway]]) is situated south-east of the town of [[Loughrea]], and in the medieval era was home to a branch of the bardic Clann [[Mac Aodhagáin]] (the MacEgans), who served as brehons for the O'Connors of Clanricarde.

==History==
In the 16th century, the manuscript was in the possession of the Mac Egans of Duniry, hence the older title Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre. In 1629, when the manuscript was held in the convent of [[Kinalehin Friary|Kinalehin]], County Galway.

It was consulted by [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], brother of the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]], who copied pp.&amp;nbsp;272–7. The book passed into the possession of [[Eamon Ó Ceallaigh]] (Co. Roscommon) in 1732, then of Dr. John O'Brien by 1768 and finally of [[Cornelius O'Daly]] (Mitchelstown, Co. Cork). The [[Royal Irish Academy]] acquired the first volume in 1789, when General [[Charles Vallancey]] purchased it for the academy for 3 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] from Cornelius O'Daly. O'Daly also owned the second volume, which comprises nine leaves, but was unaware that it belonged to the larger volume. In 1789, this volume was acquired by [[Chevalier O'Gorman]], by George Smith of College Green in the next century and by the Academy sometime after 1844. The manuscript is held in the Academy's library in Dublin to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html Irish Script on Screen].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The manuscript is of a large size, measuring 40.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, which makes it the largest Irish vellum manuscript to have been written by a single scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Irish Academy, [http://www.ria.ie/library+catalogue/word/Leabhar%20Breac.doc "Leabhar Breac"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118200919/http://www.ria.ie/library%2Bcatalogue/word/Leabhar%20Breac.doc |date=November 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 40 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s, which are written in double columns. Capitals are decorated in a simple style, with some letters having been interwoven with zoomorphic patterns and coloured in red, vermilion, yellow and blue. There are two drawings, a flower-like diagram on p.&amp;nbsp;121 and a drawing of the Crucifixion on p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html the images at ISOS].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The manuscript consists almost entirely of religious writings in Latin and [[Middle Irish]]. It includes homiletic ''Lives'' of [[Saint Patrick]], [[Saint Columba]], [[Saint Brigid]], [[Saint Cellach]], and [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], the earliest version of ''[[Félire Óengusso]]'' ("Martyrology of [[Óengus Céile Dé|Óengus]]"), the ''Rule of the Céli Dé'', ''[[Aislinge Meic Con Glinne]]'' ("The Vision of Mac Conglinne"), a version of ''[[Fís Adamnáin]]'' ("The Vision of [[Adamnán]]"), ''[[Saltair na Rann]]'', ''Stair Nicomeid'' ("Gospel of Nicodemus"), ''Amra Choluim Chille'', a [[Marian litany]], and various ecclesiastical legends, hymns, catecheses and homilies. Exceptions to the predominantly religious contents are ''[[Sanas Cormaic]]'' ("Cormac's Glossary") and a history of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, E. (ed. and tr.). "Die irische Alexandersage." [[ZCP]] 30 (1967): 71–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glosses and notes==
The numerous notes which Murchadh Ó Cuindlis jotted into the margins afford us a unique glimpse of the circumstances of the writing process. These range from everyday details like a cat straying about or a robin singing in a beautiful voice to a nearby pillage in [[Lorrha]] by a certain Murchad Ua Madagáin. A persistent object of complaint for the writer is the weather, in particular the cold.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, Leabhar Breac."&gt;O'Neill, "Leabhar Breac."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the notes, Tomás Ó Concheanainn has been able to reconstruct the time span in which certain sections had been written. For instance, it took the scribe about 6 weeks to write 35 pages (pp.&amp;nbsp;141–75), while some parts proved more challenging, such as a column for a poem with interlinear glosses, which cost him a day.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, Leabhar Breac." /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">__NOTOC__
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] continues a tradition found in Islam of not using depictions in art of people considered a [[Manifestation of God]]. This includes both images and drama. There exist several photographs and paintings of both  the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and these are viewed by Bahá'ís on rare occasions, typically on an organized [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to [[Haifa, Israel]].

The existence of images of the religion's founders is not offensive to Bahá'ís. However, they are encouraged to not display them in private homes or in public, and to treat them with a special degree of reverence and respect.

[[Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote:
:"There is no objection that the believers look at the [[Bahá'u'lláh#Photographs and imagery|picture of Bahá'u'lláh]], but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, December 6, 1939, republished in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 540)

Shoghi Effendi has also written in the ''Directives from the Guardian'' regarding the portrait of the [[Báb]]:
:"The portrait of the Báb should be regarded as an inestimable privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on."&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi: ''Directives from the Guardian'' Published in 1973.  Accessed on February 2, 2006 from http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-115.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jelle:  ''The Babi Question You Mentioned?The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of the Netherlands'', pg. 243.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">The Commonwealth of [[Australia]]'s ''Designs Act 2003'' replaced the ''Designs Act 1906''. The legislation assists in the protection of the overall appearance of a product resulting from one or more visual features of the product. Although there are some overlaps, the Designs Act is not applicable when defending the functional [[innovation]]s of a product. In [[common law]], ''Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors'' (1987) 180 CLR 483, supports this. Firmagroup Australia Pty registered a design for a ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’. The innovative product was copied by Byrne &amp; Davidson, and Firmagroup sued for infringement on design. The High Court held that the ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’ was ‘an idea of shape or configuration’, which is ‘conveyed by those features’, was ‘too general to attract statutory protection’. The Court then restricted the [[monopoly]] to the specific, individual appearance. Further, it added that ‘No design should be so construed as to give to its proprietor a monopoly in a method or principle of construction.’&lt;ref&gt;''Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors'' (1987) 180 CLR 483.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant proved to distinguish his product adequately, and thus did not infringe on Firmagroup’s design.

==Definition of a design==
Under the legislation, a design, in relation to a product, means the overall appearance of the product resulting from one or more visual features of the product.&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s5"&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s5.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the design is only a design, for the purposes of the Designs Act, when it is used in relation to the registered product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s8.&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates that the registration of the design does not protect the business against the same design being used on other products; the pattern itself cannot be registered.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, M., J., Monotti, A., L., Wiseman, L., (2008) Australian Intellectual Property Law, New York, USA, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the act covers both, two-dimensional designs&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s63"&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(3).&lt;/ref&gt; (such as a logo on a cup), and three-dimensional designs&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s63"/&gt; (such as the shape of the cup). Furthermore, Dixon J, in ''Macrae Knitting Mills Ltd v Lowes Ltd'' (1936) 55 CLR 725, confirms that ‘The Act is concerned with shape and configuration, not function’. The Act, stipulates that a visual feature may, but need not, serve a functional purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s7 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the design’s every visual feature serves a functional purpose, then common law states that the design is not registrable.&lt;ref&gt;W. van caenegem (2006), Intellectual Property (2nd ed), Sydney, [[LexisNexis]] Butterworths; Dart Industries Inc v Décor Corp Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 408: ‘if the shape exists solely to make the article work or function then it is not within the concept of a registered design’. Cited with approval in Phillips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 283, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Designs Act states that should an innovation be both, a visual feature, and serve a functional purpose, there is nothing to stop the design being registered.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law, ''British Franco Electric Pty Ltd v Dowling Plastics Pty Ltd'' [1981] NSWLR 448, reinforces the view the courts take on the distinction between a function and a design. In the case, both companies entered into a business selling and manufacturing furniture castors. Dowling Plastics developed the castor, and British Franco registered the design. Soon after the joint venture broke up, Dowling Plastics continued the production of the castors. However, British Franco claimed that Dowling Plastics were infringing on British Franco’s [[Industrial design rights|registered design]]. Dowling put forth an argument questioning the validity of the registration of the design, as the only novel feature of the castor served a functional purpose, and when the castor is assembled, the design would not be seen. The court held in favour of Dowling, however, they were not persuaded by the business’s argument, ruling that the functional purpose of the article is irrelevant, when the design does not satisfy other requirements for registration.

==Definition of a ‘product’==
The act outlines, that a product is a thing that is manufactured or handmade.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, even if a component part of a product is made separately from the product itself, for the purposes of the Designs Act, it is still a product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Even a kit made for assembly of a particular product, is that product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the issue came to designs that vary in their dimensions (such as roof guttering), the items are still considered products, as long as following conditions apply:
* a) A cross-section taken across any indefinite dimension is fixed or varies according to a regular pattern;
* b) All the dimensions remain in proportion
* c) The cross-sectional shape remains the same throughout, whether or not the dimensions of that shape vary according to a ratio or series of ratios;
* d) It has a pattern or ornamentation that repeats itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the design and the product==
One of the deep-seated aspects of the Designs Act is the distinction between the idea of a product, and the design relating to that product. Thus, the designs act will not grant a monopoly to a business attempting to register a fundamental or essential form of a product.
This is supported by common law, in ''Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd'' (1985) 5 IPR 97, when the High Court held that the Designs Act does not give a monopoly to the trading of the article to which it is applied. For example, without a design, a chair would still be a chair, a fork would still be a fork, etc.… Bollen, J, further clarified that &lt;blockquote&gt;
a design
turns a chair into something more than a mere chair. It becomes a chair with a conception or suggestion about shape or configuration beyond the fundamental form of a chair
&lt;/blockquote&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd'' (1985) 5 IPR 97&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the case established that a fundamental form cannot be registered as a design.

==Component and spare parts==
The Designs Act also caters for components and spare parts of a product. The Act provides a monopoly for a component part of a product, which it deems to be a product for the purposes of the act.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
However, The Designs Act does not provide clarity when the issue is regarding a fundamental nature of components and spare parts. It is deep-seated in legislation and common law, that if a product is a fundamental form or shape of a product, then the product cannot be registrable. Although the spare part is purely manufactured for the purpose of attaching to its larger counterpart, it is not clear if that is seen, by legislation and common law, as being dictated by a functional purpose. Further, in most cases, the designer of the spare part also had a number of potential shapes to choose from, thus the spare part cannot be the fundamental form, thus rendering the product registrable.

==When is a design registrable?==
The design is registrable if it fits the following characteristics:
* a) The design is new
* b) The design is distinctive when compared to the [[prior art]] base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design &lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design rights==
After registration, the owner of the registered design owns a renewable monopoly for 5 years, and has the [[exclusive right]]s to :
* a) To make or offer to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies the design; and
* b) To import such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; and
* c) To sell, hire and otherwise dispose of, or offer to sell, hire or otherwise deispose of, such a product; and
* d) To use such a product in any way for the purpose of any trade or business; and
* e) To keep such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d)
* f) To authorize another person to do any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e)&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement of designs==
A person infringes a registered design if, during the term of registration of the design, and without the licence or authority of the registered owner of the design, the person:
* (a) makes or offers to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; or
* (b) imports such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; or
* (c) sells, hires or otherwise disposes of, or offers to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, such a product; or
* (d) uses such a product in any way for the purposes of any trade or business; or
* (e) keeps such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d)&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s71(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identical or substantially similar in overall impression==
In subsection (a), the section mentions a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression. While the test for the design being identical is uncomplicated, to determine whether the design is substantially similar in overall impression and how it is substantially similar, the act refers to s19. The section stipulates that the court pay more attention to the similarities rather than the differences, must have regard for prior art base, and contextualize a certain part of the design that is similar, in relation to the whole design. The court must then apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s19.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act does not require any party to establish that the registered design was copied, the mere registration of the design, protects against independent creation.

==Defences==
If the defendant is repairing a complex product that has at least two replaceable component parts, permitting disassembly and re-assembly,&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s5"/&gt; then they may claim a defence under s72 of the Act, on the condition that the repair is for the purpose of restoring the complex products’ overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s72.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Legal burden of proof|onus of proof]] is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known that the use of authorisation was not for the permitted purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s72(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">A '''bandleader''' is the leader of a [[music group]] such as a [[band (rock and pop)|rock or pop group]] or [[jazz quartet]]. The term is most commonly, though not exclusively, used with a group that plays [[popular music]] as a small combo or a [[big band]], such as one which plays [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[rhythm and blues]] or [[rock and roll]]  music.&lt;ref name="club"&gt;''Club Date Musicians: Playing the New York Party Circuit''. Bruce A. MacLeod. University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|9780252019548}} (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most bandleaders  are also performers with their own band, either as [[singer]]s or as [[instrumentalist]]s, playing an instrument such as [[electric guitar]], [[piano]], or other instruments.

==Roles==
The bandleader must have a variety of musical skills. A bandleader needs to be a [[music director]] who chooses the "setlist" (the list of songs that will be played in a show), sets the tempo for each song and starts each song (often by "counting in"), leads the start of new sections of songs (e.g., signalling for the start of a [[guitar solo]] or [[drum solo]]) and leads the endings of each song. The bandleader is also onstage with the group, so she or he has to be a strong performer on [[lead vocals]] or an instrument. The bandleader also needs to have a good general knowledge of the different parts played by all the [[rhythm section]] instruments (guitar, keyboards, [[electric bass]], [[drum kit]]) and solo instruments (e.g., [[lead guitar]], [[saxophone]], etc.), as he/she/it/them has to [[audition]] prospective new members of the band and lead rehearsals. The bandleader also typically selects new songs for the group, particularly if the group is a [[cover band]] or a [[tribute band]]. In some cases, the bandleader may manage other aspects of the band, such as organizing tours and [[sound recording]] sessions. Some bandleaders are also [[composer]]s and [[songwriter]]s for their group.

Often the bands are named after their bandleaders, or the [[backing band]] is given its own name, distinct from the bandleader (e.g., [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[E Street Band]] or [[Elvis Costello]] and [[The Attractions]]). Some older bands have continued operating under their bandleaders' names long after the death of the original bandleader.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;

The '''Belgrade Drama Theatre''' ({{lang-sr|Београдско драмско позориште|Beogradsko dramsko pozorište}}; abbr. '''BDP''') is a theatre located in [[Belgrade]], Serbia.

==History==
Belgrade Drama Theatre was founded in August 1947, and it was the first city theater formed in [[Belgrade]] after the [[Second World War]]. The first opening night of "The Youth of the Fathers" by [[Boris Gorbatov]] staged by Petar S. Petrović was performed on the stage on 20 February 1948. The building on [[Crveni Krst (Belgrade)|Crveni Krst]], in which this theater is nowadays, was opened in the season of 1948/49, and the first opening night performed on this stage was "Sumnjivo lice" by [[Branislav Nušić]], produced by Bosnian Salko Repak, on 20 March 1949. In the period from 1959 to 1975, BDP, with Belgrade Comedy, made one theater house - "Contemporary Theater", and in December 1975, it became the Belgrade Drama Theater again.

In the mid-1950s and in the beginning of the 1960s, BDP had its "golden" period, mostly owing to particularly successful performances of the works of contemporary American playwrights and a brilliant galaxy of actors, stage managers, stage designers, costume designers, who, with their talents, made the reputation of the stage on Crveni Krst. The legendary performances of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'', ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' and other contemporary classics came near the cult status among the theatergoers.

Today, BDP works with a repertory artistic company and carries on the tradition created by performances of the classic and [[avant-garde]] dramatic literature, whereby it has created and maintained its recognizable style and artistic expression. In the spring of 2003, a thorough reconstruction of the theater building was completed, bringing it to the level of high European standards.

'''Bertram David Lewin''' (1896-1971) was an American [[psychoanalyst]] who was both an acute clinician and a contributor to theory, particularly to the study of [[Hypermania|elation]], and of the dream screen.

==Training and contributions==
Lewin had a training analysis with [[Franz Alexander]] in Berlin in the 1920s, before publishing his first analytic article in 1930.  This was followed by ten more over the next decade, on subjects ranging from diabetes and [[claustrophobia]] to the body as [[phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 636&lt;/ref&gt;  The main focus of his interest, however, was in manic states, which he saw as characterised by fleeting identifications with a multiple of outside figures.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he published the fruits of his investigations in ''The Psychoanalysis of Elation'' (1951).  There he stressed the role of [[denial]] in mania – denial particularly of feelings of separation and loss.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Skubal, ''Word of Mouth'' (2013) p. 35-6&lt;/ref&gt;  He also explored the paradox in elation's dark counterpart, depression, whereby the melancholic in seeking to punish the effigy of their loved one in fact punishes themselves having incorporated this effigy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Darian Leader]], ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

By that point he had also published his seminal article (1946) on the dream screen – the backcloth formed from primitive memories of the breast onto which the dream is projected.&lt;ref&gt;L. Fischer, ''Shot/Countershot'' (2014) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept would be fruitfully followed up both within analysis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Pearson, ''Analyst of the Imagination'' (2004) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of [[film theory]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Fischer, ''Cinematernity'' (2014) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bird stones''' are [[prehistoric]], [[abstract art|abstract]] stone carvings made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The artifacts were a common inclusion in graves and thought to have ceremonial importance. They are noted for their distinctive simplicity and beauty. They first appeared in the middle [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]] around 5,000 years ago and continued into the early [[Woodland period]] to about 2,500 years before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rslive.bslcore.com/article.php?aid=3906&amp;cid=3|title=The Enigmatic Birdstone|website=www.rslive.bslcore.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact purpose of these artifacts is not known, but most have a small hole drilled at the base of the neck and another at the aft end, presumably for mounting. Some theories suggest they were part of an [[atlatl]] (a short rod to hurl spears), in addition to their ceremonial uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/nat_amer/pre/htmls/a_weapons.html|title=Native Americans:Prehistoric:Archaic:Technology:Weapons|website=www.museum.state.il.us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that these artifacts were worn as decorative items denoting marriage status or pregnancy,&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodge|first1=Frederick Webb|title=Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, Part 1|date=1907|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington, DC|pages=148–149|url=https://archive.org/stream/americanindians00hodggoog#page/n2/mode/2up|ref=Hodge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[totem]]s representing tribes.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=George X.|title=The Significance of the So-Called Bird-Stone|journal=American Antiquity|date=January 1936|volume=1|issue=3|page=225|doi=10.2307/275148|jstor=275148|ref=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird stones were mostly made east of the [[Mississippi]], and the thousands in existence have been found primarily in New York, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Micropædia, Vol II at p36&lt;/ref&gt; The stones range in length from 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches, and have unique variations in style.

'''Body image''' is a person's perception of the [[aesthetics]] or [[sexual attractiveness]] of their own body. It involves how a person sees themselves according to the standards that have been set by society. The Austrian [[neurologist]] and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Paul Schilder]] coined the phrase ''body-image'' in his book ''The Image and Appearance of the Human Body'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Schilder1999"&gt;{{cite book|last= Schilder|first= Paul |authorlink= Paul Schilder|title= The Image and Appearance of the Human Body: Studies in the Constructive Energies of the Psyche|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L2CNWxKdWhMC&amp;pg=PA17|year= 1999|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-21081-2|orig-year= 1935|p=11 | quote = The body schema is the tri-dimensional image everyone has about himself. We may call it 'body-image'.}} This work translates and expands Schilder's 1923 work: {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Human society]] has at all times placed great value on beauty of the human body, but a person's perception of their own body may not correspond to society's standards.

The concept of body image is used in a number of disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]] and [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[feminist studies]]; the media also often uses the term . Across these disciplines and media there is no consensus definition, but body image may be expressed as how people view themselves in the mirror, or in their minds. It incorporates the memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons of one's own appearance, and overall attitudes towards one's height, shape, and weight.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title= What is Body Image?|publisher= National Eating Disorders Association|access-date= 2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's impression of their body is also assumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a product of ideals cultivated by various social and cultural ideals.

The issues surrounding body image can be examined through body negativity and through [[body positivity]]. Negative body image consists of a disoriented view of one's shape; whereby one may often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aside from having low [[Self-Esteem, Self-Love|self-esteem]], sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of [[eating disorders]], isolation, and [[mental illnesses]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having a negative body-image may lead to a more serious mental illness such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]: "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), occasionally still called dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix their [[Body dysmorphic disorder|dysmorphic]] part on their person..."{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= May 2018}}
Positive body image on the other hand, is described as a clear true perception of one's figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual's appearance does not reflect their character or self-worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2007 report by the [[American Psychological Association]] found that a culture-wide [[sexualization]] of girls and women was contributing to increased female [[anxiety]] associated with body image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |title= Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls |year= 2007 |format = PDF |publisher= American Psychological Association |url= http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian government]] [[Australian Senate committees|Senate Standing Committee]] report on the [[sexualization of children]] in the media reported similar findings associated with body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Completed_inquiries/2008-10/sexualisationofchildren/report/index|title= Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media|date= June 26, 2008|publisher= Parliament of Australia |access-date= 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.&lt;ref name="tamiu"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ferguson |first= C. |author2= Winegard, B. |author3= Winegard, B.M. |title= Who is the fairest one of all: How evolution guides peer and media influences on female body dissatisfaction |journal= Review of General Psychology |date= March 2011 |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |url= http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |doi= 10.1037/a0022607 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/65q5xHqLw?url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |archivedate= 2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body image can have a wide range of psychological effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people to live up to the standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Many factors contribute to a person's body image; some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for [[obesity]] or [[malnutrition]], and cultural expectations (e.g., [[Media depictions of body shape|media]] and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image. However, when people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Derenne|first= J. L.,|author2= Beresin E. V.|title= Body image, media, and eating disorders|journal= Academic Psychiatry|year= 2006|issue= 30|pages= 257–261|url= http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130415161703/http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|archivedate= 2013-04-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by [[dieting]] or by undergoing [[cosmetic surgery]]. "We expected women would feel worse about their bodies after seeing ultra-thin models, compared to no models if they have internalized the thin ideal, this replicating previous findings."&lt;ref name="DittmarHoward2004"&gt;

Society often constructs our behaviors and beliefs, such as personal developments, physiological and psychological interactions, and the common "perception of our bodies as a reflection of self worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://livelifegetactive.com/blog/body-image-self-esteem|title=Body image, self-esteem and the influence of society|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Live Life Get Active|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.

During [[Ancient Egyptian]] times, the perfect woman was said to have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Yet, females were emboldened in their beauty habits and general independence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rehabs.com/explore/womens-body-image-and-bmi/|title=Women's Body Image and BMI: 100 Years in the US|publisher=rehabs.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards were reformed in [[Ancient Greece]], when society began worshipping the male figure instead. As men faced greater pressures on beauty and perfection, women sported a fuller and plump figure, with fair skin tones becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The pale skin craze was soon adopted in the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]], but waist sizes narrowed. Overall figures shrunk, as the Chinese associated petite with [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With the need to reflect her husband's status, the behaviors and outward appearances of the wife grew incredible crucial during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Since size was linked to wealth, women maintained bodies with full hips and an ample bosom.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the corset cinching the waist, led to the desirable hourglass figure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The era also introduced the [[Gibson Girl]], which was the first sign of influence by the fashion and media industries. Created by [[Charles Gibson]], he envisioned femininity as slim and tall, with large busts and wide hips, but a narrow waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls were also often shown in magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'', which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], the Gibson Girl transformed into the [[Flapper]], which dominated the period of the "[[Roaring Twenties]]". Women transitioned towards [[Androgyny|androgynous]] looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dress senses become more casual as well, and is said to have been a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the matron like image of the women behind the alcohol [[Prohibition]] movement in the USA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ideal-body-types-throughout-history/|title=A Look Back at Beauty Through History|date=2016-05-10|publisher=Science of People|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.

The 1930s and 1940s witnessed the devastating effects of the [[World War II|2nd World War]]. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workforce. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the [[hourglass figure]], through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since this era was part of the [[Hollywood Golden Age|golden age of Hollywood]], many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. [[Pin-up girls]] and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Sophia Loren]], and [[Jessica Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Should Body-Shaming Ads Be Banned |magazine=Scholastic Choices |date=November–December 2016 |url=https://choices.scholastic.com/issues/2016-17/110116/should-body-shaming-ads-be-banned.html |pages=32(3), 2–5}}&lt;!-- Was book ref lacking URL; have I got the right ref? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The release of [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]] and the [[Barbie|''Barbie'' doll]] during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Depictions of the perfect woman slowly grew thinner from 1960s onwards. The "[[Swinging Sixties]]" saw a similar look to the Flapper&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with the emergence of high-fashion model [[Twiggy]], who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and an adolescent but androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This eventually resulted in an increase in [[anorexia nervosa]] sufferers during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater importance was soon placed on fitness. Actress [[Farrah Fawcett]] introduced a more toned and athletic body type.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The exercise craze continued in the 1980s with [[Jane Fonda]] and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Cindy Crawford]], dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater issues arose in the 1990s, when supermodel [[Kate Moss]] popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion industry pushed her image further with the 'heroin-chic' look, which dominated the [[catwalks]] during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000s saw the rise of the [[Victoria's Secret]] models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent [[thigh gap]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

More women pursued cosmetic surgery practices, on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, positive measures are being taken to promote a better body image such as the emergence of fitness trends and plus-size models in the fashion and media industries. However, the advancement of technologies and pressures from the media have led to even greater importance being placed on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== The media ==

On account of the evolution of society today; [[text messaging]], [[e-mails]], [[social media]], and other technological advancements have dominated an individual's sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a "platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/eating-disorder/body-image-technology|title=How Technology Influences Body Image |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by ''[[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'', only 4% of women thought they were beautiful,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Cindy |title=Sex, College, and Social Media: A Commonsense Guide to Navigating the Hookup Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZicxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81858-2|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media's portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dove-global-body-image-report_uk_5762a6a1e4b0681487dcc470|title=Dove's Largest Ever Body Image Report Proves The Media Needs To Up Its Game|date=2016-06-21|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ''[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]'' reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/body-image-statistics/|title=Body Image Statistics|date=2017-02-19|publisher=Statistic Brain|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Women "all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30205/1/how-should-we-tackle-fashion-s-body-image-issues|title=How should we tackle fashion's body image issues? |date=2016-03-04|publisher=Dazed|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; be it [[Ageism|age]], [[Colorism|skin tone]], or [[Anti-fat bias|size]]. A large facet of "[[social currency]] for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look, social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate [[Commodification|commodity]], and used for the selling of products.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web | title = how the fashion industry affects the bodies of young women | last = Mair | first = Avril | publisher = i-D | date = November 21, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-11-16 | url = https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kybkv/how-the-fashion-industry-affects-the-bodies-of-young-women | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate purpose of many advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fueling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems are more likely to purchase their products. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|publisher=The Balance|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisements today display an image of the 'perfect' woman with an idealistic body and flawless facial features. This ideal woman creates an unrealistic image for women and puts pressure on them to live up to that certain standard. According to [[Naomi Wolf]] "our culture disempowers women by holding them prisoner to an unattainable beauty ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Eating Disorders and the Role of the Media|last1=Spettigue|first1=Wendy|first2= Katherine A. |last2=Henderson|pmc=2533817|journal=The Canadian Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Review|date=February 2004 |volume=13|issue=1|pp=16–19|pmid=19030149}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reference various researcher's experiments in this field and the results that were found. For example, they refer to Hargreaves &amp; Tiggemann (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hargreaves|first=Duane|date=|title=Longer-term implications of responsiveness to 'thin-ideal' television: support for a cumulative hypothesis of body image disturbance?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.509/full|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=11|pages=465–477|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/erv.509|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they look at how exposure to television adverts that contain women of a thin-ideal effects the body image of the women watching them. They found that the exposure led to an increase in body dissatisfaction.

The need for body satisfaction and appearance esteem continues to increase with the abundance of [[billboards]], magazines, and conversations displaying "unrealistic images of beauty" (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices brought up in the media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet''.[[Body image#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability. This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the [[mainstream media]], whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance.[[Body image#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Hence, a women's attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society's obsession with thinness.  A study was done by Rachel Cohen in 2015 to investigate if [[Facebook]] impacted the number of women experiencing body dissatisfaction, 'Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the relationship between appearance comparison and body image dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social media images, compared to conventional media images'

Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a [[The Thin Ideal|damaging mentality,]] and negative habits in young, adult females.

Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The ''[[National Eating Disorders Association]]'', reported that 95% of individuals who suffer from an eating disorder are aged 12 to 26,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperosoftware.com/uk/blog/national-eating-disorder-awareness-week-nedaw-what-you-need-to-know/|title=National Eating Disorder Awareness Week (NEDAW) {{!}} Impero|date=2016-02-22|publisher=Impero UK|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anorexia is the third most common illness among teenagers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Based on another study by ''Dove'', 87% of individuals with low body-esteems often avoid eating, and would rather place their health at risk for the sake of beauty. With the habitual use of social media, teenage girls in particular, are most prone "to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance".&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rawhide.org/blog/infographics/body-image-issues/|title=Body Image Issues: The Teen Male Edition [Infographic]|date=2016-04-26|publisher=Rawhide|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, pressures from social media doubles for adolescent girls between the ages of 13 to 18 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanavisions.com/news/world/86458-if-i-don-t-get-40-likes-on-my-selfies-my-self-esteem-plummets-the-truth-about-how-social-media-affects-teenage-girls-that-every-mother-needs-to-read-now%C2%A0.html|title='If I don't get 40 likes on my selfies my self esteem plummets': The truth about how social media affects teenage girls that EVERY mother needs to read now|publisher=Ghana Visions |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than half of have already reported the need to diet. The pressure on females "to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity" is therefore severe,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; with many others previously citing that "their lives would be better if they were not judged by their looks and body shape, [as] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/06/body-image-concerns-men-more-than-women|title=Body image concerns more men than women, research finds|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=2012-01-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the need to be thin and young, there is also a weight prejudice within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triplett|first= L|date= May 23, 2007|title= The Blame Game: A first glimpse at the socially acceptable causes of female fatness|postscript=.

Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. Actress/comedian [[Amy Schumer]] spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in [[Glamour Magazine]] as a "Plus Size Woman".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/entertainment/amy-schumer-glamour-body-shaming-feat/index.html|title=Amy Schumer to Glamour: I'm not plus-size|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the magazines publication, Schumer posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying, "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, D., Slade, P., &amp; Riley, V. (1991). Sex differences in body image perceptions. 	Perceptual and Motor Skills, 72(1), 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; unattainable. "Idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable 'aesthetic perfection' that has no basis in biological reality" Paraskeva et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paraskeva|first=Nicole|date=|title=Consumer opinion on social policy approaches to promoting positive body image: Airbrushed media images and disclaimer labels|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=22|pages=164–175|via=sage Journals|doi=10.1177/1359105315597052|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized.&lt;ref name="tamiu" /&gt; It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.

Women are constantly exposed to the retouched bodies of celebrities, which reflect society's ideal thin body in the media. This leads to the women developing poor self-images. Women begin to see the thin ideal body, which they see constantly in the media, as the perfect body that they should aim to achieve.&lt;ref name="GrabeWard2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Shelly|last2=Ward|first2=L.

=== Men ===
Males also face similar burdens in regards to attractiveness, whereby the media's depiction of the ideal muscular physique has caused numerous body dissatisfaction issues among young men. Teenage boys in particular, are now three times more likely to suffer from [[Body dysmorphic disorder|Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)]], with numbers reaching 45% since 1991.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The main causes of male body issues include 25% being teased about their weight,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; A factor that affects male body image on social media sites is "celebrity involvement". Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image.&lt;ref name="HoLee2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Shirley S.|last2=Lee|first2=Edmund W.

Men may also suffer from the mental disorder bigorexia, also known as [[muscle dysmorphia]]. Sufferers of bigorexia tend to constantly chase their ideal muscular body. However, many sufferers never attain this ideal body due to never being fully satisfied with their physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women face expectations to be increasingly thin, endorsements featuring the muscular ideal therefore causes numerous problems for men. Granting both genders may share the idealised image of narrow waists and hips, other characteristics specific to the mesomorphic and muscular V-shaped body, include broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned six-pack abs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The importance men placed on muscle and weight may be traced back to the release of G.I. Joe. The "bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls."&lt;ref name="Adams2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/body-image-boys_n_5637975.html|title=It's Not Just Girls. Boys Struggle With Body Image, Too.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-09-17|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are thus exposed to extensive imaging of men with bulging muscles, who often act as warriors or fighters, solving problems with their fists. By watching their heroes fight and punch, boys learn that aggression is essential and that they should strive to have huge muscles too. If these role models were smiling, less hyper-masculinized, or less aggressive, boys would not learn from such a young age that hyper-masculinity is the only successful way to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Adams2014" /&gt; A new term named 'Fitspiration' has even come into play over recent years. 'Fitspiration,' a term that combines "fitness" and "inspiration", is an online trend designed to inspire viewers towards a healthier lifestyle by promoting exercise and healthy food'.&lt;ref name="TiggemannZaccardo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiggemann|first1=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|title="Exercise to be fit, not skinny": The effect of fitspiration imagery on women's body image|journal=Body Image|volume=15|year=2015|pages=61–67|issn=1740-1445|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular slogan of 'Fitspiration' photos is "Strong is the New Skinny", an expression that encourages people to not be afraid of getting strong and working out.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title='Strong is the new skinny': A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|page=135910531663943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of a desire to achieve a good body and healthy lifestyle has increased in the last decade due to fitness accounts of Facebook and [[Instagram]]. Although 'Fitspiration' accounts and pictures have the intention of motivating people to pursue healthy lifestyles, they oftentimes contain objectifying elements or only show a certain body type, which can negatively affect many women's body images. For instance, 'Fitspiration' images tend to focus on specific poses or features of a woman such as washboard abs, which in turn objectifies the person.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"/&gt;

Regardless of the lower number of products targeting males, negative messages can be communicated through fitness websites, video games, pop culture, movies, and other types of media as well. Based on a report by the Picture of Health, 53% of boys cited advertisements as a "major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive".&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/News/Ads_add_to_boys_bodyimage_pressure/37212|title=Ads add to boys' body-image pressure |publisher=WARC |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% cited it was healthy.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

With rising pressures to achieve a muscular physique, many teenage boys thus participate in extreme workouts and weight trainings for long periods of the day. Some eventually abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, 1 out of 4 men suffer from eating disorders,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 31% have admitted to [[Purging disorder|purging]] or [[binge eating]] in the past.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== The fashion industry ==
The [[fashion industry]] is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41174739|title=Dior and Gucci ban super-skinny models|date=2017-09-06|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fashion, it often seems as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% "felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny",&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teens, Social Media And Body Image|last=Gallivan|first=H|publisher=Park Nicollet Melrose Cente|year=2014|isbn=|location=MN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; while 46% will strive to achieve it.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing "the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued".&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/anorexia/underweight-models-french-fashion-brands|title=French Fashion Brands Are Refusing to Hire Models Under Size 2. Here's Why That's So Important|publisher=Health.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.

The severity of this matter continues to rise as fashion magazines directed at females, subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and are heavily relied on by teenagers for beauty and fashion advice. [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'' magazine]] in particular recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances, leading to 69% of girls stating it influenced their ideal body shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/articles/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/|title=Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising |publisher=HealthyPlace|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infographiclist.com/2012/05/18/body-culture-how-media-shapes-our-thoughts-and-ideas-about-beauty-eating-and-image-infographic/|title=Body Culture: How Media Shapes Our Thoughts and Ideas About Beauty, Eating and Image [INFOGRAPHIC]|date=2012-05-18|publisher=Infographic List|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high number of publications featuring articles promoting unhealthy weight loss, the ''U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' reported an astounding 90% of teenage girls voiced the need to change their appearances,&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title=What is Body Image?|publisher=National Eating Disorders Association|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 81% of 10 year olds were already afraid of being fat.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; As a result, many argue that fashion and media's powerful role on body image and self-perception, will spiral into eating disorders, According to a survey by the ''[[Manchester Metropolitan University]]'', "self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it"&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;'''.'''

According to ''Dove's Global Beauty And Confidence'' report, "a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including 'real' women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, "body [[fascism]] is [still] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer's self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.

Less is usually known about the pressures models in the industry face, but striving hard to meet the requirements of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.northeastern.edu/2017/02/fashion-week-brings-questions-about-body-image-front-and-center/|title=Fashion Week brings questions about body image front and center|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Another 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) level. A study published in the [[International Journal of Eating Disorders]], discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; which qualifies for anorexia.

In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was ecorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; [[Luisel Ramos]], and [[Ana Carolina Reston]]. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, a high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, [[Fasting|fasts]], and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
{{See|Body image law}}

With the aim of protecting models and projecting a healthier body image, [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], and [[Israel]], passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer Rayne|date=2013-05-22|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models,&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; and the need for a medical certificate to verify their health.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/07/france-laws-thin-models-retouched-photographs|title=Digital fakery? My dear, that is just so last year |last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=2017-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; ''[[Kering]]'' and ''[[LVMH]]'', recently "announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This Isn't the Answer to Fashion's Body-Image Issues|publisher=Racked|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to "send the message that super slim body types is the 'ideal'".&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lvmh-kering-pledge_uk_59b0f9d7e4b0354e440f56c9|title=Will French Fashion Brands' Ban On Size Zero And Underage Models Really Make A Difference?|date=2017-09-07|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributable to the level of interest in women who do not match the proportions of average models, [[plus-size model]]s are slowly emerging in the mainstream media. With several utilising their positions to promote body positivity, their continued presence in the industry, undoubtedly reign beneficial to the health of other models and customers. Health reporter Philippa of&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29569473|title=Does social media impact on body image?|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|date=2014-10-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[BBC News]] discusses how the introduction of more diversity upon body images can be a helpful factor into improving self-confidence for all body types. Prominent names include [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]]; who is the face of popular plus-size retailer ''[[Lane Bryant]]'', and [[Iskra Lawrence]]; who is a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer ''[[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]''. Fashion magazines are beginning to include plus-size models as well, with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' gaining worldwide attention when it showcased the first plus-size model on the cover of its [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|swimsuit issue]].&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Real Women Have Curves |last=Bazilian |first=Emma |magazine=[[Adweek]] |date=April 25, 2016 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA451229452&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=d7d9761b9b364c6d5dbff6ac2a615991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=Article says attention was national not worldwide}}

Fashion designers are also strong supporters for embracing diversity and healthy body ideals in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week-ashley-graham-candice-huffine-kelly-slater-itsnotok-teatum-jones-disabled-body|title=News Bites {{!}} NYFW Gets Real About Plus-Size, Kelly Slater Says #itsnotok and More...|date=2017-02-16|publisher=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Christian Siriano]]'' specifically, shocked the fashion world by casting five plus-size models for his [[New York Fashion Week]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onbreaking.com/entertainment/interview-with-christian-siriano-about-his-runway-show-with-plus-size-models/2752/|title=Christian Siriano talk about Plus Size Models|date=2016-09-14|publisher=On Breaking|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the box-office success of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', Siriano also made global headlines after he designed a gown for actress [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], because no one else would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/style/christian-siriano-confirms-that-leslie-jones-is-a-pretty-woman-at-the-ghostbusters-premiere/|title=Christian Siriano Confirms that Leslie Jones Is a Pretty Woman at the Ghostbusters Premiere|date=2016-07-10|work=People |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high number of plus-size models dominated the runways this year, print advertisements saw a decrease, with only 2.2% casted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/762095-diversity-report-fall-2017-ad-campaigns/|title=Diversity Report: The Fall 2017 Ads Were More Inclusive Than the Runways for the First Time Ever|date=2017-08-29|publisher=theFashionSpot|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models who publicly advocate their opinions of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used ''Instagram'' as a tool to "encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the ''#DearNYFW'' campaign, which targeted the fashion industry's harmful approach towards their bodies.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/started-breaking-ribs-fashion-week-models-hit-back-against-pressure/|title='I started breaking my ribs': Fashion week models hit back against the pressure to lose weight|last=Rahim|first=Lucy|date=2017-06-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start "prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway".&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer [[Tarik Carroll]] released a photo series titled the ''EveryMAN Project''. The project showcased large-framed [[queer]] and [[transgender men]] of color, with the purpose of "challenging [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] and [[gender norms]], while bringing body-positivity to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fashion-photographer-promotes-acceptance-everyman-n783881|title=Fashion photographer promotes acceptance of "EveryMAN"|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthmore, Caroll aims to enlighten society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.

The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry on the other hand, has given rise to the ''#PlusIsEqual'' movement. There was often a misconception by retailers that full-figured women{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} were not interested in purchasing trendy styles. However, high-street brands such as [[Forever 21]], and [[ASOS.com|ASOS]], have increased product offerings to include plus-size options for their customers.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/marketing/loud-proud-social-media-pushed-retail-body-positive/|title='Loud and proud': How social media pushed retail to be more body-positive - Digiday|date=2016-02-25|publisher=[[Digiday]]|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other brands include, ''[[Victoria Beckham]]'' who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL in the upcoming months,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/the-beauty-curve-here-s-how-the-fashion-industry-embraced-plus-sizes/story-A3zwYFeeZIMAsTs1vQWEpK.html|title=The beauty curve: Here's how the fashion industry is embracing plus sized clothes|date=2017-07-12|work=Hindustan Times |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'' who expanded their plus size collection to cater for sizes 1X to 3X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nike-plus-size-range-xl-xxxl-body-positive-sportswear-clothing-a7609341.html|title=Nike has finally launched its first plus size range|date=2017-03-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the criticisms surrounding the term plus-size causing unnecessary labeling, ''[[Kmart]]'' therefore replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, "lovely" and "fabulous" instead.&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/lifestyle/article/nosizefitsall-the-rise-of-body-positive-fashion.html|title=#NoSizeFitsAll: The rise of body-positive fashion|publisher=Cafe Babel|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesting against photo retouching is another important aspect towards body positivity, with the most famous example being Aerie's ''ArieReal'' campaign. Since 2014, the movement promised to display "campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Other brands such as ''Neon Moon'', which is a feminist lingerie brand from London, deeply believes in embracing and advocating the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch their models for aesthetic purposes. Hence, campaigns often feature a range of "diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool".&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll" /&gt; U.S. e-tailer ''[[ModCloth]]'' on the other hand, explored other methods including, employing their staff as models for the swimwear collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/style/modcloth-proves-we-all-have-swimsuit-bodies-new-body-positive-t90081|title='We all have swimsuit bodies': See Modcloth's empowering new campaign|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=Today |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==
In the past, exposure to photos or articles were primarily found in traditional media; however, the accessibility of the internet today has resulted in an infinite array online. The world we inhabit is transpiring into a saturated place driven by imageries, which "force [narrower] standards of beauty than ever before".&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://verilymag.com/2017/03/body-image-beauty-standards-media|title=Here's How Body Image Issues Can Affect You (Even if You Don't Have an Eating Disorder)|publisher=Verily|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest influence the internet has on body image, is the creation of [[social media]]. Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others; "sending messages about what we could, should, or would be if we only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, "the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment."&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2017-Media-Releases/The-beauty-myth-puts-big-users-of-social-at-risk-of-low-self-esteem-media/|title=The beauty myth puts big users of social media at risk of low self-esteem |publisher=University of South Austalia |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore, also "encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals ..., [which] can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In 2016, psychologists confirmed the relationship between social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged the effect of the "social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image";&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/107683/female-body-image-statistics-2016|title=This Is How Women Actually Feel About Their Bodies|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another study by the ''[[University of South Australia]]'', discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Applications such as ''Instagram'' have become a "body-image battleground",&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; while the "selfie" is now the universal lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; ''Facebook'' and ''[[Snapchat]]'' also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by ''[[Common Sense Media|Common Sense]]'' reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if it did not receive the amount of attention they hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image |author=Caroline Knorr |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos in order to meet the media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the ''[[Renfrew Center Foundation]]'', 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/friends-pictures-on-social-media-biggest-impact-body-image|title=Friends' pictures on social media have biggest impact on body image|last=Ratcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=2017-03-05|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-11-01 |issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.

With the growth of the wellness industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of [[Fitness culture|fitness]] influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these [[bloggers]] and companies have received numerous criticism because the "drive for 'wellness' and 'clean eating' has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/|title=How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror|work=Time|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by "fitspiration" websites are sometimes identical to the "thinspiration" or pro-anorexia types.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/jm5nvp/ruby-tandoh-eat-clean-wellness|title=The Unhealthy Truth Behind 'Wellness' and 'Clean Eating'|date=2016-05-13|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident through "language inducing [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about weight or the body, and promoted dieting".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause "increasingly [[disordered eating]]",&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as [[Orthorexia nervosa|Orthorexia]]; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
As an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called ''Be Real,'' after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://academytoday.co.uk/Article/almost-a-third-of-11-16-year-olds-have-body-image-anxiety|title=Almost a third of 11-16 year-olds have body image anxiety|publisher=Academy Today|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual's body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial.

Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed as a tool to share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to speak out on issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular [[hashtag]]s and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.

In response to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as ''Instagram'', have banned the use of '''thinspiration''' and '''thinspo''' related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, and the promotion of hashtags such as ''#SelfLove'' and ''#BodyPositivity''&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.self.com/story/side-by-side-photos|title=20 Side-by-Side Photos That Show How Misleading Social Media Can Be|last=Lanquist|first=Lindsey|work=Self |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Transformation photos are side-by-side images displaying an individual's fitness or weight-loss progress. Although, it aims to "serve as inspiration for people looking to change themselves physically or live healthier lives",&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; some users have utilised this technique to showcase the level of deceptiveness within social media. Likewise, in an effort to actively help those suffering from eating disorders, ''[[Eating Disorder Hope]]'' launched the ''Pro-Recovery'' ''Movement''. The project involved hosting of live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/positive-uses-social-media-body-image-advocacy|title=Positive Uses of Social Media in Body Image Advocacy |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations such as [[Project HEAL|ProjectHEAL]], introduced a campaign called ''#WhatMakesMeBeautiful'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clementine-desseaux/what-makes-me-beautiful-heal-project_b_9287398.html|title=#WhatMakesMeBeautiful Campaign With Heal Project|date=2016-02-22|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of celebrating different talents, personalities, and other non-appearance related attributes that also make one beautiful.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; This movement was especially successful among the eating disorder community; hence, emphasising the "need for social media movements that celebrate self-love and looking at beauty through a different lens".&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;
[[Celebrity culture]] is known as one of the main influences on body image for this generation. Studies in this area have been carried out with the majority proving that viewing media images affects participants abilities to correctly estimate the size and parts of their own bodies. We are subjected to [[PhotoShop|photoshop]] so often when they were shown a range of photos of famous celebrities the women with body dissatisfaction consistently choose the photos of the celebrity being photoshopped to look skinnier than the original.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="KingTouyz2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Natalie|last2=Touyz|first2=Stephen|last3=Charles|first3=Margaret|title=The effect of body dissatisfaction on women's perceptions of female celebrities|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=27|issue=3|year=2000|pages=341–347|issn=0276-3478|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(200004)27:3&lt;341::AID-EAT12&gt;3.0.CO;2-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==

Body image is often measured by asking the subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction in girls can have many negative effects, including an increased rate of [[smoking]] and a decrease in comfort with [[sexuality]] when they're older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.{{efn|An increase in women's weight dissatisfaction is found when women see idealized images of women viewed as passive sexual objects or angelic sexual subjects.{{cite journal|last1=Halliwell|first1=Emma|last2=Malson|first2=Helen|last3=Tischner|first3=Irmgard|title=Are Contemporary Media Images Which Seem to Display Women as Sexually Empowered Actually Harmful to Women?|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=35|issue=1|year=2011|pages=38–45|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1177/0361684310385217}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Healthy body image: tips for guiding girls.|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/healthy-body-image/art-20044668|publisher=MayoClinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monteath and McCabe found that 44% of women express negative feelings about both individual body parts and their bodies as a whole.&lt;ref name="MonteathMcCabe1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monteath|first1=Sheryl A.|last2=McCabe|first2=Marita P.|title=The Influence of Societal Factors on Female Body Image|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=137|issue=6|year=1997|pages=708–727|issn=0022-4545|doi=10.1080/00224549709595493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine, ''[[Psychology Today]]'' found that 56% of the women and about 40% of the men who responded to their survey in 1997 were dissatisfied with their overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-19970201-000023&amp;page=2 Psychology Today: Body Image Poll Results] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130104095000/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-19970201-000023&amp;page=2 |date=2013-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  American youth (37.7% of males and 51% of females) express dissatisfaction with their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al Sabbah|first1=Haleama|last2=Vereecken|first2=Carine A |last3=Elgar|first3= Frank J |last4=Nansel|first4= Tonja |last5=Aasvee|first5= Katrin |last6=Abdeen|first6=Ziad |last7=Ojala|first7= Kristiina |last8=Ahluwalia|first8=Namanjeet |last9= Maes|first9= Lea |displayauthors=3 |title=Body weight dissatisfaction and communication with parents among adolescents in 24 countries: international cross-sectional survey|journal=BMC Public Health|date=January 1, 2009|volume=9|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-9-52 |pmid=19200369 |pmc=2645388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a [[Dieting|diet]] or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become a very common thing to not only teenage girls but even younger children as well. The [[National Eating Disorders Association]] has found out that 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls actually feel better about themselves when they are on a diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nault|first=Kelly|title=How the Media Affects Teen Girls|url=http://www.insteadoftv.com/how-the-media-affects-teen-girls.html|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently more than 40 "instruments" used to measure body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=J. K.|last2=Altabe|first2=M.|last3=Johnson|first3=S.|last4=Stormer|first4=S.

Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it makes it difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, [[ethnicity]], culture, and age.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullari|first=S.,|author2=Vosburgh, M.|author3=Shotwell, A.|author4=Inzodda, J.|author5=Davenport, W.|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided measurement technique.|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2002|issue=4(2)|pages=221–232|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2002-17480-006&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figure preferences ===

In figure preferences the use of silhouettes is the most commonly used method. [[Silhouette]]s can be defined by a figures shape or dark outline upon a lighter background. There are many issues with this method though; for one, the drawings are not realistic looking and were originally portrayed as adults so it made them unsuitable for children.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"/&gt; Silhouettes are used to show to the subject and have them react to the different body types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=1d539162-5f98-4f55-bcb2-3670ba57a382@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided meas...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Photoshop to fit their personal preference upon their body image, altering body tones, shape or size.

=== Video projection techniques ===

In one study participants were shown a series of images flashing before them; each image was a picture of them but either increased weight or decreased weight. They were measured in self-report by responding to the pictures. Also they were measured by startle-based measures and testing their eyeblink response. "The startle response is a complex set of physiological changes that occur in response to unexpected and intense stimulus."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grillon|first=Christian|last2=Baas|first2=Johanna|date=2003-09-01|title=A review of the modulation of the startle reflex by affective states and its application in psychiatry|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=114|issue=9|pages=1557–1579|issn=1388-2457|pmid=12948786|doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(03)00202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements can be useful because "Objective, [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] measures, like the affect modulated startle eyeblink response, are less subject to reporting bias."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spresser|first=C.

=== Questionnaires ===

Questionnaires are another very commonly used method of measurement. One example of a questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, [[muscle tone]], height, and weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giovannelli|first=Thorayya Said|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Henson|first3=James M.|last4=Engle|first4=Erin K.|date=2008-06-01|title=The measurement of body-image dissatisfaction-satisfaction: is rating importance important?|journal=Body Image|volume=5|issue=2|pages=216–223|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2008.01.001|issn=1873-6807|pmid=18463010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires can have confounding variable though.

== Gender differences ==

Gender differences related to body image are increasingly prevalent between men and women. Although dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body image perceptions: Do gender differences exist? | journal = Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research | year = 2010 | first = Maggie A. | last = Brennan |author2=Christopher E.

[[Adolescence]] is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why they are becoming less sensitized to the effects.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellor|first=David|author2=Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz|author3=Marita P.

Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of [[Human Physiology|human physiology]]. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced as far back as the Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sideris |first=A.|url=https://www.academia.edu/481380/The_Athletic_Body_Image_and_Power=|title=The Athletic Body: Image and Power|journal=Imeros|volume=5|issue=1|year= 2005|pages= 287–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men with lower, more feminine, [[Waist–hip ratio]] (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pazhoohi| first1=Farid| last2=Hosseinchari|first2=M.|last3=Doyle|first3=J.

In general, research shows that body image in regards to appearance becomes less of a [[Psychological stress|stress]] for women as they age. Studies show a decline in dissatisfaction of body image in college-aged women as they progress from the first semester of college to subsequent semesters. Their appearance rating of themselves tends to increase, while males' do not significantly change and often become worse. This suggests that the early years of [[college]] serve as a period for body image development, which can later affect the mental and physical well being of an individual.&lt;ref name='PsycInfo 2011-30272-014'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gender and racial/ethnic differences in body image development among college students | journal = Body Image | date = January 2012 | first = Meghan M. | last = Gillen |author2=Eva S.

As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning.  Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2011-30272-014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esnaola 21–9"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body dissatisfaction and perceived sociocultural pressures | journal = Salud Mental | date = February 21, 2010 | first = Igor | last = Esnaola |author2=Arantzazu Rodríguez|author3=Alfredo Goñi | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9| id =  | type =  PDF | accessdate = 2012-06-26 |url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/sm/v33n1/v33n1a3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical appearance remains important later in life, but the functional aspects of the body take precedence over contentment with appearance.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"/&gt; Women are reported to benefit from the [[Ageing|ageing process]], becoming more satisfied with their images, while men begin to develop more insecurities and issues.  Women reach a certain stage where they are no longer subject to the social pressures that heavily emphasize the importance of appearance.  Men from the same studies are reported as becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their physical appearance as they age. Men are also less likely to implement appearance-enhancing activities into their daily lives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The older women become the more satisfied with their body image they are likely to become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2009-11492-005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Lucie|author2=Eyal Gringart|date=August 2009|title=Body image and self-esteem in older adulthood|journal=Ageing &amp; Society|type=PDF|volume=29|issue=6|pages=977–95|doi=10.1017/S0144686X09008721|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-27 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older men become, the more dissatisfied they are likely to become due to increased physical and perceived incompetency.  Since there are significant differences between men and women of all ages, gender serves as a better predictor of body dissatisfaction and sociocultural perceived influences than age.&lt;ref name="Esnaola 21–9"/&gt;

Adrienne Adams and Eaaron Henderson-king claim that the rates of cosmetic surgery have increased in recent years. It has been proven that the majority of people that undergo cosmetic surgery is a highly gendered activity. However, rates are increasing for men. it is predominantly women who spend more time attending to their to their bodies. Cosmetic surgery was initially developed largely in response to the reconstructive needs of wounded soldiers, but it is now primarily used in a much more feminine way to improve people's physical appearance and attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance messages AND Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weight ==

{{See also|Fat acceptance movement}}The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, with more women than men wanting to lose weight. Kashubeck-West ''et al.'' reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashubeck-West S, Mintz LB, Weigold I |title=Separating the Effects of Gender and Weight-Loss Desire on Body Satisfaction and Disordered Eating Behavior |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=7–8, |pages=505–518 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7138-4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y07h74u11ug0x245/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] reported that "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991 /&gt; Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As [[Charisse Goodman]] put it in her article, "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets", advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: "Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and 'attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.

Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model. Ads featuring a larger sized model resulted in less pressure to be thin. People also felt their actual body size was larger after viewing a slim model as compared to a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Martin Brett A.

Many, like journalist [[Marisa Meltzer]], have argued this contemporary standard of beauty to be described as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: "Never before has the 'perfect' body been at such odds with our true size."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wolf|first=Naomi |authorlink=Naomi Wolf|title=The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty are Used Against Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgfokiNQl0sC|year=1991|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-986190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Marisa.

However, these figures do not distinguish between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.

Research by [[The Lancet Psychiatry|The Lancent Psychiatry]] discusses the relationship between mass media and eating disorders stating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Emilio|last2=Carrera|first2=Olaia|date=February 2016|title=Anorexia nervosa and body-image disturbance|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00581-7/fulltext|journal=The Lancet Psychiatry|language=English|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e9–e10|doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00581-7|issn=2215-0366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Body-image disturbance and weight and shape concerns are the result of an acculturation process spread through the therapeutic milieu and the mass media." The struggles caused by body imaging have led to the increase of Anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that results in significant weight loss due to a persons own distorted body image. Its increasing rate shows the correlation between the effects body imaging through social media has on people especially upon women and how it effects the measures of weight loss.

Post-1997 studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Obesity Statistics: U.S. Obesity Trends|url = http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|publisher = North American Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate = 2008-03-08|year = 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060206185213/http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|archivedate = 2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the ''[[Psychology Today]]'' study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their body but are not.

In turn, although social pressure to lose weight has adverse effects on some individuals who do not need to lose weight, those adverse effects are arguably outweighed by that social pressure's ''positive'' effect on the overall population, without which the recent increases in obesity and associated health and social problems (described in both popular and academic parlance as an "[[obesity epidemic]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics Related to Overweight and Obesity|url = http://www.win.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|year = 2006|accessdate = 2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mxm007v1|title = The obesity epidemic in the United States—gender, age, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic characteristics: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis|last1 = Wang|first1 = Youfa|last2 = Beydoun|first2 = May A|journal = Epidemiologic Reviews|year = 2007 |doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm007|pmid = 17510091|volume = 29|pages = 6–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be even more severe than they already are.&lt;ref name="ThompsonHeinberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

[[Miss Representation]]&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis. (January 1, 2014). Retrieved May 5, 2014, from http://film.missrepresentation.org/synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]], exploring and displaying the role that mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting the lives of people from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.

The 2007 documentary [[America the Beautiful (film)|America the Beautiful]] explores how the fashion and beauty industries are contributing to the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses a wide range of topics like [[plastic surgery]], dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young [[Middle school|middle-school]] aged girls were portrayed in the beginning of the film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/america-the-beautiful-a-problem-of-self-image/82590/|title='America the Beautiful': A Problem of Self-Image|last=Snyder|first=S.

In a study performed by Leslie J. Heinberg of [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], and J. Kevin Thompson of the [[University of South Florida]], results showed that women exposed to appearance based advertisements experienced a significant growth in [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, [[anger]], and body dissatisfaction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In a study done at [[Old Dominion University]], Thomas F. Cash, [[Julie Ancis|Julie R. Ancis]] and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and their attitudes toward gender, feminist identity and body image. "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image [[dysphoria]] in women's daily lives."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Ancis | first2 = J. R. | year = 1997 | title = Gender attitudes, feminist identity, and body image among college women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 36 | issue = 7/8| pages = 433–447 | doi=10.1007/bf02766682}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contributing factor in this scenario that leads women to greater objectification of their bodies are the images that are seen throughout media. Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to [[body dysmorphic disorder]], body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.

In the same study from [[Arizona State University]], it was said that the idea of beauty is generated from these media messages. "Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women."&lt;ref name="Rubin, L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = L | year = 2004 | title = Exploring Feminist Women's Body Consciousness | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study from Old Dominion University, the authors state the importance of research in this area. "Given the centrality of body image in clinical and sub clinical eating disturbances that are so prevalent among women, research on gender and body image has substantial importance."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; Even though there is research being done, there is still much more work to be done to help individuals who struggle with their body image.

The link between body image and eating disorders is becoming increasingly prominent in the younger generations as the growth of social media and social influencers inhibits their perspective on their own bodies.&lt;ref name="NaeimiHaghighian2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeimi|first1=Alireza Farsad|last2=Haghighian|first2=Hossein Khadem|last3=Gargari|first3=Bahram Pourghassem |last4=Alizadeh|first4=Mohammad|last5=Rouzitalab|first5=Tohid|title=Eating disorders risk and its relation to self-esteem and body image in Iranian university students of medical sciences|journal=Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity|volume=21|issue=4|year=2016|pages=597–605|issn=1124-4909|doi=10.1007/s40519-016-0283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat unhealthy body image issues among women, in 2015, [[France]] passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows. It also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Willsher (December 18, 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/models-doctors-note-prove-not-too-thin-france Models in France must provide doctor's note to work], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight- The Psychosocial burden of childhood overweight and Obesity:
Children also have a hard time dealing with 'body image' and can face discrimination. According to (''[[European Journal of Pediatrics]]'' 2017 ) 
According to research, It has shown that the psychological, social and behavioral consequences of childhood obesity shows that children who are overweight experience not only discrimination but overall body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, [[social isolation]] and depression.

== Race ==
Perceptions of races have drastically changed over the years dating all the way back to the [[medieval era]] referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which left ideas of idealism for [[White people|Caucasians]] and a negative idea of any other race. [[White nationalism|Caucasian nationalists]] such as Goldstein also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/graywhite1e/#t_823553____|title=Freedom on my mind: A history of African Americans|last=Bay|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins |year=2013|last1=|first1=Mia|accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old ways of thinking about human bodies and [[African people|African]] difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camp|first1=Stephanie|title=Black Is Beautiful: An American History|journal=Journal of Southern History|date=April 2015|volume=3|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the [[Black is Beautiful]] movement and [[Black Power]] movement took form and shook the world in a display of racial pride. Today's perceptions of different races has come a long way in bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.

The [[fashion industry]] is known for not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several studies that have been conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214658/http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-12-10|title = The Beauty Ideal: The Effects of European Standards of Beauty on Black Women|last = Bryant|first = Susan L|date = n.d.|journal = Columbia Social Work Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive [[white people|white]], [[black people|black]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/racialminorities-SAI-2003.pdf|title = Do Racial Minorities Respond in the Same Way to Mainstream Beauty Standards?

[[Weight loss]] is one such method. For instance, [[Mexican American]] women who have been attuned to mainstream US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the [[White normalcy|white norm]]. In spite of the fact that certain ethnicities naturally have different body types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/race-is-part-of-the-body-image-conversation-so-why-dont-we-talk-about-it-8600605.htm|title = Race is part of the body image conversation, so why don't we talk about it?|date = May 2, 2013|accessdate = October 25, 2015|newspaper=The Independent |last = Devon|first = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; this ideal has led to disordered eating amongst [[Latino|Latinas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Beauty Whitewashed: How White Ideals Exclude Women of Color |url = http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|publisher = Beauty Redefined |accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-US|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110306151312/http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|archivedate = 2011-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastic surgery]] is another method, and is especially popular in Asia for "[[Westernization|Westernizing]]" facial features. Two of the most popular treatments are [[rhinoplasty]] (nose lifts), and [[blepharoplasty]] (eyelid lifts), which are done to make these features look more Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia's ideal beauty: Looking Caucasian - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/25/health/asian-beauty/index.html|publisher = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skin-lightening|Skin lightening]] products are also prevalent in countries where non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In [[Racism in India|India]] alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lightening trend in Asia boosts global market|url = http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/market-trends/skin-lightening-trend-in-asia-boosts-global-market|publisher = CosmeticsDesign-Asia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plenty of these whitening cosmetics are known to have dangerous side effects due to the ingredients in them; [[hydroquinone]], for instance, is known to cause irritation and [[leukemia]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is known to cause [[rash]]es and pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bob Fredericks |title=Health officials warn of mercury levels in skin-lightening creams |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/06/health-officials-warn-of-mercury-levels-in-skin-lightening-creams/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these effects, industries like the fashion industry have not significantly featured women of color (and when they have, the women may have either been significantly "whitewashed" – with digitally lightened skin and hair – or may already have features that are considered "white").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fashion industry believes that by advertising unattainable standards of beauty, they fuel a customer demand by "creating a craving that can't be satisfied".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can using different types of models benefit brands?|url = http://www.ellecanada.com/living/culture/can-using-different-types-of-models-benefit-brands/a/58327 |publisher = Elle Canada|accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by [[Elle Canada]] has proven the exact opposite: products featured by models that accurately represent the consumer's race – as well as weight and age – will increase the consumer's willingness to purchase a product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1694">A '''design competition''' is a [[competition]] in which an entity solicits design proposals from the public for a specified purpose.

==Architecture==
An [[architectural design competition]] solicits architects to submit design proposals for a building, bridge, or other structure. Such competitions may be ''open'', receiving bids internationally, domestically, or regionally. The competition may occur in a single stage, or involve two stages, the first of which eliminates non-viable candidates.

Famous early examples of design competitions were for the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in 448 BCE, and the dome of the [[Florence Cathedral]] in 1418.

==Coins and stamps==
Coin and stamp design contests solicit designs to appear on the face of stamps and usually the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of coins. In 1998, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] held the Millennium Coin Design Contest, a competition for the design of 24 [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarters]], one for each month of 1999 and 2000.&lt;!-- was this a project of the Millennium Bureau of Canada ? --&gt;

==Monuments and sculptures==
The design of artistic objects and monuments is a common subject in design competitions. A well-known example is the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]] designed by [[Maya Lin]].

==Urban space==
Urban and landscape projects may solicit design proposals in a competition. Among them are projects for urban parks, streetscapes, and rehabilitation of natural areas.

==Student design competition==
A [[student design competition]] is a [[student competition]] to introduce students to real-world engineering practices and design.

'''Elisabeth Camp''' is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Elisabeth Camp: January 2014|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/elisabethcampjanuary2012|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp's work has focused on forms of thought and speech that do not fit standard propositional models.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She has written extensively about figurative speech such as sarcasm and metaphor, arguing that these forms of speech force listeners to reconsider their standard methods of delineating the difference between what is meant and what is said.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbio&gt;{{cite web|last=Camp|first=Elisabeth|title=Elisabeth Camp|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/~emc233/index.html|publisher=Rutgers University|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
As an undergraduate, Camp attended the [[University of Michigan]], graduating in 1993 and double majoring in philosophy and English.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt; After graduating, Camp worked as an educational organizer in Chicago, creating and putting into practice programs designed to help residents of public housing study for their [[GED]]'s and programs to provide instruction in [[English as a second language]] to members of Chicago's Latino community.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;  Camp eventually decided to return to school, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;  As a graduate student, her advisors were [[John Searle]], [[Richard Wollheim]], and John MacFarlane.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;

After receiving her doctorate, Camp spent several years at [[Harvard University]] as part of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]], before moving to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 2006 where she served as an Associate Professor of Philosophy until 2013.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=leiter/&gt; In 2013, Camp accepted a tenured offer from [[Rutgers University]] where she is currently an Associate Professor of Philosophy (and where she is additionally affiliated with the [[Center for Cognitive Studies|Center for Cognitive Science]].)&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=leiter&gt;{{cite web|last=Leiter|first=Brian|title=Camp from Penn to Rutgers|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/camp-from-penn-to-rutgers.html|work=Leiter Report|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brian Leiter]] viewed Camp's move to Rutgers as cementing the reputation of Rutgers' philosophy department as a leader in the fields of [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref name=leiter/&gt;

Besides her academic appointments, Camp is also active in efforts to encourage the participation of women in academic philosophy.  Along with Elizabeth Harman and Jill North, Camp is one of the organizers behind a series of workshops aimed at providing mentorship to women in graduate philosophy programs; the first workshop is currently intended to be held at [[Princeton University]] in August 2014.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

==Research areas==
Much of Camp's research has focused on forms of thought and speech that do not fit neatly in to standard propositional models.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  An especial focus of her research has been figurative speech such as sarcasm and metaphor, although she has also worked significantly in other areas, including the effects that loaded language (such as [[racial slur|slurs]]) can have on conversational dynamics, and how conversations are effected when a speaker and a listener are uncertain about whether or not their interests agree.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; Camp has strongly defended the idea of the indispensability of metaphor.&lt;ref name=bja&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=James|title=The Dispensability of Metaphor|journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics|date=July 2010|volume=50|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also written on philosophical issues involving concepts as well as on animal cognition.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Kristin|title=Beyond Anthropomorphism: Attributing Psychological Properties to Animals (The Oxford Handbook of Animal Ethics)|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp has also made an effort to counter arguments used against the classical [[Paul Grice|Gricean]] [[implicature]] account of metaphor, making a number of arguments intended to show that [[contextualism|contextualist]] approaches to metaphor are flawed and that it is in fact possible for what is meant by a speaker to differ from what is literally said by a speaker, even in situations where the speaker appears to be quite candid in their speech.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=David|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Metaphor|year=2011|publisher=Stanford University|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphor/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Camp has published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals such as [[Noûs]], [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]],  [[Philosophical Studies]] and [[Philosophical Quarterly]].&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She has also contributed chapters to a number of books, including chapters in ''A Companion to Donald Davidson'' (part of the Blackwell Companions to Philosophy series,) and the forthcoming ''Concepts: New Directions''.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;

'''The [[flag]] and the [[coat of arms]] of Terengganu''' are [[federated state|state]] [[symbol]]s of [[Terengganu]], a [[States of Malaysia|state]] in [[Malaysia]]. Like the majority of state symbols for states with Malay royalties, the flag and the arms of Terengganu centre on [[Sultan of Terengganu|its royalty]], as well as [[Islam]], the state's traditional religion.

=== Design ===
[[File:Flag of Terengganu.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[File:FIAV 110000.svg|23px|State flag.]] The flag of Terengganu. Flag ratio: 1:2.]]

First revealed in 1953,&lt;ref name="star idris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/13/nation/15701374 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521135850/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/13/nation/15701374 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2011 |title=Idris: Terengganu needs vibrant flag |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; the present flag of Terengganu encompasses a black flag with a thick, white [[Flag terminology#Basic patterns in flags|border]] and a white [[star and crescent]] in the centre that points towards the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]].&lt;ref name="fotw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/my-teren.html |title=Trengganu (Malaysia)|accessdate=24 September 2008 |author=Various authors |date=7 June 2008 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of the crescent is five-sixths the width of the black panel, while the width of the star, which is tilting clockwise, is two-thirds that of the crescent.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

The white signifies the [[Sultan of Terengganu]], while the black signifies the state's citizens; with the white border surrounding the black panel, the layout represents the Sultan's duty to protect his subjects.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov flag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=871 |title=Bendera Negeri |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708115532/http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=871 |archivedate=8 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The star and crescent denote [[Islam]] as the official religion of the state.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov flag"/&gt;

In October 2006, then-[[List of Menteris Besar of Terengganu|''Menteri Besar'' of Terengganu]] [[Idris Jusoh]] voiced intentions by the state government to "[brighten] up" the flag and incorporate an emblem by first seeking opinions from professions, citing feedback of the flag being too "simple and dull".&lt;ref name="star idris"/&gt; As of 2008, there have been no reports of further action.

=== Variants ===

==== District flags ====
Terengganu has eight [[Daerah|administrative districts]] (''[[daerah]]''), each assigned their own district-level flags.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov districts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=872 |title=Bendera Daerah |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All eight of the flags consist of only a single coloured [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|field]] with the state flag on the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|canton]]; the only distinction is the colour of the field, which corresponds to respectable districts and represents their qualities:&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov districts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fotw district"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/my-ter-m.html |title=Municipal flags in Terengganu (Malaysia) |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author=Various authors |date=19 July 2008 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Royal Standards ====
Terengganu's royalty, mostly prominently the [[Sultan of Terengganu]], fly their own [[Royal Standard]]s.

[[File:Bendera Sultan Terengganu.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Royal Standard of the Sultan.]]

The Sultan's Royal Standard is known as ''Tanah Putih'' and consists of a white flag bearing a partial rendition of [[#Coat of arms|the state emblem]], as well as a wreath of [[rice]] stalks and a [[motto]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3334 |title=The Body Flag Of His Royal Highness The Sultan Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234551/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3334 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a plain white flag,&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; the additional emblem, which is coloured yellow, was added to identify the flag to Terengganu's royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_putih.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101010/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_putih.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the ''Pemaisuri''{{'}}s (Queen's) Royal Standard (which is given the name ''Tanah Kuning Tua'') is very similar to that of the Sultan's, but features a reversed arrangement of colours, with a white emblem against a yellow field.&lt;ref name="queen standard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3335 |title=The Body Flag Of Her Royal Highness The Queen Of Terengganu |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234705/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3335 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_tua.php |title=Laman Web Rasmi |publisher=Istana.terengganu.gov.my |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143709/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/tanah_tua.php |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Standard of the ''Yang Di-pertuan Muda'' (Crown Prince) bears a similar colour configuration as the Queen's, but features only the partial rendition of the state emblem, which is significantly larger than that of the Sultan's and the Queen's.

==== Obsolete flags ====
Prior to the adoption of the present flag, the state flag of Terengganu previously sported a significantly different design, although many of its elements would be carried over to its successor. The earliest known variant of the state flag was used between 1925 and 1933, and consisted of only a white-black flag divided vertically with the black stripe two times wider than the white stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

[[File:Flag of Terengganu (1912 - 1933).svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag used until 1933.]]

In 1933, a star and crescent that pointed upwards and featured rounder crescent was added on the black band, signifying Terengganu's recognition of Islam as the state's religion.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The flag remained in use until the introduction of the current flag.

[[File:Flag of Terengganu (1933 - 1947).svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag used until 1953.]]

Additionally, the state government of Terengganu formerly flew its own "Governmental Service Flag", which design originated in the same manner as the state flag. Bearing the same vertical white-black layout, a white [[saltire]] was also included on the black stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; Similarly, a star and crescent was also added in a later date, but was placed on the white stripe.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The flag was rendered obsolete following the adoption of the present state flag, which was also to be used by the state government.

==State Emblem==

=== Design ===
[[File:Coat of arms of Terengganu.svg|thumb|The state emblem of Terengganu.]]

Approved for official use by the State Ministers Committee in 1932, the state arms or emblem (Malay: ''Jata'') of Terengganu was designed by several state officials during the reign of [[Zainal Abidin III|Sultan Zainal Abidin III]] (1881–1918), and is thought to have been drawn by Mohamad bin Abdul Rahim, the relative of Dato' Nara Wangsa (Dato' Mata-Mata).&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=653 |title=Jata Kebesaran |language=Malay |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907064520/http://www.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/portal/cms/ikon/article.php?cid=1&amp;aid=653 |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms originally consisted of a white outlined oval that encompassed a series of symbols coloured in yellow and a [[Jawi script|Jawi]] [[motto]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt; During the rule of [[Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu|Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah]] (1945–1979), the emblem was modified with the addition of a dotted figure of a [[Seal (device)|seal]] around all of the symbols except the [[star and crescent]], which resides over the seal, the addition of a pair of maces and the shortening of the motto.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

Details of the emblem's components are as follows:&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

;Star and crescent
:The [[star and crescent]] reside atop the seal, pointing upwards. As a symbol of the [[Islam|Islamic faith]], they represent Terengganu as an Islamic state.

;Seal
:The seal consists of a near-oval, shield-like dotted outline that encompasses virtually all symbols in the emblem with the exception of the star and crescent, including:
:* A [[crown (heraldry)|crown]], located near the top, which represents the sovereignty of the [[Sultan of Terengganu]];
:* a [[sword]], a long ''[[kris]]'' and a pair of [[ceremonial mace]]s (The sword and ''kris'' crisscrosses each other to the top, while the maces crisscrosses each other lower down), which symbolise the royal paraphernalia of Terengganu;&lt;ref name="royal regalia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3326 |title=ROYAL PARAPHERNALIA |accessdate=24 September 2008 |author= |date= |publisher=Official Terengganu State Museum website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722234726/http://museum.terengganu.gov.my/maxc2020/agensi/article.php?cid=43&amp;aid=3326 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* two books, located on opposing sides of the seal below the upper half of a mace and the lower half of the sword or ''kris'', represent two important books in Terengganu: The Book of Law—placed on the left—denoting justice and the [[Qur'an]]—placed on the right—denoting the Law; and
:* a [[scarf]] (''wali'' or ''selampai''), which wraps around the sword or ''kris'' and over the maces, signify a portion of the state's cultural regalia.&lt;ref name="royal regalia"/&gt;

;Motto
The [[motto]], "Terengganu" written in [[Jawi script|Jawi]] (ترڠڬانو), is located below the seal. When introduced in 1932, the emblem's motto originally read "''Jawatan Kerajaan Terengganu''" (Terengganu Government Post) in Jawi.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt; During the rule of [[Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah]], "''Jawatan Kerajaan''" was omitted from the motto, resulting in its present form.&lt;ref name="terengganu.gov emblem"/&gt;

=== Royal Standard variants ===
The state emblem of Terengganu is included on the [[#Royal Standards|Royal Standards of Terengganu's royal family]], but differs slightly, as it is only duplicated partially, without the outlining oval border and seal, the "Terengganu" [[motto]] and the star and crescent. Two elements are added on the emblem in the case of the Royal Standards for the Sultan and the Queen: a [[wreath]] of [[rice]] stalks and a different motto depicted in the form of banner to be written in [[Jawi script|Jawi]].&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt; The motto corresponds to the individual the Standard is assigned to; as such, the motto for the Standard of the Sultan reads "''Sultan Terengganu''" while that of the Queen reads "''Pemaisuri Terengganu''".&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt; The emblem on the Royal Standard of the Crown Prince consists of only the partial replication of the state emblem.&lt;ref name="prince standard"/&gt;

As the Standard of the Sultan has a white field, the emblem retains its yellow colour.&lt;ref name="king standard"/&gt; However, as the Standard of the Queen and the Crown Prince bare yellow fields, their emblems are white.&lt;ref name="queen standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prince standard"/&gt;

In 1907, at age 23, Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz, entered the 'Berlin academy for the arts', [[Charlottenburg]]. His teachers were Max Schäfer, M. L. Körte, Hanke, [[Paul Friedrich Meyerheim]] and [[Carl Saltzmann]]. He also studied in Paris with [[Théophile Steinlen]].

===World War I===
In 1909, Schulz was appointed Second [[Lieutenant]] in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] reserve and was stationed with the 24th [[Infantry]] Regiment, in [[Neuruppin]].

'''''Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses soeurs''''' (''Gabrielle d'Estrées and one of her sisters'') is a painting by an unknown artist circa 1594. It now hangs at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]] in Paris and is usually thought to be the work of a painter from the [[Fontainebleau School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Gabrielle d'Estrées and one of her sisters |publisher=mheu |year=2009 |url=http://www.mheu.org/en/timeline/8/gabrielle-estrees.htm |accessdate=17 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219012427/http://www.mheu.org/en/timeline/8/gabrielle-estrees.htm |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epic_arts"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWEQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=Gabrielle+d%27Estr%C3%A9es+and+one+of+her+sisters&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwB2oVChMIzuSn576PxgIVw3-SCh14gwBL#v=onepage&amp;q=Gabrielle%20d'Estr%C3%A9es%20and%20one%20of%20her%20sisters&amp;f=false | title=Epic Arts in Renaissance France | publisher=OUP Oxford | author=Usher, Phillip John | year=2014 | pages=151 | isbn=9780199687848 | quote=In the School of Fontainebleau painting, ''Portrait présumé de Gabrielle d'Estrées et de sa sœur la duchesse de Villars''  (Presumed Portrait of Gabrielle d'Estrées and of her Sister the Duchess of Villars)…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting portrays [[Gabrielle d'Estrées]], mistress of King [[Henry IV of France]], sitting nude in a bath, holding a ring. Her sister sits nude beside her and pinches d'Estrées' right nipple.&lt;ref name=Hagen&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagen|first=Rose-Marie|title=What Great Paintings Say, Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=9783822813720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWe3lPyY_GIC|author2=Rainer Hagen|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Announcing Gabrielle's pregnancy===
The nipple-pinching gesture is often interpreted as a symbolic announcement that Gabrielle is pregnant with Henry's child, [[César de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme|César de Bourbon]]. According to the Louvre's website:  "The oddly affectionate way in which the sister is pinching Gabrielle d'Estrées' right breast has often been taken as symbolizing the latter's pregnancy with the illegitimate child of Henry IV. This interpretation would seem to be confirmed by the scene of the young woman sewing - perhaps preparing a [[layette]] for the coming child - in the background."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225164&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225164&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500815&amp;bmLocale=en# Official site of the Louvre Museum - Portrait présumé de Gabrielle d'Estrées et de sa soeur la duchesse de Villars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427202251/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225164&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225164&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500815&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring that Gabrielle holds is said to be Henry's coronation ring, which he supposedly gave to her as a token of his love shortly before she died.

===Erotic interpretations===
In the early years of the seventeenth century, [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme]] tells a story about a group of women who went to view the painting. He claims that the painting shows "fair naked ladies" together in a bath, and adds that they "touch, and feel, and handle, and stroke, one the other, and intertwine and fondle with each other." Brantôme reveals that while the group of women were viewing the painting, "one great lady" who was a part of the group "los[t] all restraint...before the picture, say[ing] to her lover, turning toward him [as if] maddened [by] the madness of love she beheld [in the painting]: 'Too long have we tarried here. Let us now straightway take [my] coach and go to my lodging; for...no more can I hold in the ardor that is in me. Needs must away and quench it; too sore do I burn.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.ok.ubc.ca/parthur/loughlin/Veaudry.doc# ''Selections from Pierre de Bourdeilles, Seigneur de Brantôme, Lives of Gallant Ladies: A Critical Introduction and Annotated Edition'', trans. by Jessica Veaudry.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the nineteenth century, ''Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses soeurs'' was hanging in the Prefecture of Police in Paris. Dr. Ver Heyden de Lacey states in an article from 1935 that "Nobody knew why or how it came there; [it was] placed above a door in one of the halls to which the public had access."&lt;ref&gt;"A Picture of Gabrielle d'Estrées attributed to François Pourbus le Jeune," ''Connoisseur'', Vol. 96 (1935): 137-8.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that one day, a "pusillanimous high official" noticed the painting and "conceived [of] the idea to screen the picture...from the curious public gaze, by drawing a green curtain in front of it." This action suggests that the official considered the painting to be erotic or even obscene, but instead of removing it, he had it veiled, and he thus visibly marked the image as an open secret, or as something which should not be seen. At some point after that, Dr. Ver Heyden de Lacey claims that "Somebody had the happy inspiration to expose [the veiled image] to the artistic and art-trained eyes of those called upon to take part in [a] civic function [at the police station]...In preparation [for this] special function...a thorough cleaning of the picture itself was ordered...[But] Upon drawing the curtain, [they found only] an empty picture frame."

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the ''Gabrielle d'Estrées'' painting is regularly understood to represent female homosexuality. There is an entry for it in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian Gay Histories and Cultures'' and it appears on websites about lesbian history like Sappho.com.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures'', eds. George Haggerty and Bonnie Zimmerman. NY: Garland. {{ISBN|9780815333548}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even outside of the [[LGBT]] community, the painting is frequently understood as a representation of lesbianism. In 1991, it appeared on the cover of the French magazine ''L’Événement du jeudi'' to illustrate a story on lesbian chic.&lt;ref&gt;''L’Événement du jeudi'' Number 361, 3–9 October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Green Party in Germany created a poster to announce their support of same-sex marriage and it featured two female actors reenacting the ''Gabrielle'' portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/skurrile-wahlwerbung-fotostrecke-107962-25.html |title=Skurrile Wahlwerbung: Sex, Lügen und Wahlplakate |trans-title=Absurd Political Advertising: Sex, Lies and Election Posters |date=15 January 2009 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=24 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias toward left-handedness===
This painting is peculiarly biased toward left-handedness. Gabrielle's sister is pinching her right nipple with her left hand, d'Estrées is holding the ring with her left hand, and the seamstress in the background is sewing with her left hand. Additionally, the painting hanging in the background is of the lower body of a naked person, but contrary to rumor, he is not holding his penis with his left hand; a piece of red fabric is draped over his genitals.

==In popular culture==

A sprightly British drama, ''[[Two Nudes Bathing]]'', speculates upon the origins of the anonymous painting.

An anachronistic visual reference to the painting appears in ''[[The Tudors]]'', Season 1, Episode 6 "True Love".

[[File:Hestia Giustiniani.jpg|thumb|left|Hestia Giustiniani]]
The '''Giustiniani Hestia''' is a finely-executed marble [[sculpture]], a perhaps [[Hadrian]]ic Roman copy of a Greek bronze of about 470 BCE, now in the [[Torlonia Collection]] (see [[Torlonia Museum]]), Rome, but named for its early owner, marchese [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]. It is the only known Early Classical bronze that was reproduced at full size in marble for a Roman collection: Roman taste ran more towards the [[Hellenistic]] baroque.

==Description==
[[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] cited the ''Hestia Giustiniani'' as an example of the austere early stage of [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Classical Greek sculpture]]. For female figures, early fifth-century sculptors mostly gave up the crinkly sleeved ''[[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]'', which had been popular in the later sixth century BCE, and returned to the sleeveless ''[[peplos]]'' with heavy, dominantly vertical folds not unlike the fluting of a column.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the contemporaneous ''[[Charioteer of Delphi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; With the body so shrouded the relaxation of pose has been limited to turning the head. Several Attic or Argive sculptors have been speculatively suggested as the author of the lost original.

==History==
The sculpture was known in the [[Giustiniani]] collection in [[Palazzo Giustiniani, Rome|Palazzo Giustiniani]], Rome, from the early 1630s, the date of a drawing made for the antiquarian [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]]&lt;ref&gt;Now in the archival volumes of his "paper museum" conserved in the Royal collection at [[Windsor Castle]], vol. ix, folio 29 (Lachenal).&lt;/ref&gt; and was illustrated in the engraved catalogue of the Galleria Giustiniani, produced under the direction of [[Joachim von Sandrart]] in two deluxe volumes, 1635–36 and 1638&lt;ref&gt;The ''Hestia'' appears in vol. I, plate XVII (1635-36).&lt;/ref&gt; In its first appearance in a Giustiniani inventory, 1638, it was a ''"vergine vestale vestita, di marmo greco tutta antica alta palmi 9"'' (quoted by Lachenal), "a clothed [[Vestal Virgin]], of Greek marble wholly antique, height 9 palmi."  The sculpture appeared in [[François Perrier (painter)|François Perrier]], ''Segmenta nobilium signorum'' (Paris and Rome, 1638), plate lxxii. The ''Hestia'' was purchased from the Giustiniani heirs in the nineteenth century and re-erected in Palazzo Lungara, where it was described by [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]]. It was removed to the Torlonia [[Villa Albani]] after World War II and was reinstalled in the 1990s in the courtyard of the Palazzo Torlonia in [[via della Conciliazione]].

==Identification==
Contemporary scholars are less certain about the sculpture's identification as Hestia, in part because of literary references to her imageless sanctuaries,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Joseph Goux, "Vesta, or the Place of Being", ''Representations'' '''1''' (February 1983), pp. 91-107.&lt;/ref&gt; though a similar figure is painted on a cup at Berlin attributed to the Sosias Painter (Lachenal): [[Demeter]] and [[Hera]] are alternative candidates. Often such attribution issues are skirted in modern scholarship by designating such sculptures simply as ''peplophoroi'' ("peplum-wearers")

A '''graphic designer''' is a professional within the [[graphic design]] and [[graphic arts]] industry who assembles together images, [[typography]], or motion graphics to create a piece of design. A graphic designer creates the graphics primarily for [[published media|published]], [[print media|printed]] or [[electronic media]], such as [[brochure]]s (sometimes) and [[advertising]]. They are also sometimes responsible for [[typesetting]], [[illustration]], user interfaces, and [[web design]]. A core responsibility of the designer's job is to present information in a way that is both accessible and memorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = it is the art of visualizing ideas
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications==
A Bachelor's degree  or certificate  from an accredited trade school is usually considered essential for a graphic design position. After a career history has been established, though, the graphic designer's experience and number of years in the business are considered the primary qualifications.  A [[Career portfolio|portfolio]], which is the primary method for demonstrating these qualifications, is usually required to be shown at job interviews, and is constantly developed throughout a designer's career.

One can obtain an [[Associate's degree|AAS]], [[Bachelor's degree#BA, AB, BDes, BS, BSc, SB, ScB, BAAS,|BA]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]], BCA,  [[Master's degree|MFA]] or an [[Master of Philosophy|MPhil]] / [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in graphic design. Degree programs available vary depending upon the institution, although typical U.S. graphic design jobs may require at least some form of degree.

Current graphic designer jobs demand proficiency in one or more graphic design software programs. A common software package used in the graphic design industry is [[Adobe Creative Cloud]]. This software package contains the three main programs used by graphic designers, which are Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator are the industry standard applications for many graphic design positions. Another example of a common software package is [[CorelDraw Graphics Suite]].

Outside the graphic design industry, many people use [[Microsoft Word]] or [[Microsoft Publisher]] to create a layout or design. However, depending on the job at hand, most designers create the layout in either InDesign, CorelDRAW or QuarkXPress. Specifically, the designer will type or import the text in the layout program, also importing the graphics and images they created in Photoshop or Illustrator. There are a couple of reasons a designer builds a layout in this fashion:

*Files going to press are generally printed at 300 dots per inch. As a result, the file size can become very large, depending upon the photos and graphics used in it. By using a layout program and linking these graphics and images (but not saving all of them in the file itself), the working file is a fraction of the file size. When the designer is ready to go to press, s/he will either create a press-ready PDF; or use the "Package" function in InDesign, or the "Collect For Output" function in QuarkXpress or CorelDRAW (which gathers the layout document, plus all fonts and images used therein, and saves them in one folder which can be provided to a commercial printing company for final output).
*InDesign, CorelDRAW, or QuarkXPress make it possible to work with large multiple page layouts, such as catalogs and booklets.
*Since InDesign, CorelDRAW, and QuarkXPress the original file, linking to the graphics and images, the designer can change the "original file" and it will update all instances throughout the document to save time.

A web designer should understand how to work with [[XML]], [[HTML]], and basic web programming [[Javascript|scripts]]. A print designer should understand the processes involved in printing (including, notably, [[offset printing]]) to be able to produce press-ready artwork.

Designers should be able to solve visual communication problems or challenges. In doing so, the designer must identify the communications issue, gather and analyze information related to the issue, and generate potential approaches aimed at solving the problem.  Iterative [[Prototype|prototyping]] and [[user testing]] can be used to determine the success or failure of a visual solution. Approaches to a communications problem are developed in the context of an audience and a media channel.  Graphic designers must understand the social and [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]] of that audience in order to develop visual solutions that are perceived as relevant, understandable and effective.&lt;ref name="nasad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/110496132/NASAD-Competencies-Summary-Degree-The-BFA-in-Graphic|title=NASAD Competencies Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic designers should also have a thorough understanding of production and rendering methods. Some of the technologies and methods of production are drawing, offset printing, photography, and time-based and interactive media (film, video, computer multimedia). Frequently, designers are also called upon to manage color in different media.&lt;ref name="nasad"/&gt;

==Career portfolio==
50 years ago, the graphic designer's [[Career portfolio|portfolio]]  was usually a black book or large binder in which samples of the artist's best printed pieces were carried to show prospective clients or employers. Printed pieces are often protected inside by being mounted on boards or slipped into Acetate sleeves.

Since the 1990s, portfolios have become increasingly computer digitized and now may be entirely digitized and available on the Internet, or on [[CD]], [[DVD]], or via [[email]].

==Branding==
Graphic design relates heavily to [[corporate identity]], the [[brand management|branding]], and "persona" of a corporation. Branding originated in the late 1890s and not only did it emerge as corporate identity, but it also signified corporate quality. Many might recognize the process of "branding" a hot iron symbol or logo onto an animal's body to differentiate other cattle. Branding your business or any other type of asset that requires an identity does help one to be recognized in a commercialized industry. Exceptional graphic designers can easily create a brand that fits the company as well as define it through one simple logo.

The '''''Heures de Charles d'Angoulême''''' is a [[book of hours]] commissioned in the late 15th century by [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], father of king [[Francis I of France]]. It is now in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, under the number Latin 1173.

The book contains full-page miniatures mostly painted by [[Robinet Testard]], many of which have been adapted from, and inspired by, engravings, including sixteen prints by [[Israhel van Meckenem]] which have been glued onto the vellum and overpainted. The book is notable for both the quality of its art, and its various methods of incorporating prints, which testifies to the "complex history of interchanges between printed materials and manuscript illumination during the later fifteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp.4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Letter R from folio52r.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|One of the [[historiated initial|inhabited letter]]s from the manuscript's unusual Ave Maria (folio 52r)]]
A [[book of hours]] is a manuscript designed for personal devotion and was popular in the Middle Ages. This illuminated work made for [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]] by the painter [[Robinet Testard]] is an unusual volume and is more comprehensive than just a set of devotions.  The artist seems to understand his sponsor's character. As well as its devotional purpose, the book seems designed to entertain, to arouse curiosity (f. 52v), to amuse (ff 3r, 4v and 5r), to satisfy the sponsor's aesthetic sense (ff. 16v and 26v), to encourage his pastoral feelings (f. 20v), to encourage his chivalrous instincts (f. 2v) and even to flatter him (f. 41v).&lt;ref name=Moleiro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.moleiro.com/fr_LHCA_LHEVIII_LHEIV_III_16.pdf |title=Les Heures de Charles d'Angoulême |author= |date= |work=Catalogue |publisher=M. Moleiro |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The folios most concerned with personal devotion, the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]] (f. 106v), were in fact the work of the engraver [[Israhel van Meckenem]], subsequently coloured by Testard with his characteristic luminous hues. Other work by painters such as [[Jean Bourdichon]] were included and may demonstrate Testard's honesty, his admittance that his talents were insufficient for the task. He also introduced some profane elements such as sexual encounters (ff. 4v and 20v), mythology (f. 41v) and chivalry (f. 53v). The text is entirely in [[Latin]], and the book can be interpreted as being the antithesis of a book of hours, or even an anti-book of hours.&lt;ref name=Moleiro/&gt; 

Some important pages include; the animated scene of the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]]; the mysterious image showing the death of the [[centaur]]; the moral scene "Combat between Virtue and Vice"; the political scene "Death of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]"; the picture of "the Spider King and his daughter Madame [[Anne de Beaujeu]]"; and [[George of Cappadocia]], a legendary scene which is more appropriate to a [[chivalric romance]] than a book of hours.&lt;ref name=Moleiro/&gt;

|[[Christ Pantocrator]] and the [[Tetramorph]]

This miniature is adapted by Testard from an engraving by van Meckenem, itself a copy of an [[:File:Maître E. S. Saint Jean Baptiste et l'agneau de Dieu L. 149.jpg|earlier 1466 print]] by [[Master E. S.]] The original print features John the Baptist in the centre, whom Testard has replaced with Christ amongst angels. Surrounding, the four symbols of the evangelists are arranged in a [[Latin cross]]: John's eagle (top), the winged lion of Mark (left), the bull of Luke (right), and Matthew's angel (bottom). The other medallions show the four doctors of the Church: [[Jerome]] with lion (top left); [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory]] (top right), [[Augustine]] (bottom right), and Ambrose (bottom left).

Testard largely keeps to original composition, which may have been a design for a [[paten]]. He has made some alterations to the faces and postures of the other characters, and added four prophets to the corners, skillfully extending and elaborating the foliate motifs to unify the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/516c1f3a66be7 Lepape]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene of a country dance which at first seems unconnected to this part of the book of hours. Closer examination reveals it to be a combination of religious and picturesque elements: a shepherd in the background points to an angel in the sky who is accompanied by a [[Speech scroll|phylactery]] bearing the words of the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/516c1f990f7dd Hermant]&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Judgment of Solomon]]

The composition of this scene is based upon a print by [[Master FVB]]. Testard has altered the faces, costumes and amount of  characters, introduced a lower viewpoint and made minor modifications to architectural details.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

|Death and the Centaur

Testard has been influenced here by Netherlandish printmaker [[Master I. A. M. of Zwolle]]'s ''Battle of Two Men with a Centaur'', to which he introduces [[Death (personification)|Death]], a lion and a [[Wild man|wild-woman]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of this scene is problematic. Typically understood to represent a [[Centaur]] battling the [[Lapiths]], a purely mythological tale and unusual subject for use in the "Office for the Dead", Belkin posits that this contest between man and beast is "symbolic of the struggle against dark forces. The Centaur and the wild woman form a single unit—the personification of vice in terms of Christian allegory. The private nature of the Book of Hours leads one to infer that Charles used the allegory of the struggle with the Vices for his own political vendetta against his rivals, conveying in this enigmatic miniature his bitter enmity towards those who had wronged him."&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]

17 [[Historiated initial|historiated letters]] on a background of gold which spell "Ave Maria, gracia ple[na]" from the first chapter of Luke. This is the reading for the [[Feast of the Annunciation]] (March 25)

The first letter is copied from the alphabet of [[Master E. S.]] (itself inspired by the late-14th century pattern-book by {{illm|Giovannino de' Grassi|it}}). Testard seems to have modeled the rest of the letters upon another woodblock alphabet of around 1464 from Flanders or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/5640868159100 Lepape] Two incomplete prints of  the 1464 alphabet series are in the British Museum, [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1349441&amp;partId=1 B,10.1–23] and 1947,0724.1–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Diagram for calculating the date of Easter

On the reverse of the Ave Maria is a diagram for [[Computus|calculating the date of Easter]]. Originally, "the vivid colours of the concentric circles behind the diagram must have stood out more clearly against the cream-coloured parchment [however] one of the components used to make the golden ground of the Ave Maria, probably silver, has gone rusty and seeped deep into the parchment". The main spoke, pointing up, features a sequence of nineteen Roman numerals representing years in the [[Metonic cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/56408458d0169 Hermant]&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Saint George and the Dragon]] (I. M.)

A print by van Meckenem, lightly coloured by Testard, depicting St George, patron saint of chivalry and military orders across medieval Europe. "The choice of this dragon-slaying saint rather than [[St Michael]], the patron saint of the crown of France from Louis XI onwards, was probably the result of a desire to disassociate Charles from the king of France".

Testard leaves the original print largely unaltered except for the conical hat and veil of the princess which he has replaced with a turban reflecting contemporary fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/56408477a4322 Lepape]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Seal of the Saints''' or '''"Khatam ul Awliya"''' is a central concept in the writings of 12th-century [[Islamic]] thinker and spiritual leader [[Ibn Arabi]].

== Concept of ''The Seal of the Saints'' in Ibn Arabi's writings ==

Ibn Arabi (1165-1240), in his ''"[[Mecca]]n Revelation"'' (''"Futuhati Maqiyya"''),&lt;ref name="Meccan1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Meccan Revelations 1 | publisher=Pir Press |author1=Al Arabi, Ibn |author2=Chodkiewicz, Michel |author3=Morris, James W. | year=2002 | isbn=978-1-879708-16-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that all the prophets and saints derive their light from the spirit of [[Muhammad]], the [[Islamic prophet|prophet of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Seal of the Saints: Prophethood and Sainthood in the Doctrine of Ibn 'Arabi | publisher=Fons Vitae | author=Chodkiewicz, Michel | isbn=0-946621-40-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ibn Arabi's thinking, the prophets and saints are manifestations of the spirit of Muhammad, which is the start and end point of the whole spiritual hierarchy.  The first manifestation of the spirit of Muhammad was the first man, [[Adam]]. The last and most perfect was Muhammad himself.

=== Two lines of spiritual transmission ===

In the [[Mysticism|mystical]] branch of Islam, [[Sufism]], there are two main lines of spiritual transmission:

#  The 40 [[tariqa]]s, which trace their line of Spiritual Transmission through Ali Ibn abi Thalib to the prophet Muhammad. The Seal of Saints of the 40 Tariqas line is said to be Ibn Arabi himself.&lt;ref&gt;Toshihiko Izutsu. ''Sufism and Taoism'', page 270&lt;/ref&gt;
# The chain of transmission which runs through Abu Bakr us Siddique to Muhammad. The Seal of Saints of the Abu Bakr as Siddique line is Abdullah Faiz Dagistani. This is the [[Naqshbandi]] (or Siddiqi) Tariqa.&lt;ref name=Nazim&gt;[http://www.sheiknazim2.com/khatmulawliya.html Khatm ul Awliya (The Seal of Saints), Sheikh Abdullah Faiz Daghistan] Retrieved 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi, in his book ''"The Astonishing Phoenix – on the Seal of the Saints and the Sun of the West"'', explains that the name of the Seal of Saints is Abdullah, who is a despised [[ajami]].&lt;ref name=Nazim /&gt;  Ibn Arabi describes the Seal of Saints in detail, using notably difficult symbolic language.

Similarly, Sharafuddin ad Dagistani, Moulana Sheikh Nazim and Adnan Kabbani explain that the Seal of Saints of the Siddiqi or Naqshbandi Tariqa is Abdullah Faiz Dagistani.&lt;ref name=Nazim /&gt;

The '''Kupferstich-Kabinett''' (English: '''Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs''') is part of the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden|Staatliche Kunstsammlungen]] (State Art Collections) of [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].  Since 2004 it has been located in [[Dresden Castle]].&lt;ref name=dus&gt;[http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/ks_kupferstichkabinett.htm Kupferstich-Kabinett] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720084737/http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/ks_kupferstichkabinett.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} Information and history from the Dresden and Saxony tourist website. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Like many of Dresden's notable collections, this [[print room]] traces its origins to the [[Electorate of Saxony|Prince-electors of Saxony]]. The art chamber of the [[House of Wettin]], established around 1560, became an independent museum of prints and drawings in 1720.&lt;ref name=dus /&gt;&lt;ref name=melzer&gt;[http://www.riha-journal.org/articles/2010/melzer-vorgeschichte-dresdner-kupferstich-kabinett Zur Vorgeschichte des Dresdner Kupferstich-Kabinetts zwischen 1560 und 1738] Christian Melzer, ''Journal of the International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art'', '''0004'''. 21 June 2010. Retrieved 8 September 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection was expanded in the following centuries.  It now describes itself as the oldest museum of graphic arts in the German-speaking world.  

Because most items had been evacuated to [[Schloss Weesenstein]] in the early stages of [[World War II]], the collection was saved from the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name=skd&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skd.museum/en/museums-institutions/residenzschloss/kupferstich-kabinett/history-of-the-collection/|title= History of the Collection|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Staatliche Kunstsammlung Dresden|access-date= 6 September 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; War-time losses were still high; around 50,000 items are still missing.&lt;ref name=skd/&gt; Most of the exhibits were [[Looted_art#Looting_by_the_Soviet_Union|looted]] by the [[Soviet Union]] after the war and did not return to Dresden until the late 1950s,&lt;ref name=dus /&gt; and some  when they were put back on display in the [[Albertinum]].

==Collection==
[[File:Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Study for Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]'', attributed to [[Jan van Eyck]], c. 1431]]
The collection includes over 500,000 items, only a fraction of which can be exhibited.  The most renowned artists in the collection include [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Rubens]].  There is also a large number of works by artists with strong connections to Dresden, such as [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Ludwig Richter]], [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Johannes Heisig]].  The collection of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] was started in 1898 and now numbers over 200 works from her oeuvre of drawings and graphics.&lt;ref name=dus /&gt;

Besides the permanent exhibition, the Kupferstichkabinett also hosts regular special exhibitions featuring both its own works and those on loan from other notable museums.

The [[oil painting]] depicts Picasso's mistress and muse, [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], asleep with a book upon her lap. The painting led to the breakup of Picasso's marriage to [[Olga Khokhlova]] after she saw it at a retrospective exhibition and realised that the facial features were not her own. The painting went to auction in 1989 and in 1996, where it failed to sell. In January 2011, it was announced that ''La Lecture'' would be going to auction on 8 February. The painting, which had not been seen in Europe since the exhibition, was then displayed at [[Sotheby's]] in Paris.

Picasso met [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]] in 1927 as she exited the Paris Metro and they later began a relationship, which they kept secret because she was only seventeen and Picasso was married to [[Olga Khokhlova]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12333330|title=Picasso painting La Lecture up for auction|date=1 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 February 2011 &lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wAuRXEGg|archivedate=1 February 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until he painted ''La Lecture'', Picasso often embedded some of Walter's features in the backgrounds of his other works.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; When ''La Lecture'' was exhibited at a Picasso retrospective, Khokhlova realised that her husband was in a relationship with another woman after noticing that the facial features in the painting were not hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/art-culture/Picassos-portrait-of-his-mistress-to-fetch-millions/articleshow/7403518.cms|title=Picasso's portrait of his mistress to fetch millions|date=1 February 2011|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ended her marriage to Picasso shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Walter later inspired other Picasso works including ''[[Le Rêve (Picasso)|Le Rêve]]'', which Picasso painted in the same month as ''La Lecture'', and ''[[Nude, Green Leaves and Bust]]''.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; On Walter's influence on Picasso and his work, ''The Art Wolf'' said "Marie-Thérès's potent mix of physical attractiveness and sexual naivety had an intoxicating effect on Picasso, and his rapturous desire for her brought about a number of images that are among the most sought after of his long career."&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/news/picasso-lecture-en.htm|title='La Lecture', a Picasso portrait of his muse Marie-Thérèse, to be auctioned in London|date=18 January 2011|publisher=The Art Wolf|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Picasso painted ''La Lecture'' from December 1931 to its completion in January 1932 during, what art experts have named, his "lovestruck period."&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/01/20/erotic-picasso-work-tops-sotheby-auction/|title=Erotic Picasso work tops Sotheby's auction|publisher=[[Euronews]]|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is oil on panel and is 65.5 by 51 centimeters.&lt;ref name="ChinaC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/cultureexpress/20110121/103450.shtml|title=Picasso's "La Lecture" to be sold in Pairs|date=21 January 2011|publisher=[[China Central Television]]|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wBG9LxJq|archivedate=1 February 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso has used bright colours, including yellow and green, to depict a nude Walter asleep in a chair with a book in her lap.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/17/picasso-sothebys-la-lecture-auction|title=Picasso to make biggest impression at Sotheby's sale|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=17 January 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wAw4FHLR|archivedate=1 February 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Brown of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the book in Walter's lap is a "sexual symbol" and the painting has been described as being sensual, erotic and happy.&lt;ref name="EuroNews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704754304576095693496901786?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Making a Big Impression|last=Studer|first=Margaret|date=28 January 2011|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the painting and Picasso, Philip Hook from Sotheby's said "In the early 1930s he was very lyrically in love and reflected that in these gorgeous colors, and lovely compositions. This period is just about the most desirable of all Picasso's (periods), certainly in market terms."&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; As Picasso painted ''La Lecture'' just days apart from ''La Rêve'', the two paintings are very similar in composition.&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"/&gt;

==Auctions==
The painting was auctioned in 1989 and it sold for [[United States dollar|$]]5.8 million.&lt;ref name="LongFaces"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long-faces-at-ny-art-houses-1345237.html|title=Long faces at NY art houses|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=2 May 1996|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wB97KYUt|archivedate=1 February 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''La Lecture'' went to auction again at [[Christie's]] in New York. It was estimated to sell between $6–8 million, but it failed to sell after bidding stopped at $4.8 million.&lt;ref name="LongFaces"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-18/picasso-s-sleeping-mistress-may-fetch-28-6-million-at-sotheby-s-in-london.html|title=Picasso's Sleeping Mistress May Fetch $28.6 Million at Auction|last=Reyburn|first=Scott|date=18 January 2011|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=1 February 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wB82C95R|archivedate=1 February 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that many people had judged the painting to be "over-valued."&lt;ref name="LongFaces"/&gt; Over the years, the painting has been owned by American art collectors Keith Warner, David Lloyd Kreeger and James W. Alsdorf.&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"/&gt;

In January 2011, it was announced that ''La Lecture'' would be included in an Impressionist and Modern art sale by [[Sotheby's]] in London on 8 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23917491-three-sothebys-art-auctions-expected-to-raise-pound-150m.do|title=Three Sotheby's art auctions expected to raise £150m|last=Blunden|first=Mark|date=26 January 2011|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|publisher=Evening Standard Ltd|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was being sold by an American collector.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt; Ahead of the auction, ''La Lecture'', which had not been seen in Europe since the Picasso retrospective, went on display in Paris.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The painting was estimated to fetch between £12–18 million and Helena Newman from Sotheby's said that the painting will "excite a lot of interest."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; On 8 February, ''La Lecture'' was sold in six minutes to an anonymous telephone bidder for £25.2 million ($40.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12400465|title=Picasso painting La Lecture fetches £25m at auction|date=9 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Savage Stage: Plays by Ma-Yi Theater Company'' is an anthology of selected new works developed and produced by the company since its founding.   Edited by Ma-Yi's Literary Manager, Joi Barrios, ''Savage Stage'' was published in 2007.

Ma-Yi Theater Company is a participant in "Artography: Arts in a Changing America", a pilot program launched by LINC (Leveraging Investments In Creativity) that seeks to map new arts practices in the United States resulting from demographic shifts.

== History ==

Ma-Yi did not start out to be an [[Asian American theatre]] company.  Founded in 1989 by [[Chito Jao Garces]] (artistic director), [[Ralph Pena]], [[Margot Lloren]], [[Ankie Frilles]], [[Luz de Leon]], [[Isolda Oca]], [[Arianne Recto]], [[Cristina Sison]], and [[Bernie Villanueva]], its first productions were [[Filipino culture|Filipino]] and [[Filipino-American]] plays and adaptations.  Also instrumental in the founding of Ma-Yi was [[Chris Millado]], who served as advisor to their first performance and returned to write and direct for the group.  Jorge Ortoll joined the company a year later in 1990, and became its executive director in 1991, the same year that Ma-Yi became a non-profit company and established a Board of Directors.  Ralph Peña and [[Betty Mae Piccio]] became co-artistic directors in 1995, and when Piccio moved to Philadelphia in 1996, Peña became its sole artistic director.  Ortoll and Peña have since organized a support staff that has included Lourdes Obillo as accountant, Vince Hokia as technical director, Daniel Rech as marketing manager, and Andrew Eisenmann and Suzette Porte as associate artistic directors.

Since its inception, Ma-Yi has benefited from the involvement of Filipino theatre artists based in New York, including production designer and director Loy Arcenas, composer Fabian Obispo, veteran actors Ching Valdez-Aran and Mia Katigbak, and novelist and playwright [[Jessica Hagedorn]].  Other Filipino artists and writers have also been involved with Ma-Yi, such as director Behn Cervantes; playwright and actor Rody Vera; playwright Marina Feleo-Gonzalez; [[National Artist of the Philippines]] for Literature [[Bienvenido Lumbera]] and Virgilio Almario; scholars Preachy Legasto, [[Nicanor Tiongson]], and Roland Tolentino; and choreographer-dancer Potri Rangkamanis.  In 2003, while in the United States as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the [[University of California Irvine]], Joi Barrios joined the group as its Literary Manager.

In 1998, Ma-Yi Theater expanded its mission to include works by other, non-Filipino, Asian American writers.  This move was largely prodded by the company's recognition of the need for more developmental venues for new Asian American plays.

Some of Ma-Yi Theater's recent productions include  ''Sides: The Fear is Real'', ''The Romance of Magno Rubio'' (Obie Award), ''No Foreigners Beyond This Point'' (Drama Desk nomination), and ''Trial By Water''.

The Ma-Yi Writers Lab was founded in 2004 by [[Sung Rno]] in connection with the TCG/NEA Playwright's Residence Program, and is currently led by Co-Directors [[Michael Lew]] and [[Rehana Lew Mirza]].  The Lab is Ma-Yi's resident company of emerging professional writers, and represents the largest group of professional Asian American playwrights ever assembled.

In 2005, the Ma-Yi Theater was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QW4N2XUy?url=http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html |archivedate=2007-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Ma-Yi Theater Group member and playwright Lloyd Suh asked that a student production of his play ''Jesus in India'' be shut down at Pennsylvania's Clarion University because the school ignored the play's requirement of using South Asian actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schackner|first=Bill|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=12 November 2015|title=Clarion University forced to cancel play over actors' race|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2015/11/12/Clarion-University-forced-to-cancel-production-over-actors-race/stories/201511120096|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This race controversy has been widely reported in the national press.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/11/14/playwright-forces-public-university-to-cancel-15k-production-of-his-play-after-he-saw-student-actors-race/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/11/12/clarion-university-play-canceled-over-actors-race/&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found that Clarion University had never secured the playwright's permission to use his play, much less adapt it into a musical, although it had been cleared by the author's agent. Absent a signed contract, Clarion University proceeded to change the material and schedule a public performance that the author only found out about through social media.

'''Mormon art''' comprises all visual art created to depict the principles and teachings of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), as well as art deriving from the inspiration of an artist’s LDS religious views. [[Mormons|Mormon]] art includes painting, sculpture, quilt work, photography, graphic art, and other mediums, and shares common attributes reflecting Latter-day Saint teachings and values.

==Mormon themes and aesthetic==

===Themes===
Numerous thematic components may be found in Mormon art. These range from being only inclusive of the Mormon faith to the simple underlying theme of spirituality that a Mormon artist attempts to render in a landscape or more general subject matter.

Most Mormon art is both [[Christian]]-themed and specific to the Mormon faith. It includes biblical depictions from the [[Old Testament]] and the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in the [[New Testament]], as well as [[Book of Mormon]] scenes and the history of the LDS Church. Many of these LDS historical accounts depicted in art include, what Mormons believe to be, the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the Gospel of Jesus in the mid-19th century, scenes from the life of [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] such as his [[First Vision]] and his [[Death of Joseph Smith|death]], and the migration of the [[Mormon pioneers]] from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] to [[Utah]]. LDS gospel principles, values, and the teachings of the church are also important art themes, especially to the latter half of the [[20th century]]. These are often represented literally or [[allegory|allegorically]] as in landscape paintings representing spirituality, personal inspiration, God’s love, and the wonders of God.

Although the most common themes in Mormon art are historical and principle-based, specific to the LDS faith, the decade following the founding of the church on April 6 1830, and continuing on through the end of second half of the 19th century, revealed little of these themes. Most artists who converted to the Mormon faith came from England and primarily exercised their talents by depicting the surrounding landscapes of the Mormon pioneer migration route. Their British art education concentrated on the traditional English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style and theme rather than genre and historical themes.&lt;ref name="Oman 1992"&gt;{{citation |last= Oman |first= Richard G. |contribution= Artists, Visual |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5488 |pages=  70–73 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These themes are a rarity during the initial growth of the church. One of the few exceptions that strays from this category of Romantic art is a painting by [[William Armitage (painter)|William Armitage]] (1817–1890) of London. The painting depicts LDS founder Joseph Smith preaching to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and was commissioned by the church for the [[Salt Lake Temple]].

One British artist associated with the English Romantic tradition was [[Frederick Piercy]] (1830–1891), who converted to the church in 1853. His contribution to Mormon art history is his sketches and paintings of the [[American west|western]] landscape as he migrated to Utah. He compiled these renderings into an LDS emigrant record of the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon route]] from Liverpool to Great Salt Lake Valley. The [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] holds a number of his original works.

It was not until the late 1850s and after, particularly in the beginning of World War One, when Mormon artists began to depict historical and genre-based paintings to celebrate their faith in the church.

One of the first artists to begin this historical trend in Mormon art was Scandinavian-born artist [[C. C. A. Christensen]] (1831–1912). He had trained at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] and used his talents to create one of his most famous series of paintings, ''Mormon Panorama'', made up of 23 paintings depicting the church’s history.
[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A. Christensen.jpeg|thumb|left|alt A=|''The Hill Cumorah'' by C.C.A. Christensen, depicting the [[Angel Moroni]] giving the [[golden plates]] to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]]]

Other artists that followed Christesen’s thematic choice were [[Minerva Teichert]], [[LeConte Stewart]], and [[Arnold Friberg]]. Of these, Friberg is known for depictions of Book of Mormon stories and history of the United States. One of his most recognizable paintings is ''The Prayer at Valley Forge'', featuring [[George Washington]] kneeling at [[Valley Forge]], completed in 1975.

Due to the religion's rapid membership growth in the 20th century, Mormon art created during this period reflects the diverse cultural styles within the church and range from depicting the historical to the personal interpretation of the historical, and also contain a spiritual and faithful basis.

The LDS Church places great importance on the power and use of art.&lt;ref&gt;Niebergall, Chelsee, [http://www.lds.org/church/news/worshiping-through-art ''Worshiping through Art''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513124557/https://www.lds.org/church/news/worshiping-through-art |date=2014-05-13 }}, Church News and Events, 5 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon art is circulated primarily within the church community via monthly magazines published by the church and church posters used for teaching [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] classes, [[Home teaching|Home]] and [[Visiting teaching#Visiting teaching|Visiting]], and [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] work. The magazines that are distributed monthly to members with a subscription are the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', the ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', the ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', and ''[[The Friend (LDS magazine)|The Friend]]''. The purpose of Mormon art creation and circulation is to provide inspiration and encouragement to LDS members, and to instruct and remind them of the teaching and values of the church.&lt;ref name="Peacock 1992"&gt;{{citation |last= Peacock |first= Martha Moffit |contribution= Art in Mormonism |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5489 |pages= 73–75 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular method of reaching out to the youth is through "[[Mormonads]]" (posters with social or religious messages), which are available through the ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'' (the LDS Church's youth magazine), the church's website, and independent church bookstores. Mormonads are available in poster-size and index-card sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/media-library/images/categories/mormonads "Mormonads"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic diversity and commonality===
Mormon art does not claim a particular style or aesthetic. Considered a young religion, Mormonism is not quite 200 years old and has primarily expanded in the 20th century, when artistic and cultural freedom concurrently increased. Today, there are more members of the LDS church outside of the United States than within. Accordingly, Mormon art varies widely in style.

[[Richard G. Oman]], expert on LDS art and curator of acquisitions for the LDS [[Church History Museum]] prior to 2010, states in an excerpt on visual artists in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' that the church purposefully holds no limitations on LDS artistic style in order to promote stylistic diversity: &lt;blockquote&gt; "The absence of an official [[liturgical]] art has kept the Church from directing its artists into specified stylistic traditions. This has been especially conducive to variety in art as the Church has expanded into many different cultures, with differing artistic styles and traditions."&lt;ref name="Oman 1992" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The LDS church recognizes the diverse [[demography]] and cultural differences within the church. Oman says that the church consequently embraces and promotes the various artistic attributes in order to “broaden [perspectives] so the Saints all over the world would be celebrated.”&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Corey, [http://mormonartist.net/issue-12/richard-oman/ Interview of Richard Oman by Corey Strange], [http://mormonartist.net/ Mormon Artist.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

One way the church showed their support for worldwide Mormon art was by establishing and hosting the International Art Competition in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/museum/competition/1,16118,4091-1,00.html LDS International Art Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church History Museum advertises that: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Latter-day Saint artists are citizens of many lands and come from many walks of life—and their diverse experiences are reflected in their art, for art is an important part of Latter-day Saint life and communication. The [[Church History Museum]] continues to encourage artists worldwide to express their faith through their native traditions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.lds.org/event/9th-art-comp?lang=eng&amp;program=stuff Church History Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The juried competition and exhibition is held every three years, inviting LDS artists worldwide to create and submit works of art related to a gospel theme dedicated to the year in which it is held. A number of art pieces are then exhibited at the Church History Museum. The most recent was the Ninth International Art Competition, running from 16 March 2012 – 14 October 2012. The theme was “Make Known His Wonderful Works.” More than 1,150 artists entered, and the museum displayed 198 works. Prizes were awarded to 20, and 15 artworks have been purchased by the museum, adding to the church's already vast collection of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.lds.org/event/9th-art-comp?lang=eng&amp;program=stuff Ninth International Art Competition],&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection, dispersed throughout [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] of the world and also held in the Church History Museum, includes a collection of [[Rembrandt]] etchings. In 2005, the museum exhibited 48 of Rembrandt’s 70 biblical etchings. The museum had acquired 17, with the remaining having been loaned by the [[Museum of Art at Brigham Young University]] and by a private collector. The biblical-themed exhibit, ''Rembrandt: The Biblical Etchings'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/exhibit-of-rare-rembrandt-etchings-opens-at-church-museum ''Exhibit of Rare Rembrandt Etchings Opens at Church Museum''], [http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ MormonNews Room.org],&lt;/ref&gt; included Old Testament stories such as that of Abraham, and scenes from the life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The collection was exhibited from 14 May 2005 through 14 December 2005, and online for a short period after the museum exhibition. Some etchings acquired for the collection were ''Self-Portrait Leaning on a Stone Sill'', 1639; ''Christ and the Woman of Samaria'', 1658; and ''Christ Ministering'', about 1640–49.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert O., [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/10/rembrandt-the-biblical-etchings?lang=eng ''Rembrandt: The Biblical Etchings''], [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign]], Oct. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this variety of styles produced by LDS artists from around the globe, all LDS art is interrelated by means of a shared religious belief. Oman also wrote of aesthetic uniformity: &lt;blockquote&gt; "While the work of LDS artists encompasses many historical and cultural styles, its unity derives from their shared religious beliefs and from recurring LDS religious themes in their works…Some of the aesthetic constants of LDS artists are the narrative tradition in painting, a [[reverence (emotion)|reverence]] for nature, absence of [[nihilism]], support of traditional societal values, respect for the human body, a strong sense of aesthetic structure, and rigorous craftsmanship…The artists' shared religious faith and values have constantly infused that tradition with meaning."&lt;ref name="Oman 1992" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another contributor to the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' is [[Martha Moffitt Peacock]], Professor in Art History and Associate Director for the [[Center for the Study of Europe at Brigham Young University]]. In regards to Mormon art and its spiritual commonality, she wrote that this spirituality also encourages aesthetic diversity: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Much discussion about a "Mormon aesthetic" has taken place in recent years, but it seems that the very personal nature of this spiritual artistic quest prevents the attainment of a prevalent aesthetic."&lt;ref name="Peacock 1992" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Prosperous Suzhou''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|姑蘇|繁華|圖}}|s={{linktext|姑苏|繁华|图}}|p=Gūsū Fánhuá Tú}}), originally entitled '''''Burgeoning Life in a Resplendent Age''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|盛世|滋生|圖}}|s={{linktext|盛世|滋生|图}}|p=Shèngshì Zīshēng Tú}}), is an 18th-century scroll painting ([[handscroll]]) created in 1759 by the Chinese court painter [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]].  Depicting the bustling urban life of [[Suzhou]], it combines Western perspective with traditional Chinese style.

== History ==
The [[Qianlong Emperor]] commissioned ''Prosperous Suzhou'' after he returned from an inspection trip to the south in 1751.&lt;ref name="hk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Paintings depict prosperous cities of Ming and Qing dynasties |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200909/24/P200909240131.htm |publisher=info.gov.hk |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took several years for Xu Yang, a native of Suzhou, to complete.&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; ''Prosperous Suzhou'' was renamed from ''Burgeoning Life in a Resplendent Age'' in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Drawing-Boundaries"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chung |first=Anita |year=2004 |title=Drawing Boundaries: Architectural Images in Qing China |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=9780824826635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

{{Wide image|Prosperous Suzhou.jpg|10000px|''Prosperous Suzhou'' by Xu Yang|dir=rtl}}

''Prosperous Suzhou'' is a [[handscroll]], a long narrow scroll for displaying a series of scenes. It is twelve meters in length.&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; It is intended to be viewed starting from the right end, by laying it flat on a table and unrolling it. One admires it section for section during the unrolling as if traveling through a landscape, depicting a continuous journey.&lt;ref name="Delbanco"&gt;Delbanco, Dawn (2008). [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chhs/hd_chhs.htm "Chinese Handscrolls"]. In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved November 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

European art and its techniques like [[linear perspective]] became increasingly influential in China the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="VAM-1600-1900"&gt;{{cite web |title=Masterpieces of Chinese Painting 700 - 1900: Challenging the Past and Looking to the West 1600-1900 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/album/18977 |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=November 13, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113230902/http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/album/18977 |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skillfully composed, ''Prosperous Suzhou'' combines Western linear perspective with traditional Chinese compositional devices.&lt;ref name="Drawing-Boundaries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM-1600-1900" /&gt; The scroll is invaluable from both a historical and an artistic point of view,&lt;ref name="JoA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hung | first1 = W.

In his inscription at the end of the scroll, Xu Yang wrote that he painted it in order to depict a peaceful and prosperous reign, and to pay homage to the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite web |title=Suzhou Scroll |url=http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsa13/scroll/suzhou_viewer.html |publisher=[[Harvard]] |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, his inscription describes the scroll as a journey from [[Mount Lingyan]] to the city walls of Suzhou, through the city, and ending at [[Tiger Hill, Suzhou|Tiger Hill]].&lt;ref name="Drawing-Boundaries" /&gt;

The scroll vividly illustrates the visual appearance of the terrain, urban landscapes, and everyday life in an area covering several dozen miles. The middle of the scroll depicts an idealised view of all the activities of the bustling urban center of Suzhou. Viewers can see numerous merchants, traders, barges and passenger boats, as well as dense rows of shops and vendors. More than 4,800 human figures,&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; 2,000 architectural structures,&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; and 400 boats&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; are present.

== Exhibitions ==

''Prosperous Suzhou'' along with fourteen other paintings (all on the subject of the prosperous cities of the [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]) from the [[Liaoning Provincial Museum]] were exhibited at the [[Hong Kong Museum of Art]] from 25 September 2009 to 22 November 2009 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt;

The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]] mounted an exhibition entitled ''Masterpieces of Chinese Painting'' that included ''Prosperous Suzhou'' from 26 October 2013 to 19 January 2014. The exhibition was organized to display the finest examples of Chinese painting from the beginning of the 8th to the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="VAM-exhibition" /&gt;

In 2016, a booklet was published entitled "Prosperous Suzhou" which displays a painted copy of Xu Yang's original.  The booklet includes an explanation in English of what is seen in each half-metre. [http://www.blurb.com/b/6958888-prosperous-suzhou]

'''Relative luminance''' follows the [[Luminance|photometric definition of luminance]], but with the values normalized to 1 or 100 for a reference white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Poynton, Charles | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | isbn = 1-55860-792-7 | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ra1lcAwgvq4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA206&amp;dq=relative-luminance+100-units&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=lU18R8aTJ4iUtgOskqGeBw&amp;sig=IEWpWLxN_3uSazaqN-6dBkJ3UXM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the photometric definition, it is related to the luminous flux density in a particular direction, which is radiant flux density weighted by the [[luminosity function]] {{overline|''y''}}(''λ'') of the CIE Standard Observer.

The use of relative values is useful in systems where absolute reproduction is impractical. For example, in prepress for print media, the absolute luminance of light reflecting off the print depends on the illumination and therefore absolute reproduction cannot be assured.

==Relative luminance in colorimetric spaces==
For [[color space]]s such as [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ]], xyY, etc. the letter Y refers to relative luminance. No computation is required to find relative luminance when it is explicit in a color representation in such spaces.

For [[RGB]] color spaces that use the [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709]] primaries (or [[sRGB]], which defines the same primaries), relative luminance can be calculated '''from linear RGB components: first [[SRGB#The_reverse_transformation|convert the gamma-compressed RGB values to linear RGB]]''', and then &lt;ref&gt;Michael Stokes, Matthew Anderson, Srinivasan Chandrasekar, and Ricardo Motta, "A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet - sRGB", [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB online] see matrix at end of Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y = 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula reflects the [[luminosity function]]: green light contributes the most to the intensity perceived by humans, and blue light the least.

For other sets of primary chromaticities (defined by their x and y chromaticity coordinates), different linear coefficients are needed to get relative luminance. In general, the coefficients are all positive, the green coefficient is largest and blue smallest, and the three form the middle row of the RGB-to-XYZ color transformation matrix.

For nonlinear gamma-compressed R′G′B′ color spaces as typically used for computer images, a linearization of the R′G′B′ components to RGB is needed before the linear combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Maureen C. Stone]] | title = A Field Guide to Digital Color | publisher = A K Peters, Ltd | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k8IsqEF8FgQC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=inauthor:stone+luminance+linear-values-of-RGB&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=GU98R7ahBpHwsgOw67ieBw&amp;sig=zirxmtOXHJG0vvtFIkQJqb5oYlQ | isbn = 1-56881-161-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[L*a*b*]] space, the L* component is the [[lightness (color)|lightness]]; a perceptual scale of the brightness as a nonlinear function of the relative luminance Y.

Note that [[luminance (relative)|relative luminance]] should not be confused with ''[[luma (video)|luma]]'', the weighted sum of the nonlinear gamma-compressed R′G′B′ components. For color spaces that use luma, such as [[Y′UV]] or [[Y′CbCr]] (where Y′ represents luma), computation of relative luminance can still be done. The R′G′B′ components can be transformed into RGB linear components by undoing the [[gamma compression]]; these linear components can then be used to calculate luminance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">'''Rudolph Franz Zallinger''' (November 12, 1919 – August 1, 1995) was an American-based [[Austrians|Austrian]]-[[Russians|Russian]] artist notable for his mural ''[[The Age of Reptiles]]'' (1947) at [[Yale University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]. His painting of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' heavily influenced the creature design of [[Toho Studios]]' ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954). Two of Zallinger's dinosaurs, ''T. rex'' and ''[[Brontosaurus]]'', are seen in the film as part of a slide demonstration during a lecture in the [[National Diet Building]]. A third slide showing Zallinger's ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' was planned but eventually not used in the film.

==Biography==
Zallinger was born in [[Irkutsk]], [[Siberia]] in 1919. He attended [[Yale School of Art|Yale's School of Fine Arts]] on scholarships during the [[Great Depression]], was trained as an illustrator, and he taught at Yale after graduation. The Peabody Museum hired him to paint the mural in 1943 at $40 a week, and Zallinger took a crash course in paleontology to prepare for the job. The mural is one of the largest in the world, measuring 110 feet (33.5 meters) by 16 feet (4.9 meters). It required more than 4.5 years (1943–1947) to complete.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title =  Rudolph Franz Zallinger | url = http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/archives/biography/rudolph-franz-zallinger | publisher =Yale Peabody Museum: Collections : Archives | date =  | accessdate = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the mural appeared on a United States postage stamp in 1970.&lt;ref name="Stamp"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = 1970 U.S. Postage Stamp Issues | url = http://www.1847us.com/ByYear/1970.htm | publisher =1847us.com  | date =2011  | accessdate = 25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After that, the museum appointed him as the “artist in residence”, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name="Wallace2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wallace, D.R.|title=Beasts of Eden|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2004|isbn=0-520-23731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zallinger received many assignments, prominent among which are those he did for illustrating articles for [[Life (magazine)|Life]] magazines. His paintings portrayed dinosaurs, the [[Russian Revolution]], the rain forests of Dutch Guiana (now [[Suriname]]) and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s of ancient [[Crete]], besides others.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;

He taught at the Yale School of Fine Arts, the Hartford Art School at the University of Hartford in West Hartford, and at the Paier School of Art in Hamden.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">'''Scottish orientalism''' refers to the collective views of a group of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] scholars of [[oriental languages]], informed by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and applied to the culture and administration of the [[Indian subcontinent]] though the [[East India Company]], from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century.

The word "orientalist" is recorded in English from 1779. In its early days and in relation to [[India]] (rather than the Ottoman possessions) it connoted not only proficiency in languages of India, but also study of the culture, and advocacy of administration of the existing legal systems and customs. This attitude was opposed by both [[evangelical]] and [[Utilitarian]] critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] |title=For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and their Enemies |year=2006 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=0-713-99415-0 |pages=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Scottish dominance within [[Orientalism#British_Orientalism|British orientalism]] at the end of the 18th century—the period after the death of [[Sir William Jones]] in 1794—was almost complete: the only leading exception was [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore Koditschek|title=Liberalism, Imperialism, and the Historical Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heOq2CIzEtAC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=3 March 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49488-5|page=66 note 19.}} Others mentioned there are: [[Neil Benjamin Edmonstone]]; [[John Gilchrist (linguist)|John Gilchrist]]; [[William Hunter (Asiatic Society)|William Hunter]]; James Kirkpatrick; William Kirkpatrick; [[Colin Mackenzie]]; and [[Thomas Munro]]. [[Mark Wilks]] was from the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rendall's theory==
Rendall has identified a group of Scottish oriental scholars, under the influence of [[Dugald Stewart]] and his view of "philosophical history". They bridge the gap between [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] who warned of the [[ethnocentrism]] into which the approach of [[stadial history]] could betray Europeans, and [[James Mill]] who in ''[[The History of British India]]'' embraced the assumption of European superiority, in the case of [[Hindu culture]]. These men all had contact with [[Edinburgh University]], and comprise:&lt;ref&gt;Rendall, pp. 44–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[William Erskine (historian)|William Erskine]]
*[[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]]
*[[Vans Kennedy]]
*[[John Leyden]]
*[[James Mackintosh]].
*[[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Murray]]

==Orientalism in government==
Michael Fry has argued that there was a "Scottish orientalist regime", including Elphinstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Avril Ann Powell|title=Scottish Orientalists and India: The Muir Brothers, Religion, Education and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOnS1X8a528C&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-579-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The views of Scottish administrators derived from the contemporary [[Moderate Party (Scotland)|Moderate]] church party, and Scottish intellectuals including Robertson and [[Adam Ferguson]], leading to an accepting line on Indian custom and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Constable, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Strong sympathy for Indians was shown in the 1796 novel ''Translations of the Letters of a Hindoo Rajah'' (1796) by [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]], sister of the orientalist [[Charles Hamilton (orientalist)|Charles Hamilton]]. The family was [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Brown|title=The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain And Empire( 1707-1918)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BasUT5FyhM8C&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2481-2|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scouting for the Reaper''''' (2014) is the first collection of [[short stories]] by American author [[Jacob M. Appel]].&lt;ref&gt;Writers Chronicle, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Poets &amp; Writers'', March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It won the [[Hudson Prize]] in 2012 and was published by [[Black Lawrence Press]].  ''Writing Today'' named it the best debut collection of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Writing Today, November 1, 2014, P. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the stories in the collection, "Rods and Cones," which had previously appeared in ''[[The Southwest Review]]'', was listed "Notable Nonrequired Reading of 2007" in ''[[The Best American Nonrequired Reading]]'' and "Creve Coeur", which previously won [[The Missouri Review|The Missouri Review's]] Editors Prize, was named as one of the "100 Other Distinguished Stories of 2007" by [[The Best American Short Stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Best American Short Stories, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; "Ad Valorem," first published in ''[[Subtropics]]'', was named a "Distinguished Mystery Story" in [[The Best American Mystery Stories]] of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Best American Mystery Stories, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Critic John Domini in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'' noted of Appel's stories that "the rambunctious serendipity recalls [[T.C. Boyle]], as does the ability to turn on a dime, now cutthroat, now huggable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/02/books/the-containable-apocolypse-the-biology-of-luck-elephant-rock-books-2013-and-scouting-for-the-reaper-black-lawrence-press-2014-by-jacob-m-appel|title=The Containable Apocalypse|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue Ellis in ''Prick of the Spindle'' wrote of the collection that "every story is filled with all the pathos, humor, and intimacy readers will come to expect from this author."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prickofthespindle.com/reviews/8.3/appel/appel.html Scouting for the Reaper: Stories By Jacob M.

== Definition and purpose ==
The term ''skeuomorph'' is compounded from ''skeuos'' (σκεῦος), meaning 'container or tool', and ''morphḗ'' (μορφή), meaning 'shape'. It has been applied to material objects since 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=March|first=H. Colley|title=Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society|year=1890|publisher=The Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society|pages=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=910vAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22skeuomorph%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JjzCUP2UB7T9iQLl_YGIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22skeuomorph%22&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202165310/https://books.google.com/books?id=910vAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22skeuomorph%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JjzCUP2UB7T9iQLl_YGIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22skeuomorph%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now also used to describe computer and mobile interfaces.&lt;ref name=gessler&gt;{{cite web|last=Gessler|first=Nicholas|title=Skeuomorphs and Cultural Algorithms|url=http://www.skeuomorph.com/|accessdate=7 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624065316/http://www.skeuomorph.com/|archivedate=24 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar alternative definition of skeuomorph is "a physical [[Ornament (art)|ornament]] or [[Graphic design|design]] on an object made to resemble another material or technique". This definition is broader in scope, as it can be applied to design elements that still serve the same function as they did in a previous design.

Skeuomorphs may be deliberately employed to make a new look more familiar and comfortable, or may be the result of cultural influences and norms on the designer.  They may be artistic expression on the part of the designer.&lt;ref name=gessler/&gt; The academic [[Donald Norman]] describes skeuomorphism in terms of cultural constraints: interactions with a system that are learned only through culture. Norman also popularized perceived [[affordance]]s, where the user can tell what an object provides or does based on its appearance, which skeuomorphism can make easy.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;{{cite web | title=Affordances and Design | last=Norman | first=Donald | url=http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html | accessdate=2012-12-03 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120145620/http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html | archivedate=2012-11-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of skeuomorphism overlaps with other design concepts. [[Mimesis]] is an imitation, coming directly from the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Janusheske | first=Jeffrey | title=Thesis: Mimesis to Skeuomorph? | url=http://www.jfree-design.com/2012/02/14/thesis-mimesis-to-skeuomorph/ | accessdate=2012-12-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215081556/http://www.jfree-design.com/2012/02/14/thesis-mimesis-to-skeuomorph/ | archivedate=2013-02-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archetype]] is the original idea or model that is emulated, where the emulations can be skeuomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sen | first=Rahul | title=Archetypes and Their Use in Mobile UX | url=http://johnnyholland.org/2010/05/archetypes-and-their-use-in-mobile-ux/ | accessdate=2012-12-03 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226223052/http://johnnyholland.org/2010/05/archetypes-and-their-use-in-mobile-ux/ | archivedate=2012-12-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeuomorphism is parallel to, but different from, [[path dependence]] in technology, where an element's functional behavior is maintained when the reasons for its design no longer exist.

== Physical skeuomorphs ==
[[File:Doric-order-labeled (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Triglyph]] and [[guttae]] in the [[Doric order]]; traditionally seen as recreating in stone functional features of the wooden [[Greek temple]]s that preceded them.]]

Many features of wooden buildings were repeated in stone by the [[Ancient Greeks]] when they transitioned from wood to masonry construction. Decorative stone features in the [[Doric order]] of [[classical architecture]] in [[Greek temple]]s such as [[triglyph]]s, [[mutules]], [[guttae]], and [[modillions]] are supposed to be derived from true structural and functional features of the early wooden temples. The [[triglyph]] and [[guttae]] are seen as recreating in stone functional features of the wooden temples that preceded them, respectively the carved beam-ends and six wooden pegs driven in to secure the beam in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artful Crafts: Ancient Greek Silverware and Pottery |last1=Vickers |first1=Michael |last2=Gill |first2=David |year=1996 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-198-15070-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manby/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Summerson|Summerson, John]], ''[[The Classical Language of Architecture]]'', pp. 128, 133, 1980 edition, [[Thames and Hudson]] ''World of Art'' series, {{ISBN|0500201773}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Historically, high-status items such as the [[Minoans]]' elaborate and expensive silver cups were recreated for a wider market using [[pottery]], a cheaper material. The exchange of shapes between metalwork and ceramics, usually in that direction, is near-constant in the history of the [[decorative arts]]. Sometimes pellets of clay evoke the [[rivet]]s of the metal originals.&lt;ref name=Knappet&gt;{{cite web | last=Knappet | first=Carl | title=Photographs, Skeuomorphs and Marionettes | url=http://mcu.sagepub.com/content/7/1/97 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201184641/http://mcu.sagepub.com/content/7/1/97 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of skeuomorphism in material transitions. Leather and pottery often carry over features from the wooden counterparts of previous generations. Clay pottery has also been found bearing rope-shaped protrusions, pointing to craftsmen seeking familiar shapes and processes while working with new materials.&lt;ref name=Manby&gt;{{cite book | last=Manby | first=T.G. | title=Unbaked Urns of Rudely Shape: essays on British and Irish pottery for Ian Longworth | year=1995 | publisher=Oxbow Books and others | location=Oxford | isbn=0946897948 | pages=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, skeuomorphs exist as traits sought in other objects, either for their social desirability or psychological comforts.&lt;ref name=gessler /&gt;

In the modern era, cheaper plastic items often attempt to mimic more expensive wooden and metal products, though they are only skeuomorphic if new ornamentation references the original functionality,&lt;ref name="Bullock1999"&gt;{{Citation |last=Bullock |first=Alan  |title=The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought |pages=795–796 |year=1999 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-04696-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as molded screw heads in molded plastic items. Another well-known skeuomorph is the [[plastic]] [[Adirondack chair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Totally weird and wonderful words |last=Winchester |first=Simon |last2=Lederer&lt;!--should be contributors but the template doesn't like that without an actual author!--&gt; |first2=Richard |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195312120 |editor-last=McKean |editor-first=Erin |location=Oxford |chapter=Foreward |oclc=70060979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.]], while under the direction of [[Steve Jobs]], was known for its wide usage of skeuomorphic designs in various applications. This changed after Jobs' death when [[Scott Forstall]], described as "the most vocal and high-ranking proponent of the visual design style favored by Mr. Jobs", resigned. Apple designer [[Jonathan Ive]] took over some of Forstall's responsibilities and had "made his distaste for the visual ornamentation in Apple’s mobile software known within the company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilton|first2=Nick|date=2012-10-31|title=Apple Shake-Up Could Lead to Design Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/technology/apple-shake-up-could-mean-end-to-real-world-images-in-software.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|journal=[[The New York Times]]|volume=CLXII|issue=55,941|last1=Wingfield|first1=Nick|accessdate=2012-11-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104084356/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/technology/apple-shake-up-could-mean-end-to-real-world-images-in-software.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|archivedate=2012-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the announcement of [[iOS 7]] at [[WWDC]] in 2013, Apple officially shifted from skeuomorphism to a [[Flat Design|more simplified design]], thus beginning the so-called "death of skeuomorphism" at Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2013-06-11|title=A Eulogy for Skeuomorphism|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-eulogy-for-skeumorphism|journal=Motherboard|last1=Evans|first1=Claire|accessdate=2013-06-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613043144/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-eulogy-for-skeumorphism|archivedate=2013-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other virtual skeuomorphs do not employ literal images of some physical object; but rather allude to ritual human heuristics or heuristic motifs, such as slider bars that emulate [[Potentiometer#Audio control|linear potentiometers]]&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; and tabs that behave like tabbed file folders. Another example is the swiping hand gesture for turning the "pages" or screens of a tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An E-Book UI That Lets You Flip Digital Pages, Just Like A Real Book |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669802/an-e-book-ui-that-lets-you-flip-digital-pages-just-like-a-real-book |publisher=Co.Design |accessdate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322193502/http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669802/an-e-book-ui-that-lets-you-flip-digital-pages-just-like-a-real-book |archivedate=22 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual skeuomorphs can also be auditory. The shutter-click sound emitted by most [[camera phone]]s when taking a picture is an auditory skeuomorph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McNeil |first1=Joanne |title=Skeuomorphic Sounds: Digital Camera Shutter Clicks and Car Door Clunks |url=https://rhizome.org/editorial/2011/jul/14/skeuomorphic-sounds/ |publisher=Rhizome |accessdate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307014351/https://rhizome.org/editorial/2011/jul/14/skeuomorphic-sounds/ |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skeuomorphic design ==

[[Retrofuturism]] incorporates spatial motifs from previous iterations of the future; especially visions of electro-industrialism. This is frequently incorporated in retrowave or synthwave illustrations. Skeumorphic time is closely linked with [[metamodernism]].

=== Arguments in favor ===
An argument in favor of skeuomorphic design is that it makes it easier for those familiar with the original device to use the digital emulation by making certain [[affordance]]s stronger. Interactions with computer devices are mostly cultural and learned. Once a process is learned and adopted in a society, it develops persistence. Proposals for change, especially radical change, often result in debate between proponents and opponents. [[Don Norman|Norman]] describes this process as a form of [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;

=== Arguments against ===
The arguments against skeuomorphic design are that skeuomorphic interface elements use metaphors that are more difficult to operate and take up more screen space than standard interface elements, that this breaks operating system interface design standards, that it causes an inconsistent look and feel between applications,&lt;ref name=tacky&gt;{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Austin|title=Will Apple’s Tacky Software-Design Philosophy Cause A Revolt?|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=11 December 2012|quote=The issue is two-fold: first, that traditional visual metaphors no longer translate to modern users; and second, that excessive digital imitation of real-world objects creates confusion among users.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215043327/http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt|archivedate=15 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that skeuomorphic interface elements rarely incorporate numeric input or feedback for accurately setting a value, that many users may have no experience with the original device being emulated, that skeuomorphic design can increase [[cognitive load]] with visual noise that after a few uses gives little or no value to the user, that skeuomorphic design limits creativity by grounding the experience to physical counterparts,&lt;ref name="Sharp 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Helen |last2=Rogers |first2=Yvonne |last3=Preece |first3=Jenny
|title=Interaction Design: Beyond Human–Computer Interaction |edition=2nd |page=62 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that skeuomorphic designs often do not accurately represent underlying system state or data types due to inappropriate [[mimesis]], such as analog gauges in a digital interface.

In the case of the electric tea kettle such designs can be dangerous. If used in the original way catastrophe can ensue resulting in property damage or injury.

The '''South London Theatre''' is a [[Community theatre]] in [[West Norwood]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], [[England]].  The first play opened in October 1967, and it is now a busy [[theatre|theatrical]] venue, presenting more than 22 shows annually in two [[auditoria]]: the 100-seater [[proscenium arch]] "Bell Theatre" and a smaller "[[Black box theater|black box theatre]]" called "[[Prompt Corner]]", it also has a private [[basement]] bar open 363 nights a year which is host to regular social events.

The plays produced include all genres: Shakespeare, comedy, classics, pantomime, musicals and modern cutting-edge drama. New writing is particularly encouraged, as are aspiring directors. There are plenty of available roles behind scenes and help and encouragement is given to new members.

There is a very active youth group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nayt.org.uk/youngpeople/youth-theatres/theatres/greater-london/lambeth/south-london-theatre ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928100226/http://www.nayt.org.uk/youngpeople/youth-theatres/theatres/greater-london/lambeth/south-london-theatre |date=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the "South London Youth Theatre") as well as children's classes. The children have their own showcases and are also encouraged to participate in the main productions.

The South London Theatre is a member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littletheatreguild.org//cgi-bin/PHPTest/LTGTheatreShow.php?theatreid=20 Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

The [[Gothic revival]] style building was originally a [[fire station]], built in 1881, by the architect [[Robert Pearsall (architect)|Robert Pearsall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London’s Oldest Operational Fire Station|url=http://e-shootershill.co.uk/closure-threat-for-londons-oldest-operational-fire-station/|work=e-shootershill.co.uk|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It retains much of that original character, for example it is the only fire Station for horse-drawn tenders which still has the look-out tower and doors still in place. The building should always retain its historic features as it is Grade II [[listed building|listed]]. It had a short history as a fire station as it was built for horse-drawn fire engines and the new motorised appliances were too big for the doors, which could not be extended. The area behind these doors, where the appliances and horses were kept, is now the Bell [[Theatre]] stage. Between its life as a fire station and its current one as a theatre, the building was used as a hall for the local church and also as an illegal boxing venue.

The design for the conversion to a theatre was by [[Owen Luder]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3300-south-london-theatre South London Theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106145208/http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3300-south-london-theatre |date=2014-01-06 }}. The Theatres Trust. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; (later to become President of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] on two occasions and a well-known [[Dulwich]] personality), the original design for the building was probably designed by Richard Pearsall, in the Metropolitan Board of Works Architect's Department.

Like all old buildings, the theatre requires a lot of maintenance and a renovation is planned which should make the building fully [[Handicapped-accessible|accessible]] and able to accept performances from external theatre companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southlondontheatre.co.uk/restoration/ Case for restoration funding]&lt;/ref&gt; Work on this is soon to start so at present the theatre is using other performance spaces. The main shows are at the [[Stanley Halls]] in South Norwood and Youth Group performances will be in St Luke's Church next door to the Norwood High St SLT building.

For those interested at simply looking around the building, it does tours for a weekend in September as part of [[Open House London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonopenhouse.org/public/london/event.html Open House]. Londonopenhouse.org (2010-09-19). Retrieved on 2013-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{styles}}

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

The '''Fleming Collection''' is a large [[private collection]] of [[Scottish art]]. It was on display in a gallery in [[Berkeley Square]], central [[London]], England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flemingcollection.com/collection/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819021804/http://flemingcollection.com/collection | archivedate=19 August 2016 | title=History of the Collection | accessdate=30 December 2017 | publisher=Fleming Collection, UK | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the gallery's closure in 2016.

==Origins==
The collection was started in 1968 from the Scottish banking firm [[Robert Fleming &amp; Co.]], founded in [[Dundee, Scotland|Dundee]], [[Scotland]].  In 1968 the bank moved to a new building in Corsby Square in the City of London and it was decided to create a collection for the purpose of decorating the space.  This task was given singularly to one of the bank’s directors, David Donald.  The only guideline given was that the paintings should be by Scottish artists or Scottish scenes by any artists, to emphasise the bank's proud Scottish origins.  Scottish art was largely unknown outside Scotland until the 1980s, making prices relatively low, meaning that a large collection was amassed in a short amount of time.

David Donald died unexpectedly in 1985.  Earlier that year he was awarded the honour of being elected an Honorary Academician of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] for services to Scottish art.  The role of collector was continued by Robert Fleming and Bill Smith, who was later to become the first Keeper of Art.  Under his guidance the Collection was moved to its new headquarters in Copthall Avenue.  The Collection also began to focus more on collecting the work of living artists.  By the 1990s it had gained international recognition as a collection of Scottish art and as a corporate art collection.  After Bill Smith’s retirement, Selina Skipwith became the new Keeper of Art.

==The Fleming-Wyfold Foundation==

In March 2000 Flemings bank was sold to [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], New York.  To avoid the Collection being lost, the Fleming family put forward the funds to enable a new charitable foundation, The Fleming-Wyfold Foundation, to purchase the collection at market value before the sale.

The collection was moved to premises on Berkeley Street in 2002.  The gallery was to have a revolving exhibition based on works from the Collection and aiming to act as a showcase for Scottish art in London.  The Foundation also continues to lend works to exhibitions internationally.  In June 2010, a second gallery was opened within the premises to allow for a changing exhibition programme showing emerging and established Scottish artists as well as works from the collection.

In 2015 it was announced that the gallery would close in March 2016, and that the Foundation would instead focus on 'loans, exhibitions, and art education'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/14040453.Renowned_Fleming_Collection_gallery_of_Scottish_art_in_London_to_close/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works in the Collection==
The collection contains art from the mid 18th century to the present by a large selection of Scottish artists.
From the 18th and 19th centuries, artists include [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], [[Henry Raeburn]], [[Jacob More]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], Scottish [[Impressionist]] [[William McTaggart]] and notable images of the [[Highland Clearances]], [[Thomas Faed]]’s ''The Last of The Clan'' and John Watson Nicol’s ''Lochaber No More''.

Key groups represented include [[The Glasgow Boys]], with works by [[Arthur Melville]], [[John Lavery]], [[Sir James Guthrie]], [[Edward Arthur Walton]], [[Joseph Crawhall]] and [[Edward Atkinson Hornel]].

The collection is particularly known for its works by the [[Scottish Colourists]], a group composed of [[Samuel John Peploe]], [[John Duncan Fergusson]], [[George Leslie Hunter]], and [[Francis Campbell Boileau Cadell]].

The collection includes works by 20th-century artists including [[James Cowie (artist)|James Cowie]], [[Stanley Cursiter]], [[Anne Redpath]], [[William Johnstone (artist)|William Johnstone]], [[William George Gillies]], [[William Geissler]], [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], [[Alan Davie]], [[Joan Eardley]], [[Craigie Aitchison (painter)|Craigie Aitchison]], [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Will Maclean]], [[John Bellany]], [[Alison Watt (Scottish painter)|Alison Watt]], [[Jock McFadyen]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Skipwith (2003) ''A History of Scottish Art'' London: Merrell Publishers Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The North-West Passage''''' is an 1874 painting by [[John Everett Millais]]. It depicts an elderly sailor sitting at a desk, with his daughter seated in a stool beside him. He stares out at the viewer, while she reads from a log-book. On the desk is a large chart depicting complex passageways between incompletely charted islands. 

Millais exhibited the painting with the subtitle '''"It might be done and England should do it"''', a line imagined to be spoken by the aged sailor.  The title and subtitle refer to the repeated failure of British expeditions to find the [[northwest passage]], a navigable passageway around the north of the American continent. These expeditions "became synonymous with failure, adversity and death, with men and ships battling against hopeless odds in a frozen wilderness."&lt;ref name = tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-the-north-west-passage-n01509 Tate Gallery, The North-West Passage 1874]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The search for the northwest passage had been undertaken repeatedly since the voyages of [[Henry Hudson]] in the early 17th century. The most significant attempt was the 1845 expedition led by [[John Franklin]], which had disappeared, apparently without trace. Subsequent expeditions had found evidence that Franklin's two ships had become stuck in ice, and that the crews had died over a number of years from various causes, some having made unsuccessful attempts to escape across the ice. These later expeditions were also unable to navigate a route between Canada and the Arctic. Millais had the idea for the painting when a new expedition to explore the passage, the [[British Arctic Expedition]] led by [[George Nares]], was being prepared.&lt;ref name = tate/&gt;&lt;ref name = nar&gt;James, Ian, "'The North-West Passage' by Sir John Millais", ''Polar Record'', January 1986; 23 (142), pp. 81-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Millais was keen to use [[Edward John Trelawny]] as the model for the figure of his old sailor. He had met him at the funeral of their mutual friend [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]. Millais' wife [[Effie Gray]] persuaded Trelawny to sit for the picture by agreeing to attend a Turkish bath he was promoting at the time. The female figure was a professional model, Mrs Ellis, who was later used in another painting, ''Stitch, Stitch, Stitch'' (1876). The right side of the painting originally depicted two of the sailor's grandchildren, who were modelled by John and Alice Millais, two of Millais' own children. They were shown looking at a globe of the world. But after Millais completed the painting, he became unhappy with the figures of the children, thinking that they distracted the eye from the main figure. He cut out this section of the painting and replaced it with a screen, over which British naval flags are hung.&lt;ref name = "guille"&gt;Millais, John Guille, ''The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', 1898, pp. 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart depicted in the painting is of the northern coast of Canada, as mapped during the [[Robert McClure]] expeditions of 1848-53. It was designed by [[Edward Augustus Inglefield]] and printed in 1854.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; Millais may have intended to suggest that the old man was a veteran of one of McClure's expeditions. The painting in the background depicting an ice-trapped ship (partly hidden by the flag) resembles images of McClure's ship [[HMS Investigator (1848)|HMS ''Investigator'']], which was abandoned by McClure and his crew in 1853 after three years of being trapped.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; 

When he saw the painting at the Royal Academy exhibition, Trelawny, who was teetotal, was outraged by the fact that Millais had included a glass of [[grog]] and a lemon. According to Millais' son [[John Guille Millais]], he complained to his friends in the Albany Club that "that fellow Millais has handed me down to posterity with a glass of rum-and-water in one hand and a lemon in the other". However, he eventually decided that Millais' Scottish wife Effie was probably to blame because "the Scotch are a nation of sots".&lt;ref name = "guille2"&gt;Millais, John Guille, ''The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', 1898, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and provenance==
The painting was first shown at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1874, at which it was highly praised by the art critics of the day.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; It was then shown at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1876. The painting was acquired by [[Henry Bolckow]] of Marton Hall, Middlesbrough for £4,930, from whose estate it was later bought by [[Henry Tate]] in 1888, who subsequently donated it to the National Gallery of British Art he had founded, later named after him as the [[Tate Gallery]].&lt;ref name = "guille"/&gt; When Tate bought the painting for 4,000 guineas there was apparently a "huge cheer" because it meant that it would form part of the national collection which Tate was planning.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Charles Robinson Carter, ''Let Me Tell You'', Hutchinson &amp; Company, 1940, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Heartbreak House, act 2 (Shotover &amp; Ellie).jpg|thumb|Albert Perry as Shotover and Elizabeth Risdon as Ellie Dunn in the original 1920 production of ''Heartbreak House'']]
The painting was hugely successful at the time, and was very widely circulated in reproductions. Millais' son says he once saw a reproduction in "the hut of a Hottentot shepherd" in South Africa.&lt;ref name = "guille"/&gt; Along with Millais' earlier painting ''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' it came to symbolise Britain's self-image as a nation of heroic explorers and empire-builders.&lt;ref name = nar/&gt; Millais received a letter from the explorer Sir George Nares in which he said that the painting had had a powerful effect on the spirit of the nation.&lt;ref name = "guille"/&gt; 

The painting was quickly referenced in cartoons. In October 1874 ''[[Punch, or the London Charivari|Punch]]'' published a pastiche by [[John Tenniel]] portraying Disraeli as the old sailor and Britannia in the position of his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Tenniel, John, engraved by [[Joseph Swain (engraver)|Joseph Swain]], ''Punch, or the London Charivari'', December 5, 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1915 cartoon by [[Joseph Morewood Staniforth]] entitled "The Dardanelles Passage" was captioned "it might be done and England and France can do it", referring to the [[Gallipoli campaign]], which was then just beginning. [[John Bull]] and [[Marianne]] replaced the old sailor and his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Dardanelles Passage", ''Western Mail'', 27 February 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] was inspired by the doleful imagery of failure and frustration in the work when he came to write his play ''[[Heartbreak House]]'', which emphasises the pathos and impotence of its characters. The relationship between the main characters, Captain Shotover and Ellie Dunn, was based on the figures in the painting, and one scene partially reproduces the composition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Bernard Shaw on the London art scene, 1885-1950'', Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In his last completed play, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', Shaw depicts the same scene mimicking Millais' painting.&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Bertolini, ''Shaw and Other Playwrights'', Penn State Press, 1993, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Twofold movement''''' (in Hungarian: '''''Kétféle mozgás''''') is a work of art by Hungarian artist [[Ilona Keserü Ilona]] from 1980 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063625/HU_280_002.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Its dimensions are 210 x 200&amp;nbsp;cm. This experimental work consists of two parts. The upper part contains strips of raw textiles stacked wave sewn on canvas painted with white oil paints. The lower part is oil painting on canvas, the surface is occupied by abstract black ink.  
The picture is part of the collection of the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mng.hu/kepkereso/440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The work interfaces between two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality. Since the late 1960s the artist conducted experiments to look for new ideas. Often uses textiles to emphasize spatial nature of its work. The contrast between the use of textiles and abstract expressionism emphasizes the opposition of male and female means of expression in art

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">An '''umbrella title''' is a formal or informal name connecting a number of individual items with a common theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/~okerson/yea/yeaappendC.pdf Description of Metadata Elements in the Yale Electric Library Archive (glossary)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often used in lieu of listing separately the separate components or providing a convenient "label" for a collection of [[discipline]]s.

==Uses of umbrella titles==
===Academia===
Nonspecific fields of study are identified by umbrella titles such as "[[physics]]", "[[physical education]]", and "[[medicine]]", to distinguish them from specialized fields of study such as [[exercise physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.css.edu/tboone2/asep/julyasep.html Glossary from American Society of Exercise Physiologists newsletter, July 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific conferences and discussions===
Many [[scientific conference|scientific]] and [[academic conference]]s use umbrella titles as unifying themes for the activities scheduled in the course of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/cme/cmea/glossary.html Glossary from American Academy of Family Physicians]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Umbrella titles in common use involve either general job descriptions of a group of workers with similar responsibilities (like "teacher")&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=%22Umbrella+title%22+definition&amp;fr=slv8-msgr&amp;u=www.dps109.org/File.asp%3FID%3D1027%26ws%3D&amp;w=%22umbrella+title%22+definition&amp;d=SsirS_mdOeij&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us Collective Bargaining Agreement between Board of Education Deerfield District #109 and Deerfield Education Association, IEA-NEA]&lt;/ref&gt; or rank (military or nonmilitary).

===Politics and law===
Collections of organizations with a common legal or legislative interest are often "united" under an umbrella title for the purposes of [[lobbying]] or participating in a [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/blog/2006/09/global-warming-in-supreme-court.asp "Global Warming in the Supreme Court"] - Sierra Club article mentioning umbrella groups (and an umbrella title) in lawsuit&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment and literature===
Umbrella titles are widely used in music, literature, television, and theater. Uses of umbrella titles vary widely in the arts, to a much greater spectrum of use than in other fields of study.

====Music and dance====
Umbrella titles are used to demarcate the music field into general trends or styles: [[classical music]], [[jazz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/fac/media/danilo.pdf University of Massachusetts program for Danelo Pérez concert] - includes history and terminology of jazz&lt;/ref&gt; [[rock music]], [[hip hop]], [[rhythm and blues]] and other labels which each cover more specialized musical styles. A similar "structure" can be found in the field of dance.

Prior to the sale of the [[long playing record]] in 1950, albums containing several 78 revolutions-per-minute records were often sold under umbrella titles (a collection of recordings from ''[[Oklahoma (musical)|Oklahoma]]'', for example).  It can be argued that titles of all long-playing records and [[compact disc]]s are "umbrella" titles—and several such recordings with a common theme often have an umbrella title (such as [[Chip Davis]]' "[[Mannheim Steamroller|Day Parts]]" series) as well.

====Television====
While it can be argued that every title of a televised series, especially those primarily used to designate a time period rather than actual programming (like ''NBC Monday Night at the Movies'') is an umbrella, the term is more appropriately applied to names of [[anthology series]], series that combine together to provide a common theme (such as the three components of ''[[90 Bristol Court]]''), [[wheel series]], and other series under a common heading (such as ''[[Crimetime After Primetime]]'' and ''[[Four in One]]'').

While it was common practice in the 1950s and early 1960s for series to alternate or otherwise share a time slot in [[United States|American]] broadcast network television (for example, ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]'' shared a time slot with, first ''[[Private Secretary (TV series)|Private Secretary]]'' and then ''[[The George Gobel Show]]''), umbrella titles were not used by United States' networks until 1964, when [[NBC]] presented three half-hour programs on Monday nights as a programming block centered at a southern California apartment complex, ''90 Bristol Court''.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-345-45542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''TV Guide Guide to TV 2006'' (2006) {{ISBN|0-7607-7572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 1964 programming experiment did not succeed (two of the series were cancelled; the third lasted the broadcast season but was not renewed for the 1965-1966 season), NBC was not dissuaded from further programming experimentation. Within a decade, the network then experimented with wheel series, first with ''Four in One'' and ''[[The Bold Ones]]'', then with ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''.  Afterwards additional wheel series were presented by American broadcast networks, to varying degrees of success. The expirement was revived in 1979 with ''[[Cliffhangers (TV series)|Cliffhangers]]''.

In the United Kingdom, umbrella titles were used in varying degrees in their programming as well. The long-running ''[[Doctor Who]]'' used umbrella titles on several levels, first with individual named episodes under the umbrella of the title of an overall story (the first four episodes were commonly called "An Unearthly Child" even though none of them actually showed it to be the title of the story); even after the naming of individual episodes ceased, umbrella titles were often used to collect [[story arc|stories with a common enemy or theme]] ([[Dalek]]s stories, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] stories, [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] stories, and season-long "Key to Time" and "[[The Trial of a Time Lord|Trial of a Time Lord]]").

====Motion pictures and literature====
The use of umbrella titles in motion pictures parallels their use in literature. Movie trilogies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' and the ''[[Three Colors]]'' trilogy (''a.k.a.'' "Red, White, and Blue trilogy") commonly are called by umbrella titles, as was the case for their literary cousins (such as [[John Dos Passos]]' ''[[USA trilogy|U.S.A.]]'').  Umbrella titles were often used to cover longer sequences of motion pictures or novels (such as the [[James Bond]] and ''[[Star Wars]]'' films and [[Marcel Proust]]'s multi-volume ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''). Often umbrella titles are used to collect motion pictures with common stars ("[[Marx Brothers]] movies") or common characters ("[[Dirty Harry]] movies"), as is the case for novels or comics ("[[Perry Mason]] novels", for example). In literature, sometimes an umbrella title is used for a collection of stories with a common locality, such as the [[Wessex]] novels of [[Thomas Hardy]].

He was one of ''Mad''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s founding cartoonists in 1952. Although much of his early professional artwork is signed '''Wallace Wood''', he became known as '''Wally Wood''', a name he claimed to dislike.&lt;ref name=grain&gt;{{cite book|last = Stewart|first = Bhob, ed.|authorlink = Bhob Stewart|title = Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages = |isbn = 978-1893905283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the comics community, he was also known as '''Woody''', a name he sometimes used as a signature.

In addition to Wood's hundreds of comic book pages, he illustrated for books and magazines while also working in a variety of other areas – advertising; [[packaging]] and product illustrations; [[joke|gag]] [[cartoons]]; [[LP (format)|record album]] covers; [[posters]]; [[print syndication|syndicated]] [[comic strip]]s; and [[trading cards]], including work on [[Topps]]' landmark ''[[Mars Attacks]]'' set. &lt;!--worded last phrase in manner to address the commented-out concerns, by attempting to acknowledge this key assignment without suggesting he was the only artist involved. This Wiki article details his Mars Attacks involvement in the section "1950s and the Silver Age" --&gt;

EC publisher [[William Gaines]] once stated, "Wally may have been our most troubled artist... I'm not suggesting any connection, but he may have been our most brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Evanier|first = Mark|authorlink = Mark Evanier|title = Mad Art : A Visual Celebration of the Art of Mad Magazine and the Idiots Who Create It|publisher = Watson-Guptill Publications|year = 2002|page = 47|isbn = 978-0823030804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the inaugural inductee into the comic book industry's [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and was inducted into the [[The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 1992.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Wally Wood was born in [[Menahga, Minnesota]], and he began reading and drawing comics at an early age. He was strongly influenced by the art styles of [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', [[Milton Caniff]]'s ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[The Spirit]]'' and especially [[Roy Crane]]'s ''[[Wash Tubbs]]''. Recalling his childhood, Wood said that his dream at age six, about finding a magic pencil that could draw anything, foretold his future as an artist.&lt;ref name=grain/&gt;
Wood graduated from high school in 1944, signed on with the [[United States Merchant Marine]] at the close of [[World War II]] and enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]] in 1946. He went from training at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to [[Occupation of Japan|occupied Japan]], where he was assigned to the island of [[Hokkaidō]].

In 1947, at age 20, Wood enrolled in the [[Minneapolis School of Art]] but only lasted one term.&lt;ref name="McLauchlin" /&gt; Arriving in New York City with his brother Glenn and mother Alma (of [[Finnish Americans|Finnish]]&lt;ref&gt;David Saunders: [http://www.pulpartists.com/Wood.html WALLY WOOD]&lt;/ref&gt; descent), after his military discharge in July 1948, Wood found employment at [[Bickford's (restaurant)|Bickford's]] restaurant as a busboy. During his time off he carried his thick portfolio of drawings all over midtown Manhattan, visiting every publisher he could find. He briefly attended the [[Hogarth School of Art]] but dropped out after one semester.

By October, after being rejected by every company he visited, Wood met fellow artist [[John Severin]] in the waiting room of a small publisher. After the two shared their experiences attempting to find work, Severin invited Wood to visit his studio, the Charles William Harvey Studio, where Wood met Charlie Stern, [[Harvey Kurtzman]] (who was working for Timely/Marvel) and [[Will Elder]]. At this studio Wood learned that Will Eisner was looking for a ''Spirit'' background artist. He immediately visited Eisner and was hired on the spot.

Over the next year, Wood also became an assistant to [[George Wunder]], who had taken over the Milton Caniff strip ''Terry and the Pirates''. Wood cited his "first job on my own" as ''Chief Ob-stacle'', a continuing series of strips for a 1949 political newsletter. He entered the comic book field by [[letterer|lettering]], as he recalled in 1981: "The first professional job was lettering for [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox]] [[Romance comics in the United States (1946–1975)|romance comics]] in 1948. This lasted about a year. I also started doing backgrounds, then [[inker|inking]]. Most of it was the romance stuff. For complete pages, it was $5 a page... Twice a week, I would ink ten pages in one day".&lt;ref&gt;Wally Wood interview, originally published in ''The Buyer's Guide'' No. 403 (August 1, 1981), reprinted in ''Comic Book Artist'' No. 14 (July 2001); p. 18 of the latter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists' representative Renaldo Epworth helped Wood land his early comic-book assignments, making it unclear if that connection led to Wood's lettering or to his comics-art debut, the ten-page story "The Tip Off Woman" [sic] in the [[Fox Comics]] [[Western comics|Western]] ''Women Outlaws'' No. 4 (cover-dated January 1949, on sale late 1948). Wood's next known comic-book art did not appear until Fox's ''My Confession'' No. 7 (August 1949), at which time he began working almost continuously on the company's similar ''My Experience'', ''My Secret Life'', ''My Love Story'' and ''My True Love: Thrilling Confession Stories''. His first signed work is believed to be in ''My Confession'' #8 (October 1949), with the name "Woody" half-hidden on a theater [[marquee (sign)|marquee]]. He penciled and inked two stories in that issue: "I Was Unwanted" (nine pages) and "My Tarnished Reputation" (ten pages).

Wood began at EC co-penciling and co-inking with [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] the story "Too Busy For Love" (''Modern Love'' #5), and fully penciling the lead story, "I Was Just a Playtime Cowgirl", in ''Saddle Romances'' No. 11 (April 1950), inked by Harrison.&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search= Wallace+Wood|title= Wallace Wood}} and {{gcdb|type=credit|search= Wally+Wood|title= Wally Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
Working from a Manhattan studio at West 64th Street and Columbus Avenue, Wood began to attract attention in 1950 with his  science-fiction artwork for EC and [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Comics]], some in collaboration with [[Joe Orlando]]. During this period, he drew in a wide variety of subjects and genres, including adventure, romance, war and [[horror fiction|horror]]; message stories (for EC's ''[[Shock SuspenStories]]''); and eventually [[satire|satirical]] humor for writer/editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' including a satire of the [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|lawsuit]] [[Superman]]'s publisher [[DC Comics|DC]] filed against [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s publisher [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] called "[[Superduperman!]]" battling Captain Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|chapter= The Comics Code Crunch|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company|Bulfinch Press]]|year = 1995|location= New York, New York|page = 115|isbn = 0821220764|quote= In the fourth issue [of ''Mad''] (April–May 1953), writer Harvey Kurtzman and artist Wallace Wood make light of the lawsuit between Superman and Captain Marvel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood was instrumental in convincing EC publisher [[William Gaines]] to start a line of science fiction comics, ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' and ''[[Weird Fantasy]]'' (later combined under the single title ''[[Weird Science-Fantasy]]'').  Wood penciled and inked several dozen EC science fiction stories. Wood also had frequent entries in ''[[Two-Fisted Tales]]'' and ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', as well as the later EC titles ''[[Valor (EC Comics)|Valor]]'', ''[[Piracy (comics)|Piracy]]'', and ''[[Aces High (comics)|Aces High]]''.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

Working over scripts and pencil breakdowns by [[Jules Feiffer]], the 25-year-old Wood drew two months of [[Will Eisner]]'s  Sunday-supplement newspaper comic book ''The Spirit'', on the 1952 story arc "The Spirit in Outer Space". Eisner, Wood recalled, paid him "about $30 a week for lettering and backgrounds on ''The Spirit''. Sometimes he paid $40 when I did the drawings, too".&lt;ref&gt;Wood interview, ''Comic Book Artist'' No. 14, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:WallyWoodBookCovers.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Books illustrated by Wood]]
Feiffer, in 2010, recalled Wood's studio, "which was at that time in the very slummy [[Upper West Side]] [of Manhattan] in the [West] 60s, years before it was [the] Lincoln Center [area]. It was a cartoonist and science-fiction writers' ghetto – just a huge room where the walls were knocked down, dark, smelly, roach-infested, and all these cartoonists and writers bent over their tables. One was [science-fiction writer] [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]."&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of March 24, 2010, Feiffer interview at the [[Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art]], published as [http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=705%3Ajules-feiffer-qa&amp;catid=31%3Ageneral&amp;limitstart=1 "Backing into Jules Feiffer: An Exclusive Q&amp;A"], p.2, FilmFestivalTraveler.com, April 18, 2010. [https://www.webcitation.org/5xJCSCeRD?url=http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=705%3Ajules-feiffer-qa&amp;catid=31%3Ageneral WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1957 and 1967, Wood produced both covers and interiors for more than 60 issues of the science-fiction digest ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', illustrating such authors as [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Jack Finney]], [[Cyril M. Kornbluth|C.M. Kornbluth]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Robert Silverberg]], [[Robert Sheckley]], [[Clifford D. Simak]] and [[Jack Vance]]. He painted six covers for ''Galaxy Science Fiction Novels'' between 1952 and 1958. His gag cartoons appeared in the [[Men's adventure|men's magazines]] ''Dude'', ''Gent'' and ''Nugget''. He [[inker|inked]] the first eight months of the 1958–1961 syndicated comic strip ''[[Sky Masters of the Space Force]]'', penciled by [[Jack Kirby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Evanier|first= Mark|title= [[Kirby: King of Comics]]|publisher= [[Abrams Books]]|year= 2008|location= New York, New York|page= 106|isbn= 978-0810994478|quote= The artwork was exquisite, in no small part because Dave Wood had the idea to hire Wally Wood (no relation) to handle the inking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood expanded into book illustrations, including for the picture-cover editions (though not the dust-jacket editions) of titles in the 1959 Aladdin Books reissues of Bobbs Merrill's 1947 "Childhood of Famous Americans" series.&lt;ref&gt;Guthridge, Sue. ''Tom Edison, Boy Inventor''. Illustrated by Wood. New York : Aladdin Books ; London : Collier Macmillan, 1986, c1959&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marvel during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Wood's work as penciler-inker of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #5–8 and inker over Bob Powell of issues #9-11 established the title character's distinctive red costume (in issue #7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|chapter= The Marvel Age (1961–1970)|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = Abrams Books|year = 1991|page = 120|isbn = 9780810938212|quote= The complicated red-and-yellow costume that [Bill] Everett created for the original ''Daredevil'' cover was changed by artist Wally Wood to simpler red tights.

Wood penciled and inked the first four 10-page installments of the company's "[[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]]" feature in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #1–4 (Aug. 1970-Feb. 1971),&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 146: "Marvel's second split book of 1970 gave two longtime Marvel stars their own series.

He inked Kirby on the covers of ''Avengers'' #20–21 and ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #14. The Grand Comics Database also cites "additional inks... uncredited" on the Kirby layouts and [[George Tuska]] pencil and ink work of the "Captain America" feature in ''Tales of Suspense'' #71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In circles concerned with [[copyright]] and intellectual property issues, Wood is known as the artist of the unsigned [[satire|satirical]] [[The Disneyland Memorial Orgy|Disneyland Memorial Orgy]] poster, which first appeared in [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krassner, Paul, and Wally Wood [http://www.ep.tc/realist/74/12.html "The Disneyland Memorial Orgy"], ''The Realist'' Archive Project: ''The Realist'' #74, May 1967, pp. 12–13.

[https://www.webcitation.org/5w3YRPdN4?url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/74/24.html WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; The poster depicts a number of [[copyrighted]] [[Disney]] characters in various unsavory activities (including sex acts and drug use), with huge dollar signs radiating from [[Cinderella's Castle]]. Wood himself, as late as 1981, when asked who did that drawing, said only, "I'd rather not say anything about that! It was the most pirated drawing in history! Everyone was printing copies of that. I understand some people got busted for selling it. I always thought Disney stuff was pretty sexy... [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;''Comic Book Artist'' No. 14, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or ''The Realist'' but did sue a publisher of a "[[blacklight]]" version of the poster, who used the image without Krassner's permission. The case was settled out of court.

At DC Comics, he and [[Jim Shooter]] launched the ''[[Captain Action]]'' comic book series in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 131 |quote= Writer Jim Shooter and artist Wally Wood helmed November [1968]'s ''Captain Action'' #1, based on Ideal's popular action figure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wood briefly served as inker of the ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Silver Age 1956–1970|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= [[Taschen]]|year=2010|location= Cologne, Germany|ISBN= 9783836519816|page= 325|quote= In 1969, ''Superboy''...swerved radically from the complacent Super-house style once writer Frank Robbins came aboard...Overnight the comic was reinvented with realistic teen angst, natural dialogue, and a sex appeal that was only aided by the inks of good-girl artist Wally Wood.

===Publisher===
In 1966, Wood launched the independent magazine ''[[witzend]]'' (originally to be titled ''et cetera'', a name which had to be withdrawn when Wood was told another magazine had already used this) one of the first [[alternative comics]], a decade before [[Mike Friedrich]]'s ''[[Star Reach]]'' or [[Flo Steinberg]]'s ''[[Big Apple Comix]]'' for which Wood drew the cover and contributed a story. Wood offered his fellow professionals the opportunity to contribute illustrations and graphic stories that detoured from the usual conventions of the comics industry. After the fourth issue, Wood turned ''witzend'' over to [[Bill Pearson (American writer)|Bill Pearson]], who continued as editor and publisher through the 1970s and into the 1980s.
Wood additionally collected his feature ''[[Sally Forth (Wally Wood)|Sally Forth]]'', published in the U.S. servicemen's periodicals ''Military News'' and ''[[Overseas Weekly]]'' in 1968–1974, in a series of four oversize (10"x12") magazines. Pearson, in 1993–95, reformatted the strips into a series of comics published by [[Eros Comix]], an imprint of [[Fantagraphics Books]], which in 1998 collected the entire run into a single 160-page volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.toonopedia.com/sallyf-1.htm|title= Sally Forth|first= Don|last= Markstein|year= 2007|publisher= Don Markstein's Toonopedia|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QVojvPxN?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/sallyf-1.htm|archivedate= June 22, 2014|deadurl= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Wood created another independent comic, ''[[Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon]]'', intended for his "Sally Forth" military readership as indicated in the ads and indicia. Artists [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Ralph Reese]] and writer [[Ron Whyte]] are credited with primary writer-artist Wood on three features: "Cannon", "The Misfits",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/misfitsww.htm Wally Wood's "Misfits"] at An International Catalogue of Superheroes.[https://www.webcitation.org/5xpKTuaW5?url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/misfitsww.htm WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; and "Dragonella". A second magazine-format issue was published in 1976 by Wood and [[CPL Gang Publications]]. [[Larry Hama]], one of Wood's assistants, said, "I did script about three ''Sally Forth'' stories and a few of the ''Cannon'''s. I wrote the main ''Sally Forth'' story in the first reprint book, which is actually dedicated to me, mostly because I lent Woody the money to publish it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://joeguide.com/hama/artist.shtml JoeGuide.com: "Larry Hama: Writer &amp; Artist"], no date.

In 1980 and 1981, Wood did two issues of a completely pornographic comic book, titled ''Gang Bang''. It featured two sexually explicit ''Sally Forth'' stories, and sexually explicit versions of [[Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', titled ''So White and the Six Dorks''; ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and The Pirates]]'', titled ''Perry and the Privates''; ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', titled ''Prince Violate''; ''[[Superman]]'' and ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', titled ''Stuporman Meets Blunder Woman''; ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', titled ''Flasher Gordon''; and ''[[Tarzan]]'' titled ''Starzan''. A third volume, published in 1983, contained three more sexually explicit parodies of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', titled ''Malice in Blunderland''; a second Flash Gordon sendup titled ''Flesh Fucker Meets Women's Lib!''; and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', titled ''The Blizzard of Ooze''.

=== "Panels That Always Work" ===
Wood struggled to be as efficient as possible in the often low-paying comics industry.&lt;ref name="Evanier"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsfromme.com/2010/07/02/todays-video-link-158/|title= Today's Video Link|first= Mark|last= Evanier|date= July 2, 2010 |publisher= News From ME|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140625004310/http://www.newsfromme.com/2010/07/02/todays-video-link-158/|archivedate=June 25, 2014 |deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time he created a series of layout techniques sketched on pieces of paper which he taped up near his drawing table. These "visual notes," collected on three pages,&lt;ref name="Hama" /&gt; reminded Wood (and select assistants he showed the pages to)&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; of various layouts and compositional techniques to keep his pages dynamic and interesting.&lt;ref name="Evanier" /&gt; (In the same vein, Wood also taped up another note to himself: "Never draw anything you can copy, never copy anything you can trace, never trace anything you can cut out and paste up.")&lt;ref name="Hama"&gt;Hama, quoted in Johnson, Joel.

(It was subtitled, "Or some interesting ways to get some variety into those boring panels where some dumb writer has a bunch of lame characters sitting around and talking for page after page!") Hama left out two of the original 24 panels as his photocopies were too faint to make out some of the lightest sketches.&lt;ref name="1980 Crouch Sketchbook"/&gt; Hama distributed Wood's "elegantly simple primer to basic storytelling"&lt;ref name="Heidi"&gt;McDonald, Heidi.

a creation using the motif of one of them, depicting Daredevil and Wood himself, in Wally Wood style – and the Wally Wood Estate's official print of the panels.

===Personal life and final years===
Wood was married three times. His first marriage was to artist [[Tatjana Wood]], who later did extensive work as a comic-book [[colorist]]. Their marriage ended in the late 1960s. His second marriage, to Marilyn Silver, also ended in divorce.&lt;ref name="McLauchlin"&gt;{{cite journal|last= McLauchlin|first= Jim|title= Tragic Genius: Wally Wood|journal= [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]|issue= 228|pages = |date = July 2010|url= http://heroinitiative.blogspot.com/2010/06/tragic-genius-wally-wood.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232423/http://heroinitiative.blogspot.com/2010/06/tragic-genius-wally-wood.html|archivedate= December 30, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of his adult life, Wood suffered from chronic, unexplainable headaches. In the 1970s, following bouts with [[alcoholism]], Wood suffered from [[kidney failure]]. A stroke in 1978 caused a loss of [[Visual perception|vision]] in one eye. Faced with declining health and career prospects, he committed suicide by gunshot in Los Angeles on 
November 2, 1981.&lt;ref name=Lambiek/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLauchlin"/&gt; Toward the end of his life, an embittered Wood would say, according to one biography, "If I had it all to do over again, I'd cut off my hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Against the Grain: MAD Artist Wallace Wood|first=Bhob, ed.&lt;!--sp POK--&gt; | last=Stewart|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing| year=2003|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|isbn=978-1-893905-23-8|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=D3Up5Fqyc6MC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=“If+I+had+it+all+to+do+over+again,+I’d+cut+off+my+hands.”&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QkstDtD7l_&amp;sig=7P80aTdolEk6y0ejxTH-naT6Yzk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hBOoTs_CM6Hf0QHQ1tmBDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=“If%20I%20had%20it%20all%20to%20do%20over%20again%2C%20I’d%20cut%20off%20my%20hands.”&amp;f=false 321]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[EC Comics|EC]] editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]], who worked closely with Wood during the 1950s, said:
{{blockquote|Wally had a tension in him, an intensity that he locked away in an internal steam boiler. I think it ate away his insides, and the work really used him up. I think he delivered some of the finest work that was ever drawn, and I think it's to his credit that he put so much intensity into his work at great sacrifice to himself.&lt;ref&gt;''EC Lives! The 1972 EC Fan-Addict Convention Book'' (privately published)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Biographies, criticism, collections===
In 2017 and 2018, [[Fantagraphics Books]] published ''The Life and Legend of Wallace Wood'' a set of two hardcover books ({{ISBN|978-1-60699-815-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-68396-068-3}}), mainly compiled by his former assistant [[Bhob Stewart]] over a 30-year period that featured personal recollections of Wood's friends, colleagues, and assistants, including [[John Severin]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Paul Krassner]], [[Trina Robbins]], [[Larry Hama]], and [[Paul Levitz]]; previously unpublished artwork and photographs; and a detailed examination of his life and career. It was Stewart's last publishing project, but he did not live to see it in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/report-to-readers-the-life-and-legend-of-wallace-wood-volume-2/ |title=Report to Readers: The Life and Legend of Wallace Wood Volume 2 |publisher=The Comics Journal |date=2018-03-19 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi.

This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).

'''William Edward (Bill) deGarthe''' (1907&amp;ndash;1983) was a Finnish-born painter and sculptor who lived for much of his life in [[Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia]].

==Early life==
William deGarthe (1907&amp;ndash;1983) was born Birger Edward Degerstedt in [[Kaskinen]], also known as Kaskö (Swedish), a remote island town off the northwest coast of [[Finland]].  He was the son of Edward Degerstedt, a Swedish-speaking school principal and artist. The third-oldest in a family of five brothers, deGarthe was competitive and athletic but demonstrated an early aptitude for art. After graduating from high school with his strongest marks in art and drawing, deGarthe studied art in [[Helsinki]] while awaiting his call-up for active duty in the Finnish military.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release from service, deGarthe obtained his passport – declaring his profession as "artist"—and emigrated to Canada in the fall of 1926. Landing in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], he boarded a train for [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] intending to join other expatriate Scandinavians in the northern [[Ontario]] forestry trade.  The work was hard and the climate unforgiving; after only two months he left the woods bound for [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]].  Virtually penniless, he made his way to a mission where he showed the supervisor some of his drawings.  Impressed with the work and with the 19-year-old's determination, the man introduced deGarthe to a local publisher who hired him as an illustrator in January 1927 at a rate of $7 a week.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, D.  (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot&lt;/ref&gt;

It was around this time that the young artist changed his name from the Scandinavian ''Degerstedt'' to the French-sounding ''deGarthe''. While continuing his work as a commercial artist, deGarthe continued his formal art studies in Montreal at the [[Montreal|Museum of Fine Art]] under [[Edmond Dyonnet]]  but the restless young man was still seeking something more. Declaring he was on a quest to find "the most beautiful spot on earth", in 1930 deGarthe quit his job in Montreal with the goal of sailing to [[Brazil]] to join an aunt there.  He travelled by rail to Halifax to board a ship bound for [[South America]] but on disembarking he was struck by the similarity between [[Nova Scotia]] and the rugged seacoast of his native Finland. He later declared, "I didn't have to travel any farther."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, D.  (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot. Page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Soon after his arrival in Nova Scotia, deGarthe was introduced to Frank Wallace, a prominent Halifax marketing executive who immediately offered him a job as a commercial illustrator. deGarthe would continue to work for Wallace Advertising for the next 15 years before launching his own advertising company, deGarthe Advertising Art, in 1945; however, it was the onset of [[World War II]] that rekindled his passion for fine art.

Biographer Douglas Pope recounts that when the Soviet Red Army invaded Finland in November 1939&lt;ref&gt;Alex, D. (2014). Winter war: Soviet Invasion of Finland timeline. In http://www.secondworldwarhistory.com/winter-war-soviet-invasion-of-finland.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220095303/http://www.secondworldwarhistory.com/winter-war-soviet-invasion-of-finland.asp# |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deGarthe was determined to return to his homeland to fight. With his four other sons already enlisted, Edward Degerstedt begged his middle child to stay in Canada.  Inspired by the work of [[Alex Colville]] and other prominent Canadian war artists, deGarthe resolved to use his art to inspire others. Around 1940 he began painting under the tutelage of [[Leonard Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope, D.  (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years deGarthe would study oil painting under [[Stanley Royle]] at [[Mount Allison University]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]]. deGarthe later studied [[marine painting]] in Rockport, Massachusetts under Stanley Woodward, followed by [[Emile Gruppe]] in East Gloucester, Massachusetts and George Groz at the Art Students League in [[New York City]]. He also spent many winters studying in [[Europe]] at the [[Academie de la Grand Chaumiere]] in [[Paris]] as well as [[Académie Julian]] in Paris and the Accademie di Belle Arti in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Ask Art Artists' Bluebook at http://www.askart.com/askart/d/william_edward_de_garthe/william_edward_de_garthe.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career de Garthe worked in many mediums; however he is best known for his atmospheric oil paintings depicting scenes of life on and around the rugged Nova Scotia coast.  He also completed works in charcoal, pen and ink, lithograph and fresco and, in later life, sculpture. Beginning in 1942 deGarthe taught commercial art at the Nova Scotia College of Art, now [[NSCAD University|Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University]] (NSCAD), later teaching younger students at the city's [[YMCA]]s and [[YWCA]]s and at his own studio.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Art Artists' Bluebook at http://www.askart.com/askart/d/william_edward_de_garthe/william_edward_de_garthe.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

deGarthe became a prominent member of the Nova Scotia arts community and a strong promoter of the province's artistic tradition. In the early forties he joined a lively "round table" of Halifax's most influential artists including gallery owners Marguerite and LeRoy Zwicker, prominent editorial cartoonist [[Bob Chambers (cartoonist)|Robert Chambers]], photographer Robert Norwood and war artist Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, D.  (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career deGarthe created a number of important works in oils, notable among them ''Looking for the Mothership'', an evocative 1955 painting depicting a dory carrying a lone fisherman, searching for his lost home schooner. The same year, the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts, now the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]], acquired its first deGarthe painting, ''Out of the Hurricane''.   In 1963, deGarthe created two large murals for St. John's Anglican Church in Peggy's Cove.  The canvasses, 136 x 210&amp;nbsp;cm, depict a fishing boat on stormy seas with four fishers appearing to reach out to a figure of Christ on the water, surrounded by 12 gulls.

In 1970, deGarthe created what he considered to be his finest painting, ''Out of the Mist'', a work Pope called a "simplified, condensed and more charged version of earlier themes", depicting a schooner in full sail emerging from the fog, seeming "to owe its existence to two worlds, the seen and the unseen, the world of fact and the world of fancy." &lt;ref&gt;Pope, D.  (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot. Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; deGarthe refused to sell the painting and it remains on display in his Peggy's Cove gallery.

In 1958, deGarthe exhibited 138 works at the Halifax Memorial Library in a show sponsored by the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts, now the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]]. In 1959 over 100 of his paintings were exhibited at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] in Montreal. His painting "Approaching Storm" was voted most popular at the 1959 Maritime Art Exhibition at the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]] in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. His work was also shown in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Florida]] and [[Barbados]].&lt;ref&gt;Ask Art Artists' Bluebook at http://www.askart.com/askart/d/william_edward_de_garthe/william_edward_de_garthe.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

deGarthe's work became popular among individual and corporate collectors; he sold his first painting to the [[Imperial Bank of Canada]], now the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]], in 1949. In 1951, [[Nova Scotia Light and Power]] Company, Limited (NSLP) commissioned deGarthe to paint a Nova Scotia seascape for the cover of its annual report. Pleased with the result, the artist and company would continue their relationship for another two decades. In all, deGarthe created 21 paintings for NSLP. Most depicted scenes of the Atlantic coast, including fishers at work and sailing vessels, but a series of four covers from 1953 to 1956 featured scenes of [[Halifax Harbour]]. Beginning in 1959, NSLP produced fine art prints of deGarthe's work which it made available at no cost upon request. For many years, framed copies of deGarthe's paintings for NSLP were a common sight in Nova Scotia homes and offices.&lt;ref&gt;Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited. Annual Reports (1951-1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

deGarthe authored and illustrated three books: This is ''Peggy's Cove Nova Scotia'' (1956), ''Painting the Sea'' (1969), and ''The Story of the Herring Gull: Larus Argentatus'' (1977).

==Sculpture==
[[File:William deGarthe's Fishermen's Monument.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fishermen's Monument at Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada by William Edward deGarthe. Carved on-site from granite in-situ. (detail)]]
In 1962, deGarthe wintered in Florida where he studied sculpture under the direction of Leslie Thomas Posey (1900-?) at the [[Longboat Key Center for the Arts]]. He later studied sculpting in marble at [[Pietrasanta]] in [[Tuscany]].

In the late 1970s, deGarthe began a ten-year project to sculpt a "lasting monument to Nova Scotia fishermen" on a 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) granite outcropping  behind his Peggy's Cove Home. In 1976 deGarthe invited one of his students, J. Rene Barrette (Lt. Col. Retd) to help him with the sculpture. They worked together for 5 years. The project was about 80-per cent complete when the artist died in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Nova Scotia Archives: https://novascotia.ca/archives/virtual/degarthe/default.asp?Language=English&lt;/ref&gt;

With deGarthe's approval, Rene Barrette documented their progress on the sculpture in journals that were printed and sold to tourists who gathered around to watch the two artists at work.

The work depicts thirty-two fishermen and their wives and children enveloped by the wings of the guardian angel St. Elmo. It also features the image of Peggy, a legendary late-18th century shipwreck survivor deGarthe believed gave her name to the village. deGarthe bequeathed the sculpture to the province of Nova Scotia and it can be viewed in a park located behind his former home.&lt;ref&gt;St. Margaret's Bay Regional Tourism Development Association: http://www.peggyscoveregion.com/peggys-cove-area-things-to-do-visit-degarthe-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

==deGarthe gallery==
deGarthe's Peggy's Cove home has been transformed into The William E. deGarthe Gallery where 65 of his paintings and sculptures are on permanent exhibition. It is open from May 1 until October 31 each year. The gallery is part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] network. Although none of the works at the gallery is for sale, the North Shore Historic Art Gallery in nearby [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] carries deGarthe's work.

A permanent display of deGarthe painting is exhibited at the Nova Scotia Archives in Halifax.  His works are also in the collection of the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and the [[Barbados Museum]] as well as numerous private collections around the world.
 
==Personal life==
deGarthe became a Canadian citizen in 1934. In 1935 he met weaver and editor Phoebe Agnes Payne (1906-2008) at a house party and within a few months they married.

In 1931 deGarthe visited Peggy's Cove, a rugged and picturesque fishing village near Halifax, for the first time.  Inspired by the community's stark beauty, deGarthe and his wife bought a summer home there in 1948.  He was to visit there frequently to paint and exhibit his work.  In 1955 deGarthe closed his city advertising business and moved to Peggy's Cove permanently. He would remain there for the rest of his life, rebuilding his studio after it was destroyed by [[Hurricane Ginny]] in 1963.

deGarthe and his wife were seasoned travellers, spending winters in the [[Caribbean]] and Florida, and visiting [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Africa]], and the [[Galapagos Islands]] among other places. In 1975, 35 years after he first embarked for Brazil, he finally reached [[Rio de Janeiro]] where the sight of the statue of [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] inspired him to create his own monument in stone in Peggy's Cove.

Health problems in the last years of his life slowed deGarthe's progress on the Fishermen's Monument.  He suffered a heart attack in 1979 and was diagnosed with cancer in 1982.  He died in a Toronto hospital on February 13, 1983. His funeral was held at Peggy's Cove and his ashes interred inside the Fishermen's Monument.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, D.  (1989).
