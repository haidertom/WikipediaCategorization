'''Adversarial machine learning''' is a research field that lies at the intersection of [[machine learning]] and [[computer security]]. It aims to enable the safe adoption of machine learning techniques in adversarial settings, such as [[spam filtering]], [[Malware analysis|malware detection]], and [[Biometrics|biometric recognition]].

==Analysis==
[[Machine learning]] techniques were originally designed for stationary environments in which the training and test data are assumed to be generated from the same (although possibly unknown) distribution. However, In the presence of intelligent and adaptive adversaries this [[working hypothesis]] is likely to be violated to at least some degree (depending on the adversary). In fact, a malicious adversary can carefully manipulate the input data, exploiting specific vulnerabilities of [[Machine learning|learning algorithms]] to compromise the whole system security.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Examples==
Examples include attacks in [[spam filtering]], where spam messages are obfuscated through misspelling of "bad" words or insertion of "good" words,&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_12A"&gt;B. Biggio, G. Fumera, and F. Roli. "[http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/node/671 Multiple classifier systems for robust classifier design in adversarial environments]". International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 1(1):27–41, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_18A"&gt;M. Bruckner, C. Kanzow, and T. Scheffer.

Res., 13:2617–2654, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; attacks in [[computer security]] such as obfuscating malware code within [[network packet]]s or to mislead signature detection, attacks in biometric recognition where fake biometric traits may be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user,&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_44A"&gt;R. N. Rodrigues, L. L. Ling, and V. Govindaraju.

J. Vis. Lang. Comput., 20(3):169–179, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or to compromise users' template galleries that adapt to updated over time.

In 2017, researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[3-D print]]ed a toy turtle with a texture engineered to make Google's object detection [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] classify it as a rifle, no matter the angle the turtle was viewed from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating the turtle required only low-cost commercially available 3-D printing technology.&lt;ref&gt;Athalye, A., &amp; Sutskever, I. (2017). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07397.pdf Synthesizing robust adversarial examples]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.07397.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Google Brain]] published a machine-tweaked image of a dog that looked like a cat both to computers and to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/|accessdate=10 March 2018|work=WIRED|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security evaluation==
[[File:Reactive arms race.jpg|thumb|Conceptual representation of the reactive arms race&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A"&gt;B. Biggio, G. Fumera, and F. Roli. "[http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/node/657 Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack]".

To understand the security properties of learning algorithms in adversarial settings, one should address the following main issues:&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A"&gt;B. Biggio, I. Corona, B. Nelson, B. Rubinstein, D. Maiorca, G. Fumera, G. Giacinto, and F. Roli. "[http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/node/1047 Security evaluation of support vector machines in adversarial environments]". In Y. Ma and G. Guo, editors, Support Vector Machines Applications, pp. 105–153. Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_46A"&gt;B. Biggio, G. Fumera, and F. Roli. "[http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/node/1103 Pattern recognition systems under attack: Design issues and research challenges]". Int'l J. Patt. Recogn. Artif. Intell., 28(7):1460002, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_26A"&gt;L. Huang, A. D. Joseph, B. Nelson, B. Rubinstein, and J. D. Tygar. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.360.168&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Adversarial machine learning]". In 4th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2011), pages 43–57, Chicago, IL, USA, October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* identifying potential vulnerabilities of machine learning algorithms during learning and classification
* devising appropriate attacks that correspond to the identified threats and evaluating their impact on the targeted system
* proposing countermeasures to improve the security of machine learning algorithms against the considered attacks

This process amounts to simulating a proactive arms race (instead of a reactive one, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2), where system designers try to anticipate the adversary in order to understand whether there are potential vulnerabilities that should be fixed in advance; for instance, by means of specific countermeasures such as additional features or different learning algorithms. However proactive approaches are not necessarily superior to reactive ones. For instance, it was shown that under some circumstances, reactive approaches are more suitable for improving system security.&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_3A"&gt;A. Barth, B. I. P. Rubinstein, M. Sundararajan, J. C. Mitchell, D. Song, and P. L. Bartlett. "[http://www.redpel.com/A%20Learning-Based%20Approach%20to%20Reactive%20Security.pdf A learning-based approach to reactive security]. IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing", 9(4):482–493, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks against machine learning algorithms (supervised)==
The first step of the above-sketched arms race is identifying potential attacks against machine learning algorithms. A substantial amount of work has been done in this direction.&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_46A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_2"&gt;M. Barreno, B. Nelson, A. Joseph, and J. Tygar. "[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10994-010-5188-5.pdf The security of machine learning]". Machine Learning, 81:121–148, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===A taxonomy of potential attacks against machine learning===
Attacks against (supervised) machine learning algorithms have been categorized along three primary axes:&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_2" /&gt; their ''influence'' on the classifier, the ''security violation'' they cause, and their ''specificity''.

* ''Attack influence''. It can be '''causative''', if the attack aims to introduce vulnerabilities (to be exploited at classification phase) by manipulating training data; or '''exploratory''', if the attack aims to find and subsequently exploit vulnerabilities at classification phase. The attacker’s capabilities might also be influenced by the presence of data manipulation constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2018 |title=AI in Cybersecurity |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98842-9 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-98841-2 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-98842-9 | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Security violation''. It can be an '''integrity''' violation, if it aims to get malicious samples misclassified as legitimate; or an  '''availability''' violation, if the goal is to increase the misclassification rate of legitimate samples, making the classifier unusable (e.g., a denial of service).
* ''Attack specificity''. It can be '''targeted''', if specific samples are considered (e.g., the adversary aims to allow a specific intrusion or he/she wants a given spam email to get past the filter); or '''indiscriminate'''.

This taxonomy has been extended into a more comprehensive threat model that allows one to make explicit assumptions on the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, capability of manipulating the input data and/or the system components, and on the corresponding (potentially, formally-defined) attack strategy. Details can be found here.&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A" /&gt; Two of the main attack scenarios identified according to this threat model are sketched below.

===Evasion attacks===
Evasion attacks&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_36A"&gt;B. Nelson, B. I. Rubinstein, L. Huang, A. D. Joseph, S. J. Lee, S. Rao, and J. D. Tygar. "[http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/nelson12a/nelson12a.pdf Query strategies for evading convex-inducing classifiers]". J. Mach. Learn. Res., 13:1293–1332, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; are the most prevalent type of attack that may be encountered in adversarial settings during system operation. For instance, spammers and hackers often attempt to evade detection by obfuscating the content of spam emails and malware code. In the evasion setting, malicious samples are modified at test time to evade detection; that is, to be misclassified as legitimate. No influence over the training data is assumed.
A clear example of evasion is [[Image spam|image-based spam]] in which the spam content is embedded within an attached image to evade the textual analysis performed by anti-spam filters.
Another example of evasion is given by spoofing attacks against biometric verification systems.&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_44A" /&gt;

===Poisoning attacks===
Machine learning algorithms are often re-trained on data collected during operation to adapt to changes in the underlying data distribution. For instance, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often re-trained on a set of samples collected during network operation. Within this scenario, an attacker may poison the training data by injecting carefully designed samples to eventually compromise the whole learning process. Poisoning may thus be regarded as an adversarial contamination of the training data. Examples of poisoning attacks against machine learning algorithms (including learning in the presence of worst-case adversarial label flips in the training data) can be found in.&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_15A"&gt;B. Biggio, B. Nelson, and P. Laskov. "[http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/node/751 Support vector machines under adversarial label noise]". In Journal of Machine Learning Research - Proc. 3rd Asian Conf. Machine Learning, volume 20, pp. 97–112, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_29A"&gt;M. Kloft and P. Laskov. "Security analysis of online centroid anomaly detection". Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13:3647–3690, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks against clustering algorithms==
Clustering algorithms have been increasingly adopted in security applications to find dangerous or illicit activities. For instance, clustering of malware and computer viruses aims to identify and categorize different existing malware families, and generate specific signatures for their detection by anti-viruses, or signature-based intrusion detection systems like Snort.

However, clustering algorithms have not been originally devised to deal with deliberate attack attempts that are designed to subvert the clustering process itself. Whether clustering can be safely adopted in such settings thus remains questionable. Preliminary work reporting some vulnerability of clustering can be found in.&lt;ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_42A"&gt;D. B. Skillicorn. "Adversarial knowledge discovery". IEEE Intelligent Systems, 24:54–61, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secure learning in adversarial settings==
A number of defense mechanisms against evasion, poisoning, and privacy attacks have been proposed in the field of adversarial machine learning, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15380">'''Alternatives assessment''' or '''alternatives analysis''' is a problem-solving approach used in [[environmental design]], [[environmental technology|technology]], and [[environmental policy|policy]]. It aims to minimize environmental harm by comparing multiple potential solutions in the context of a specific problem, design goal, or policy objective. It is intended to inform decision-making in situations with many possible courses of action, a wide range of variables to consider, and significant degrees of uncertainty. Alternatives assessment was originally developed as a robust way to guide [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] action and avoid [[Analysis paralysis|paralysis by analysis]]; authors such as O'Brien have presented alternatives assessment as an approach that is complementary to [[risk assessment]], the dominant decision-making approach in environmental policy.&lt;ref name="obrien_2000"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-15051-4| last = O'Brien| first = Mary| title = Making better environmental decisions: An alternative to risk assessment| location = Cambridge| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Ashford has described the similar concept of ''technology options analysis'' as a way to generate innovative solutions to the problems of industrial pollution more effectively than through risk-based regulation.&lt;ref name="ashford_1994"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Resources for the Future| isbn = 0-915707-74-8| pages = 275–314| editor = Adam M. Finkel| editor2 = Dominic Golding| last = Ashford| first = Nicholas A.| title = Worst things first? The debate over risk-based national environmental priorities| chapter = An innovation-based strategy for the environment| location = Washington, DC| date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ashford_2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10807030590919918| issn = 1549-7860| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 85–96| last = Ashford| first = Nicholas A.| title = Incorporating science, technology, fairness, and accountability in environmental, health, and safety decisions| journal = Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal| date = 2005-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives assessment is practiced in a variety of settings, including but not limited to [[green chemistry]], [[sustainable design]], supply-chain chemicals management, and chemicals policy.&lt;ref name="geiser_2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-51206-0| last = Geiser| first = Ken| title = Chemicals without harm: Policies for a sustainable world| location = Cambridge, Mass.| series = Urban and industrial environments| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent application area for alternatives assessment is the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, also known as chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| isbn = 978-1-84973-723-4| editor = Roy M. Harrison| editor2 = Ronald E. Hester| title = Chemical alternatives assessments| location = Cambridge| series = Issues in Environmental Science and Technology| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

Generally, alternatives assessment involves considering a number of possible options to achieve a specific objective, and applying a principled comparative analysis. The objective is usually to improve the environmental performance or safety of a specific product, material, process, or other activity. Potential alternatives considered in the analysis may include different chemical substances, materials, technologies, methods of use, or even extensive redesign to enable new ways of achieving the objective while avoiding the problem. Understanding the consequences of each available option is central to the process and goals of alternatives assessment, because this helps avoid decisions that substitute one problem with another (unknown) problem. The comparative analysis can involve any number of criteria for evaluating options, and these are typically focused on environmental health and sustainability.&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| last1 = Rossi| first1 = Mark| last2 = Tickner| first2 = Joel| last3 = Geiser| first3 = Ken| title = Alternatives assessment framework of the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| location = Lowell, MA| url=http://www.sustainableproduction.org/downloads/FinalAltsAssess06_000.pdf| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single protocol that dictates how options should be identified, evaluated, and compared in an alternatives assessment. Rather, a number of different alternatives assessment ''frameworks'' exist, which serve to structure decision-making and to enable systematic consideration of the key factors. Jacobs and colleagues identify six major components of alternatives assessment: evaluation of [[Hazard (risk)|hazard]], exposure, [[Life-cycle assessment|life cycle]] impacts, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility; and an overall decision-making strategy.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.1409581| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 124| issue = 3| last1 = Jacobs| first1 = Molly M.| last2 = Malloy| first2 = Timothy F.| last3 = Tickner| first3 = Joel A.| last4 = Edwards| first4 = Sally| title = Alternatives assessment frameworks: Research needs for the informed substitution of hazardous chemicals| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2016-03-01| pmid=26339778| pmc=4786344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major framework, the [https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/ Lowell Center for Sustainable Production] Alternatives Assessment Framework,&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk" /&gt; conceives of alternatives assessment very broadly, as a reflexive problem-solving process that recognizes the social and technical complexity of environmental problems. It emphasizes aspects such as stakeholder participation, transparency of the process, and open discussion of values in decision-making. Most other frameworks are more narrow and primarily focused on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016" /&gt;

=== Chemical alternatives assessment ===

Chemical alternatives assessment (or ''substitution of hazardous chemicals'') is the use of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances. Safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals may simply be other chemical substances, or may involve deeper changes in material or product design.&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es1015789| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 44| issue = 24| pages = 9244–9249| last1 = Lavoie| first1 = Emma T.| last2 = Heine| first2 = Lauren G.| last3 = Holder| first3 = Helen| last4 = Rossi| first4 = Mark S.| last5 = Lee| first5 = Robert E.| last6 = Connor| first6 = Emily A.| last7 = Vrabel| first7 = Melanie A.| last8 = DiFiore| first8 = David M.| last9 = Davies| first9 = Clive L.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: Enabling substitution to safer chemicals| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2010-12-15| pmid=21062050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tickner_2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es503328m| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 49| issue = 2| pages = 742–749| last1 = Tickner| first1 = Joel A.| last2 = Schifano| first2 = Jessica N.| last3 = Blake| first3 = Ann| last4 = Rudisill| first4 = Catherine| last5 = Mulvihill| first5 = Martin J.| title = Advancing safer alternatives through functional substitution| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment aims to provide the basis for well-informed decision-making by thoroughly characterizing chemicals and materials (and other design options) across a wide range of environmental and health impact categories. The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a [[carcinogen]]ic chemical with a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] one), 
and to minimize the [[unintended consequences]] of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance—in other words, to prevent "[[Hazard substitution#Regrettable substitutions|regrettable substitutions]]", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad.&lt;ref name="howard_2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.02.034| issn = 0045-6535| last = Howard| first = Gregory J.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: The case of flame retardants| journal = Chemosphere| date = 2014| volume=116| pages=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An array of methodologies and tools for chemical alternatives assessment have been developed worldwide and have been deployed in a variety of industry sectors.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd_toolbox"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| title = OECD substitution and alternatives assessment toolbox| url = http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment frameworks include [[chemical hazard]] assessment methods that consider a wide range of hazard [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], such as those defined in the
[[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]] or the [[GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals]].

=== Examples ===

* The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute has conducted alternatives assessments for the substitution of hazardous substances like lead and formaldehyde.&lt;ref name="turi_five"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Toxics Use Reduction Institute| title = Five Chemicals Alternatives Assessment Study| accessdate = 2016-07-31| date = 2006| url = http://www.turi.org/TURI_Publications/TURI_Methods_Policy_Reports/Five_Chemicals_Alternatives_Assessment_Study._2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of alternatives assessment ==

Scientists from a variety of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and firms have contributed to developing the practice of alternatives assessment.

=== In the United States ===

Scientific research in the US federal government has contributed to alternatives assessment frameworks and practices. In 2014 the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] released a chemical alternatives assessment framework developed by an expert working group.&lt;ref name="nrc_2014"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The National Academies Press| isbn = 978-0-309-31013-0| author = National Research Council (US)| title = A framework to guide selection of chemical alternatives| location = Washington, D.C| url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18872/a-framework-to-guide-selection-of-chemical-alternatives| date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] ran a program called ''Design for the Environment'' (now called [https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice Safer Choice]), which developed chemical alternatives assessment methodology&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010" /&gt; and created partnerships to undertake numerous alternatives assessments for chemicals of concern in products.&lt;ref name="usepa_dfe"&gt;{{Cite web| author = US Environmental Protection Agency| title = Design for the Environment alternatives assessments| url = https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/design-environment-alternatives-assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives assessment has featured in some state-level chemicals policies and regulatory activities. The [[Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute]] has provided public technical assistance for "toxics use reduction planning", which includes alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="eliason_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.05.011| issn = 0959-6526| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 517–526| last1 = Eliason| first1 = Pamela| last2 = Morose| first2 = Gregory| title = Safer alternatives assessment: The Massachusetts process as a model for state governments| journal = Journal of Cleaner Production| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] is implementing new regulations that require firms to undertake alternatives assessments for selected priority chemicals in products.&lt;ref name="ca_dtsc_aa"&gt;{{Cite web| author = California Department of Toxic Substances Control| title = Alternatives analysis| work = Safer Consumer Products (SCP)| url = http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/AA.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse, an association of state governments, has also produced its own guide to alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="ic2_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse| title = IC2 Alternatives assessment guide, version 1.0| url=http://theic2.org/article/download-pdf/file_name/IC2_AA_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US-based companies have begun to use chemical alternatives assessment to address chemical safety issues in supply chains. For example, firms that participate in the [http://bizngo.org/ Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials] have produced their own guidance for chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="bizngo_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials (BizNGO)| title = BizNGO chemical alternatives assessment protocol| url=http://www.bizngo.org/alternatives-assessment/chemical-alternatives-assessment-protocol| date = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

The Sweden-based non-governmental organization [[ChemSec]] has been active in developing resources and tools for the substitution of hazardous chemicals.  The [http://www.subsport.eu/ Substitution support portal (SUBSPORT)] is an EU-based collaboratively-developed resource for chemical substitution.&lt;ref name="lissner_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2190/NS.21.3.l| issn = 1541-3772| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 477–497| last1 = Lissner| first1 = Lothar| last2 = Romano| first2 = Dolores| title = Substitution for hazardous chemicals on an international level—The approach of the European project "SUBSPORT"| journal = NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy| date = 2011-01-01| pmid=22001043}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes alternatives assessment case studies.

'''Ari Elon''' ([[Hebrew]]: ארי אלון) (born 1950) is an Israeli writer, a Talmud scholar and educator.

Elon was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1950. He is the son of former [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel Supreme Court]] Justice [[Menachem Elon]]. Elon's brothers include the late Israeli politician, MK [[Binyamin Elon|Benny Elon]], disgraced Rabbi [[Mordechai Elon]] and Be'er Sheva District Court Judge [[Joseph ("Sefi") Elon]] . 
 
Despite his family's religious background, he became secular at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/because-judaism-isn-t-a-dirty-word-1.209168 Because Judaism isn't a dirty word], haaretz,1,4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He taught Talmud and Midrash at [[The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Elon taught at various institutions throughout Israel, including [[BINA Center for Jewish Identity and Hebrew Culture]], and served as the director of the Rabbinic Texts Program at the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] in [[Philadelphia]].

'''Autofellatio''' is the act of [[Oral sex|oral stimulation]] of one's own [[human penis|penis]] as a form of [[masturbation]]. Only a limited number of  men are physically capable of performing autofellatio.&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Savage, Dan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iWmsV0n0mNYC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=autofellation+and+really&amp;ei=hUEgSvU-hYrKBOq01eYC Savage Love]'', page 242 (Plume 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Egyptologist David Lorton says that many ancient texts refer to autofellatio within the religion of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], both in the realm of the gods and among the followers performing religious rituals.&lt;ref name="lorton1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/ontology.html|title=Autofellatio and Ontology|author=David Lorton|year=1995|accessdate=15 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229072235/http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/ontology.html|archive-date=29 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexinfo101.com/as_autofellatio.shtml|title=Autofellatio|publisher=SexInfo101.com|accessdate=15 October 2006|quote=Academic David Lorton says that many ancient texts refer to autofellatio within the religious mythology of Egypt. He also notes that autofellatio was performed during rituals as a result of the sun god Ra’s. . .|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021215552/http://www.sexinfo101.com/as_autofellatio.shtml|archivedate=21 October 2006|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lorton, in the [[List of ancient Egyptian papyri|Papyrus Bremner-Rhind]] 28, 20–24, in a document called "Book of Overthrowing Apophis", there is a poem narrating how the sun god [[Ra]] had created the god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and goddess [[Tefnut]] by fellating himself and spitting out his own semen onto the ground.&lt;ref name="lorton1"/&gt; In ancient Egyptian texts, this act is usually performed by the god [[Atum]], and most texts depict only the spitting of the semen or only the masturbation, but not both.&lt;ref name="lorton1" /&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] cites [[Artemidorus]]' ''[[Oneirocritica]]'' as identifying the act of "taking [one's] sex organ into one's [own] mouth" as one of three ways to commit "relations with oneself." Artemidorus thought that dreams of this "unnatural" act [[portend]]ed the death of one's children, loss of one's mistresses, or extreme poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1984).

==Physical aspects==
Few men possess sufficient flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary [[frontbend]].&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt; However, increased flexibility achieved via gravity-assisted positions, and physical training such as [[gymnastics]], [[contortion]], or [[yoga]] may make it possible for some. American biologists [[Kinsey Reports|Craig Bartle]] and [[Alfred Charles Kinsey]] reported that fewer than 1% of males can successfully orally contact their own penis and that only 2 or 3 men in a thousand could perform a full autofellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Psychoanalytic Review]] | issue = 41 | pages = 354–358 | title = A Review of Autofellatio: A Psychological Study of Two New Cases | author = William Guy, Michael H.

In 1993, American [[feminist]] artist [[Kiki Smith]] created a beeswax life-size sculpture titled "Mother/Child" which included a depiction of man performing autofellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasquez |first=Diego |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Magazines_22/Words-and-thoughts-from-New-York.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128110730/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Magazines_22/Words-and-thoughts-from-New-York.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |title=Words and thoughts from New York |publisher=Media Life Magazine |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saltz |first=Jerry |url=http://nymag.com/arts/art/reviews/65115/ |title=Jerry Saltz on the Jeff Koons-Curated 'Skin Fruit' Exhibit at the New Museum - New York Magazine Art Review |publisher=Nymag.com |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roberta Smith |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/arts/design/05dakis.html?pagewanted=2 |title=Art Review - 'Skin Fruit' - A Mainstream Show at the Anti-Mainstream New Museum |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be insulting to a man's masculinity, implying that someone performs autofellatio due either to extremely high self-regard or inability to get someone else to do it for him. This was the sense in which the term was used by President [[Donald Trump]]'s former [[White House Communications Director]] [[Anthony Scaramucci]], when he said of strategist [[Steve Bannon]], "I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own cock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/anthony-scaramucci-called-me-to-unload-about-white-house-leakers-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon |title=Anthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon |date=27 July 2017 |accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2016}}
In [[Islam]], '''''Barakah''''' or '''''Baraka''''' ({{lang-ar|بركة}}) is a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1216 |title=Home - Brill Reference |publisher=Brillonline.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|title=Sufi Essays|date=1972|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0873952332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Baraka can be found within physical objects, places, and people, as chosen by God. This force begins by flowing directly from God into creation that is worthy of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; These creations endowed with baraka can then transmit the flow of baraka to the other creations of God through physical proximity or through the adherence to the spiritual practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. God is the sole source of baraka and has the power to grant and withhold baraka.

==Islamic mysticism==
Baraka is a prominent concept in Islamic mysticism, particularly [[Sufism]]. It pervades Sufi texts, beliefs, practices, and spirituality. Sufism emphasizes the importance of esoteric knowledge and the spiritual union with God through the heart. Baraka symbolizes this connection between the divine and the worldly through God's direct and intentional blessing of those that are most reflective of Him and his teachings.

Baraka is not a state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It flows from God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have received baraka are thought to have the abilities to perform miracles (''karamat''), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|title=The Shambhala Guide to Sufism|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=9781570621802|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} However, according to [[Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri]], a prominent Sufi mystic, the use of these miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Sources, transmission, and traditional importance==

===Sources===
The [[Qur'an]], [[hadith]], saints, prophets, Muhammad and his descendants are all powerful sources of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; Through these sources, one may achieve baraka by three methods: (1) visitation of saints and holy shrines charged with baraka, (2) attachment to the chain of spiritual masters through the [[khirqa]], and (3) emulation of the inner [[Sunnah]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through saints===
Saints as the source of baraka, can transmit baraka to ordinary men simply through their presence. As this hadith explains, "By means of the righteous Muslim, God repulses affliction from one hundred neighbors".&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Valerie J.|title=Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt|date=2009|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|isbn=157003849X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} In this way, the saints provide a means for ordinary men to connect with the blessings of God through baraka. The physical closeness to a saint's shrine is said to emit baraka, which is why many followers of Islam choose to visit shrines. The ritualistic act of visiting tombs and other holy places, such as shrines, to receive baraka is known as [[ziyara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karamustafa|first1=Ahmet T.|title=Sufism: The Formative Period|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520252691}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through khirqa===
Sufis pass esoteric knowledge and baraka from the master [[sheikh]] to the aspirant through the passing of the [[khirqa]]. The khirqa is the initiatory cloak of the Sufi chain of spirituality. This cloak initiates an aspirant into the [[silsilah]], which is the chain of sheikhs that goes back to Muhammad. This chain serves as the channel through which baraka flows from the source of spiritual revelation to the being of the initiate.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} There are two kinds of this kind of transmission (tanakkul) of baraka through the khirqa: khirqa-yi irada and khirqa-yi tabarruk. Khirqa-yi irada is characterized by the passing of baraka to the aspirant from the singular sheikh to which he has sworn. Khirqa-yi tabarruk, also known as the "frock of blessing", is characterized by the passing of baraka to the worthy aspirant from any sheikh that he has encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|date=2013|publisher=Mizan|location=Jakarta Selatan|isbn=9794337978|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

The silsilah chain created from the passing of the khirqa that confirms authenticity of many hadiths is known as the [[isnad]]. It was not until the late eleventh and twelfth centuries that the Sufi tradition began accepting this form of [[isnad]] as a means to transmit mystical knowledge and blessings.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan A.C.|title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|date=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=1851686630|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission through Sunnah===
By following the practices and teachings of Muhammad, one can achieve baraka through the emulation of [[Sunnah]]. Because Muhammad is the source of Muhammadan baraka, by living in constant remembrance of [[Names of God in Islam|the names of God]] and in accordance to Muhammad's Sunnah. Those that live the inner Sunnah within the heart, are those that reflect the Light of Muhammad (al-nur al-muhammadi) and the Muhammadan baraka.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Those that live according to the Sunnah, live in constant remembrance of God, and live authentically from the heart are those to whom God opens the channel through which baraka can flow. By living in accordance to Muhammad, one can become worthy of God's direct blessing of baraka. If granted baraka, the saintly person is able to feel God's force from within and is nourished by the hadith while being guided by the baraka.&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Controversy of seeking baraka==
Seeking baraka has been a source of controversy throughout the Islamic world. Through the act of [[ziyara]], saints and the shrines of saints are seen as a means to access the baraka sent from God.  Because of this, many within Islam see ziyara as a form of [[idolatry]] in the way devotees may look towards the saints instead of towards God, Himself, for baraka.&lt;ref name="Sells"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seels|first1=Michael A.|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi'raj, Poetic and Theological Writings|date=1996|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809136198}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Although ziyara has been a source of great controversy, it remains one of the most typical ritual practices of Islamic spirituality.&lt;ref name="Sells"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Breakover angle may also be referred to as "break-over angle" or "break over angle." Breakover angle is different from [[ground clearance]] in that ground clearance is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle.

==Relevance==
[[Image:MUTCD W10-5.svg|100px|thumb|right|[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] warning sign for a [[Level  crossing|low-ground-clearance crossing]]]]
Breakover angle is a relevant performance metric in many common vehicle scenarios, including:
* [[Off-roading]].
* Loading a vehicle onto a higher surface with a ramp.
* Going over raised [[Level crossing|railroad crossings]].
* Going over [[speed bump]]s
* Going over [[linkspan]]s

If a vehicle drives over a breakover angle larger than what it is capable of clearing, the vehicle will contact the apex of the angle, which will quite likely prevent the vehicle from continuing any further in its direction of travel, possibly even completely immobilizing the vehicle.

==Calculation==
Assuming no tire deflection, and assuming an ideal breakover angle scenario (two flat surfaces coming to a point, a vehicle with the lowest point of the chassis located at its midsection, etc.), an ''approximation'' for the breakover angle of a vehicle can be calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{breakover angle}_{approximate} = 2 \cdot \arctan\left(\frac{2 \cdot \text{ground clearance}}{\text{wheelbase}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1688">The '''Center for Mathematical Modeling''' (CMM) was created in 2000 to encompass research and training activities that were being conducted by members of the Department of Mathematical Engineering at [[Universidad de Chile]]. Today, it features a range of activities from fundamental research in applied mathematics to industry-oriented research and education. The Center is a base for international collaboration; it hosts an increasing number of engineering and Ph.D. students as well as postdoctoral fellows, and provides a scientific counterpart to their industrial partners.

==Origins==
The CMM was founded by members of the Department of Mathematical Engineering (DIM) at the Universidad de Chile with the aid of a FONDAP-[[CONICYT]] project. From its inception, the Center was an associated international unit of the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS), the first in mathematics outside France. The CMM is physically housed in the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Science, which contains the oldest, most prestigious and productive engineering school in [[Chile]]. As a consequence the Center has a strong link with departments in this school -industrial, mechanical, civil, electrical, computer science and earth science- and benefits from access to the 4.000 strong student population of the school and to more than 500 graduated students in diverse fields and engineering.

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

'''Common sense''' is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to [[Perception|perceive]], [[Nous|understand]], and [[Phronesis|judge]] that is shared by ("common to") nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' gives: "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts." [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common+sense], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, "the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way."[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that "common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument." C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense "often means" is "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man."&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as "the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done." The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], "signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought." The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as "the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language" and notes, "A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sjöberg|journal=Scandinavian journal of psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin '''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}''', Greek {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις κοινὴ}} ('''{{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}'''), and French '''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}''', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed "common sense", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|φρονεῖν}}, {{transl|grc|phroneîn}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοεῖν#Ancient Greek|νοεῖν]]}}, {{transl|grc|noeîn}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]
"Common sense" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|ψῡχή]]}}, {{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.

The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives 4 meanings of "common sense": (1) An archaic meaning is "An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses"; (2) "Ordinary, normal, or average understanding" without which a man would be "foolish or insane" (3) "The general sense of mankind, or of a community" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity) (4) A philosophical meaning, the "faculty of primary truths".&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.

All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning [[science]], politics and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: "today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term "common sense" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to [[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]] [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.&lt;ref name="hund"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: "Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common sense : a political history.|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This began with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "[[rationalism]]" and "[[empiricism]]". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is "{{lang|fr|bon sens}}" sometimes translated as "good sense". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt; Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].

==Aristotelian==
The origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.&lt;ref&gt;There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδια]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion, "common" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κοινός#Ancient Greek|κοινή]]}}, {{transl|grc|koiné}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|tá koiná}} ({{lang|grc|τά κοινᾰ́}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κίνησις#Ancient Greek|κῑ́νησῐς]]}}, {{transl|grc|kī́nēsis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of "common sense".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as "[[primary qualities]]" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term "primary qualities"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c–d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example "are" versus "are not"; are "similar" versus "dissimilar"; are the "same" versus being "different"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.&lt;ref&gt;These "common sensibles" or {{transl|grc|koiná}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called "[[universals]]", although it should be noted that Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koiná}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοῦς#Ancient Greek|νοῦς]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle
|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&amp;pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koiná}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|κᾰτᾰ́ σῠμβεβηκός}}, {{transl|grc|katá sumbebēkós}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|idéā}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koiná}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koiná}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of "common sense".&lt;/ref&gt; Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" that can distinguish black from sweet.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a–c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σημεῖον#Ancient Greek|σημεῖον]]}}, {{transl|grc|sēmeîon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2011|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.&lt;ref name="brann43" /&gt;

The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].&lt;/ref&gt; But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koiná}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]

The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=204–205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φαντασία#Ancient Greek|φᾰντᾰσῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantasíā}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.&lt;ref name="brann43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walz"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=1871031761|year=1998|page=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} or "intellect"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|noûs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|lógos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|noûs}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phroneîn}} and {{transl|grc|noeîn}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|noûs}}.

Aristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|prôton aisthētikón}} ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον αἰσθητῐκόν}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).&lt;ref name="walz" /&gt; [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense".&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt; The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=10}}. The "cogitative" or "estimative" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, "enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five "external" senses.&lt;ref name="hr42"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that "In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averroës]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the "central" faculty of the sensuous soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman==
[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of "humanist" common sense.]]
"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word {{transl|grc|koinḗ}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή}}, {{literal translation|'common, shared'}}); not only {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, but also such terms as {{transl|grc|koinós noûs}} ({{lang|grc|κοινός νοῦς}}, {{literal translation|'common mind/thought/reason'|lk=no}}) {{transl|grc|koinḗ énnoia}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή ἔννοιᾰ}}), and {{transl|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}}, all of which involve {{transl|grc|noûs}}—something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in "lower" animals.&lt;ref name="Bugter1987"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinḗ énnoia}} is a term from [[Stoic philosophy]], a Greek philosophy, influenced by Aristotle, and influential in [[Rome]]. This refers to shared notions, or common conceptions, that are either in-born or imprinted by the senses on to the soul. Unfortunately few true Stoic texts survive, and our understanding of their technical terminology is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110212297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinós noûs}} is a term found in [[Epictetus]] (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} believed this to be close to a modern English meaning of "common sense", "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like [[intelligence]]. He noted that {{lang|la|sensus}} could be a translation of {{transl|grc|noûs}}, (for example in the [[Vulgate Bible]]), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus the fable writer]].
* {{transl|grc|Koinonoēmosúnē}} is found only in the work of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''[[Meditations]]'' I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑπόληψις|ὑπόληψις]]}} [conjecture], and the vulgar {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἴσθησις|αἴσθησις]]}} [perception]; how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, volume I, part III, section I, first footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link between Latin {{lang|la|communis sensus}} and Aristotle's Greek was in [[rhetoric]], a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions ({{lang|grc|δόξαι}}, {{transl|grc|[[Doxa|dóxai]]}}) that are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] saw Aristotle's rhetorical work as having formed a continuity with his ethical and political work, all sharing a focus upon {{transl|grc|[[Phronesis|phrónēsis]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις#Ancient Greek|φρόνησῐς]]}}, {{literal translation|'practical wisdom'|lk=no}}), and a connection to what Vico saw in the concept of common sense. See {{citation|title=Gadamer's Hermeneutics and the Art of Conversation| editor-first=Andrzej |editor-last=Wierciński| first=John|last=Arthos| chapter=Gadamer's dialogical imperative: Linking Socratic dialogue to Aristotle's ''PHRONESIS''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lE268UbRQsC| isbn=9783643111722 | year=2011 }} and {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} ({{lang|grc|κοιναί δόξαι}}, {{literal translation|'common opinions'|lk=no}}), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as {{transl|grc|[[Endoxa|éndóxa]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἔνδόξα}}).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' for example Aristotle mentions "{{transl|grc|koinōn&amp;nbsp;[...] tàs písteis}}" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|ἀνάγκη διὰ τῶν κοινῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πίστεις καὶ τοὺς λόγους}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3Abekker+page%3D1355a ''Rhetoric'' 1355a]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', [[Cicero]] wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of "{{lang|la|communis sensus}}" in the Latin of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120:book=1:section=12&amp;highlight=communis%2Csensus ''De Oratore'', I, 3, 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Latin writers such as [[Cicero]] deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=112}} has proposed for example that the [[Roman republic]] maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. {{harvtxt|Peters Agnew|2008}} argues, in agreement with [[Shaftesbury]] in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.

As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in ''De Anima'', and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|pages=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of {{lang|la|[[humanitas]]}}. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only [[human nature]], but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Cicero, [[Quintilian]], [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Horace]] and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}" in a range of such ways.&lt;ref name=rethink&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote:
{{Quote|Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ({{lang|la|congressus}}) how will he ever learn that {{lang|la|sensus}} which we call {{lang|la|communis}}? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible {{transl|grc|koiná}}, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, {{transl|grc|noûs}} (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of {{transl|grc|koiná}}, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Holthoon|1987}}, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of perception. Sensations from the senses travel to {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, seated in the pineal gland inside the brain, and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION II.: Of the Nature of the Human Mind ; and that It is More Easily Known than the Body.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION VI.: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.
{{Quote|René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649).&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21" /&gt;}}

Contemporaries such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Hobbes]] went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or {{transl|grc|noûs}}, which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA83|page=83|title=The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: The Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes' Natural Philosophy| first=Cees |last=Leijenhorst| publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117296|year=2002}}. Hobbes (like Gassendi) wrote scornfully of the complex old distinctions, and in particular the medieval concept of sensible "species" (a concept derived from Aristotle's perceptibles):
{{Quote|Some say the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing understood. ({{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes| title= The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart., 11 vols.| volume=3 (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'')  |chapter= II.: of imagination| publication-place=London |publisher=Bohn| url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/585/89820/2025312}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"...
{{Quote|According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Spruit|1995|pages=403–404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Descartes portrait.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes is the source of the most common way of understanding the "common sense" as a widely spread type of judgement.]]
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}", but also the French term {{lang|fr|bon sens}}, with which he opens his ''Discourse on Method''. And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;282. English is unusual in keeping one term that unites the classical and modern meanings, and philosophical and everyday meanings, so clearly. Italian has {{lang|it|senso comune}} and also {{lang|it|buon senso}}; German has {{lang|de|gemeiner Verstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunder Menschenverstand}}, and {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, used by Kant and others. French also has {{lang|fr|sens commun}}, used by [[Étienne Gilson]] and others. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}, who also notes that according to Gilson, Descartes himself always referred to {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|bona mens}} in Latin, never {{lang|la|sensus communis}} (p.&amp;nbsp;340).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=2}} writes that "Descartes is the source of the most common meaning of ''common sense'' today: practical judgment". Gilson noted that Descartes actually gave {{lang|fr|bon sens}} two related meanings, first the basic and widely shared ability to judge true and false, which he also calls {{lang|fr|raison}} ({{literal translation|'reason'|lk=on}}); and second, wisdom, the perfected version of the first. The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense. Descartes was being original.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la méthode| chapter=Première Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.

==The Enlightenment after Descartes==

===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.&lt;ref name="gil1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and the Cartesian "[[rationalists]]", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or "{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}" [[knowledge]] in the human mind—a controversial proposal.

In contrast to the rationalists, the "[[Empiricism|empiricists]]" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "[[idols of the mind]]", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] "introduced him as the "father" of the [[scientific method]]" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt;

As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:
{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ethics: "humanist"===
[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]
Once Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.

Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:
{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. "our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery."" which, he explains, "was sometimes called {{lang|grc|κοινονοημοσύνη}}&lt;ref&gt;Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed. Aaron Garrett |publication-place=Indianapolis| publisher=Liberty Fund|year= 2002| chapter= section i: A general Account of our several Senses and Desires, Selfish or Publick|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/885/65922/1605681 |accessdate= 2013-07-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.

By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "[[moral sentiment]]" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:
{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, "OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY", in "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".

According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.

Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the [[Württemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambattista Vico===
[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]
Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref name="Bugter1987" /&gt; Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of [[eloquence]]" but also "the standard of [[practical judgment]]". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as "judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii "Elements" (§§141-146) and I.iv "Method" (§§347-350).&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence}}.

===Thomas Reid and the Scottish school===
[[File:ThomasReid.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas Reid, founder of the Scottish school of Common Sense.]]
Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school of Common Sense]] formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, [[Thomas Reid]]:
{{Quote|If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Cuneo |editor2-last=Woudenberg|title=The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid|year=2004| page= 85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQAg6CTl3QC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780521012089}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow]]. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.

Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.

Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.

==Kant: In aesthetic taste==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:

{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.

But under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's "{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.

Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;312, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The [[moral imperative]] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32–34}}. Note: The source makes it clear that "English" includes Scottish authors.&lt;/ref&gt; For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:
{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant—so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=0812205502}}, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.

Another example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics: what the community would think===
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Rancière]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and refer to the "[[postmodern]]" condition as one where there is "{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah Arendt cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Hannah Arendt, who proposed an adaptation of Kant's aesthetic concept of common sense as having broader relevance to political philosophy.]]

[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[Jürgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "[[euphony]]" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.

Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".

[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&amp;pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology
|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality"===
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.

While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], "Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse." Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.

==Catholic theology==
Among Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[François Fénelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Théodore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt; In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name="murph"&gt;{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:

{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt;}}

Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".&lt;ref name="murph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9460">'''Compound heterozygosity''' in [[medical genetics]] is the condition of having two heterogeneous [[recessive]] [[alleles]] at a particular locus that can cause [[genetic disorders|genetic disease]] in a [[heterozygous]] state. That is, an organism is a compound heterozygote when it has two recessive alleles for the same gene, but with those two alleles being different from each other (for example, both alleles might be mutated but at different locations). Compound heterozygosity reflects the diversity of the mutation base for many [[autosomal recessive]] genetic disorders; mutations in most disease-causing genes have arisen many times. This means that many cases of disease arise in individuals who have two unrelated alleles, who technically are [[heterozygous|heterozygotes]], but both the alleles are defective.

These disorders are often best known in some classic form, such as the homozygous recessive case of a particular [[mutation]] that is widespread in some population. In its compound heterozygous forms, the disease may have lower [[penetrance]], because the mutations involved are often less deleterious in combination than for a [[homozygous]] individual with the classic symptoms of the disease. As a result, compound heterozygotes often become ill later in life, with less severe symptoms. Although compound heterozygosity as a cause of genetic disease had been suspected much earlier, widespread confirmation of the phenomenon was not feasible until the 1980s, when [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques for amplification of DNA made it cost-effective to sequence genes and identify polymorphic alleles.

== Cause ==

Compound heterozygosity is one of the causes of variation in genetic disease. The diagnosis and nomenclature for such disorders sometimes reflects history, because most diseases were first observed and classified based on [[biochemistry]] and [[pathophysiology]] before genetic diagnosis was available. Some genetic disorders are really a family of related disorders that occur in the same [[metabolic pathway]], or in related pathways. Naming conventions for the disease became established before precise molecular diagnosis was possible.

For example, [[hemochromatosis]] is the name given to several different heritable diseases with the same outcome, excess absorption of iron. These variants all reflect a failure in a metabolic pathway associated with [[iron]] [[metabolism]], however mutations that cause hemochromatosis can occur at different gene loci. Mutations have occurred at each locus many times, and a few such mutations have become widespread in some population. The fact that multiple loci are involved is the primary cause for the variant forms of hemochromatosis and its outcome. This variation is caused not by compound heterozygosity, but rather by the fact that several different enzyme defects can cause the disease. Clinically, most cases of hemochromatosis are found in homozygotes for the most common mutation in the [[HFE (gene)|HFE gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=2008-01-17 | title=Iron-Overload–Related Disease in HFE Hereditary Hemochromatosis | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume=358 | issue=3 | pages=221–230 | author = KJ Allen | author2 = LC Gurrin | author3 = CC Constantine | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa073286 | pmid=18199861 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at each gene locus associated with the disease, there is the possibility of compound heterozygosity, often caused by inheritance of two unrelated alleles, of which one is a common or classic mutation, while the other is a rare or even novel one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=Feb 2000 | title=Compound heterozygous hemochromatosis genotype predicts increased iron and erythrocyte indices in women | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume=46 | issue=2 | pages=162–166 | vauthors = Rossi E, Olynyk JK, Cullen DJ, Papadopoulos G, Bulsara M, Summerville L, Powell LW | pmid=10657371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some genetic diseases, environmental cofactors are an important determinant of variation and outcome. In the case of hemochromatosis, [[penetrance]] is incomplete, even for the classic HFE mutation, and is affected by gender, diet, and behaviors such as alcohol consumption. Compound heterozygotes are often observed only through subclinical symptoms such as excess iron. Disease is rarely observed in such compound heterozygotes unless other causal factors (such as [[alcoholism]]) are present. As a result, compound heterozygosity for hemochromatosis may be more common than diagnosis based on pathology would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=Aug 2008 | title=Modifying factors of the HFE hemochromatosis phenotype | journal = Expert Reviews in Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=531–540 | vauthors = Deugnier Y, Mosser J | pmid=19072401 | doi=10.1586/17474124.2.4.531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some genetic diseases are named more precisely, and represent a [[single point of failure]] on a metabolic pathway. For example, [[Tay-Sachs disease]], [[GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant]], and [[Sandhoff disease]] might easily have been defined together as a single disease, because the three disorders are associated with failure of the same enzyme and have the same outcome. However, the three were discovered and named separately, and each represents a distinct molecular point of failure in a subunit that is required for activation of the enzyme. For all three disorders, compound heterozygosity is responsible for variant forms. For example, both TSD and Sandhoff disease have a more common infantile form and several late-onset variants. Post-infantile forms, which are rare, are generally caused by the inheritance of two unrelated alleles, of which one is usually a classic mutation, while the other is a rare or even novel one.

=== Examples ===

* '''[[Phenylketonuria]]'''. Because phenylketonuria was the first genetic disorder for which mass post-natal genetic screening was available, beginning in the early 1960s, atypical cases were detected almost immediately. Molecular analysis of the genome was not yet possible, but protein sequencing revealed cases caused by compound heterozygosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Atypical phenylketonuric heterozygote. Deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase and transaminase activity | vauthors = Anderson JA, Fisch R, Miller E, Doeden D | journal = Journal of Pediatrics | volume=68 | issue=3 | date=Mar 1966 | pages=351–360 | pmid=4379218 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(66)80237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As molecular genomic techniques became available in the 1980s and 1990s, it became possible to explain a range of disorders in heterozygotes carrying one copy of one of the classic mutations for phenylketonuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Compound heterozygosity in nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalanemia: The contribution of mutations for classical phenylketonuria | vauthors = Avigad S, Kleiman S, Weinstein M, Cohen BE, Schwartz G, Woo SL, Shiloh Y | last-author-amp = yes | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=49 | issue=2 | date=Aug 1991 | pages=393–399 | pmc=1683284 |pmid=1867197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Tay-Sachs disease]]'''. In addition to its classic infantile form, Tay Sachs disease may present in juvenile or adult onset forms, often as the result of compound heterozygosity between two alleles, one that causes the classic infantile disease in homozygotes and another that allows some residual HEXA enzyme activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Multiple Abnormal beta-Hexosaminidase alpha-Chain mRNAs in a Compound-Heterozygous Ashkenazi Jewish Patient with Tay-Sachs Disease | author = Ohno, Kousaku | author2 = Suzuki, Kunihiko | last-author-amp = yes | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume =263 | issue=34 | date= 1988-12-05 | pmid =2973464 | url= http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/263/34/18563.pdf |format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-05-11 | pages= 18563–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[sickle cell|Sickle cell syndromes]]'''. A variety of sickle cell disorders result from inheritance of the sickle cell gene in a compound heterozygous manner with other mutant beta globin genes. These disorders include [[sickle cell-beta thalassemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in black patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia from the southeastern United States | vauthors = Gonzalez-Redondo JM, Stoming TA, Lanclos KD | journal=Blood | volume=72 | issue=3 | year=1988 | pages=1007–1014 | pmid=2458145|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[sickle cell|sickle cell anemia]], an individual with one allele for [[hemoglobin]] S and one [[allele]] for [[hemoglobin C]] would still develop the disease, despite being heterozygous for both genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1056/NEJM199110173251607 | title=Sickle cell disease in a patient with sickle cell trait and compound heterozygosity for hemoglobin S and hemoglobin Quebec-Chori | author = Witkowska HE | author2 = Lubin BH | author3 = Beuzard Y | author4 = Baruchel S | author5 = Esseltine DW | author6 = Vichinsky EP | author7 = Kleman KM | author8 = Bardakdjian-Michau J | author9 = Pinkoski L | author10 = Cahn S | publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume=325 | issue=16 | date= 1991-10-17 | pages=1150–1154 | pmid=1891024|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict continuum''' is a model or concept used by various [[Social sciences|social science]] researchers in modelling conflict, usually going from low "irritations" to high "explosiveness" intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.uiowa.edu/pimgr/?get=conflict |title=Conflict Management |accessdate=2010-11-30 |date=26 July 2007 |publisher=The University of Iowa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002222238/https://research.uiowa.edu/pimgr/?get=conflict |archivedate=2 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conceptual models facilitate discussion as in "anywhere on the conflict continuum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ruoti | first1 = Tony | title = C412 INTEROPERABILITY: Operational Art in a New Paradigm | publisher = NAVAL WAR COLLEGE | date = 18 June 1993 | location = Newport, RI. | pages = ii | url = http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA266739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hart | first1 = Louis B. | title = Learning from Conflict: A Handbook for Trainers and Group Leaders | chapter = 4.

==Various continuum models==

=== Elise Boulding's conflict continuum===
[[Elise M. Boulding]] was a Quaker sociologist influenced by the events of World War II. Examining how war becomes peace, she posited a continuum between Wars of Extermination &lt;ref name="HockerW"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hocker, Joyce &amp; William W. Wilmot | title = Interpersonal Conflict, 4th Edition | year = 1995 | publisher = Brown &amp; Benchmark, Madison }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |title=History |year=2001 |publisher=The Institute for Global Leadership |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uxd3ekHA?url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |archivedate=14 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is Boulding’s conflict continuum:&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt;  War of extermination, Limited war, Threat systems (deterrence), Arbitration, Mediation, Negotiation (exchange), Mutual adaptation, Alliance, Co-operation, Integration,&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt; Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg" /&gt;

===Andra Medea===
{{COI|section|date=March 2013}}
{{primary sources|section|date=March 2013}}
Theorist [[Andra Medea]] seeks to explain how [[individuals]], small groups, [[organizations]], [[family|families]], [[ethnicities]], and even whole [[nations]] function when disputes arise between them. She posits that there are four types or levels of conflict, each operating under distinct rules: 1) ''Problem Solving''; 2) ''Domination''; 3) ''Blind Behavior''; 4) ''Rogue Messiah''.&lt;ref&gt;Andra Medea interviewed by McDonnell, Jerome. [http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/may-6-1999 "WorldView"]. WBEZ, Chicago. 16 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level moving from first to fourth is characterized by increasing degrees of separation from reality, and decreasing degrees of maturity, in this context, defined as the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. Problem-solving behavior is based in reality and maturity, and is therefore more rational and mature than domination. Domination is more rational and mature than blind behavior, which is more rational and mature than the Rogue Messiah.&lt;ref name="AMbookA"&gt;Medea, Andra. “The Conflict Continuum.”  Chicago, 1996. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, each level moving from fourth to first is more capable than the one below it at forcing victory in a conflict. The Rogue Messiah overpowers blind behavior, blind behavior thwarts domination, and domination deadlocks Problem-solving.&lt;ref name="AMbookA" /&gt;

[[File:Kylix before and after conservation - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Kylix before and after conservation - restoration.]]
'''Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects''' is a process dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from ceramic. Typically this activity of [[conservation-restoration]] is undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]], especially when dealing with object of [[cultural heritage]]. Ceramics are created from a production of coatings of inorganic, nonmetallic materials using heating and cooling to create a glaze. Typically the coatings are permanent and sustainable for utilitarian and decorative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctioa.org/index.cfm?pi=GL&amp;gaction=list&amp;grp=C Ceramic Tile and Stone Standards]. Ctioa.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The cleaning, handling, storage, and in general treatment of ceramics is consistent with that of [[glass]] because they are made of similar [[oxygen]]-rich components such as [[silica]]tes.&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Margaret|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection.

Abrams, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-3174-5|pages=97–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration of ceramics ==
It is in the nature of all the materials used for construction to eventually degrade and deteriorate. Degradation of an object occurs as a result of the interaction between the environment or with the materials that form the object however, in the case of ceramics, environmental factors are the major cause. There are several ways in which ceramics break down physically and chemically.

Additionally the type of ceramic will affect how it will break down. Unfired clay, like [[mud]] and clay [[adobe]], is clay that is fired under 1000&amp;nbsp;°C or 1832&amp;nbsp;°F. This type of clay is water-soluble and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000-1200&amp;nbsp;°C or 1832°-2192&amp;nbsp;°F. The firing makes the clay water [[insoluble]] but does not allow the formation of an extensive glassy or [[Glass|vitreous]] within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400&amp;nbsp;°C or 2192-2552&amp;nbsp;°F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface.&lt;ref name="Craft"/&gt;{{rp|p.98}} However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.

=== Physical degradation ===
Due to their fragility, damage to ceramics typically comes from mishandling and packing. However, other factors such as [[vandalism]], [[frost]], [[mold]], and other similar occurrences can also inflect harm.&lt;ref name="Buys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buys|first=Susan|title=The Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics|year=1993|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0 7506 0957 5|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manufacturing defects ====
Also known as inherent vice, the intrinsic instability of the fabric and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within the fabric of the material and therefore is a natural occurrence. [[Wear|Deterioration]] of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects in the piece.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}} This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}

==== Impact and abrasions ====
With its delicate nature, ceramics that have been used over a period of time will sustain cracks, nicks, and blemishes. Additionally in a museum environment, damages can occur from packing storing, and handling of objects.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.22}}

==== Frost ====
Damage can occur when ceramics are exposed to freezing temperatures and frost. The problem occurs when [[ice]] [[crystals]] form inside of the pores of the ceramic piece. The frost inside of the pores will exert pressure onto the fabric of the pottery and cause the material to crack and break.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.24}}

==== Mold growth ====
Opposite of frost is heat and humidity. When the humidity is high [[mold]]s can begin to form on ceramic, particularly ones in which there is no glaze. Spores of molds are found throughout the atmosphere and will attached to any organic residues nearby, such as ceramics. Earthenware ceramics are frequently affected due to their porosity and lack of glaze.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.25}}

=== Chemical degradation ===
{{About||Additional information on chemical degradation|Chemical decomposition}}
Chemical degradation of objects occurs not in the physical structure of the object but rather in at the chemical or compound level. Compounds begin to breakdown into more simpler compounds and is often an undesired reaction. The degradation of the chemical component of an object will hinder or weaken the stability of the object when exposed to environmental factors such as water, air, pollution, heat, humidity, and the like.

==== Water ====
Water can dissolve or deform ceramics that have been low fired, i.e. temperatures around 600&amp;nbsp;°C. Ceramic fired in high temperatures may also be susceptible to water if their mineral particles are soluble in water, for example [[Gypsum]] or [[calcite]]. Additionally the different compounds in water can flux and react in different ways to different ceramics. In naturally occurring water, [[carbon dioxide]] is dissolved and can create a chemical reaction with minerals in clay bodies that may form [[calcium bicarbonate]] which is very soluble. Stagnant water is less damaging because the carbon dioxide is not exhausted.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

==== Soluble salts ====
A common degradation issue in ceramics involves [[soluble]] [[salts]]. Soluble salts can either enter the [[clay]] body from the environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to the components of the materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they [[crystallize]]. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Over time, the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}}

== Preventive care of ceramics ==
{{Main|Collections care}}
In the realm of conservation there are two distinct practices: non-interventive and active conservation. Non-interventive types of conservation are used to control the surrounding environment such as light, humidity, and temperature. Active conservation is when a conservator practices treatments to alleviate physical problems in the object such as fading, chipping, or breaks.

=== Display ===
Although ceramics are utilitarian, some pieces are made to be artwork and therefore displayed. Displaying an object improperly can cause damages either physical or chemically from the environment. One of the most common causes for damages is a ceramic piece falling over or off a shelf. To prevent this issue, many historic houses will line storage and display shelves with a thin layer of ethafoam ([[polyethylene]] foam) or [[bubble wrap]].&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.63}}

=== Storage ===
[[File:Ceramic ring housed in blue board box.JPG|right|thumb|300px|This ceramic ring is housed in a blue board box with an acrylic plastic lid. The ring is laid upon a layer of carved ethafoam to prevent it from shifting during handling.]]
Ceramics are very delicate in nature and damages can occur even when they are stored away. The most common way in which ceramics become damaged is when they are stacked one inside the other. Unless this is part of the original design, this will typically cause nicks, cracks, or breaks. Some ceramics, depending on their provenance, survive better in different temperature and [[humidity]] conditions. [[Pottery]] that has been buried, such as from an archaeological site, adheres better to storage at a constant low humidity. Low humidity will help to keep any salts from [[efflorescing]] which can mar the surface as well as remove the surface glaze.&lt;ref name=Bachmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachmann|first=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|year=1992|publisher=Smithonsian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general ceramics are typically inert and are not sensitive to elevated light levels. However, extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause chemical and physical damage. Typically museums strive to store ceramics, as well as many other material types, in a stable temperature of 68&amp;nbsp;°F with ± 3°.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}} Additionally relative humidity should be stabilized at 50% also with a ±5%. Storing objects near windows, heaters, fireplaces, and exterior walls can create an unstable environment with temperature and humidity fluctuation and increase potential for damages.

Some storing materials can be harmful to ceramic objects. [[Wool]] [[felt]] attracts and harbors insects including [[moths]] and [[silverfish]] which can be potentially very harmful to other collection material types. [[Polyurethane]] foam deteriorates over time which leaves a by-product that are sticky and acidic.&lt;ref name="Craft"/&gt;{{rp|p.102}}

=== Handling ===
One of the cardinal rules in object handling is to treat every object as if it is fragile and easily breakable. Museum technicians, curators, and conservators are trained to prepare a moving plan before an object is even touched that way minimal damage can occur when handling or moving an object. In the museum field is it a known fact that a vessel, or any object, should be held and handled by its strongest part, such as the base, and with both hands. Areas such as the handle or neck of a vessel tend to be the weakest points and may break if picked up by these components.&lt;ref name="Bachmann"/&gt;{{rp|p.98}}

== Removal of previous conservation actions ==
Damages also occur to ceramics from previous restoration. Although the intent was to repair the object for use or display, some dated practices are now known to increase damages either physically, from rivets or staples, or chemically, from old used adhesives that off-gas.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}}

=== Removal of surface coating ===
Overpaint is a technique that is used to cover imperfection on the surface of a ceramic piece. Differences can be seen to the naked eye due to discoloration, being matched poorly, and change in texture or gloss. subtle difference can also been seen by restorers by using lighting and magnification. Overpaint and surface coatings can be removed either mechanically or with the use of solvents.

Mechanical removal of overpaint include physical techniques to remove the coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, [[white spirit]], industrial methylated spirits ([[denatured alcohol]]), [[acetone]], and [[Dichloromethane]] which is usually found in the form of a commercial [[paint stripper]]. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.75–77}}

=== Removal of filling materials ===
Fill materials are used to fill in missing parts or breaks in a ceramic piece in order to stabilize the piece. A wide range of materials and techniques have been used to restore losses in ceramics. Today the most common filling materials are made from calcium-sulphate-based fillers or synthetic resins based on epoxy, acrylic, or polyester resin. These new resins are stronger and do not harm the object. Removing previous filling materials, either mechanically or chemically, and replacing them with new fillers can help keep the piece strong and stable.

Fillers can be removed physically by mechanical ways, depending on the filler material type.  Cement mortar can be chiselled away with a hammer and chisel gradually. Plaster is easily removed through mechanical methods such as chiselling and chipping away with sharp implements. Saws, drills, and other mechanical methods can be used to remove the bulk of protruding materials, however scratches, chips, and breaks can occur.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.77–78}}

A second option to removing filler material is chemically. Typically, chemical removal is used once the bulk of filler material is left and only a small portion is left.

Unlike adhesives, fills tend to be easier to remove and dismantle from ceramics. Plaster of Paris is one example of a fill that comes apart easily with warm.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.37}}

=== Removal of adhesives ===
[[Image:Minoan Ceramic 2.jpg|right|thumb|375px|A Minoan ceramic piece from the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion that has gone under restoration]]
The selection for the proper solvent is based on the identification of the adhesive itself. Every adhesive has a particular solvent that work best to break down its chemical composition. Color, hardness, and other physical properties will allow for identification of the adhesive. The adhesive can be soften once exposed, either in a liquid of [[vapor]] form, of the solvent for some time. The length of time depends on the solubility of the adhesive and the thickness of the joint. Porous bodies, low-fired clays, are sometimes pre-soaked in water to prevent the adhesive from being drawn back into the body once it joins with the removal solution. If the adhesive that is being removed is part of the support for the object, then supports, such as tissue paper or propping up the object, will be used to make sure the object does not sustain damages once the adhesive is removed. Sometimes if the adhesive is not softened enough if will remove part of the surface on the ceramic if pressure is applied. The information on solvents for specific adhesives are found below, under each adhesive section.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.78–79}}

== Cleaning ==
Removal of surface dirt and deposits is beneficial for the health and longevity of an object because it will prevent the dirt from becoming drawn into the body. Dust and grease may be held on the surface loosely by electrostatic forces or weak chemical bonds and are easily removed. Some deposits, such as [[calcium salts]], can be strongly attached to a ceramic surface, especially if the surface is unglazed. There are two main methods in which ceramics are cleaned and treated: mechanically and chemically.

Not all ceramic pieces are dry when they need cleaning. Some ceramics, such as those that are excavated archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier to do before the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.

=== Mechanical methods ===
Mechanical methods include [[dust]]ing, picking and cutting, and abrading. Mechanical cleaning is typically much easier to control than chemical treatments and there is no danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of mechanical cleaning is the potential for the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered to the surface of the ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with delicate [[vacuum cleaner]] with a soft, [[muslin]]-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there are hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adheres to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure.

Abrading is the process in which surface deposits are removed using [[abrasive]]s. Abrasives come in both solid and [[cream]] forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber brush or a [[rubber]] [[Dental drill#Dental burr|burr]] on a dental drill. Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of [[insoluble]] surface deposits such calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have [[oil]], [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]], or [[bleach]] as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.86–87}}

=== Chemical methods ===
Chemical methods for cleaning ceramics involve water, solvents, acids, and alkalis. Prolonged soaking in water may be used as a conservation method. The goal is to either remove stains from the surface or to remove the soluble salts in the clay body.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

== Repair and restoration==
The repair and restoration of ceramics has occurred since ceramics were invented including fillings, adhesives, reinforcements, and even patch work. The history of ceramic repair is vast and ranges from different methods and methodologies. For example, in 16th century China, people would repair broken ceramics by using pieces from other objects to disguise the patch. A sixteenth-century manuscript describes the process of patching broken ceramics:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 16th century - "Old pieces of porcelain from any famous kiln such as censers lack ears or feet or if vases have damaged mouth rims one can use old bits to patch the old; and if one adds glaze and then bakes it is just the same as the old. But the colour is weak at the patch. Yet people prefer this to the new stuff. And if one uses the method of blowing the glaze on to the patched parts there is still less of a trace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=G|title=The Potteries of China|year=1951|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|}
 
Today there are new advances in ceramic restoration including consolidation, bonding, adhesives, dowels, rivets, and fillers.

=== Consolidation ===
Consolidation is the process in which the fabric of the ceramic is strengthened by introducing a material into the fabric that will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include [[isocyanates]], [[silanes]], siloxnes, and [[methyl methacrylate]]s, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.106}}

==== Adhesives ====
{{For|Additional information on Adhesives|Adhesive}}
[[File:Cattien ceramic bowl.png|right|thumb|275px|Repaired ceramic bowl from the National Museum of Vietnam History]]
A chemical compound that adheres or bonds items together, such as pieces of ceramic. In ceramic conservation there are several different types that range from natural to man-made adhesives. Conservators characterise the best [[adhesive]] as one which can be undone.

===== Animal glue =====
{{About||Additional information on Animal Glue|Animal glue}}
Animal glue is an adhesive that contains various animal parts such as bone, skin, or fish and is widely used. It is a soft adhesive and can appear white, but usually has a pale yellow or brown appearance. Animal glue is very soft and can easily be broken down and removed with warm water and steam.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Nigel|title=Porcelain: repair and restoration, a handbook|year=2002|publisher=The British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=0 7141 2757 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although easily reversible, the relative ease with which the glue breaks down makes it a less strong bonding method.

===== Shellac =====
{{About||Additional information on Shellac|Shellac}}
A widely used old adhesive that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive is very hard and becomes increasingly more brittle over time. Shellac does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is [[Industrial methylated spirit]] or (IMA).&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.31}} Shellac is prepared by dissolving flakes of shellac in hot [[alcohol]]. The properties of shellac make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to shellac under the hot light of photography.&lt;ref name="Koob 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Removal of Aged Shellac Adhesive from Ceramics|journal=Studies in Conservation|year=1979|volume=24|pages=134–135|doi=10.1179/sic.1979.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Epoxy resin =====
{{About||Additional information on epoxy Resin|Epoxy}}
This type of resin is typically used post-1930s and is an indication of modern conservation work. Generally epoxy is very hard but unlike shellac is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin is an indication of aging. Warm to hot water or [[acetone]] are known to be the solvents of this adhesive.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.31}}

===== Rubber adhesives =====
{{About||Additional information on rubber adhesives|Rubber cement}}
Rubber cements are solutions of synthetic or natural rubber products in solvents, with or without resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic due to the nature of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including [[silver]], because it can cause discoloration.&lt;ref name="Hatchfield"/&gt;{{rp|p.99}} Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Vinyl acetate polymers =====
{{About||Additional information on Vinyl acetate polymers|Vinyl acetate}}
Vinyl acetate polymers include polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetal; all come from reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates are known to be acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead.&lt;ref name=Hatchfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchfield|first=Pamela|title=Pollutants in the Museum Environment: Practical Strategies for Problem Solving in Design, Exhibition and Storage|year=2002|publisher=Archetype Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=1-873132-96-4|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Cellulose nitrate =====
{{About||Additional information on Cellulose nitrate|Nitrocellulose}}
There are early and modern forms of this adhesive. While both tend to tinge with yellow as they age, the early form tends to become more brittle than the modern version, which contains a [[plasticizer]] to make the compound more stable. As with many adhesives, acetone is generally used as a solvent, however IMS can also be used.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Paraloid B-72 =====
{{About||Additional information on Paraloid B-72|Paraloid B-72}}
B-72 is a [[thermoplastic]] resin that was created by Rohm and Haas for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for [[Flexographic ink]]. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike cellulose nitrate, B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] is a chemical that can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Additionally research shows that the silica will better distribute stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of the solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

=== Dowels and rivets ===
[[Dowel]]s and [[rivet]]s are physical ways in which ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. Dowels are cylindrical rods that consist of [[wood]], [[metal]], or [[plastic]]. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive that is used to repair the ceramic piece. Removing dowels can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through dowels with a [[piercing saw]] and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.40}}

Riveting is a process in which holes are drilled in the surface of the ceramic, but does not go completely through the piece. The rivets are angled toward the joint and provide additional structural support.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.81}} There are two methods to removing rivets: the 'cut' and 'pull'. The 'cut' method consists of cutting the rivets through the middle with a file and then pulled out. The 'pull' method involves placing a thin blade under the rivet and pushing out any [[plaster]] packing. This method uses leverage to pull the rivet from the ceramic piece.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.38}}

=== Fillers ===
Fillers are used to replace gaps and losses from ceramic materials for either aesthetic reasons or for support. There are several different filler materials used in ceramics including [[plaster of Paris]] and other commercially available [[putties]] and fillers.

Plaster of Paris is a material that consists of [[calcium sulphate]] hemihydrate power and is produced by heating [[gypsum]] to 120&amp;nbsp;°C. The chemical formula is as follows: :CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''Heat'' → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·½H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  1½ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (released as steam). When mixed with water, an [[exothermic reaction]] occurs and forms a hard white filling similar to density of fired ceramics. Different grades of plasters are available and vary based on their particle size, setting time, density, expansion, and color.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.198}}

A thermoplastic [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[wax]] resin mixture developed by John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 can be used to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as [[alabaster]], [[marble]], [[calcite]], [[diorite]], and [[anhydrite]]. The mixture consists of [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVAC) AYAC, [[ethylene]] [[acrylic acid]] (EAA) [[copolymers]] A-C 540, and 580, [[antioxidants]] Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry [[pigment]]s, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are [[toxic]] and [[Poison|noxious]]. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.&lt;ref name=Wax&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gansicke|first=Susanne|author2=Hirx, John|title=The Translucent Wax-Resin Fill Material for the Compensation of Losses in Objects|journal=Journal of American Institute for Conservation|year=1997|volume=36|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1179/019713697806113648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retouching ===

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12100">'''Cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylases''', also termed '''cytochrome P450 ω-hydroxylases''', '''CYP450 omega hydroxylases''', '''CYP450 ω-hydroxylases''', '''CYP omega hydroxylase''', '''CYP ω-hydroxylases''', '''fatty acid omega hydroxylases''', '''cytochrome P450 monooxygenases''', and '''fatty acid monooxygenases''', are a set of [[cytochrome P450]]-containing enzymes that catalyze the addition of a [[hydroxyl]] residue to a [[fatty acid]] [[Substrate (chemistry)]].  The CYP omega hydroxylases are often referred to as monoxygenases; however, the [[monooxygenase]]s are CYP450 enzymes that add a hydroxyl group to a wide range of [[xenobiotic]] (e.g. drugs, industrial toxins) and naturally occurring endobiotic (e.g. cholesterol) substrates, most of which are not fatty acids. The CYP450 omega hydroxylases are accordingly better viewed as a subset of monooxygenases that have the ability to hydroxylate fatty acids. While once regarded as functioning mainly in the [[catabolism]] of dietary fatty acids, the omega oxygenases are now considered critical in the production or break-down of fatty acid-derived mediators which are made by cells and act within their cells of origin as [[autocrine signaling]] agents or on nearby cells as [[paracrine signaling]] agents to regulate various functions such as blood pressure control and inflammation.

==Action==
The omega oxygenases metabolize fatty acids (RH) by adding a hydroxyl (OH) to their terminal (i.e. furthest from the fatty acids' carboxy residue) carbons; in the reaction, the two atoms of molecular oxygen(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ are reduced to one hydroxyl group and one water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule) by the concomitant oxidation of [[NAD(P)H]] (see [[monooxygenase]]).&lt;ref name="PUB00000123"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harayama S, Kok M, Neidle EL |title=Functional and evolutionary relationships among diverse oxygenases |journal=Annu.

==Functions==
CYP450 enzymes belong to a superfamily which in humans is composed of at least 57 CYPs; within this superfamily, members of six CYP4A subfamilies, (which are CYP4A, CYP4B, CYP4F, CYP4V, CYP4X, and CYP4z) possess ω-hydroxylase activity viz., CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4F&lt;ref name="Panigrahy_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panigrahy D, Kaipainen A, Greene ER, Huang S | title = Cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids: the neglected pathway in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 723–35 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 20941528 | pmc = 2962793 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9264-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15822183 | year = 2005 | author1 = Kroetz | first1 = D.

==Ida Craddock==
[[File:IdaCraddock.jpg|thumb|right|Occultist and sex reformer [[Ida Craddock]]]]
Ida Craddock (August 1, 1857 – October 16, 1902) was a 19th-century American occultist, Theosophist, and  author, sex reformer and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Chappell | first = Vere | title = Ida Craddock: Sexual Mystic and Martyr for Freedom | accessdate = 2009-08-10 | url = http://www.idacraddock.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craddock developed an interest in the [[occult]] through her association with the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning around 1887.  She tried in her writings to synthesize translated mystic literature and traditions from many cultures into a scholarly, distilled whole. Craddock became a student of religious eroticism and declared herself a Priestess and Pastor of the Church of Yoga.  Never married, Craddock eventually claimed to have a blissful ongoing marital relationship with an [[angel]] named Soph.  Craddock even stated that her intercourse with Soph was so noisy as to draw complaints from her neighbors.&lt;ref name=Schaechterle&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = OhioLINK; Bowling Green State University | last = Schaechterle | first = Inez L | title = Speaking of Sex: The Rhetorical Strategies of Frances Willard, Victoria Woodhull, and Ida Craddock | accessdate = 2009-08-10 | year = 2005 | url = http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother responded by threatening to burn Craddock's papers and unsuccessfully tried to have her institutionalized.

In Chicago, Craddock opened an office offering "mystical" sexual counseling to married couples via both walk-in counseling and mail order.  She dedicated herself to “preventing sexual evils and sufferings” by educating adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Burton | first = Shirley J | title = Women Making a Difference: Ida Craddock, Adelaide Johnson, and Laura Dainty Pelham | accessdate = 2009-08-10 | url = http://www.lib.niu.edu/1997/iht419722.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Shirley J.

Michigan Historical Review 19: 1 (1993): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Craddock authored "Heavenly Bridegrooms", in which she described her sexual relationship with a spiritual being she called Soph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/bridegrooms.html|title=Heavenly Bridegrooms|website=www.idacraddock.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, she authored "Psychic Wedlock", which provided further detail on her spiritual worldview and recommended training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/psychic.html|title=Psychic Wedlock|website=www.idacraddock.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craddock's three planes===
Craddock cites [[New Thought]] leader Alma Gillen, a London teacher of "Divine Healing"  (also called "Divine Science"), who divides the universe into three 'factors':  (1) The Thinker (that which thinks); (2) The mentality, "where thoughts are shaped"; and (3) "the body, the material life, where spirit finds expression as outward form."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/bridegrooms.html|title=Heavenly Bridegrooms|author=|date=|website=www.idacraddock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt51TBulIhwC&amp;pg=PA119|title=Heaven's Bride: The Unprintable Life of Ida C. Craddock, American Mystic, Scholar, Sexologist, Martyr, and Madwoman|first=Leigh Eric|last=Schmidt|date=7 December 2010|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Craddock explains that "it is incorrect to say 'I *have* spirit.' We should say 'I *am* a spirit'".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"/&gt; 

Craddock argues that "every act ... consists of three stages." which she illustrates by stating:  "Let us suppose a man: 
:1.  conceives the idea of pushing a ball out of his path;
:2.  he determines how the ball shall be pushed aside, with hand or foot, gently or powerfully, etc.;
:3.  at the command of his mentality, his body performs the act of moving the ball."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/psychic.html|title=Psychic Wedlock|author=|date=|website=www.idacraddock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craddock's three degrees of training===
Craddock refers to the first degree, known as "Alpha-ism", which she defines as "No sex union except for the distinct purpose of begetting a child".  Craddock emphasized the importance of Alpha-ism during pregnancy, claiming that "Modern researchers have shown the impressionability of the embryo child during gestation" and that "Napoleon the Great owed his remarkable military genius to the fact that, prior to his birth, his mother accompanied her husband through a military campaign."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"/&gt;

After mastering Alpha-ism,  Craddock's suggests readers consult Parkhurt's pamphlet "Diana" as an introduction to the second degree, which is "the most difficult of the three degrees to acquire, physiologically speaking, inasmuch as it exacts supreme self-control at a crucial moment."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"/&gt; But Craddock promises that "as the power of self-control is developed, it becomes and more possible for a man to do here just what he wills. And no man who has once acquired this power will ever care to return to the old habit of abandonment to passion; for he will see that he was then a slave, whereas now he is a king".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"/&gt;

Craddock writes that: "There is a belief among some occultists that an earnest wish breathed at that time, when husband and wife are one, will not fail to be granted. This opens, it is said, the door to those who practice what is called 'black magic', and enables them to work harm upon other human beings." Craddock continues: "What foundation there is for this belief as applied to the magicians I do not see. If it really be that a wish is granted then more readily than when the seeker is in any other mood, it is probably because the occultist who attains the second degree has to exercise such supreme self-control at that moment that he is complete master of his sub-consciousness".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"/&gt; 

According to Craddock the "Third and Highest Degree", involves "Communion with Deity as the third partner in marital union".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"/&gt;

In 1915, American author [[Theodore Schroeder]] published Ida Craddock's ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'', along with a brief introduction, in the pages of the journal ''The Alienist and Neurologist''.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpvqhORGQe4C&amp;pg=PT178|title=Aleister Crowley and Western Esotericism|first1=Henrik|last1=Bogdan|first2=Martin P.|last2=Starr|date=5 September 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlEvfflQZbIC&amp;pg=PA282|title=Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley|first=Richard|last=Kaczynski|date=7 August 2017|publisher=North Atlantic Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schroeder was an associate of occultist Aleister Crowley, and introduced Craddock's work to Crowley.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoybRLX4jqIC&amp;pg=PA245|title=Sexual Outlaw, Erotic Mystic: The Essential Ida Craddock|first=Vere|last=Chappell|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Weiser Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919,  Crowley reviewed ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'' in the pages of the journal ''[[The Equinox]]'', stating that it was:

The [[discrete dipole approximation]] (DDA) is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary geometry. Given a target of arbitrary geometry, one seeks to calculate its scattering and absorption properties. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire dipole moments in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled dipole approximation. It is closely related to method of moments, digitized Green's function, or volume integral equation method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5964">[[Image:Trees showing the presence of creep.jpg|thumb|Trees showing the effect of creep.{{fact|date=April 2016}}]]
'''Downhill creep''', also known as '''soil creep''' or commonly just '''creep''', is the slow [[Mass wasting|downward progression]] of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[soil]] down a low [[Grade (slope)|grade]] slope; it can also refer to slow deformation of such materials as a result of prolonged pressure and stress. Creep may appear to an observer to be continuous, but it really is the sum of numerous minute, discrete movements of slope material caused by the force of [[gravity]]. Friction, being the primary force to resist gravity, is produced when one body of material slides past another offering a mechanical resistance between the two which acts to hold objects (or slopes) in place. As slope on a hill increases, the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the slope decreases and results in less friction between the material that could cause the slope to slide.

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date = August 2013}}
The rate of soil creep down a slope depends on the steepness (gradient) of the slope, water absorption and content, type of sediment and material, and lastly vegetation. The rate of creep will take into account all of these factors to decide whether or not the hillside will progress downward. Creep is what is responsible for the rounded shape of hillsides.
[[File:Victorian_headstones,_England.JPG|right|thumb|A group of Victorian [[headstone]]s, [[England]]. Soil creep has led to the headstones being tilted at an angle over time.]]
Water is a very important factor when discussing soil deformation and movement. For instance, a sandcastle will only stand up when it is made with damp sand. The water offers cohesion to the sand which binds the sand particles together. However, pouring water over the sandcastle destroys it. This is because the presence of too much water fills the pores between the grains with water creating a slip plane between the particles and offering no cohesion causing them to slip and slide away. This holds true for hillsides and creep as well. The presence of water may help the hillside stay put and give it cohesion, but in a very wet environment or during or after a large amount of precipitation the pores between the grains can become saturated with water and cause the ground to slide along the slip plane it creates.

[[Image:Hillside moving over a sidewalk.jpg|thumb|Creep has caused the soil to spread over this pavement.]]
Creep can also be caused by the expansion of materials such as [[clay]] when they are exposed to water. Clay expands when wet, then contracts after drying. The expansion portion pushes downhill, then the contraction results in consolidation at the new offset.

Objects resting on top of the soil are carried by it as it descends down the slope. This can be seen in churchyards, where older [[headstones]] are often situated at an angle and several metres away from where they were originally erected.

Vegetation plays a role with slope stability and creep. When a hillside contains many trees, ferns, and shrubs their roots create an interlocking network that can strengthen unconsolidated material. They also aid in absorbing the excess water in the soil to help keep the slope stable. However, they do add to the weight of the slope giving gravity that much more of a driving force to act on in pushing the slope downward. In general, though, slopes without vegetation have a greater chance of movement.

Design engineers sometimes need to guard against downhill creep during their planning to prevent building [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] from being undermined. Pilings are planted sufficiently deep into the surface material to guard against this behavior.

==Modeling regolith diffusion==
For shallow to moderate slopes, diffusional sediment flux is modeled linearly as (Culling, 1960; McKean et al., 1993)

&lt;math&gt;q_s = k_d S \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_d\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion constant, and &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is slope.  For steep slopes, diffusional sediment flux is more appropriately modeled as a non-linear function of slope&lt;ref name="Roering1999" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_s = \frac{k_d S}{1 - (S/S_c)^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the critical gradient for sliding of dry soil.

On long timescales, diffusive creep in hillslope soils leads to a characteristic rounding of ridges in the landscape.&lt;ref name="Roering1999"&gt;Roering, Joshua J., James W. Kirchner, and William E. Dietrich. "Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology." Water Resources Research 35.3 (1999): 853–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, N. A., and Robert S. Anderson. "Hillslope and channel evolution in a marine terraced landscape, Santa Cruz." California: Journal of Geophysical Research 99.B7 (1994): 14-013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, '''energy homeostasis''', or the '''homeostatic control of energy balance''', is a [[biological process]] that involves the coordinated [[homeostatic]] regulation of food intake (energy inflow) and energy expenditure (energy outflow).&lt;ref name="MetaReg2013"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Frayn KN|title=Metabolic Regulation: A Human Perspective|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118685334|pages=329–349|edition=3rd|chapter=Chapter 11: Energy Balance and Body Weight Regulation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdQ9NPIzMmsC&amp;pg=394#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-energy balance"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 179, 262–263 | edition = 2nd | quote = Orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral mediators that carry information about energy balance, including glucose, leptin, and ghrelin.&amp;nbsp;... Accordingly, orexin plays a role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, reward, and perhaps more generally in emotion.&amp;nbsp;... The regulation of energy balance involves the exquisite coordination of food intake and energy expenditure. Experiments in the 1940s and 1950s showed that lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) reduced food intake; hence, the normal role of this brain area is to stimulate feeding and decrease energy utilization. In contrast, lesions of the medial hypothalamus, especially the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) but also the PVN and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), increased food intake; hence, the normal role of these regions is to suppress feeding and increase energy utilization. Yet discovery of the complex networks of neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters acting within the hypothalamus and other brain regions to regulate food intake and energy expenditure began in earnest in 1994 with the cloning of the leptin (ob, for obesity) gene. Indeed, there is now explosive interest in basic feeding mechanisms given the epidemic proportions of obesity in our society, and the increased toll of the eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Unfortunately, despite dramatic advances in the basic neurobiology of feeding, our understanding of the etiology of these conditions and our ability to intervene clinically remain limited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homeostatic control of energy balance"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton GJ, Meek TH, Schwartz MW | title = Neurobiology of food intake in health and disease | journal = Nat.

An emerging concept in the neurobiology of food intake is that neurocircuits exist that are normally inhibited, but when activated in response to emergent or stressful stimuli they can override the homeostatic control of energy balance.

Energy homeostasis is an important aspect of [[bioenergetics]].

==Definition==
In the US, biological energy is expressed using the energy unit [[Calorie]] with a capital C (i.e. a kilocalorie), which equals the energy needed to increase the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;kilogram of water by 1&amp;nbsp;°C (about 4.18&amp;nbsp;k[[Joule|J]]).&lt;ref&gt;David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker, Fundamentals of physics, 9th edition,John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2011, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Energy balance, through [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic reactions]], can be measured with the following equation:&lt;ref name="MetaReg2013" /&gt;
:''Energy intake (from food and fluids) = Energy expended (through work and heat generated) + Change in stored energy ([[Adipose tissue|body fat]] and [[glycogen]] storage)''

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. But energy can be converted from one form of energy to another. So, when a calorie of food energy is consumed, one of three particular effects occur within the body: a portion of that calorie may be stored as [[body fat]], [[triglyceride]]s, or [[glycogen]], transferred to cells and converted to chemical energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP&amp;nbsp;– a [[coenzyme]]) or related compounds, or dissipated as [[heat]].&lt;ref name="MetaReg2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature2006KMSB /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2645124"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Field JB | title = Exercise and deficient carbohydrate storage and intake as causes of hypoglycemia | journal = Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–161 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2645124 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==

===Intake===
Energy intake is measured by the amount of calories consumed from food and fluids.&lt;ref name="MetaReg2013" /&gt; Energy intake is modulated by hunger, which is primarily regulated by the [[hypothalamus]],&lt;ref name="MetaReg2013" /&gt; and choice, which is determined by the sets of brain structures that are responsible for [[stimulus control]] (i.e., [[operant conditioning]] and [[classical conditioning]]) and [[cognitive control]] of eating behavior.&lt;ref name="Cognitive control of eating behavior"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziauddeen H, Alonso-Alonso M, Hill JO, Kelley M, Khan NA | title = Obesity and the neurocognitive basis of food reward and the control of intake | journal = Adv Nutr | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 474–86 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26178031 | pmc = 4496739 | doi = 10.3945/an.115.008268 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stimulus control of eating behavior"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weingarten HP | title = Stimulus control of eating: implications for a two-factor theory of hunger | journal = Appetite | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 387–401 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3911890 | doi = 10.1016/S0195-6663(85)80006-4 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunger is regulated in part by the action of certain [[peptide hormone]]s and [[neuropeptide]]s (e.g., [[insulin]], [[leptin]], [[ghrelin]], and [[neuropeptide Y]], among others) in the [[hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="MetaReg2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghrelin and Leptin review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klok MD, Jakobsdottir S, Drent ML | title = The role of leptin and ghrelin in the regulation of food intake and body weight in humans: a review | journal = Obes Rev | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–34 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17212793 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00270.x | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expenditure===
{{Further|Caloric deficit}}

Energy expenditure is mainly a sum of internal heat produced and external work. The internal heat produced is, in turn, mainly a sum of [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR) and the [[thermic effect of food]]. External work may be estimated by measuring the [[physical activity level]] (PAL).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Imbalance===
{{Further|Nutrition disorder}}

===Positive balance===
A positive balance is a result of ''energy intake'' being ''higher'' than what is consumed in external work and other bodily means of energy expenditure.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The main preventable causes are:
*[[Overeating]], resulting in increased energy intake
*[[Sedentary lifestyle]], resulting in decreased energy expenditure through external work

A positive balance results in energy being stored as [[fat]] and/or [[muscle]], causing [[weight gain]]. In time, [[overweight]] and [[obesity]] may develop, with resultant complications.

===Negative balance===
A negative balance is a result of energy intake being less than what is consumed in external work and other bodily means of energy expenditure.

The main cause is ''undereating'' due to a medical condition such as [[anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[digestive disease]], or due to some circumstance such as fasting or lack of access to food. [[Hyperthyroidism]] can also be a cause.

===Requirement===
Normal energy requirement, and therefore normal energy intake, depends mainly on age, sex and [[physical activity level]] (PAL). The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]] has compiled a detailed report on human energy requirements: [http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5686e/y5686e00.HTM Human energy requirements (Rome, 17&amp;ndash;24 October 2001)] An older but commonly used and fairly accurate method is the [[Harris-Benedict equation]].

Yet, there are currently ongoing studies to show if [[calorie restriction]] to below normal values have beneficial effects, and even though they are showing positive indications in primates&lt;ref name="Anderson09"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson RM, Shanmuganayagam D, Weindruch R |title=Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys |journal=Toxicol Pathol |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=47–51 |year=2009 |pmid=19075044 |doi=10.1177/0192623308329476 |url=|pmc=3734859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19264119"/&gt; it is still not certain if calorie restriction has a positive effect on longevity for primates and humans.&lt;ref name="Anderson09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19264119"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rezzi S, Martin FP, Shanmuganayagam D, Colman RJ, Nicholson JK, Weindruch R |title=Metabolic shifts due to long-term caloric restriction revealed in nonhuman primates |journal=Exp. Gerontol. |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=356–62 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19264119 |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2009.02.008 |url= |pmc=2822382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calorie restriction may be viewed as attaining energy balance at a lower intake and expenditure, and is, in this sense, not generally an energy imbalance, except for an initial imbalance where decreased expenditure hasn't yet matched the decreased intake.

==Society and culture==
There has been controversy over energy-balance messages that downplay energy intake being promoted by food industry groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = O’Connor| first = Anahad| title = Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets| work = Well| accessdate = 2018-03-24| date = 2015-08-09| url = https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental flows''' describe the quantity, timing, and quality of '''water flows''' required to sustain [[freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]] and [[estuarine]] [[ecosystem]]s and the human livelihoods and well being that depend on these ecosystems. In the [[India]]n context [[river]] flows required for [[Culture|cultural]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] needs assumes significance.&lt;ref&gt;http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/exec_summary_mail_1_28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eflownet.org/viewinfo.cfm?linkcategoryid=4&amp;linkid=64&amp;siteid=1&amp;FuseAction=display&lt;/ref&gt;  Through implementation of environmental flows, water managers strive to achieve a flow regime, or pattern, that provides for human uses and maintains the essential processes required to support healthy [[river ecosystem]]s. Environmental flows do not necessarily require restoring the natural, pristine flow patterns that would occur absent human development, use, and diversion but, instead, are intended to produce a broader set of values and benefits from rivers than from management focused strictly on water supply, energy, recreation, or [[flood control]].

Rivers are parts of integrated systems that include [[floodplains]] and [[riparian corridor]]s.  Collectively these systems provide a large suite of benefits.  However, the world's rivers are increasingly being altered through the construction of dams, diversions, and [[levee]]s. More than half of the world's large rivers are dammed,&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, C., Reidy, C. A., Dynesius, M., and Revenga, C. 2005. Fragmentation and flow regulation of the world's large river systems.  Science 308:405-408.&lt;/ref&gt; a figure that continues to increase.  Almost 1,000 dams are planned or under construction in South America and 50 new dams are planned on China's Yangtze River alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/riverslakes/reducing-the-ecological-impact-of-dams.xml Rivers and Lakes: Reducing the Ecological Impact of Dams]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dams and other river structures change the downstream flow patterns and consequently affect water quality, temperature, sediment movement and deposition, fish and wildlife, and the livelihoods of people who depend on healthy river ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Postel, S., and Richter, B. 2003. Rivers for Life: Managing Water for People and Nature. Island Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental flows seek to maintain these river functions while at the same time providing for traditional offstream benefits.

==Evolution of environmental flow concepts and recognition==
From the turn of the 20th century through the 1960s, [[water management]] in [[developed nations]] focused largely on maximizing [[flood protection]], [[water supplies]], and [[hydropower]] generation.  During the 1970s, the ecological and economic effects of these projects prompted scientists to seek ways to modify [[dam]] operations to maintain certain fish species.  The initial focus was on determining the minimum flow necessary to preserve an individual species, such as [[trout]], in a river. Environmental flows evolved from this concept of "minimum flows" and, later, "instream flows", which emphasized the need to keep water within waterways.

By the 1990s, scientists came to realize that the biological and social systems supported by rivers are too complicated to be summarized by a single minimum flow requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, S. E., and Arthington, A. H. 2002. Basic principles and ecological consequences of altered flow regimes for aquatic [[biodiversity]].

{{See also|Stream restoration}}
One effort currently underway to restore environmental flows is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321045053/http://www.conservationgateway.org/content/sustainable-rivers Sustainable Rivers Project], a collaboration between [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) and [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE), which is the largest water manager in the United States.  Since 2002, TNC and the USACE have been working to define and implement environmental flows by altering the operations of USACE dams in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321045155/http://www.conservationgateway.org/file/sustainable-rivers-project-current-sites 8 rivers] across 12 states.  Dam reoperation to release environmental flows, in combination with floodplain restoration, has in some instances increased the water available for [[hydropower]] production while reducing flood risk.

[[Arizona]]'s [[Bill Williams River]], flowing downstream of [[Alamo Dam]], is one of the rivers featured in the Sustainable Rivers Project.  Having discussed modifying dam operations since the early 1990s, local stakeholders began to work with TNC and USACE in 2005 to identify specific strategies for improving the ecological health and biodiversity of the river basin downstream from the dam.  Scientists compiled the best available information and worked together to define [http://www.fort.usgs.gov/products/publications/21745/21745.pdf environmental flows for the Bill Williams River].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey, 2006.

Beauchamp.&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all of the recommended environmental flow components could be implemented immediately, the USACE has changed its operations of Alamo Dam to incorporate more natural low flows and controlled floods. Ongoing monitoring is capturing resulting ecological responses such as rejuvenation of native willow-cottonwood forest, suppression of invasive and non-native tamarisk, restoration of more natural densities of beaver dams and associated lotic-lentic habitat, changes in aquatic insect populations, and enhanced [[groundwater recharge]]. USACE engineers continue to consult with scientists on a regular basis and use the monitoring results to further refine operations of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;Shafroth, P., Wilcox, A., Lytle, D., Hickey, J., Andersen, D., Beauchamp, V., Hautzinger, A., McMullen, L., and Warner, A. 2010.

Due to very limited available data, innovative approaches were developed for estimating flow needs based on experiences and observations of the local people who depend on this nearly pristine river reach.&lt;ref&gt;Esselman, P.

==Methods, tools, and models==
More than 200 methods are used worldwide to prescribe river flows needed to maintain healthy rivers.

To facilitate environmental flow prescriptions, a number of computer models and tools have been developed by groups such as the USACE's [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/ Hydrologic Engineering Center] to capture flow requirements defined in a workshop setting (e.g., [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-rpt/ HEC-RPT]) or to evaluate the implications of environmental flow implementation (e.g., [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ressim/ HEC-ResSim], [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/ HEC-RAS], and [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-efm/index.html HEC-EFM]).
Additionally, a [[2D geometric model|2D]] model is developed from a [[3D modeling|3D]] turbulence model based on Smagorinsky large eddy closure to more appropriately model environmental large scale flows.&lt;ref&gt;Cao, M. and Roberts, A. J. 2012. Modelling 3D turbulent floods based upon the Smagorinski large eddy closure. Proceedings of the 18th Australasian Fluid Mechanics Conference Published by the Australasian Fluid Mechanics Society.&lt;/ref&gt; This model is based on a [[slow manifold]] of the turbulent Smagorinsky large eddy closure instead of conventional depth-averaging flow equations.

Other tried and tested environmental flow assessment methods include DRIFT (King et al. 2003), which was recently used in the Kishenganga HPP dispute between Pakistan and India at the International Court of Arbitration.

==In India==

In [[India]], the need for environmental flows has emerged from the hundreds of large [[dams]] being planned in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] rivers for hydro power generation. The cascades of dams planned across the [[Lohit district|Lohit]], [[Dibang River]] in the [[Brahmaputra River]] , the [[Alaknanda River|Alaknanda]] and [[Bhagirathi River]] in the [[Ganga river|Ganga]] basin and the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] in [[Sikkim]] for example, would end up in the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert Appraisal Committee of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]]) on releasing e-flows from dams. However, these recommendations have never been backed by strong objectives about why certain e-flow releases are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/eflows_primer_062012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710223754/http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/attached-files/eflows_primer_062012.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eukaryotic initiation factor 3''' ('''eIF3''') is a [[multiprotein complex]] that functions during the initiation phase of [[eukaryotic translation]].&lt;ref name="Aitken"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aitken|first1=Colin E.|last2=Lorsch|first2=Jon R.|title=A mechanistic overview of translation initiation in eukaryotes|journal=Nat.

In humans, eIF3 consists of 13 nonidentical subunits (eIF3a-m) with a combined molecular weight of ~800 kDa, making it the largest [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|translation initiation factor]].&lt;ref name="Hershey"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of eIF3 and its individual subunits in cancer|journal = Biochim.

== Function ==
eIF3 stimulates nearly all steps of translation initiation.&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt;  eIF3 also appears to participate in other phases of translation, such as recycling, where it promotes the splitting of post-termination ribosomes.&lt;ref name=Pisarev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pisarev|first1=Andrey V.|last2=Hellen|first2=Christopher U.

== Interactions ==
eIF3 binds the [[Eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|small ribosomal subunit (40S)]] at and near its solvent side and serves as a scaffold for several other initiation factors, the auxiliary factor [[DHX29]], and [[mRNA]]. eIF3 is a component of the multifactor complex (MFC) and [[43S preinitiation complex|43S]] and [[48S preinitiation complex|48S]] preinitiation complexes (PICs).&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt; The interactions of eIF3 with other initiation factors can vary amongst species; for example, mammalian eIF3 directly interacts with the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F|eIF4F]] complex (via [[eIF4G]]), while budding yeast lacks this connection.&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt; However, both mammalian and yeast eIF3 independently bind [[eIF1]], [[eIF4B]], and [[eIF5]].&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Richard J.|last2=Hellen|first2=Christopher U.

Several subunits of eIF3 contain [[RNA recognition motif|RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)]] and other RNA binding domains to form a multisubunit RNA binding interface through which eIF3 interacts with cellular and viral [[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]] mRNA, including the [[HCV IRES]].&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt; eIF3 has also been shown to specifically bind [[N6-Methyladenosine|m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A]] modified RNA within [[Five prime untranslated region|5'UTRs]] to promote cap-independent translation.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Kate D.|last2=Patil|first2=Deepak P.|last3=Zhou|first3=Jun|last4=Zinoviev|first4=Alexandra|last5=Skabkin|first5=Maxim A.|last6=Elemento|first6=Olivier|last7=Pestova|first7=Tatyana V.|last8=Qiang|first8=Shu-Bing|last9=Jaffrey|first9=Samie R.|title=5' UTR m6A Promotes Cap-Independent Translation|journal=Cell|date=November 2015|volume=163|pages=999–1010|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.012|pmid=26593424|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)01325-2|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signaling ==
eIF3 serves as a hub for cellular signaling through [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]] and [[mTORC1|mTOR]]/[[RPTOR|Raptor]].&lt;ref name="Holz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holz|first1=Marina K.|last2=Ballif|first2=Bryan A.|last3=Gygi|first3=Steven P.|last4=Blenis|first4=John|title=mTOR and S6K1 Mediate Assembly of the Translation Preinitiation Complex through Dynamic Protein Interchange and Ordered Phosphorylation Events|journal=Cell|date=2005|volume=123|pages=569–580|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.024|pmid=16286006|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01157-8|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, eIF3 is bound by S6K1 in its inactive state, and activated mTOR/Raptor binds to eIF3 and phosphorylates S6K1 to promote its release from eIF3. Phosphorylated S6K1 is then free to phosphorylate a number of its own targets, including [[eIF4B]], thus serving as a mechanism of translational control.

== Disease ==
Individual subunits of eIF3 are overexpressed (a, b, c, h, i, and m) and underexpressed (e, f) in multiple human cancers.&lt;ref name="Hershey"/&gt; eIF3 has also been shown to bind a specific set of cell proliferation mRNAs and regulate their translation.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{Cite journal|title = eIF3 targets cell-proliferation messenger RNAs for translational activation or repression|journal = Nature|year = 2015|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7554/full/nature14267.html|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 25849773 |pages = 111–114|volume = 522|doi=10.1038/nature14267|language = en|first = Amy S.Y.|last = Lee|first2 = Philip J.|last2 = Kranusch|first3 = Jamie H.D.|last3 = Cate|pmc=4603833}}&lt;/ref&gt; eIF3 also functions in the life cycles of a number of important human pathogens, including [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]]. In particular, the d-subunit of eIF3 is a substrate of [[HIV-1 protease|HIV protease]], and genetic knockdown of eIF3 subunits d, e, or f results in increased viral infectivity for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="JägerCimermancic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jäger|first1=Stefanie|last2=Cimermancic|first2=Peter|last3=Gulbahce|first3=Natali|last4=Johnson|first4=Jeffrey R.|last5=McGovern|first5=Kathryn E.|last6=Clarke|first6=Starlynn C.|last7=Shales|first7=Michael|last8=Mercenne|first8=Gaelle|last9=Pache|first9=Lars|last10=Li|first10=Kathy|last11=Hernandez|first11=Hilda|last12=Jang|first12=Gwendolyn M.|last13=Roth|first13=Shoshannah L.|last14=Akiva|first14=Eyal|last15=Marlett|first15=John|last16=Stephens|first16=Melanie|last17=D’Orso|first17=Ivan|last18=Fernandes|first18=Jason|last19=Fahey|first19=Marie|last20=Mahon|first20=Cathal|last21=O’Donoghue|first21=Anthony J.|last22=Todorovic|first22=Aleksandar|last23=Morris|first23=John H.|last24=Maltby|first24=David A.|last25=Alber|first25=Tom|last26=Cagney|first26=Gerard|last27=Bushman|first27=Frederic D.|last28=Young|first28=John A.|last29=Chanda|first29=Sumit K.|last30=Sundquist|first30=Wesley I.|last31=Kortemme|first31=Tanja|last32=Hernandez|first32=Ryan D.|last33=Craik|first33=Charles S.|last34=Burlingame|first34=Alma|last35=Sali|first35=Andrej|last36=Frankel|first36=Alan D.|last37=Krogan|first37=Nevan J.|title=Global landscape of HIV–human protein complexes|journal=Nature|year=2011|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature10719|pmid=22190034|pmc=3310911|volume=481|pages=365–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">In [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], a '''full employment theorem''' is a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done.

For example, the ''full employment theorem for compiler writers'' states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to [[halting problem|detect non-terminating computations]] and reduce them to a one-instruction [[infinite loop]]. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the [[halting problem]], which cannot exist, making the proof itself an [[undecidable problem]].  This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist.  Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. Similarly, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] have been called full employment theorems for mathematicians. In [[theoretical computer science]] this field of study is known as [[Kolmogorov complexity]], or the smallest program which outputs a given string.

Tasks such as [[computer virus|virus]] writing and detection, and [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] filtering and filter-breaking are also subject to [[Rice's theorem]].

==Additional examples==
*[[No free lunch in search and optimization]] - no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83508">'''Gaseous signaling molecules''' are [[gas]]eous [[molecule]]s that are either [[biosynthesis|synthesised]] internally ([[endogenous]]ly) in the [[organism]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] or [[cell (biology)|cell]] or are received by the organism, tissue or cell from outside (say, from the atmosphere or [[hydrosphere]], as in the case of [[oxygen]]) and that are used to transmit chemical signals which induce certain physiological or biochemical changes in the organism, tissue or cell. The term is applied to, for example, [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], [[ethylene]], etc.

Many, but not all, gaseous signaling molecules are called '''gasotransmitters'''.&lt;!--Bolded due to redirect, per MOS:BOLD--&gt;

The biological roles of each of the gaseous signaling molecules are in short outlined below.

== Gaseous signaling molecules as gasotransmitters ==

Gasotransmitters is a subfamily of endogenous molecules of gases or gaseous signaling molecules, including NO, CO, {{chem|H|2|S}}.&lt;ref name="GTs"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mustafa AK, Gadalla MM, Snyder SH | title = Signaling by gasotransmitters | journal = Sci Signal | volume = 2 | issue = 68 | pages = re2 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19401594 | pmc = 2744355 | doi = 10.1126/scisignal.268re2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These particular gases share many common features in their production and function but carry on their tasks in unique ways, which differ from classical signaling molecules, in the human body. In 1981, it was first suggested from clinical work with nitrous oxide that a gas had a direct action at pharmacological receptors and thereby acted as a neurotransmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillman MA, Lichtigfeld FJ |title=A comparison of the effects of morphine sulphate and nitrous oxide analgesia on chronic pain states in man |journal=J.

The terminology and characterization criteria of “gasotransmitter” were firstly introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Wang 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = R | year = 2002 | title = Two's company, three's a crowd - Can {{chem|H|2|S}} be the third endogenous gaseous transmitter? | url = | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 13| pages = 1792–1798 | doi=10.1096/fj.02-0211hyp | pmid=12409322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For one gas molecule to be categorized as a gasotransmitters, all of the following criteria should be met.&lt;ref&gt;Wang R (ed) (2004) Signal Transduction and the Gasotransmitters: NO, CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in Biology and Medicine. Humana Press, New Jersey, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang 2002" /&gt;
# It is a small molecule of gas;
# It is freely permeable to membranes.  As such, its effects do not rely on the cognate membrane receptors. It can have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects.  In their endocrine mode of action, for example, gasotransmitters can enter the blood stream; be carried to remote targets by scavengers and released there, and modulate functions of remote target cells;
# It is endogenously and enzymatically generated and its production is regulated;
# It has well defined and specific functions at physiologically relevant concentrations.  Thus, manipulating the endogenous levels of this gas evokes specific physiological changes;
# Functions of this endogenous gas can be mimicked by its exogenously applied counterpart;
# Its cellular effects may or may not be mediated by second messengers, but should have specific cellular and molecular targets.

In 2011, a [http://www.gasotransmitters.eu European Network on Gasotransmitters (ENOG)] was formed. The aim of the network is to promote research on NO, CO and {{chem|H|2|S}} in order to better understand the biology of gasotransmitters and to unravel the role of each mediator in health and disease. Moreover, the network aims to contribute to the translation of basic science knowledge in this area of research into therapeutic or diagnostic tools.

== Carbon dioxide ==
{{see also|Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules}}

Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its levels are high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.

Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].

Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels.&lt;ref name='solarnav'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/solar_cola/carbon_dioxide.htm |title=Carbon dioxide |accessdate=2007-10-12 |work=solarnavigator.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure of 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.

== Nitric oxide ==

{{Main|Biological functions of nitric oxide}}

NO is one of the few gaseous signalling molecules known and is additionally exceptional due to the fact that it is a radical gas. It is a key [[vertebrate]] [[signal transduction|biological messenger]], playing a role in a variety of biological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Richard, [http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_weller_could_the_sun_be_good_for_your_heart.html Could the sun be good for your heart?] TedxGlasgow. Filmed March 2012, posted January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is a known bioproduct in almost all types of organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants, fungi, and animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;Roszer, T (2012) The Biology of Subcellular Nitric Oxide. {{ISBN|978-94-007-2818-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitric oxide, known as the '[[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]]', or 'EDRF', is biosynthesized endogenously from [[L-arginine]], [[oxygen]], and [[NADPH]] by various [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) [[enzyme]]s.  Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide. The [[endothelium]] (inner lining) of [[blood vessel]]s uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding [[smooth muscle]] to relax, thus resulting in [[vasodilation]] and increasing blood flow. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient [[paracrine]] (between adjacent cells) and [[autocrine]] (within a single cell) signaling molecule.&lt;ref name="stryer"&gt;{{cite book|last = Stryer| first = Lubert| title = Biochemistry, 4th Edition| publisher = W.H.

Independent of [[nitric oxide synthase]], an alternative pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleytest.com/plant-based.html |title=Plant-based Diets &amp;#124; Plant-based Foods &amp;#124; Beetroot Juice &amp;#124; Nitric Oxide Vegetables |publisher=Berkeley Test |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as [[spinach]] and [[arugula]], and [[beetroot]], have been shown to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-[[hypertension|hypertensive]] persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00933|title=Enhanced Vasodilator Activity of Nitrite in Hypertension: Critical Role for Erythrocytic Xanthine Oxidoreductase and Translational Potential|year=2013|last1=Ghosh|first1=S.

The production of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by aiding in pulmonary vasculature [[vasodilation]].

Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium.

Nitric oxide can contribute to [[reperfusion injury]] when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of [[ischemia]]) reacts with [[superoxide]] to produce the damaging oxidant [[peroxynitrite]]. In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from [[paraquat]] poisoning, which produces lung tissue-damaging superoxide and hinders NOS metabolism.

In plants, nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cellular and subcellular localization of endogenous nitric oxide in young and senescent pea plants|author=Corpas, F.

Two important biological reaction mechanisms of nitric oxide are S-[[nitrosation]] of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of [[thiol]] groups, including [[cysteine]] residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-[[Nitrosation]] is a mechanism for dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein.&lt;ref&gt;van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (eds.) (2007) ''Radicals for life: The various forms of nitric oxide''. Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|978-0-444-52236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO is referred to as a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.&lt;ref&gt;van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (2004) "Nitric Oxide", in ''Encyclopedia of Analytical Science'', 2nd ed., Elsevier, {{ISBN|0127641009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several mechanisms by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as [[ribonucleotide reductase]] and [[aconitase]], activation of the soluble [[guanylate cyclase]], ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group [[nitrosylation]], and iron regulatory factor activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7658698|year=1995|last1=Shami|first1=PJ|last2=Moore|first2=JO|last3=Gockerman|first3=JP|last4=Hathorn|first4=JW|last5=Misukonis|first5=MA|last6=Weinberg|first6=JB|title=Nitric oxide modulation of the growth and differentiation of freshly isolated acute non-lymphocytic leukemia cells|volume=19|issue=8|pages=527–33|journal=Leukemia Research|doi=10.1016/0145-2126(95)00013-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; NO has been demonstrated to activate [[NF-κB]] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaibori M. |author2=Sakitani K. |author3=Oda M. |author4=Kamiyama Y. |author5=Masu Y. |author6=Okumura T. |year=1999|title=Immunosuppressant FK506 inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression at a step of NF-κB activation in rat hepatocytes|journal=J.

It was found that NO acts through the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates [[protein kinase G]], which causes reuptake of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=174|year=2003|last1=Rhoades|first1=RA|last2=Tanner|first2=GA|title=Medical physiology 2nd edition|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.

Nitrous oxide does not bind as a ligand to the [[heme]] and does not react with thiol-containing [[protein]]s.

== Carbon monoxide ==
{{Further|Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules}}
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a [[signaling molecule]]. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a [[neurotransmitter]] or a [[vasodilation|blood vessel relaxant]].&lt;ref name="endogenous_co"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=L|title=Carbon Monoxide: Endogenous Production, Physiological Functions, and Pharmacological Applications|journal=Pharmacol Rev|volume=57|issue=4|pages=585–630|date=December 2005|pmid=16382109|doi=10.1124/pr.57.4.3|last2=Wang|first2=R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and inflammation.&lt;ref name="endogenous_co" /&gt;

* CO functions as an endogenous signaling molecule.
* CO modulates functions of the cardiovascular system.
* CO inhibits blood platelet aggregation and adhesion.
* CO may play a role as potential therapeutic agent.

In mammals, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,&lt;ref name = verma&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7678352 | title = Carbon monoxide: A putative neural messenger | year = 1993 | last1 = Verma | first1 = A | last2 = Hirsch | first2 = D. | last3 = Glatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Ronnett | first4 = G. | last5 = Snyder | first5 = S. | journal = Science | volume = 259 | issue = 5093 | pages = 381–4 | pmid = 7678352|bibcode = 1993Sci...259..381V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Carbon Monoxide Gas Is Used by Brain Cells As a Neurotransmitter |first=Gina |last=Kolata |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/26/science/carbon-monoxide-gas-is-used-by-brain-cells-as-a-neurotransmitter.html?pagewanted=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 26, 1993 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator.

There is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.&lt;ref name="clinical-trial"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrogen sulfide ==

{{main|Biological functions of hydrogen sulfide}}

Hydrogen sulfide is produced in small amounts by some cells of the [[mammal]]ian body and has a number of biological signaling functions. (Only two other such gases are currently known: [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).)

The gas is produced from [[cysteine]] by the [[enzyme]]s [[cystathionine beta-synthase]] and [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]]. It acts as a relaxant of [[smooth muscle]] and as a [[vasodilator]]&lt;ref name="lefer" /&gt; and is also active in the [[brain]], where it increases the response of the [[NMDA receptor]] and facilitates [[long term potentiation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Eventually the gas is converted to sulfite in the [[mitochondria]] by thiosulfate reductase, and the sulfite is further oxidized to [[thiosulfate]] and [[sulfate]] by [[sulfite oxidase]]. The sulfates are excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="Kamoun"&gt;{{Cite journal

Though both [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and hydrogen sulfide have been shown to relax blood vessels, their mechanisms of action are different: while NO activates the enzyme [[guanylyl cyclase]], {{chem|H|2|S}} activates [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel]]s in smooth muscle cells. Researchers are not clear how the vessel-relaxing responsibilities are shared between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. However, there exists some evidence to suggest that nitric oxide does most of the vessel-relaxing work in large vessels and hydrogen sulfide is responsible for similar action in smaller blood vessels.&lt;ref name="sciam1"&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=toxic-gas-lifesaver Toxic Gas, Lifesaver]", ''Scientific American'', March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, {{chem|H|2|S}} reacts with intracellular [[S-Nitrosothiol|S-nitrosothiols]] to form the smallest S-nitrosothiol (HSNO), and a role of hydrogen sulfide in controlling the intracellular S-nitrosothiol pool has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[trisomy 21]] (Down syndrome) the body produces an excess of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="Kamoun" /&gt; Hydrogen sulfide is also involved in the disease process of [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]]. The [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreas]] in type 1 diabetes produce an excess of the gas, leading to the death of these cells and to a reduced production of insulin by those that remain.&lt;ref name="sciam1" /&gt;

In 2005, it was shown that [[mus musculus|mice]] can be put into a state of [[suspended animation]]-like [[hypothermia]] by applying a low dosage of hydrogen sulfide (81 [[parts per million|ppm]] {{chem|H|2|S}}) in the air. The breathing rate of the animals sank from 120 to 10 breaths per minute and their temperature fell from 37&amp;nbsp;°C to just 2&amp;nbsp;°C above ambient temperature (in effect, they had become [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]). The mice survived this procedure for 6 hours and afterwards showed no negative health consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/science/nature/4469793.stm Mice put in 'suspended animation'], BBC News, 21 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 it was shown that the [[blood pressure]] of mice treated in this fashion with hydrogen sulfide did not significantly decrease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4469793.stm Gas induces 'suspended animation'], BBC News, 9 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar process known as [[hibernation]] occurs naturally in many [[mammal]]s and also in [[toad]]s, but not in mice. (Mice can fall into a state called [[torpor|clinical torpor]] when food shortage occurs). If the {{chem|H|2|S}}-induced hibernation can be made to work in humans, it could be useful in the emergency management of severely injured patients, and in the conservation of donated organs. In 2008, hypothermia induced by hydrogen sulfide for 48 hours was shown to reduce the extent of brain damage caused by experimental [[stroke]] in rats.&lt;ref name="Florian"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Florian B, Vintilescu R, Balseanu AT, Buga AM, Grisk O, Walker LC, Kessler C, Popa-Wagner A |title=Long-term hypothermia reduces infarct volume in aged rats after focal ischemia |journal=Neurosci.

As mentioned above, hydrogen sulfide binds to [[Cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome oxidase]] and thereby prevents oxygen from binding, which leads to the dramatic slowdown of [[metabolism]]. Animals and humans naturally produce some hydrogen sulfide in their body; researchers have proposed that the gas is used to regulate metabolic activity and body temperature, which would explain the above findings.&lt;ref&gt;Mark B. Roth and Todd Nystul. Buying Time in Suspended Animation. ''Scientific American, 1 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Two recent studies cast doubt that the effect can be achieved in larger mammals. A 2008 study failed to reproduce the effect in pigs, concluding that the effects seen in mice were not present in larger mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Jia |authorlink= |author2=Zhang, Gencheng |author3=Cai, Sally |author4= Redington, Andrew N  |date=January 2008 |title=Effect of inhaled hydrogen sulfide on metabolic responses in anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated piglets |journal=[[Pediatric Critical Care Medicine]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=110–112 |id= |url=http://www.pccmjournal.com/pt/re/pccm/abstract.00130478-200801000-00021.htm |accessdate= 2008-02-07 |quote=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S does not appear to have hypometabolic effects in ambiently cooled large mammals and conversely appears to act as a hemodynamic and metabolic stimulant. |doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000298639.08519.0C |pmid=18477923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise a paper by Haouzi et al. noted that there is no induction of hypometabolism in sheep, either.&lt;ref name="pmid17980679"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Haouzi P, Notet V, Chenuel B, Chalon B, Sponne I, Ogier V | title=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S induced hypometabolism in mice is missing in sedated sheep | journal=Respir Physiol Neurobiol | year= 2008 | volume= 160 | issue= 1 | pages= 109–15 | pmid=17980679 | doi=10.1016/j.resp.2007.09.001  | displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sulfur dioxide ==

The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=D. |url=http://benthamscience.com/mrmc/contabs/mrmc10-11.html#4 |title=Sulfur dioxide: a novel gaseous signal in the regulation of cardiovascular functions |journal=Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue= 11|pages=1039–1045 |pmid=20540708 |last2=Jin |first2=H |last3=Tang |first3=C |last4=Du |first4=J |doi=10.2174/1389557511009011039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the [[pulmonary stretch receptors]] and abolishes the [[Hering–Breuer reflex|Hering–Breuer inflation reflex]].

It was shown that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a role in diminishing an experimental [[lung]] damage caused by [[oleic acid]]. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an [[enzyme]] that produces endogenous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding [[acetylcysteine]] or [[glutathione]] to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen S, Zheng S, Liu Z, Tang C, Zhao B, Du J, Jin H |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against oleic acid-induced acute lung injury in association with inhibition of oxidative stress in rats.|journal=Lab. Invest.|date=Feb 2015|volume=95|issue=2|pages=142–156|doi=10.1038/labinvest.2014.147|pmid=25581610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating [[cardiac]] and [[blood vessel]] function, and aberrant or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism can contribute to several different cardiovascular diseases, such as [[arterial hypertension]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], [[stenocardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian H.|title=Advances in the study on endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Chin Med J|date=Nov 2014|volume=127|issue=21|pages=3803–3807|pmid=25382339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shown that in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of [[homocysteine]] is higher and the level of endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered homocysteine to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yang R, Yang Y, Dong X, Wu X, Wei Y |title=Correlation between endogenous sulfur dioxide and homocysteine in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease|language=chinese|journal=Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi|date=Aug 2014|volume=52|issue=8|pages=625–629|pmid=25224243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also has been shown to lower the [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] rate of endothelial [[smooth muscle]] cells in blood vessels, via lowering the [[MAPK]] activity and activating [[adenylyl cyclase]] and [[protein kinase A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu D, Huang Y, Bu D, Liu AD, Holmberg L, Jia Y, Tang C, Du J, Jin H |title=Sulfur dioxide inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via suppressing the Erk/MAP kinase pathway mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling.|journal=Cell Death Dis.|date=May 2014|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e1251|doi=10.1038/cddis.2014.229|pmid=24853429|pmc=4047873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth muscle cell proliferation is one of important mechanisms of hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels and their [[stenosis]], so it is an important pathogenetic mechanism in arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.

Endogenous sulfur dioxide in low concentrations causes endothelium-dependent [[vasodilation]]. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation and has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent [[calcium channel]]s and L-type ("dihydropyridine") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang XB, Jin HF, Tang CS, Du JB |title=The biological effect of endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|date=16 Nov 2011|volume=670|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.031|pmid=21925165|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also diminishes myocardial damage, caused by [[isoproterenol]] [[adrenergic]] hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liang Y, Liu D, Ochs T, Tang C, Chen S, Zhang S, Geng B, Jin H, Du J |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury and increases myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats.|journal=Lab. Invest.|date=Jan 2011|volume=91|issue=1|pages=12–23|doi=10.1038/labinvest.2010.156|pmid=20733562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur dioxide expelled from the gastrointestinal tract (through the process of flatulence) is thought to be one of the main constituents to the unpleasant smell colloquially referred to as a "fart".

== Hydrogen cyanide ==

Some authors have shown that [[neuron]]s can produce [[hydrogen cyanide]] upon activation of their [[opioid]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates [[NMDA receptor]]s and plays a role in [[signal transduction]] between neuronal cells ([[neurotransmission]]). Moreover, increased endogenous neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid [[analgesia]], as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator.&lt;ref name="pmid9369328"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Borowitz JL, Gunasekar PG, Isom GE |title=Hydrogen cyanide generation by mu-opiate receptor activation: possible neuromodulatory role of endogenous cyanide|journal=Brain Res.|date=12 Sep 1997|volume=768|issue=1–2|pages=294–300|pmid=9369328|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)00659-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also shown that, while stimulating [[muscarinic]] [[cholinergic]] receptors in cultured [[pheochromocytoma]] cells ''increases'' HCN production, in a living organism (''in vivo'') muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually ''decreases'' HCN production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gunasekar PG, Prabhakaran K, Li L, Zhang L, Isom GE, Borowitz JL |title=Receptor mechanisms mediating cyanide generation in PC12 cells and rat brain.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010204000094|journal=Neurosci Res.|date=May 2004|volume=49|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.1016/j.neures.2004.01.006|pmid=15099699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leukocyte]]s generate HCN during [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9369328" /&gt;

The [[vasodilatation]], caused by [[sodium nitroprusside]], has been shown to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to [[nitroglycerine]] and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith RP, Kruszyna H |title=Toxicology of some inorganic antihypertensive anions.|journal=Fed Proc.|date=Jan 1976|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–72|pmid=1245233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ammonia ==

Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=10323059 |title=PubChem Substance Summary|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Georg Hoffman|title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Friedrichsdorf, Germany: Milupa GmbH|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton |author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1994|isbn=978-0-683-07354-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methane ==

Some authors have shown that endogenous [[methane]] is produced not only by the [[intestinal flora]] and then absorbed into the [[blood]], but also is produced - in small amounts - by [[eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental [[mitochondria]]l [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], for example, [[sodium azide]] intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of hypoxia and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eszter Tuboly |author2=Andrea Szabó |author3=Dénes Garab |author4=Gábor Bartha |author5=Ágnes Janovszky |author6=Gábor Ero″s |author7=Anna Szabó |author8=Árpád Mohácsi |author9=Gábor Szabó |author10=József Kaszaki |author11=Miklós Ghyczy |author12=Mihály Boros |title=Methane biogenesis during sodium azide-induced chemical hypoxia in rats|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Other authors have shown that cellular methane production also rises during [[sepsis]] or [[bacteria]]l [[endotoxemia]], including an experimental imitation of endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tuboly E, Szabó A, Erős G, Mohácsi A, Szabó G, Tengölics R, Rákhely G, Boros M |title=Determination of endogenous methane formation by photoacoustic spectroscopy.|journal=J Breath Res.|date=Dec 2013|volume=7|issue=4|doi=10.1088/1752-7155/7/4/046004|pmid=24185326|pages=046004|bibcode = 2013JBR.....7d6004T |url=http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/4032/1/Tuboly_JBR_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other researchers have shown that methane, produced by the intestinal flora, is not fully "biologically neutral" to the intestine, and it participates in the normal physiologic regulation of [[peristalsis]]. And its excess causes not only belching, flatulence and belly pain, but also functional constipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sahakian AB, Jee SR, Pimentel M |title=Methane and the gastrointestinal tract.|journal=Dig Dis Sci|date=Aug 2010|volume=55|issue=8|pages=2135–2143|doi=10.1007/s10620-009-1012-0|pmid=19830557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethylene ==

[[File:Ethylene Signal Transduction.svg|thumb|An ethylene signal transduction pathway. Ethylene permeates the membrane and binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum.  The receptor releases the repressed EIN2.  This then activates a signal transduction pathway which activates a regulatory genes that eventually trigger an Ethylene response. The activated DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into a functional enzyme that is used for ethylene biosynthesis.]]
Ethylene serves as a [[plant hormone|hormone]] in [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lin, Z. |author2=Zhong, S. |author3=Grierson, D. |title=Recent advances in ethylene research |journal=J.

Commercial ripening rooms use "catalytic generators" to make ethylene gas from a liquid supply of ethanol. Typically, a gassing level of 500 to 2,000 ppm is used, for 24 to 48 hours. Care must be taken to control carbon dioxide levels in ripening rooms when gassing, as high temperature ripening ({{convert|20|C|F|disp=x|; }}){{citation needed|date=February 2014}} has been seen to produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels of 10% in 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ne-postharvest.com/ripening.htm#controlledatmosphereripening External Link to More on Ethylene Gassing and Carbon Dioxide Control]. ne-postharvest.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene has been used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate ripening (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn [[incense]] in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, it was discovered that gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene.&lt;ref name="Neljobov_1901"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neljubov D. | title = Uber die horizontale Nutation der Stengel von Pisum sativum und einiger anderen Pflanzen | journal = Beih Bot Zentralbl | volume = 10 | pages = 128–139 | year = 1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated [[abscission]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="Doubt_1917"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doubt, Sarah L.| title = The Response of Plants to Illuminating Gas | journal = Botanical Gazette | jstor= 2469142 | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 209–224 | year = 1917  | doi = 10.1086/332006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 1934 that Gane reported that plants synthesize ethylene.&lt;ref name="Gane_1934"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gane R. | title = Production of ethylene by some fruits | journal = Nature| volume = 134| issue = 3400| pages = 1008| year = 1934  | doi = 10.1038/1341008a0 | bibcode = 1934Natur.134.1008G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Crocker proposed that ethylene was the plant hormone responsible for fruit ripening as well as [[senescence]] of vegetative tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker W, Hitchcock AE, Zimmerman PW.

[[File:Yang-cycle.png|thumb|left|The Yang cycle]]
Ethylene is produced from essentially all parts of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, tubers, and seeds.
Ethylene production is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene production is induced during certain stages of growth such as [[germination]], [[ripening]] of fruits, [[abscission]] of leaves, and [[senescence]] of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced by a variety of external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators.&lt;ref name=Yang_1984&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang, S.

Ethylene is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from the amino acid [[methionine]] to [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-methionine]] (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] (ACC) by the enzyme [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase|ACC synthase]] (ACS). The activity of ACS determines the rate of ethylene production, therefore regulation of this [[enzyme]] is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves the action of the enzyme [[Aminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase|ACC-oxidase]] (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of [[auxin]]s, especially [[indole acetic acid]] (IAA) and [[cytokinin]]s.

Ethylene is perceived by a family of five transmembrane [[protein dimer]]s such as the ETR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; protein in ''Arabidopsis''. The [[gene]] [[encoding]] an ethylene receptor{{which|date=September 2013}} has been cloned in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and then in [[tomato]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in the ''Arabidopsis'' and [[tomato]] [[genome]]s. Mutations in any of the [[gene family]], which comprises five receptors in ''Arabidopsis'' and at least six in tomato, can lead to insensitivity to ethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants. In flooding, roots suffer from lack of oxygen, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], which leads to the synthesis of [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes [[nastic movements]] (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planthormones.info/epinasty.htm Explaining Epinasty]. planthormones.inf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene in plant induces such responses:
* Seedling triple response, thickening and shortening of [[hypocotyl]] with pronounced apical hook.
* In [[pollination]], when the pollen reaches the stigma, the precursor of the ethene, [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|ACC]], is secreted to the petal, the ACC releases ethylene with ACC oxidase.
* Stimulates leaf and flower [[senescence]]
* Stimulates senescence of mature [[xylem]] cells in preparation for plant use
* Induces leaf [[abscission]]
* Induces seed [[germination]]
* Induces [[root hair]] growth — increasing the efficiency of water and mineral absorption
* Induces the growth of [[adventitious root]]s during flooding
* Stimulates epinasty — leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] grows out, leaf hangs down and curls into itself
* Stimulates [[fruit ripening]]
* Induces a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] rise in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] in some fruit which causes a release of additional ethylene.
* Affects [[gravitropism]]
* Stimulates nutational bending
* Inhibits stem growth and stimulates stem and cell broadening and lateral branch growth outside of seedling stage (see [[Hyponastic response]])
* Interference with [[auxin]] transport (with high [[auxin]] concentrations)
* Inhibits shoot growth and [[stoma]]tal closing except in some water plants or habitually flooded ones such as some rice varieties, where the opposite occurs (conserving {{chem|CO|2}} and {{chem|O|2}})
* Induces flowering in [[pineapple]]s

Small amounts of endogenous ethylene are also produced in [[mammals]], including [[human]]s, due to lipid peroxidation. Some of endogenous ethylene is then oxidized to [[ethylene oxide]], which is able to [[alkylation|alkylate]] [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]] (forming a specific adduct with its N-terminal [[valine]], N-hydroxyethyl-valine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Filser JG, Denk B, Törnqvist M, Kessler W, Ehrenberg L|title=Pharmacokinetics of ethylene in man; body burden with ethylene oxide and hydroxyethylation of hemoglobin due to endogenous and environmental ethylene.|journal=Arch Toxicol.|date=1992|volume=66|issue=3|pages=157–163|pmid=1303633|doi=10.1007/bf01974008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endogenous ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can alkylate [[guanine]] in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Bolt HM, Leutbecher M, Golka K|title=A note on the physiological background of the ethylene oxide adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine in DNA from human blood.|journal=Arch Toxicol.|date=1997|volume=71|issue=11|pages=719–721|pmid=9363847|doi=10.1007/s002040050451}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also mutagenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Csanády GA, Denk B, Pütz C, Kreuzer PE, Kessler W, Baur C, Gargas ML, Filser JG|title=A physiological toxicokinetic model for exogenous and endogenous ethylene and ethylene oxide in rat, mouse, and human: formation of 2-hydroxyethyl adducts with hemoglobin and DNA.|journal=Toxicol Appl Pharmacol|date=May 15, 2000|volume=165|issue=1|pages=1–26|pmid=10814549|doi=10.1006/taap.2000.8918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Thier R, Bolt HM|title=Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity of ethylene oxide: new aspects and recent advances.|journal=Crit Rev Toxicol.|date=Sep 2000|volume=30|issue=5|pages=595–608|pmid=11055837|doi=10.1080/10408440008951121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11547">'''Geodemography''' includes the application of geodemographic classifications for business, social research and public policy but has a parallel history in academic research seeking to understand the processes by which settlements (notably, cities) evolve and neighborhoods are formed. It links the sciences of [[demography]], the study of human population dynamics, [[geography]], the study of the locational and spatial variation of both physical and human phenomena on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830110916/http://www.iowageographer.com/research.html|title=BTL Consulting -- Geodemographic Research|date=30 August 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[sociology]]. In short, geodemography is the study of people based on where they live. Geodemographic systems estimate the most probable characteristics of people based on the pooled profile of all people living in a small area near a particular address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105215826/http://www.rdaresearch.com.au/resources.php|title=rda research - geodemographic resources|date=5 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of geodemographics are often identified as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] and his studies of deprivation and poverty in early twentieth century [[London]], and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of sociology]]. Booth developed the idea of 'classifying neighborhoods', exemplified by his multivariate classification of the 1891 UK Census data to create a generalized social index of London's (then) registration districts. Research at the Chicago School – though generally qualitative in nature – strengthened the idea that such classifications could be meaningful by developing the idea of 'natural areas' within cities: conceived as geographical units with populations of broadly homogenous social-economic and cultural characteristics.

The idea that census outputs could serve to identify and to characterize the geographies of cities gathered momentum with the increased availability of national census data and the computational ability to look for patterns in such data. Of particular importance to the emerging geodemographic industry was the development of clustering techniques to group statistically similar neighborhoods into classes on a 'like with like' basis. More recently, data have become available at finer geographical resolutions (such as postal units), often originating from private commercial (i.e. non-governmental) sources.

Commercial geodemographics emerged from the late 1970s with the launch of PRIZM by Claritas in the US and [[Acorn (demographics)|Acorn]] by [[CACI]] in the UK. Geodemography has been used to target consumer services to 'ideal' populations based on their lifestyle and location. These parameters have been taken from geographical databases as well as from electoral lists and credit agencies. Combining these builds a picture of the population characteristics in different locations. The ''geodemographic'' data that this provides can then be used by marketers to target information towards those that they want to influence. This can be in the form of sales, services or even political information. At heart, geodemographics is just a structured method of making sense of complex socio-economic datasets.

==In the UK==
In 2005 the [[Office for National Statistics|Office for National Statistics (ONS)]] in collaboration with Dan Vickers and [[Phil Rees (academic)|Phil Rees]] of the University of Leeds, released a free small scale social area classification of the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/methodology_by_theme/area_classification/oa/default.asp|title=Home - Office for National Statistics|website=www.statistics.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on 2001 UK small area census data. Similar classifications had been developed for earlier censuses, notably by [[Stan Openshaw]] and colleagues at Newcastle and Leeds Universities, but access to these generally was restricted to the academic communities.

The 2005 Output Area Classification (OAC) and the 2013 release of [[Acorn (demographics)|Acorn]] in the UK is a move to 'open geodemographics' and reflects a concern that applications of commercial geodemographics in policy and social research can otherwise be 'black box': it is not always clear exactly what variables were used to classify small areas and to define their neighbourhood type, how those variables were weighted, or how similar (or otherwise) each of the neighbourhoods within a class type actually are. Open geodemographics provides such information (because it is not constrained by commercial interests) and is an important development for applied social research that also seeks to understand and to explain the roots causes or processes that generate aggregate spatial patterns of social behaviour and attitudes. The Output Area Classification is now supported by a user group [http://www.opengeodemographics.com/ here].  CACI have also released detailed documentation on how their classification utilizes Open Data [http://acorn.caci.co.uk/what-is-acorn here].

Geodemographic profiles have widened their application in the UK, with many life insurance companies and pension funds using them to assess longevity for pricing and reserving.&lt;ref name=insurance&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-actuarial-journal/article/applying-survival-models-to-pensioner-mortality-data/A16087FBD111D696E44F1220B2D15CDE|title=Applying Survival Models to Pensioner Mortality Data|first=S. J.|last=Richards|publisher=|journal=British Actuarial Journal|volume=14|issue=2|pages=257–303|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S1357321700001720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
In [[Australia]], general purpose geodemographic systems summarises a broad range of profiling data, largely derived from the [[Census in Australia|Australian Census]] to create a thumbnail sketch of the type of people living in a particular small area. These small areas are either CCD (Census Collection District)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607093533/http://www.marketfind.com.au/index.php?action=help|url=http://www.marketfind.com.au/index.php?action=help |title=CATEGORIES OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)|archivedate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sub-CD area, like a Meshblock.

The types of characteristics mainly taken into account in geodemographic system construction are:
* [[Population pyramid|Age distribution]];
* [[Socioeconomic status]] indicators like income, education, and occupational status;
*Household and family composition;
*Cultural factors, such as ethnicity, language spoken, country of birth, and (but not limited to) religion;
*Employment factors, such as type of job, type of industry, and hours of work;
*Household economic factors, like indebtedness, investments, and poverty;
*Regional factors (e.g. whether the resided area is classified as [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]], provincial, or sparsely settled), and;
*Residential stability.

In 1987, geodemographic systems were first introduced as social analysis tools with CCN's (later [[Experian]]) introduction of the MOSAIC system. In 1990, RDA Research built their first system, geoSmart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rdaresearch.com.au/resources.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105215826/http://www.rdaresearch.com.au/resources.php |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Geodemographics has drawn critical attention. Some focus on the possible discriminatory and intrusive effects of geodemographic practices. Others wonder whether members of geodemographic groups really are sufficiently alike to be analysed together. The generally unknown variance within geodemographic groupings makes it difficult to assess the significance of trends found in data.
This may not matter for commercial and service planning applications but is of some concern for public sector and social research. A way forward is to integrate geodemographics with more statistical frameworks of analysis, using multilevel methods for example.

The villages of '''Großwilsdorf''' and the Rödel Plateau are situated in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the middle of [[Germany]].  It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Wilsdorf ===
The farming community of Gross-Wilsdorf consists of two [[villages]]. It is an example of a circular village structure in the [[Slav]]-[[Germans|German]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namenkundliche Beiträge zur Siedlungsgeschichte des Saale- und Mittelelbegebietes bis zum Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts (Deutsch-Slawische Forschungen zur Namenkunde und Siedlungsgeschichte 26).|date=1971|publisher=Berlin|language=German|trans-title=The history of names in the settlement in the area of the Saale and the Elbeuntil the end of the 9th century (German-Slav research on the history of names and settlements 26).|author=Walter, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entrance of the high medieval village was traditionally marked by a [[pond]]. This pond was kept for use as service water in everyday life and for fire fighting in cases of emergency. In the village of Gross-Wilsdorf, you can also find a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower church, which had been erected between the two high medieval settlement nucleuses of Gross-Wilsdorf and Kleinwilsdorf and which has partly been preserved. The [[tombstones]] of the church were ornamented with engraved crosses and a stick-like image deemed to be a walking stick. Since medieval tombstones in places other than large [[cathedral]]s and [[minsters]] have rarely been preserved, the tombstones in Gross-Wilsdorf can be considered special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg. An agricultural research.|title=Zur Geschichte der sogenannten "Kreisdörfer" im Naumburger Kreise. Eine agrarhistorische Studie.|author=Naumann, Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sandstone,_Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The villages of Großwilsdorf demonstrate the cultural exchange of neighboring [[settler]]s in the region, who all relied at first on their traditional settlement forms.  [[Sorbs]], [[Thuringians]], and other groups created three individual round villages in the [[12th century]], that all shared the same village church built right in the middle between these settlements.  During the [[High Middle Ages]] these settlers from different regions and ethnicities mixed and the villages grew together, forming nowaday Großwilsdorf. The layouts of houses and streets are still well preserved and dated to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siedlungsformen und -entwicklung – neue analytische, systematische und planungsrelevante Aspekte.|date=2012|language=German|trans-title=Forms of settlement and development - new analystical relevant aspects.|author=Liesenberg, Carsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rödel ===

Adjoining the village lies the Rödel [[Plateau]] with its porous [[limestone]] layers. The important limestone quarry “Rödel” served for producing large-sized cut stones of highest quality and supplied the [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut|Naumburg Cathedral]] with building material. [[Neuenburg Castle]] was almost entirely built using the local shell limestone. Structural elements of higher quality were made using shell limestone from the surrounding quarries. This [[quarry]] also is visible and unchanged until today, as are the transport paths for the limestone to Naumburg.

In the year 1032, [[Conrad II|King Conrad II]] gave the royal court of Balgstädt to the Cathedral of Naumburg, including all accessories such as rocks and cliffs (molis). The monastery was granted the permission to dig out suitable rock material there freely, to break it up, roll it out and carry it away. The great number of pits identified by way of laser scans clearly reflect that there was likely a multitude of entitled parties and producers because of the highly fragmented nature of medieval stone [[quarrying]].  Parcels could be identified in the forests on the Rödel Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologie von Thüringen.|date=1974|publisher=Haack|pages=15–79|language=German|trans-title=Geology of Thuringia.|author=Seidel, Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

the two teams being led by the dukes of [[duke of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], respectively, and one spectator box on each side for the ladies; inscribed over the boxes is ''plus est en vous'', the [[heraldic motto]] of the [[Gruuthuse]] family of Bruges, attributed to tournament between  [[Jean III de Gruuthuse]] and Jean de Ghistelles held in 1393.&lt;ref&gt;Octave Delepierre, '' Précis des annales de Bruges'' (1835) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=eIpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38f]. René of Anjou's contemporary [[Louis de Gruuthuse]] himself was a famous competitor in tournaments during the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dukes can be seen facing each other in the center of the front lines, each with a personal heraldic flag as well with a larger flag of the same design representing their team.
The chief [[herald]] is also on horseback, between the two teams, wearing his own heraldic colours.]]

'''[[Heraldry]]''' is the system of visual identification of rank and [[genealogy|pedigree]] which developed 
in the European [[High Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], 
[[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. 
Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]].
Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). 
Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. 
Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.

Western heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].

With the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.

[[File:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|Depiction of [[kite shield]]s with cross or spiral ornaments in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (c. 1070).]]
Traditions of [[field sign]]s, personal [[emblem]]s or [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] go back to at least the [[Ancient Near East|Bronze Age]].
The [[Ekphrasis|ekphrastic]] description of [[shield]] designs in particular is found as a topos in classical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldry developed in the [[high medieval period]], based on earlier, "pre-heraldic" or "ante-heraldic", traditions of visual identification by means of  [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s,  [[field sign]]s, emblems used on [[numismatics|coins]], etc. Notably, [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] that would subsequently appear in 12th-century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the [[animal style]] of ancient art (specifically  the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western heraldry is an innovation of the 12th century. Certain members of the high nobility began to display animals, 
specifically [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] on their shields beginning in c. the 1140s. 
Prior to this, western military shields of the 11th to early 12th century did sometimes show simple decorations, but not apparently tied to the personal identification of the bearer.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt, depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankish or German [[round shield]]s of the 11th century ([[Ottonian]], [[Salian dynasty|Salian]]) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: "chequered" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), "flared cross" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), 
"spirals" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), "spirals with dots" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-heraldry (12th century)==
{{seealso|List of oldest heraldry|Equestrian seal}}
[[File:Thibaut Blois.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the [[equestrian seal]] of [[Theobald III, Count of Blois]], dated 1138. Traces of an ornamental cross design are visible on the shield.]]
The 12th-century tradition is mostly preserved in the form of the [[equestrian seal]]s popular at the time which show the nobleman as a fully armed warrior on horseback. Early equestrian seals show plain shields. From the mid 12th century, proto-heraldic designs are sometimes shown, but the shield is shown naturally, as part of the knight's armament, and is often seen in profile or partially obscured. 
The [[:File:Demay p6.jpg|equestrian seal]] of Enguerrand (Ingelram), [[count of Saint-Pol]] (1130s or 1140s) still shows a plain shield, but what would later become [[heraldic charge]]s (in this case, sheaves of corn) are shown arranged around the horse.&lt;ref&gt;"le blason fait son apparition dans les dernières années du XIIe siècle, brusquement, sans transition. Mais il est d’autres types plus anciens où les pièces des armoiries existent, s’annonçant pour ainsi dire avant de passer dans l’écu. Le sceau d’Enguerran, comte de Saint-Pol, antérieur à l’année 1150, est de ce nombre. Il offre déjà plusieurs ''gerbes'' dispersées dans le champ." 
G. Demay, ''Le Blason d’après les sceaux du Moyen-Âge'' (1877), [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Demay_-_Le_Blason_d’après_les_sceaux_du_Moyen-Âge,_1877.djvu/7 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Seals displaying actual heraldic shields appear by the very end of the 12th century or the early years of the 13th century.

Seals with elements of a distinctly heraldic character begin to appear in the second third of the 12th century.
A number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  
A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest equestrial seals with armorials are those of [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]], duke of Saxony (1142&amp;ndash;1180) and Bavaria (1156&amp;ndash;1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable [[heraldic lion|lion]] displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), p. 175,
citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, '' Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und Lüneburg'', nr. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;
An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is [[:File:Ottokar III of Styria 1160.jpg|that]] of [[Ottokar III of Styria]], dated 1160, with an early form of the [[Styria]]n [[Panther (legendary creature)|panther]] on his shield.

[[File:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Enamel from the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], showing his shield in profile, with four out of what were presumably six lions visible (six lions are on the shield of the effigy of  his grandson  [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], d. 1226).]]
The oldest extant depiction of a coloured armoury can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), {{p.|18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early mention of heraldic shields in [[Middle High German literature]] also dates to the 12th century.
Shield designs are described in the  ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' (c. 1150&amp;ndash;1170), such as the boar carried by the Romans, as well as, in isolated cases, in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'' (c. 1115), ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'' (c. 1150), [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']] (c. 1170), and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']] (c. 1185).
These appear in the larger context of describing an armed protagonist, and are not yet tied to the bearer's pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'', such as the boar carried by the Romans&amp;mdash;the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [''Wappenwesen'', 1966]&amp;mdash;most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'', ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'', [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']], and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']]&amp;mdash;mostly related to the protagonists." Wandhoff (2016),  ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=5mYYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[heraldic cross|cross symbol]] worn on the shield and surcoat at this time is not a heraldic charge identifying the bearer but a [[field sign]] worn by all participants in the Crusade.]]
At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the [[Crusades]]: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase "coat of arms" is derived.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the term is from the 14th century, and has no direct relation to the crusades at all--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades,{{cn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--do you mean the period of the crusades (i.e. the 12th century), or the actual campaign? If the latter, what is the evidence?--&gt;
serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval heraldry==
{{see|Roll of arms}}
[[File:DeringRoll.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dering Roll'', c. 1270, Dover, one of the oldest extant [[Roll of arms|rolls of arms]], showing the coats of arms as yet without [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] or any other achievements.]]

===Terminology===
{{see|Blazon}}
The origin of the term ''[[:wikt:heraldry|heraldry]]'' itself ([[Middle English]] ''heraldy'', [[Old French]] ''hiraudie''), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the [[Tournament (medieval)|knightly tournament]]s in the 12th century. Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their [[heater shield|shields]]. A [[herald]] (Old French ''heraut'', from a [[Frankish language|Frankish]] ''*hariwald'' "commander of an army") was an officer who would announce the competitors. 

Originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, heralds assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title "King of Heralds", which eventually became "[[King of Arms]]."&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"/&gt;

The term ''[[coat of arms]]''  in origin refers to the [[surcoat]] with heraldic designs worn by combattants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French ''cote a armer''. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/coat%20of%20arms#etymonline_v_28240 etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldic shield===
{{see|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}
By about the 1230s, the shields used by cavalry were almost triangular in shape, referred to as [[heater shield]]s. Such a 
shield is preserved, the shield of [[Konrad von Thüringen]], dated c. 1230, showing the ''lion barry'' of the [[Ludovingians]].
This heater-shaped form was used in warfare during the apogee of the [[Chivalry|Age of Chivalry]], and it becomes the classic heraldic shield, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], at about the time of the [[Battle of Crecy]] (1346) and the founding of the [[Order of the Garter]] (1348), when heraldry had become a fully developed system.
All medieval [[roll of arms|rolls of arms]], from the late 13th and throughout the 14th to 15th century, almost exclusively use this shield shape. 

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Division of the field===
{{see|Division of the field}}
Coats of arms of the 13th century in some cases already include marks of [[cadency]] to distinguish descendants, but they mostly still do without [[division of the field]] to indicate descent from more than one lineage. 
An exception is the [[coat of arms of Castile and León]], showing
the [[Heraldry of Castile|arms of Castile]] (the yellow castle) [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] with the [[Heraldry of León|arms of León]] (the purple lion) in the late 13th century ''[[Camden Roll]]'' and  ''Segar's Roll''.
This practice becomes much more common in the late medieval period. For example, the  arms of [[Eric of Pomerania]] as king of the [[Kalmar Union]] (r. 1396–1439) combine five coats of arms, for Denmark, Sweden, the [[House of Bjelbo]], Pomerania and Norway, quartered by a cross gules and with a central [[inescutcheon]].
In the later 15th century, holders of ecclesiastical office would quarter their family arms with those of the 
order or diocese they represented. Thus [[Pierre d'Aubusson]] as grand master of the [[Knights of Malta]] quartered his family arms with the [[Maltese cross]]; bishop [[Hugo von Hohenlandenberg]] quartered his family arms with those of the [[bishopric of Constance|prince-bishopric of Constance]].

===Heraldic authorities===
{{see|Heraldic authority}}
By the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Squibb, "The Law of Arms in England", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"&gt;Pastoureau, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are graÅnted by the authority of the crown.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"/&gt;

Beginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London (1960), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[early modern period]], heraldry became highly complex and standardised, divided into "national"  traditions. 
Western heraldry can be divided into three large cultural groups, "Gallo-British", "German-Nordic" and "Latin".
Part of the Gallo-British group are [[French heraldry|French]], 
[[English heraldry|English]] and [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish]] traditions. The "German-Nordic" group includes the tradition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its greater sphere of incluence, including 
[[German heraldry]], [[Swedish heraldry]], [[Norwegian heraldry]], [[Danish heraldry]], [[Russian heraldry]],  [[Polish heraldry]], [[Hungarian heraldry]], [[Croatian heraldry]], [[Serbian heraldry]], etc.

The "Latin" group includes [[Italian heraldry]], [[Spanish heraldry]] and [[Portuguese heraldry]].

[[Dutch heraldry]] shows influence of all three groups.

Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes &amp; Noble (1998), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abandonment of the [[joust]] as courtly practice at the beginning of the 17th century,  heraldic achievements, especially the [[helmet (heraldry)|heraldry]], ceased to be tied to the technological development or fashion of [[jousting armour]] and shapes of helmets became purely conventional, and in the various regional systems, separate types of helmets came to be tied to separate ranks of nobility.

[[Baroque]] heraldic designs became increasingly elaborate, both in terms of the increasingly complex [[division of the field]] and in terms of the surrounding achievements, culminating in the development of "landscape heraldry", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.

==Modern heraldry==

In the mid-19th century, there was  a renewed interest in the history of armory,
but now mostly from an [[antiquarian]]'s or [[genealogy|genealogist]]'s perspective. This led to a re-evaluation of older designs over Baroque and Roccoco styles, a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "heraldry" is sometimes used to include the [[national emblem]]s of modern states. Some modern states, especially constitutional monarchies, use national coats of arms (such as the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] or the [[coat of arms of Spain]]).
States with republican tradition tend to avoid coats of arms, using "national seals" or "national emblems" instead, such as the [[national emblem of France]], the [[national emblem of Turkey]] or the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

[[File:In Situ Bioremediation.png|thumb|In Situ Bioremediation]]
[[Bioremediation]] is the process of decontaminating polluted sites through the usage of either endogenous or external [[microorganism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7R7VX9dLV8oC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=in+situ+bioremediation#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=Rittmann|first=Bruce E.|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780815513483|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[In situ#Environmental remediation|In situ]] is a term utilized within a variety of fields meaning "on site" and refers to the location of an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=situs2|title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short,  A Latin Dictionary, sĭtus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of bioremediation, in situ indicates that the location of the bioremediation has occurred at the site of contamination without the translocation of the polluted materials.  Bioremediation is used to neutralize pollutants including [[Hydrocarbon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, chlorinated compounds, nitrates, toxic metals and other [[pollutant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s through a variety of chemical mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Microorganism used in the process of bioremediation can either be implanted or cultivated within the site through the application of fertilizers and other nutrients. Common polluted sites targeted by bioremediation are groundwater/aquifers and polluted soils. Aquatic [[ecosystem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s  affected by oil spills have also shown improvement through the application of bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perelo|first=Louisa Wessels|date=15 May 2010|title=Review: In situ and bioremediation of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389409020792|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=177|issue=1–3|pages=81–89|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.12.090|pmid=20138425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable cases being the [[Deepwater Horizon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-clean-up-oil-spills/|title=Slick Solution: How Microbes Will Clean Up the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|last=Biello|first=David|date=|work=Scientific American|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil spill in 2010 and the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlas|first=Ronald M.|last2=Hazen|first2=Terry C.|date=15 August 2011|title=Oil Biodegradation and Bioremediation: A Tale of the Two Worst Spills in U.S. History|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=16|pages=6709–6715|doi=10.1021/es2013227|issn=0013-936X|pmc=3155281|pmid=21699212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two variations of bioremediation exist defined by the location where the process occurs. Ex situ bioremediation occurs at a location separate from the contaminated site and involves the translocation of the contaminated material. In situ occurs within the site of contamination&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In situ bioremediation can further be categorized by the metabolism occurring, [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]], and by the level of human involvement.
__TOC__

==History==
The Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, [[Pennsylvania]] spurred the first commercial usage of in situ bioremediation in 1972 to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-34-waste-containment-and-remediation-technology-spring-2004/lecture-notes/lecture12.pdf|title=Lecture 12 Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Course Work Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was filed in 1974 by Richard Raymond, Reclamation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground Waters, which provided the basis for the commercialization of in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications of In situ Bioremediation ==

===Accelerated===
Accelerated in situ bioremediation is defined when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth through the application of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site. Within aerobic metabolism the nutrient added to the soil can be solely Oxygen. Anaerobic in situ bioremediation often requires a variety of electron donors or acceptors such as [[benzoate]] and lactate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioprocess.pnnl.gov/resour/rt3d.in.situ.bioremediation.htm#advant|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=bioprocess.pnnl.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=David E.|last2=Lutz|first2=Edward J.|last3=Odom|first3=J. Martin|last4=Buchanan|first4=Ronald J.|last5=Bartlett|first5=Craig L.|last6=Lee|first6=Michael D.|last7=Harkness|first7=Mark R.|last8=DeWeerd|first8=Kim A.|date=1 June 2000|title=Bioaugmentation for Accelerated In Situ Anaerobic Bioremediation|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=34|issue=11|pages=2254–2260|doi=10.1021/es990638e|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed [[bioaugmentation]] and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Raymond Process====
The Raymond Process is a type of accelerated in situ bioremediation that was developed by Richard Raymond and involves the introduction of nutrients and electron acceptors to a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This process is primarily used to treat polluted groundwater. In the Raymond process a loop system is created. Contaminated [[Groundwater]] from downstream of the groundwater flow is pumped to the surface and infused with nutrients and an electron donor, often oxygen. This treated water is then pumped back down below the [[water table]] upstream of where it was originally taken. This process introduces nutrients and electron donors into the site allowing for the growth of a determined microbial population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=====Oxygen Injection=====
In contaminated sites where the desired microbial metabolism is aerobic the introduction of oxygen to the site can be used to increase the population of targeted microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Bioremediation/cat/Aerobic_Bioremediation_(Direct)/|title=CLU-IN {{!}} Technologies &gt; Remediation &gt; About Remediation Technologies &gt; Bioremediation &gt; Aerobic Bioremediation (Direct)|last=|first=|date=|website=clu-in.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection of Oxygen can occur through a variety of processes. Oxygen can be injected into the subsurface through injection wells. It can also be introduced through an injection gallery. The presence of oxygen within a site is often the limiting factor when determining the time frame and efficacy of a proposed in situ bioremediation process.

====== Ozone Injection ======
Ozone injected into the subsurface can also be a means of introducing oxygen into a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Despite being a strong oxidizing agent and potentially having a toxic effect on subsurface microbial populations, ozone can be an efficient means of spreading oxygen throughout a site due to its high solubility.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Within twenty minutes after being injected into the subsurface, fifty percent of the ozone will have decomposed to Oxygen.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Ozone is commonly introduced to the soil in either a dissolved or gaseous state.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

=====Accelerated Anaerobic In situ Bioremediation=====
Within accelerated anaerobic in situ bioremediation electron donors and acceptors are introduced into a contaminated site in order to increase the population of anaerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA)===
Monitored Natural Attenuation is in situ bioremediation that occurs with little to no human intervention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf|title=A Citizen's Guide to Monitored Natural Attenuation|last=|first=|date=September 2012|website=Contaminated Sites Clean up Information|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process relies on the natural microbial populations sustained within the contaminated sites to over time reduce the contaminants to a desired level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During monitored natural attenuation the site is monitored in order to track the progress of the bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monitored natural attenuation is used in sites where the source of contamination is no longer present, often after other more active types of in situ bioremediation have been conducted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Uses of In situ bioremediation==
===Hydrocarbon Degradation===

Naturally occurring within the soil are microbial populations that utilize [[hydrocarbons]] as a source of energy and Carbon.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.bren.ucsb.edu/~keller/courses/esm223/SuthersanCh05Bioremediation.pdf|title=IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION|last=Suthersan|first=Susan|date=1999|website=University of California Barbara|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is [[cometabolism]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The fungus genus [[Phanerochaete]] under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syed|first=Khajamohiddin|last2=Yadav|first2=Jagjit S.|date=1 November 2012|title=P450 monooxygenases (P450ome) of the model white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=339–363|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2012.682050|issn=1040-841X|pmc=3567848|pmid=22624627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorinated Compounds===
====Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds====

A variety of metabolic modes exist capable of degrading chlorinated [[aliphatic compounds]]. Anaerobic reduction, oxidation of the compound, and cometabolism under aerobic conditions are the three main metabolic modes utilized by microorganisms to degrade chlorinated aliphatic compounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Organisms that can readily metabolize chlorinated aliphatic compounds are not common in the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One and two carbons that have little chlorination are the compounds most effectively metabolized by soil microbial populations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The degradation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds is most often performed through cometabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
[[File:Reacciotriclorur.png|thumb|Synthesis and general structure of polychlorinated byphenyls.]]

====Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons====

Chlorinated [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] hydrocarbons are resistant to bioremediation and many microorganisms lack the ability to degrade the compounds. Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are most often degraded through a process of reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) are primarily degraded through cometabolism. There are also some fungi that can degrade the compounds as well.  Studies show an increase in PCB degradation when biphenyl is added to the site due to cometabolic affects the enzymes used to degrade [[biphenyl]] have on PCBs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Due to in situ bioremediation taking place at the site of contamination there is a lessened risk of cross contamination as opposed to ex situ bioremediation where the polluted material is transported to other sites. In situ bioremediation can also have lower costs and a higher rate of decontamination than ex situ bioremediation.

The '''Institute of Systematics and Ecology of Animals''' ('''ISEA''') ({{lang-ru|Институт систематики и экологии животных, ИСЭЖ {{efn|Or ''ИСиЭЖ''.}}}}) located in [[Novosibirsk]] is one of the oldest research organization in the Siberian Branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (SB RAS).&lt;ref name="Krasilnikov2013"&gt;[[#Krasilnikov 2013|Krasilnikov 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Makarova2004"&gt;[[#Makarova 2004|Makarova 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was founded in 1944&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;[[#Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970|Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aseevetal-2014"&gt;[[#Aseev et al. 2014|Aseev et al. 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; as Biomedical Institute,&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt; the first Siberian academic establishment working in biology.&lt;ref name="Aseevetal-2014" /&gt;  The Siberian Zoological Museum of the ISEA SB RAS has the third-largest [[coleoptera]]n collection in Russia.&lt;ref name="ZIN"&gt;[[#ZIN RAS|ZIN RAS]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Siberian research organizations as the Central Siberian Botanical Garden SB RAS and the Institute of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry SB RAS were derived from the Institute former laboratories.&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aseevetal-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evsikovetal2004" /&gt;   
   
==General background==
The Institute research mission is the study of animal populations and communities structural and functional organization (as the base of living systems sustainable being and evolution) along with [[community (ecology)|community ecology]] and [[biodiversity]] (animal [[systematics]], inventory, monitoring and animal resource assessment).&lt;ref name="Evsikovetal2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Litvinov 2008|Litvinov 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISEA international activities include collaboration with researchers from the [[United Kingdom]], Germany,&lt;ref name="NatureIndex"&gt;[[#Nature Index|The Nature Index 2013—2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]], [[Japan]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="Aseevetal-2014" /&gt;

==History==
The Institute was formed as Biomedical Institute&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt; in 1944&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aseevetal-2014" /&gt; due to the special Order of the [[USSR]] [[Council of People's Commissars|Sovnarkom]] (1943{{efn|Order No 1149, 21 October 1943&lt;ref name="OfHist" /&gt;}}). It was renamed a few times:&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evsikovetal2004"&gt;[[#Evsikov et al. 2004|Evsikov et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SB RAS PhotoChronicle"&gt;[[#SB RAS photo chronicle|SB RAS photo chronicle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded using a grant from the US [[National Science Foundation]] in 1996 for the study of [[Integrated Media Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imsc.usc.edu/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906013115/http://imsc.usc.edu/about.html |archivedate=2007-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original mission was focused on the advancement the integration of digital video, immersive audio, text, animation and graphics to  transform the way people work, communicate, learn, teach, entertain and play. By using cross-disciplinary programs of research and education, the Center has taken multimedia to a new level of technological sophistication.

There are more than 1,000 '''[[chemical compounds]] in [[coffee]]''',&lt;ref name="Coffee Chemistry"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=  978-9401086936  |title=Coffee Volume 1 Chemistry |author=R.J. Clarke |location=New York|publisher=Springer|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their molecular and physiological effects are areas of active research in [[food chemistry]]. There are a large number of ways to organize coffee compounds. The major texts in the area variously sort by effects on flavor, physiology, pre- and post-roasting effects, growing and processing effects, botanical variety differences, country of origin differences, and many others. Interactions between compounds also is a frequent area of taxonomy, as are the major organic chemistry categories (Protein, carbohydrate, lipid, etc.) that are relevant to the field. In the field of aroma and flavor alone, Flament gives a list of 300 contributing chemicals in green beans, and over 850 after roasting. He lists 16 major categories to cover those compounds related to aroma and flavor.&lt;ref name="Coffee Flavor Chemistry"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=  978-0471720386 |title=Coffee Flavor Chemistry |author=Ivon Flament |location=New York|publisher=Wiley|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health effects are certainly a valid taxonomy category, less than 30 of the over 1,000 compounds have been subjected to juried, health-related research (e.g. official potential carcinogen classification — see [[furan]]s, for example), so health categorization has been avoided.

On the other hand, physiological effects are well documented in some (e.g. stimulant effects of caffeine), and those are listed where relevant and well-documented. Internet claims for individual chemicals, or compound synergies, such as preventing dental cavities (speculative but unproven effect of the alkaloid [[trigonelline]] with ''[[in vitro]]'' bacterial attachment research, but missing ''in vivo'' research on any health effects), preventing kidney stones, or negative effects, also have been avoided.

Chemicals found in coffee can be categorized in the following groups:
* [[Hydrocarbon]]s
* [[Alkaloid]]s 
Caffeine, Theophylline, Trigonelline
* [[Alcohol]]s
Quinic acid, Acetoin
* [[Aldehyde]]s
* [[Ketone]]s
Acetoin
* [[Acid]]s and [[anhydride]]s
Quinic acid, 3,5-Di-caffeoylquinic acid
* [[Ester]]s
3,5-Di-caffeoylquinic acid
* [[Lactone]]s
* [[Phenol]]s
3,5-Di-caffeoylquinic acid
* [[Furan]]s
* [[Pyran]]s
* [[Thiophene]]s
* [[Pyrrole]]s
* [[Oxazole]]s
* [[Thiazole]]s
* [[Pyridine]]s
* [[Pyrazines]]
* [[Nitrogen]]ous compounds and [[amine]]s
Putrescine
* [[Sulfur]]s
Dimethyl disulfide
* [[Water]]
* [[Mineral]]s
* [[Carbohydrate]]s
* [[Protein]]s
* [[Lipid]]s
* [[Phenol]]ic compounds
* [[Wax]]es
* [[Oil]]s
* [[Volatility (chemistry)|Volatile]] components''' (not in the sense of [[volatile organic compound]]s)

||Likely the best known component of coffee, caffeine content varies both by variety and producing location, with Arabica having less, Robusto having more, and blending the two controlling caffeine content. Some authors consider alkaloids to be a special class of [[amine]]s, depending on nitrogen pattern.

||Oils, along with caffeine, are the second most stable chemicals in coffee, due to their high melting point. Although most roasting takes place above {{convert|540|F|C}}, it is well into “second crack” (City ++) that oils start to migrate from inside to outside, hence the darker, oily appearing bean for long hot roasts. There are hundreds of oils in coffee, and although very important to flavor and aroma, they are some of the less studied chemicals to date. Oils are one of the few chemicals in coffee that change over time during storage of the green beans, and Arabica has over 50% more oils than Robusta, which is thought to contribute to aroma as well as taste differences. Also called wax, the majority of oils in a coffee bean are in the inner endosperm, not the waxy outer covering of the bean.&lt;ref name="Coffee Flavor Chemistry"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

'''Los Alamos National Laboratory''' ('''Los Alamos''' or '''LANL''' for short) is a [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|United States Department of Energy national laboratory]] initially organized during [[World War II]] for the design of [[nuclear weapon]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. It is located a short distance northwest of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in the southwestern [[United States]].

Los Alamos was selected as the top secret location for bomb design in late 1942, and officially commissioned the next year. At the time it was known as [[Project Y]], one of a series of laboratories located across the United States given letter names to maintain their secrecy. Los Alamos was the centre for design and overall coordination, while the other labs, today known as [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]], concentrated on the production of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] bomb fuels. Los Alamos was the heart of the project, collecting together some of the world's most famous scientists, among them numerous [[Nobel Prize]] winners. The site was known variously as Project Y,  Los Alamos Laboratory, and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory through this period.

The lab's existence was announced to the world in the post-WWII era, when it became known universally as Los Alamos. In 1952, the Department of Energy formed a second design lab under the direction of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], becoming the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). Since that date the two labs have competed on a wide variety of bomb designs. With the ending of the [[Cold War]], both labs turned their focus increasingly to civilian missions. Today, Los Alamos is one of the largest science and technology institutions in the world. It conducts multidisciplinary research in fields such as [[national security]], [[space exploration]], [[nuclear fusion]], [[renewable energy]],&lt;ref&gt;

After several reorganizations, the LANL is currently managed and operated by [[Triad National Security|Triad National Security, LLC]].

==History==

===The Manhattan Project===
{{Main|Project Y}}
The laboratory was founded during [[World War II]] as a secret, centralized facility to coordinate the scientific research of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] project to develop the first [[nuclear weapon]]s. In September 1942, the difficulties encountered in conducting preliminary studies on [[nuclear weapon]]s at universities scattered across the country indicated the need for a laboratory dedicated solely to that purpose.

General [[Leslie Groves]] wanted a central laboratory at an isolated location for safety, and to keep the scientists away from the populace. It should be at least 200 miles from international boundaries and west of the Mississippi. Major John Dudley suggested [[Oak City, Utah|Oak City]], Utah or [[Jemez Springs, New Mexico|Jemez Springs]], New Mexico but both were rejected. Jemez Springs was only a short distance from the current site. Manhattan Project scientific director [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] had spent much time in his youth in the New Mexico area, and suggested the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]] on the [[mesa]]. Dudley had rejected the school as not meeting Groves’ criteria, but as soon as Groves saw it he said in effect "This is the place".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer became the laboratory's first director.

During the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos hosted thousands of employees, including many [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientists. The location was a total secret. Its only mailing address was a post office box, number 1663, in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], New Mexico. Eventually two other post office boxes were used, 180 and 1539, also in Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its contract with the [[University of California]] was initially intended to be temporary,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the relationship was maintained long after the war. Until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], University of California president [[Robert Gordon Sproul|Robert Sproul]] did not know what the purpose of the laboratory was and thought it might be producing a "[[death ray]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cstms.berkeley.edu/archive/oppenheimer/exhibit/chapter3.html Cstms.berkeley.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071050/http://cstms.berkeley.edu/archive/oppenheimer/exhibit/chapter3.html |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only member of the UC administration who knew its true purpose—indeed, the only one who knew its exact physical location—was the Secretary-Treasurer Robert Underhill, who was in charge of wartime contracts and liabilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[Image:Trinity Test Fireball 16ms.jpg|left|thumb|The first stages of the explosion of the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]].]]
The work of the laboratory culminated in the creation of several atomic devices, one of which was used in the first [[nuclear testing|nuclear test]] near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], codenamed "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]", on July 16, 1945. The other two were weapons, "[[Little Boy]]" and "[[Fat Man]]", which were used in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Laboratory received the [[Army-Navy ‘E’ Award]] for Excellence in production on October 16, 1945.

===Post-war===
After the war, Oppenheimer retired from the directorship, and it was taken over by [[Norris Bradbury]], whose initial mission was to make the previously hand-assembled atomic bombs "G.I. proof" so that they could be mass-produced and used without the assistance of highly trained scientists. Many of the original Los Alamos "luminaries" chose to leave the laboratory, and some even became outspoken opponents to the further development of nuclear weapons.

The name officially changed to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory on January 1, 1947. By this time, Argonne had already been made the first National Laboratory the previous year. Los Alamos would not become a National Laboratory in name until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Plans and Practices for Groundwater Protection at the Los Alamos National Laboratory |publisher= National Research Council |page=5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=smObAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since the 1940s, Los Alamos was responsible for the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], and many other variants of nuclear weapons. In 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was founded to act as Los Alamos' "competitor", with the hope that two laboratories for the design of nuclear weapons would spur innovation. Los Alamos and Livermore served as the primary classified laboratories in the U.S. national laboratory system, designing all the country's nuclear arsenal. Additional work included basic scientific research, [[particle accelerator]] development, health physics, and fusion power research as part of [[Project Sherwood]]. Many nuclear tests were undertaken in the [[Marshall Islands]] and at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. During the late-1950s, a number of scientists including [[John Robert Beyster|Dr. J. Robert "Bob" Beyster]] left Los Alamos to work for [[General Atomics]] (GA) in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;

Three major nuclear-related accidents have occurred at LANL. [[Criticality accident]]s occurred in August 1945 and May 1946, and a third accident occurred during an annual physical inventory in December 1958.&lt;ref name=unsc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/11-80076_Report_2008_Annex_C.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation – 2008 Report to the General Assembly |volume=II Scientific Annexes C, D, and E - Annex C: Radiation exposures in accidents |website=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] |pages=2–3 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several buildings associated with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos were declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{cite web |url={{NHLS url|id=66000893}} |format=pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form / Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory |date=January 14, 1974 |first=Richard |last=Greenwood |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url={{NHLS url|id=66000893|photos=y}} |title=Accompanying photos |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cold War===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], both labs went through a process of intense scientific diversification in their research programs to adapt to the changing political conditions that no longer required as much research towards developing new nuclear weapons and has led the lab to increase research for "non-war" science and technology. Los Alamos' nuclear work is currently thought to relate primarily to computer simulations and [[stockpile stewardship]]. The development of the [[Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility]] will allow complex simulations of nuclear tests to take place without full explosive yields.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The lab has made intense efforts for [[humanitarian]] causes through its scientific research in medicine. Three vaccines for the [[AIDS virus]] are being tested by lab scientist Bette Korber and her team. "These vaccines might finally deal a lethal blow to the [[HIV|AIDS virus]]", says Chang-Shung Tung, leader of the Lab's Theoretical Biology and Biophysics group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/news/releases/hiv_vaccine_strategy_expands_immune_responses_news_release.html |title=HIV Vaccine Strategy Expands Immune Responses |first=Bette |last=Korber |date=March 3, 2010 |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021050027/http://www.lanl.gov/news/releases/hiv_vaccine_strategy_expands_immune_responses_news_release.html |archivedate=October 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also development for a safer, more comfortable and accurate test for [[breast cancer]] by Lab scientists Lianjie Huang and Kenneth M. Hanson and collaborators. The new technique, called ultrasound-computed tomography (ultrasound CT), uses sound waves to accurately detect small tumors that traditional mammography cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Lianjie|last2=Hanson|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Quan|first3=Youli|last4=Li|first4=Cuiping|last5=Duric|first5=Neb|chapter=Globally optimized Fourier finite-difference method for ultrasound breast imaging|title=Medical Imaging 2008: Ultrasonic Imaging and Signal Processing |series=Proceedings of SPIE|volume=692007|doi=10.1117/12.771024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory contributed to the early development of the [[flow cytometry]] technology. In the 1950s, researcher Mack Fulwyler developed a technique for sorting [[erythrocytes]] that combined the Coulter Principle of [[Coulter counter]] technologies, which measures the presence of cells and their size, with ink jet technology, which produces a laminar flow of liquid that breaks up into separate, fine drops. In 1969, Los Alamos reported the first fluorescence detector apparatus, which accurately measured the number and size of ovarian cells and blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sYZuiy4BbvUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=flow+cytometry+principles&amp;ots=jcxa4lXAek&amp;sig=3-AR7OFH6ZplN9eUhVDMNS7UYDw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Flow Cytometry First Principles | first = Alice | last = Givan |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research performed at the lab includes developing cheaper, cleaner bio-fuels and advancing scientific understanding around renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science-innovation/science-programs/applied-energy-programs/index.php|title=Applied Energy Program|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-nuclear [[national security]] and defense development is also a priority at the lab. This includes preventing outbreaks of deadly diseases by improving detection tools and the monitoring the effectiveness of the United States’ [[vaccine]] distribution infrastructure. Additional advancements include the ASPECT airplane that can detect bio threats from the sky.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The laboratory has attracted negative publicity from a number of events.  In 1999, Los Alamos scientist [[Wen Ho Lee]] was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets—"weapons codes" used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests—to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count and the other 58 were dismissed with an apology from U.S. District Judge [[James Aubrey Parker|James Parker]] for his incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, two computer hard drives containing classified data were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier; in 2003, the laboratory's director [[John C. Browne (physicist)|John Browne]], and deputy director, resigned following accusations that they had improperly dismissed two [[whistleblower]]s who had alleged widespread theft at the lab. The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory in the form of the [[Cerro Grande Fire]], a severe [[Wildfire|forest fire]] that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks.

In July 2004, an inventory of classified weapons data revealed that four [[hard disk drive]]s were missing:  two of the drives were subsequently found to have been improperly moved to a different building, but another two remained unaccounted for.  In response, director [[Peter Nanos]] shut down large parts of the laboratory and publicly rebuked scientists working there for a lax attitude to security procedures. In the laboratory's August 2004 newsletter he wrote, "This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many people I have to fire to make it stop". Nanos is also quoted as saying, "If I have to restart the laboratory with 10 people, I will". However, a report released in January 2005 found that the drives were in fact an artifact of an inconsistent inventory system: the report concludes that 12 barcodes were issued to a group of disk drives that needed only 10, but the two surplus barcodes nevertheless appeared on a master list. Thus, auditors wrongly concluded that two disks were missing. The report states, "The allegedly missing disks never existed and no compromise of classified material has occurred". This incident is widely reported as contributing to continuing distrust of management at the lab. In May 2005, Nanos stepped down as director.

== Science mission ==
Los Alamos National Laboratory's mission is to solve national security challenges through scientific excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/mission/index.php|title=Mission|last=Energy|first=Los Alamos National Laboratory, Operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC, for the U.S. Department of|website=www.lanl.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory's strategic plan reflects U.S. priorities spanning nuclear security, intelligence, defense, emergency response, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, energy security, emerging threats, and environmental management. This strategy is aligned with priorities set by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA), and national strategy guidance documents, such as the [[Nuclear Posture Review]], the [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160815011713/https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/blueprint-secure-energy-future Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future]

Los Alamos is the senior laboratory in the [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|DOE system]], and executes work in all areas of the DOE mission: national security, science, energy, and environmental management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/mission|title=Mission {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory also performs work for the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] (IC), and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), among others.
The laboratory's multidisciplinary scientific capabilities and activities are organized into four Science Pillars:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science-innovation/pillars/index.php|title=Capabilities: Science Pillars|last=Energy|first=Los Alamos National Laboratory, Operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC, for the U.S. Department of|website=www.lanl.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Information, Science, and Technology Pillar''' leverages advances in theory, algorithms, and the exponential growth of high-performance computing to accelerate the integrative and predictive capability of the scientific method.
* '''The Materials for the Future Pillar''' seeks to optimize materials for national security applications by predicting and controlling their performance and functionality through discovery science and engineering.
* '''The Nuclear and Particle Futures Pillar''' applies science and technology to intransigent problems of system identification and characterization in areas of global security, nuclear defense, energy, and health.
* '''The Science of Signatures Pillar''' integrates nuclear experiments, theory, and simulation to understand and engineer complex nuclear phenomena.
Through partnerships across government agencies, laboratories, universities, and industry, Los Alamos integrates science, technology, research and development solutions to achieve the maximum impact on strategic national security priorities. To further these collaborative efforts, Los Alamos operates three main user facilities:
# [http://cint.lanl.gov/ The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies]: The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies is a DOE/Office of Science National User Facility operated jointly by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories with facilities at both Laboratories. CINT is dedicated to establishing the scientific principles that govern the design, performance, and integration of nanoscale materials into microscale and macroscale systems and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.energy.gov/bes/suf/user-facilities/nanoscale-science-research-centers/cint/|title=Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) {{!}} U.S. DOE Office of Science (SC)|website=science.energy.gov|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Los Alamos Neutron Science Center|Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)]]: The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center is one of the world's most powerful linear accelerators. LANSCE provides the scientific community with intense sources of neutrons with the capability of performing experiments supporting civilian and national security research.

The Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory operates an international user program for research in high magnetic fields.
As of 2017, the Los Alamos National Laboratory is using data and [[algorithm]]s to possibly protect public health by tracking the growth of [[Infection|infectious diseases]]. Digital [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] at the lab's Information Systems and Modeling group are using clinical surveillance data, [[Google]] search queries, census data, Wikipedia, and even [[Twitter|tweets]] to create a system that could predict epidemics. The team is using data from Brazil as its model; Brazil was notably threatened by the [[Zika virus]] as it prepared to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/24541-los-alamos-national-laboratory-reveals-potential-tracking-disease-spread-real-time/|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory reveals potential in tracking disease spread in real time|last=Galford|first=Chris|date=October 4, 2017|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=October 11, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laboratory management and operations==
Around LANL's 43-square-mile property are 2,000 dumpsites which have permanently contaminated the environment. It also contributed to thousands of dumpsites at 108 locations in 29 US states.&lt;ref name=sf&gt;{{cite news|author1=Staci Matlock|title=TRINITY: 70 YEARS LATER 'Los Alamos will never be clean'|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/los-alamos-will-never-be-clean/article_a3cc7ce1-8af0-5113-8f38-5d4aa673fd7a.html|accessdate=July 18, 2015|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract changes===
Continuing efforts to make the laboratory more efficient led the Department of Energy to open its contract with the University of California to bids from other vendors in 2003. Though the university and the laboratory had difficult relations many times since their first World War II contract, this was the first time that the university ever had to compete for management of the laboratory. The University of California decided to create a private company with the [[Bechtel]] Corporation, [[Washington Group International]], and the [[BWX Technologies]] to bid on the contract to operate the laboratory. The UC/Bechtel led corporation—[[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] (LANS)—was pitted against a team formed by the [[University of Texas System]] partnered with [[Lockheed-Martin]]. In December 2005, the Department of Energy announced that LANS had won the next seven-year contract to manage and operate the laboratory.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

On June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its sixty years of direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory, and management control of the laboratory was taken over by [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] with effect October 1, 2007. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 plus UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL. Other than UC appointing three members to the eleven member board of directors that oversees LANS, UC now has virtually no responsibility or direct involvement in LANL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and its two national laboratories in California ([[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]]) no longer apply to LANL, and the LANL director no longer reports to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President. Also, LANL employees were removed from the UC's [[403(b)]] retirement savings and defined benefits [[pension]] program and placed in a LANS run program. While the LANS retirement program provides rehired UC employees with pensions similar to those UC would have given them, LANS no longer guarantees full pensions to newly hired LANL employees. It now provides basic [[401(k)]] retirement saving options.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Safety Management===

In August 2011, a near criticality incident happened with eight rods of plutonium placed close to each other to take a photo. In the aftermath, 12 of 14 of the lab's safety staff left in anger about their advice being dismissed by the management. Without safety management, the Plutonium Facility PF-4 was shut down in 2013 and is still closed in 2017 because the lab fails to meet expectations.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Public Integrity, Patrick Malone: [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/near-disaster-federal-nuclear-weapons-laboratory-takes-hidden-toll-america-s-arsenal ''Repeated safety lapses hobble Los Alamos National Laboratory’s work on the cores of U.S. nuclear warheads'']. Science 356, 2017, [[doi:10.1126/science.aan7026]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the U.S. Department of Energy, sought alternative suppliers the LANL's management contract.&lt;ref name=sciencemag-20180119/&gt;

The lab was penalized with a $57 million reduction in its 2014 budget over the February 14, 2014 accident at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] for which it was partly responsible.&lt;ref&gt;W.J.

Los Angeles Times, January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

With support of the [[National Science Foundation]], LANL operates one of the three [[NHMFL|National High Magnetic Field Laboratories]] in conjunction with and located at two other sites [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], and [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]].

Los Alamos National Laboratory is a partner in the [[Joint Genome Institute]] (JGI) located in [[Walnut Creek, California]]. JGI was founded in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in [[genome project|genome mapping]], [[DNA sequencing]], technology development, and [[information science]]s pioneered at the three [[genome]] centers at University of California's [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and LANL.

The '''Integrated Computing Network''' (ICN) is a multi-security level network at the LANL integrating large host supercomputers, a file server, a batch server, a printer and graphics output server and numerous other general purpose and specialized systems. [[IBM Roadrunner]], which was part of this network, was the first supercomputer to hit petaflop speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUKN0947487420080610 |title=Energy Dept says new computer world's fastest |last=Fox |first=Maggie |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-link trunking (MLT)''' is a [[link aggregation]] [[port trunking]] technology developed at [[Nortel]] in 1999. It allows grouping several physical [[Ethernet]] links into one logical Ethernet link to provide fault-tolerance and high-speed links between routers, switches, and servers.

Using this technology allows or enables the use of several links (from 2 up to 8) and combined them to create increased bandwidth and several fail-over paths. This produces server to switch or switch to switch connections that are up to 8 times faster. In the past redundant links were unused due to [[Spanning tree protocol|Spanning Tree]]’s loop protection.

[[Fault-tolerant design]] is an important aspect of Multi-Link Trunking technology. Should any one or more than one link fail, the MLT technology will automatically redistribute traffic across the remaining links. This automatic redistribution is accomplished in less than half a second (typically less than 100 millisecond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tolly.com/ts/2007/Nortel/ERSswitches/Tolly207171NortelERSwitchSMLT.pdf | title=Evaluation of Resilient Routing Switches for Real-Time Multimedia Traffic with Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 and Nortel MCS 5100 | publisher=The Tolly Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so no outage is noticed by end users. This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks. Combining MLT technology with [[Distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking]] (DSMLT), [[Split multi-link trunking]] (SMLT), and [[R-SMLT]] technologies create networks that support the most critical applications.

A general limitation of standard MLT is that all the physical ports in the link aggregation group must reside on the same switch. SMLT, DSMLT and R-SMLT technologies removes this limitation by allowing the physical ports to be split between two switches.

Link aggregation or MLT allows multiple physical network links between two network switches and another device (which could be another switch or a network device such as a server) to be treated as a single logical link and load balance the traffic across all available links.  For each packet that needs to be transmitted, one of the physical links is selected based on a [[load balancing (computing)|load-balancing]] [[algorithm]] (usually involving a [[hash function]] operating on the source and destination [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) address information). For real-world network traffic this generally results in an effective bandwidth for the logical link equal to the sum of the bandwidth of the individual physical links. Redundant links that were once unused due to Spanning Tree’s loop protection can now be used to their full potential.

A general limitation of standard link aggregation, MLT or [[EtherChannel]] is that all the physical ports in the link aggregation group must reside on the same switch. The SMLT, [[DSMLT]] and [[RSMLT]] protocols remove this limitation by allowing the physical ports to be split between two switches, allowing for the creation of Active load sharing [[high availability]] network designs that meet [[Nines (engineering)|five nines]] availability requirements.

===SMLT Topologies===
[[Image:SMLT.JPG|300px|thumb|right|SMLT triangle between 3 [[Avaya]] switches 40Gbit/s full duplex to edge switch]]The two switches between which the SMLT is split are known as aggregation switches and form a logical cluster which appears to the other end of the SMLT link as a single switch.

The split may be at one or at both ends of the MLT. If both ends of the link are split, the resulting topology is referred to as an "SMLT square" when there is no cross-connect between diagonally opposite aggregation switches, or an "SMLT mesh" when each aggregation switch has a SMLT connection with both aggregation switches in the other pair. If only one end is split, the topology is referred to as an SMLT triangle.

In an SMLT triangle, the end of the link which is not split does not need to support SMLT. This allows non-Avaya devices including third-party switches and servers to benefit from SMLT. The only requirement is that IEEE 802.3ad static mode must be supported.

=== Operation ===
[[Image:Server-SMLT.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Server SMLT triangle]]The key to the operation of SMLT is the [[Inter-Switch Trunk]] (IST).  The IST is a (standard) MLT connection between the aggregation switches which allows the exchange of information regarding traffic forwarding and the status of individual SMLT links.

For each SMLT connection, the aggregation switches have a standard MLT or individual port with which an SMLT identifier is associated.  For a given SMLT connection, the same SMLT ID must be configured on each of the peer aggregation switches.

For example, when one switch receives a response to an [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] request from an end-station on a port that is part of an SMLT, it will inform its peer switch across the IST and request the peer to update its own ARP table with a record pointing to its own connection with the corresponding SMLT ID.

In general, normal network traffic does not traverse the IST unless this is the only path to reach a host which is connected only to the peer switch.  By ensuring all devices have SMLT connections to the aggregation switches, traffic never needs to traverse the IST and the total forwarding capacity of the switches in the cluster is also aggregated.

The communication between peer switches across the IST allows both unicast and multicast routing information to be exchanged allowing protocols such as [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) and [[PIM Sparse Mode|Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode]] (PIM-SM) to operate correctly.

===Failure Scenarios===
[[File:Video SMLT Presentation.theora.ogv|700px]]
The use of SMLT not only allows traffic to be load-balanced across all the links in an aggregation group but also allows traffic to be redistributed very quickly in the event of link or switch failure. In general the failure of any one component results in a traffic disruption lasting less than half a second (normal less than 100 millisecond&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;) making SMLT appropriate in environments running time- and loss-sensitive applications such as voice and video.

In a network using SMLT, it is often no longer necessary to run a [[spanning tree protocol]] of any kind since there are no logical bridging loops introduced by the presence of the IST. This eliminates the need for spanning tree reconvergence or root-bridge failovers in failure scenarios which causes interruptions in network traffic longer than time-sensitive applications are able to cater for.

===Product Support===
SMLT is supported within the following Avaya Ethernet Routing Switch (ERS) and Virtual Services Platform (VSP) Product Families: ERS 1600, [[Avaya ERS 5500|ERS 5500]], [[Avaya ERS-5600 Systems|ERS 5600]], [[Avaya VSP-7000 System|ERS 7000]], [[Avaya ERS 8300|ERS 8300]], [[Avaya ERS 8800|ERS 8800]], [[Avaya ERS 8600|ERS 8600]], [[MERS 8600]], [[Avaya VSP-9000 System|VSP 9000]]

SMLT is fully interoperable with devices supporting standard MLT (IEEE 802.3ad static mode).

In many cases, core network convergence time after a failure is dependent on the length of time a routing protocol requires to successfully converge (change or re-route traffic around the fault). Depending on the specific routing protocol, this convergence time can cause network interruptions ranging from seconds to minutes.  The R-SMLT protocol works with SMLT and [[distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking]] (DSMLT) technologies to provide sub-second failover (normally less than 100 milliseconds)&lt;ref&gt;

Fault-tolerance is a very important aspect of Distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking (DSMLT) technology. Should any one switch, port, or more than one link fail, the DSMLT technology will automatically redistribute traffic across the remaining links. Automatic redistribution is accomplished in less than half a second (typically less than 100 milliseconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tolly.com/ts/2007/Nortel/ERSswitches/Tolly207171NortelERSwitchSMLT.pdf | title=Evaluation of Resilient Routing Switches for Real-Time Multimedia Traffic with Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 and Nortel MCS 5100 | publisher=The Tolly Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so no outage is noticed by end users.  This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks.

The '''Nelson–Aalen estimator''' is a [[nonparametric statistics|non-parametric estimator]] of the [[hazard rate|cumulative hazard rate]] function in case of [[Censoring (statistics)|censored data]] or [[missing data|incomplete data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tkchen.wordpress.com/2008/09/21/kaplan-meier-and-nelson-aalen-estimators/|title=Kaplan–Meier and Nelson–Aalen Estimators}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[survival analysis|survival theory]], [[reliability engineering]] and [[life insurance]] to estimate the cumulative number of expected events. An "event" can be the failure of a non-repairable component, the death of a human being, or any occurrence for which the experimental unit remains in the "failed" state (e.g., death) from the point at which it changed on. The [[estimator]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}(t)=\sum_{t_i\leq t}\frac{d_i}{n_i},&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; the number of events at &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; the total individuals at risk at &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statsdirect.com/help/survival_analysis/kaplan.htm|title=Kaplan–Meier Survival Estimates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curvature of the Nelson–Aalen estimator gives an idea of the hazard rate shape. A concave shape is an indicator for [[bathtub curve|infant mortality]] while a convex shape indicates [[bathtub curve|wear out mortality]].

It can be used for example when testing the homogeneity of [[Poisson process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jan |last=Kysely |first2=Jan |last2=Picek |first3=Romana |last3=Beranova |year=2010 |title=Estimating extremes in climate change simulations using the peaks-over-threshold method with a non-stationary threshold |journal=Global and Planetary Change |volume=72 |issue=1-2 |pages=55–68 |doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Private jurisdiction''' is the right of an individual or a [[Legal person|legal entity]] to establish [[Court|courts of law]]. It was prevalent during [[feudalism]].

A [[Exclusive right|franchise]], such as a [[corporation]], a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an "[[incorporeal hereditament]]". Under [[English law]] incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in [[charter]]s. 

Franchise jurisdictions included those of [[manorial court]]s, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over [[family law]]), [[borough courts]] of [[municipal corporation]]s, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.

In medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]" and [[county|counties]]. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the [[East India Company]]). 

In medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for [[trespass]] ([[tort]]) against the franchise court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55745">'''Protein engineering''' is the process of developing useful or valuable [[protein]]s. It is a young discipline, with much research taking place into the understanding of [[protein folding]] and recognition for [[protein design]] principles.  It is also a product and services market, with an estimated value of $168 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/speeding-up-the-protein-assembly-line/5418/ |title= Speeding Up the Protein Assembly Line |last= Liszewski|first= Kathy |date= 15 February 2015 |work= [[Gen. Eng. Biotechnol. News|Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News]] |via= |type= paper|page= 1|volume= 35|issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two general strategies for protein engineering: [[protein design|rational protein design]] and [[directed evolution]].  These methods are not mutually exclusive; researchers will often apply both.  In the future, more detailed knowledge of [[protein structure]] and [[Protein function|function]], and advances in [[high-throughput screening]], may greatly expand the abilities of protein engineering.  Eventually, even unnatural amino acids may be included, via newer methods, such as [[expanded genetic code]], that allow encoding novel amino acids in genetic code.

==Approaches==

=== Rational design ===
{{main|Protein design}}
In rational protein design, a scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of a protein to make desired changes. In general, this has the advantage of being inexpensive and technically easy, since [[site-directed mutagenesis]] methods are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and, even when available, it can be very difficult to predict the effects of various mutations since structural information most often provide a static picture of a protein structure. However, programs such as [[Folding@home]] and [[Foldit]] have utilized [[crowdsourcing]] techniques in order to gain insight into the folding motifs of proteins. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=Tylar|last2=Bohse|first2=Patrick|last3=Kerr|first3=Diane|title=Rational Design Protein Engineering Through Crowdsourcing|journal=Journal of Student Research|date=2017|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.jofsr.com/index.php/path/article/view/377/168|accessdate=27 April 2018|issn=2167-1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Computational protein design [[algorithm]]s seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.

===Multiple Sequence Alignment===

Without structural information about a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for the function of the protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. [[Multiple sequence alignment]] utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross reference target protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poluri|first1=Krishna Mohan|last2=Gulati|first2=Khushboo|title=Protein Engineering Techniques|date=2017|publisher=Springer|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-981-10-2732-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

This method begins by performing pair wise alignment of sequences using [[k-tuple]] or [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm|Needleman–Wunsch]] methods. These methods calculate a matrix that depicts the pair wise similarity among the sequence pairs. Similarity scores are then transformed into distance scores that are used to produce a guide tree using the neighbor joining method. This guide tree is then employed to yield a multiple sequence alignment.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Clustal Omega====

This method is capable of aligning up to 190,00 sequences by utilizing the k-tuple method. Next sequences are clustered using the mBed and [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] methods. A guide tree is then constructed using the [[UPGMA]] method that is used by the HH align package. This guide tree is used to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====MAFFT====
This method utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that converts amino acid sequences into a sequence composed of volume and polarity values for each amino acid residue. This new sequence is used to find homologous regions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====K-Align====

This method utilizes the Wu-Manber approximate string matching algorithm to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log Expectation (MUSCLE)====

This method utilizes Kmer and Kimura distances to generate multiple sequence alignments.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====T-Coffee====

This method utilizes tree based consistency objective functions for alignment evolution. This method has been shown to be 5-10% more accurate than Clustal W.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Coevolutionary Analysis===

Coevolutionary analysis is also known as correlated mutation, covariation, or co-substitution. This type of rational design involves reciprocal evolutionary changes at evolutionarily interacting loci. Generally this method begins with the generation of a curated multiple sequence alignments for the target sequence. This alignment is then subjected to manual refinement that involves removal of highly gapped sequences also sequences with low sequence identity. This step increases the quality of the alignment. Next, the manually processed alignment is utilized for further coevolutionary measurements using distinct correlated mutation algorithms. These algorithms result in a coevolution scoring matrix. This matrix is filtered by applying various significance tests to extract significant coevolution values and wipe out background noise. Coevolutionary measurements are further evaluated to assess their performance and stringency. Finally, the results from this coevolutionary analysis are validated experimentally.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

===Structural Prediction===

''De Novo'' synthesis of protein benefits from knowledge of existing protein structures. This knowledge of existing protein structure assists with the prediction of new protein structures. Methods for protein structure prediction fall under one of the four following classes:  ''ab initio,'' fragment based methods, homology modeling, and protein threading.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====''Ab initio''====

These methods involve free modeling without using any structural information about the template. ''Ab initio''  methods are aimed at prediction of the native structures of proteins corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy. some examples of ''ab initio'' methods are AMBER, GROMOS, GROMACS, CHARMM, OPLS, and ENCEPP12. General steps for  ''ab initio'' methods begin with the geometric representation of the protein of interest. Next, a potential energy function model for the protein is developed. This model can be created using either molecular mechanics potentials or protein structure derived potential functions. Following the development of a potential model, energy search techniques including molecular dynamic simulations, Monte Carlo simulations and genetic algorithms are applied to the protein.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Fragment based====

These methods use database information regarding structures to match homologous structures to the created protein sequences. These homologous structures are assembled to give compact structures using scoring and optimization procedures, with the goal of achieving the lowest potential energy score. Webservers for fragment information are listed here: I-TASSER, ROSETTA, ROSETTA @ home, FRAGFOLD, CABS fold, PROFESY, CREF, QUARK, UNDERTAKER, HMM, and ANGLOR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|72}}

====Homology modeling====

These methods are based upon the homology of proteins. These methods are also known as comparative modeling. The first step in homology modeling is generally the identification of template sequences of known structure which are homologous to the query sequence. Next the query sequence is aligned to the template sequence. Following the alignment, the structurally conserved regions are modeled using the template structure. This is followed by the modeling of side chains and loops that are distinct from the template. Finally the modeled structure undergoes refirnment and assessment of quality. Servers that are available for homology modeling data are listed here: SWISS MODEL, MODELLER, ReformAlign, PyMOD, TIP-STRUCTFAST, COMPASS, 3d-PSSM, SAMT02, SAMT99, HHPRED, FAGUE, 3D-JIGSAW, META-PP, ROSETTA, and I-TASSER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Protein threading====

Protein threading can be used when a reliable homologue for the query sequence cannot be found. This method begins by obtaining a query sequence and a library of template structures. Next, the query sequence is threaded over known template structures. These candidate models are scored using scoring functions. These are scored based upon potential energy models of both query and template sequence. The match with the lowest potential energy model is then selected. Methods and servers for retrieving threading data and performing calculations are listed here: GenTHREADER, pGenTHREADER, pDomTHREADER, ORFEUS, PROSPECT, BioShell-Threading, FFASO3, RaptorX, HHPred, LOOPP server, Sparks-X, SEGMER, THREADER2, ESYPRED3D, LIBRA, TOPITS, RAPTOR, COTH, MUSTER.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

For more information on rational design see [[Site-directed mutagenesis]].

=== Directed evolution ===
{{main|Directed evolution}}
In directed evolution, random [[mutagenesis]], e.g. by [[error-prone PCR]] or [[Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis]], is applied to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits.  Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied.  This method mimics natural [[evolution]] and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed [[DNA shuffling]], mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results.  Such processes mimic the [[homologous recombination|recombination]] that occurs naturally during [[sexual reproduction]].  Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary to be able to predict what effect a given mutation will have.  Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect.  The drawback is that they require [[high-throughput screening]], which is not feasible for all proteins.  Large amounts of [[recombinant DNA]] must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits.  The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process.  Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.

Natural Darwinian evolution can be effectively imitated in the lab toward tailoring protein properties for diverse applications, including catalysis. Many experimental technologies exist to produce large and diverse protein libraries and for screening or selecting folded, functional variants. Folded proteins arise surprisingly frequently in random sequence space, an occurrence exploitable in evolving selective binders and catalysts. While more conservative than direct selection from deep sequence space, redesign of existing proteins by random mutagenesis and selection/screening is a particularly robust method for optimizing or altering extant properties. It also represents an excellent starting point for achieving more ambitious engineering goals. Allying experimental evolution with modern computational methods is likely the broadest, most fruitful strategy for generating functional macromolecules unknown to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jäckel|first=Christian|last2=Kast|first2=Peter|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2008-05-07|title=Protein Design by Directed Evolution|url=http://annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=153–173|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenges of designing high quality mutant libraries have shown significant progress in the recent past. This progress has been in the form of better descriptions of the effects  of mutational loads on protein traits. Also computational approaches have showed large advances in the innumerably large sequence space to more manageable screenable sizes, thus creating smart libraries of mutants. Library size has also been reduced to more screenable sizes by the identification of key beneficial residues using algorithms for systematic recombination. Finally a significant step forward toward efficient reengineering of enzymes has been made with the development of more accurate statistical models and algorithms quantifying and predicting coupled mutational effects on protein functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shivange|first=Amol V|last2=Marienhagen|first2=Jan|last3=Mundhada|first3=Hemanshu|last4=Schenk|first4=Alexander|last5=Schwaneberg|first5=Ulrich|title=Advances in generating functional diversity for directed protein evolution|url=http://za2uf4ps7f.search.serialssolutions.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.atitle=Advances%20in%20generating%20functional%20diversity%20for%20directed%20protein%20evolution&amp;rft.aufirst=Amol%20V.&amp;rft.aulast=Shivange&amp;rft.date=2009&amp;rft.epage=25&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.issn=1367-5931&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.jtitle=CURRENT%20OPINION%20IN%20CHEMICAL%20BIOLOGY&amp;rft.pages=19-25&amp;rft.spage=19&amp;rft.stitle=CURR%20OPIN%20CHEM%20BIOL&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/www.isinet.com:WoK:UA&amp;rft.au=Marienhagen,%20Jan&amp;rft.au=Mundhada,%20Hemanshu&amp;rft.au=Schenk,%20Alexander&amp;rft.au=Schwaneberg,%20Ulrich&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/19261539&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=19–25|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, directed evolution may be summarized as an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the protein structure and function relationship. Directed evolution utilizes random or focused mutagenesis to generate libraries of mutant proteins. Random mutations can be introduced using either error prone PCR, or site saturation mutagenesis. Mutants may also be generated using recombination of multiple homologous genes. Nature has evolved a limited number of beneficial sequences. Directed evolution makes it possible to identify undiscovered protein sequences which have novel functions. This ability is contingent on the proteins ability to tolerant amino acid residue substitutions without compromising folding or stability.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Directed evolution methods can be broadly categorized into two strategies, asexual and sexual methods.

=== Asexual Methods ===
Asexual methods do not generate any cross links between parental genes. Single genes are used to create mutant libraries using various mutagenic techniques. These asexual methods can produce either random or focused mutagenesis.

==== Random Mutagenesis ====
Random mutagenic methods produce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest. Random mutagenesis can introduce the following types of mutations: transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, inversion, missense, and nonsense. Examples of methods for producing random mutagenesis are below.

====Error Prone PCR====

Error prone PCR utilizes the fact that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to competent cell systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates the next round of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Rates of error in PCR can be increased in the following ways:&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}
# Increase concentration of magnesium chloride, which stabilizes non complementary base pairing.
# Add manganese chloride to reduce base pair specificity. 
# Increased and unbalanced addition of dNTPs.
# Addition of base analogs like dITP, 8 oxo-dGTP, and dPTP.
# Increase concentration of Taq polymerase.
# Increase extension time.
# Increase cycle time.
# Use less accurate Taq polymerase.
Also see [[Polymerase chain reaction]] for more information.

====Rolling circle error-prone PCR====

This PCR method is based upon rolling circle amplification, which is modeled from the method that bacteria use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear  DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Φ29  DNA polymerase under error prone rolling circle amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone rolling circle amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone rolling circle amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification do not need to be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Chemical mutagenesis====

Chemical mutagenesis involves the use of chemical agents to introduce mutations into genetic sequences. Examples of chemical mutagens follow:

&lt;u&gt;Sodium Bisulfate&lt;/u&gt; - This mutagenic agent is effective at mutating G/C rich genomic sequences. This is because sodium bisulfate catalyses deamination of unmethylated cytosine to uracil.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

&lt;u&gt;Ethyl Methane Sulfonate&lt;/u&gt; - This chemical agent alkylates guanidine residues. This alteration causes errors during DNA replication.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

&lt;u&gt;Nitrous Acid&lt;/u&gt; - This chemical agent causes transversion by de-amination of adenine and cytosine.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

The dual approach to random chemical mutagenesis is an iterative two step process. First it involves the ''in vivo'' chemical mutagenesis of the gene of interest via EMS. Next, the treated gene is isolated and cloning into an untreated expression vector in order to prevent mutations in the plasmid backbone.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This technique preserves the plasmids genetic properties.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Targeting Glycosylases to Embedded Arrays for Mutagenesis (TaGTEAM)====

This method has been used to create targeted  ''in vivo'' mutagenesis in yeast. This method involves the fusion of a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase to tetR DNA-binding domain. This has been shown to increase mutation rates by over 800 time in regions of the genome containing tetO sites.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenesis by Random Insertion and Deletion====

This method involves alteration in length of the sequence via simultaneous deletion and insertion of chunks of bases of arbitrary length. This method has been shown to produce proteins with new functionalities via introduction of new restriction sites, specific codons, four base codons for non-natural amino acids.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Transposon Based Random Mutagenesis====

Recently many methods for transposon based random mutagenesis have been reported. This methods include, but are not limited to the following: PERMUTE-Random Circular Permutation, random protein truncation, random nucleotide triplet substitution, random domain/tag/multiple amino acid insertion, codon scanning mutagenesis, and multicodon scanning mutagenesis. These aforementioned techniques all require the design of mini-Mu transposons. Thermo scientific manufactures kits for the design of these transposons.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Mutagenesis Methods Altering the Target DNA Length====

These methods involve altering gene length via insertion and deletion mutations. An example is the Tandem Repeat Inserstion (TRINS) method. This technique results in the generation of tandem repeats of random fragments of the target gene via rolling circle amplification and concurrent incorporation of these repeats into the target gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutator strains====

Mutator strains are bacterial cell lines which are deficient in one or more DNA repair mechanisms. An example of a mutator strand is the E. coli XL1-RED.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} This subordinate strain of E. coli is deficient in the MutS, MutD, MutT DNA repair pathways. Use of mutator strains is useful at introducing many types of mutation; however, these strains show progressive sickness of culture because of the accumulation of mutations in the strains own genome.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== Focused mutagenesis ====
Focused mutagenic methods produce mutations at predetermined amino acid residues. These techniques require and understanding of the sequence-function relationship for the protein of interest. Understanding of this relationship allows for the identification of residues which are important in stability, stereoselectivity, and catalytic efficiency.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Examples of methods that produce focused mutagenesis are below.

====Site saturation mutagenesis====

Site saturation mutagenesis is a PCR based method used to target amino acids with significant roles in protein function. The two most common techniques for performing this are whole plasmid single PCR, and overlap extension PCR.

Whole plasmid single PCR is also referred to as site directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM products are subjected to Dpn endonuclease digestion. This digestion results in cleavage of only the parental strand, because the parental strand contains a GmATC which is methylated at N6 of adenine. SDM does not work well for large plasmids of over ten kilobases. Also, this method is only capable of replacing two nucleotides at a time.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Overlap extension PCR requires the use of two pairs of primers. One primer in each set contains a mutation. A first round of PCR using these primer sets is performed and two double stranded DNA duplexes are formed. A second round of PCR is then performed in which these duplexes are denatured and annealed with the primer sets again to produce heteroduplexes, in which each strand has a mutation. Any gaps in these newly formed heteroduplexes are filled with DNA polymerases and further amplified.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====[[Sequence saturation mutagenesis]] (SeSaM)====

This technique results in the randomization of the target sequence at every nucleotide position. This method begins with the generation of variable length DNA fragments tailed with universal bases via the use of template transferases at the 3' termini. Next, these fragments are extended to full length using a single stranded template. The universal bases are replaced with a random standard base, causing mutations. There are several modified versions of this method such as SeSAM-Tv-II, SeSAM-Tv+, and SeSAM-III.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Single primer reactions in parallel (SPRINP)====

This site saturation mutagenesis method involves two separate PCR reaction. The first of which uses only forward primers, while the second reaction uses only reverse primers. This avoids the formation of primer dimer formation.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mega Primed and Ligase Free Focused Mutagenesis====

This site saturation mutagenic technique begins with one mutagenic oligonucleotide and one universal flanking primer. These two reactants are used for an initial PCR cycle. Products from this first PCR cycle are used as mega primers for the next PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Ω-PCR====

This site saturation mutagenic method is based on overlap extension PCR. It is used to introduce mutations at any site in a circular plasmid.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====PFunkel-Ominchange-OSCARR====

This method utilizes user defined site directed mutagenesis at single or multiple sites simultaneously. OSCARR is an acronym for One Pot Simple Methodology for Cassette Randomization and Recombination. This randomization and recombination results in randomization of desired fragments of a protein. Omnichange is a sequence independent, multisite saturation mutagenesis which can saturate up to five independent codons on a gene.

====Trimer-Dimer Mutagenesis====

This method removes redundant codons and stop codons.

====Cassette Mutagenesis====

This is a PCR based method. Cassette mutagenesis begins with the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves these restriction sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave these restriction sites and create sticky ends.  Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion  of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Sexual Methods ===
Sexual methods of directed evolution involve ''in vitro'' recombination which mimic natural ''in vivo'' recombination. Generally these techniques require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques are often used to recombine two different parental genes, and these methods do create cross overs between these genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vitro'' Homologous Recombination ====
Homologous recombination can be categorized as either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro. In vitro'' homologous recombination mimics natural ''in vivo'' recombination. These ''in vitro'' recombination methods require high sequence homology between parental sequences. These techniques exploit the natural diversity in parental genes by recombining them to yield chimeric genes. The resulting chimera show a blend of parental characteristics.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====DNA shuffling====

This ''in vitro'' technique was one of the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in chimeric DNA. The chimeric DNA of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random priming ''In vitro'' recombination (RPR)====

This ''in vitro'' homologous recombination method begins with the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers. These fragments are reassembled to full length parental genes using primer-less PCR. These reassembled sequences are then amplified using PCR and subjected to further selection processes. This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling because there is no use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Truncated Metagenomic Gene-Specific PCR====

This method generates chimeric genes directly from metagenomic samples. It begins with isolation of the desired gene by functional screening from metagenomic DNA sample. Next, specific primers are designed and used to amplify the homologous genes from different environmental samples. Finally, chimeric libraries are generated to retrieve the desired functional clones by shuffling these amplified homologous genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Staggered Extension Process (StEP)====

This ''in vitro'' method is based on template switching to generate chimeric genes. This PCR based method begins with an initial denaturation of the template, followed by annealing of primers and a short extension time. All subsequent cycle generate annealing between the short fragments generated in previous cycles and different parts of the template. These short fragments and the templates anneal together based on sequence complementarity. This process of fragments annealing template DNA is known as template switching. These annealed fragments will then serve as primers for further extension. This method is carried out until the parental length chimeric gene sequence is obtained. Execution of this method only requires flanking primers to begin. There is also no need for Dnase1 enzyme.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Chimeragenesis on Transient Templates (RACHITT)====

This method has been shown to generate chimeric gene libraries with an average of 14 crossovers per chimeric gene. It begins by aligning fragments from a parental top strand onto the bottom strand of a uracil containing template from a homologous gene. 5' and 3' overhang flaps are cleaved and gaps are filled by the exonuclease and endonuclease activities of Pfu and taq DNA polymerases. The uracil containing template is then removed from the heteroduplex by treatment with a uracil DNA glcosylase, followed by further amplification using PCR. This method is advantageous because it generates chimeras with relatively high crossover frequency. However it is somewhat limited due to the complexity and the need for generation of single stranded DNA and uracil containing single stranded template DNA.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Synthetic shuffling====

Shuffling of synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides adds flexibility to shuffling methods, since oligonucleotides containing optimal codons and beneficial mutations can be included.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

==== ''In vivo'' Homologous Recombination ====
'''&lt;small&gt;Cloning Performed in Yeast&lt;/small&gt;'''

This method involves PCR dependent reassembly of fragmented expression vectors. These reassembled vectors are then introduced to, and cloned in yeast. Using yeast to clone the vector avoids toxicity and counter-selection that would be introduced by ligation and propagation in E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mutagenic Organized Recombination Process by Homologous ''In Vivo'' Grouping (MORPHING)====

This method introduces mutations into specific regions of genes while leaving other parts intact by utilizing the high frequency of homologous recombination in yeast.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phage Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE)====

This method utilizes a bacteriophage with a modified life cycle to transfer evolving genes from host to host. The phage's life cycle is designed in such a way that the transfer is correlated with the activity of interest from the enzyme. This method is advantageous because it requires minimal human intervention for the continuous evolution of the gene.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

=== ''In Vitro'' Non-Homologous Recombination Methods ===
These methods are based upon the fact that proteins can exhibit similar structural identity while lacking sequence homology.

===Exon Shuffling===

Exon shuffling is the combination of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon shuffling involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Incremental Truncation for the Creation of Hybrid Enzymes (ITHCY)====

Fragments of parental genes are created using controlled digestion by exonuclease III. These fragments are blunted using endonuclease, and are ligated to produce hybrid genes. THIOITHCY is a modified ITHCY technique which utilized nucleotide triphosphate analogs such as α-phosphothioate dNTPs. Incorporation of these nucleotides blocks digestion by  exonuclease III. This inhibition of digestion by exonuclease III is called spiking. Spiking can be accomplished by first truncating genes with exonuclease to create fragments with short single stranded overhangs. These fragments then serve as templates for amplification by DNA polymerase in the presence of small amounts of phosphothioate dNTPs. These resulting fragments are then ligated together to form full length genes. Alternatively the intact parental genes can be amplified by PCR in the presence of normal dNTPs and phosphothioate dNTPs. These full length amplification products are then subjected to digestion by an exonuclease. Digestion will continue until the exonuclease encounters an α-pdNTP, resulting in fragments of different length. These fragments are then ligated together to generate chimeric genes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====SCRATCHY====

This method generates libraries of hybrid genes inhibiting multiple crossovers by combining DNA shuffling and ITHCY. This method begins with the construction of two independent ITCHY libraries. The first with gene A on the N-terminus. And the other having gene B on the N-terminus. These hybrid gene fragments are separated using either restriction enzyme digestion or PCR with terminus primers via agarose gel electrophoresis. These isolated fragments are then mixed together and further digested using DNase1. Digested fragments are then reassembled by primerless PCR with template switching.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Recombined Extension on Truncated Templates (RETT)====

This method generates libraries of hybrid genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides in the presence of single stranded DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of single stranded DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the single stranded DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other single stranded DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length single stranded DNA is obtained.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence Homology-Independent Protein Recombination (SHIPREC)====

This method generates recombination between genes with little to no sequence homology. These chimeras are fused via a linker sequence containing several restriction sites. This construct is then digested using DNase1. Fragments are made are made blunt ended using S1 nuclease. These blunt end fragments are put together into a circular sequence by ligation. This circular construct is then linearized using restriction enzymes for which the restriction sites are present in the linker region. This results in a library of chimeric genes in which contribution of genes to 5' and 3' end will be reversed as compared to the starting construct.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Sequence Independent Site Directed Chimeragenesis (SISDC)====

This method results in a library of genes with multiple crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This is followed by the incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with cohesive ends. These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Degenerate Homo-Duplex Recombination (DHR)====

This method begins with alignment of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand of the gene is divided into small degenerate oligonucleotides. The bottom strand is also digested into oligonucleotides to serve as scaffolds. These fragments are combined in solution are top strand oligonucleotides are assembled onto bottom strand oligonucleotides. Gaps between these fragments are filled with polymerase and ligated.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Random Multi-Recombinant PCR (RM-PCR)====

This method involves the shuffling of plural DNA fragments without homology, in a single PCR. This results in the reconstruction of complete proteins by assembly of modules encoding different structural units.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====User Friendly DNA Recombination (USERec)====

This method begins with the amplification of gene fragments which need to be recombined, using uracil dNTPs. This amplification solution also contains primers, PfuTurbo, and Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase. Amplified products are next incubated with USER enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of uracil residues from DNA creating single base pair gaps. The USER enzyme treated fragments are mixed and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and subjected to Dpn1 digestion to remove the template DNA. These resulting dingle stranded fragments are subjected to amplification using PCR, and are transformed into E. coli.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Golden Gate Shuffling (GGS) Recombination====

This method allows you to recombine at least 9 different fragments in an acceptor vector by using type 2 restriction enzyme which cuts outside of the restriction sites. It begins with sub cloning of fragments in separate vectors to create Bsa1 flanking sequences on both sides. These vectors are then cleaved using type II restriction enzyme Bsa1, which generates four nucleotide single strand overhangs. Fragments with complementary overhangs are hybridized and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Finally these constructs are then transformed into E. coli cells, which are screened  for expression levels.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Phosphoro Thioate-Based DNA Recombination Method (PRTec)====

This method can be used to recombine structural elements or entire protein domains. This method is based on phosphorothioate chemistry which allows the specific cleavage of phosphorothiodiester bonds. The first step in the process begins with amplification of fragments that need to be recombined along with the vector backbone. This amplification is accomplished using primers with phosphorothiolated nucleotides at 5' ends. Amplified PCR products are cleaved in an ethanol-iodine solution at high temperatures. Next these fragments are hybridized at room temperature and transformed into E. coli which repair any nicks.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Integron====

This system is based upon a natural site specific recombination system in E. coli. This system is called the integron system, and produces natural gene shuffling. This method was used to construct and optimize a functional tryptophan biosynthetic operon in trp-deficient E. coli by delivering individual recombination cassettes or trpA-E genes along with regulatory elements with the integron system.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

====Y-Ligation Based Shuffling (YLBS)====

This method generates single stranded DNA strands, which encompass a single block sequence either at the 5' or 3' end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch  region serving as a primer binding site for PCR. Equivalent amounts of both 5' and 3' half strands are mixed and formed a hybrid due to the complementarity in the stem region. Hybrids with free phosphorylated 5' end in 3' half strands are then ligated with free 3' ends in 5' half strands using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 0.1 mM ATP. Ligated products are then amplified by two types of PCR to generate pre 5' half  and pre 3' half PCR products. These PCR product are converted to single strands via avidin-biotin binding to the 5' end of the primes containing stem sequences that were biotin labeled. Next, biotinylated  5' half strands and non-biotinylated 3' half strands are used as 5' and 3' half strands for the next Y-ligation cycle.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

== Semi-Rational Design ==
Semi-rational design uses information about a proteins sequence, structure and function, in tandem with predictive algorithms. Together these are used to identify target amino acid residues which are most likely to influence protein function. Mutations of these key amino acid residues create libraries of mutant proteins that are more likely to have enhanced properties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Stefan|date=2017-04-20|title=Beyond directed evolution - semi-rational protein engineering and design|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=734–743|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.08.011|issn=0958-1669|pmc=2982887|pmid=20869867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in semi-rational enzyme engineering and de novo enzyme design provide researchers with powerful and effective new strategies to manipulate biocatalysts. Integration of sequence and structure based approaches in library design has proven to be a great guide for enzyme redesign. Generally, current computational de novo and redesign methods do not compare to evolved variants in catalytic performance. Although experimental optimization may be produced using directed evolution, further improvements in the accuracy of structure predictions and greater catalytic ability will be achieved with improvements in design algorithms. Further functional enhancements may be included in future simulations by integrating protein dynamics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Biochemical and biophysical studies, along with fine-tuning of predictive frameworks will be useful to experimentally evaluate the functional significance of individual design features. Better understanding of these functional contributions will then give feedback for the improvement of future designs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Directed evolution will likely not be replaced as the method of choice for protein engineering, although computational protein design has fundamentally changed the way protein engineering can manipulate bio-macromolecules. Smaller, more focused and functionally-rich libraries may be generated by using in methods which incorporate predictive frameworks for hypothesis-driven protein engineering. New design strategies and technical advances have begun a departure from traditional protocols, such as directed evolution, which represents the most effective strategy for identifying top-performing candidates in focused libraries. Whole-gene library synthesis is replacing shuffling and mutagenesis protocols for library preparation. Also highly specific low throughput screening assays are increasingly applied in place of monumental screening and selection efforts of millions of candidates. Together, these developments are poised to take protein engineering beyond directed evolution and towards practical, more efficient strategies for tailoring biocatalysts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Screening and Selection Techniques ==
Once a protein has undergone directed evolution, ration design or semi-ration design, the libraries of mutant proteins must be screened to determine which mutants show enhanced properties. Phage display methods are one option for screening proteins. This method involves the fusion of genes encoding the variant polypeptides with phage coat protein genes. Protein variants expressed on phage surfaces are selected by binding with immobilized targets in vitro. Phages with selected protein variants are then amplified in bacteria, followed by the identification of positive clones by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. These selected phages are then subjected to DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell surface display systems can also be utilized to screen mutant polypeptide libraries. The library mutant genes are incorporated into expression vectors which are then transformed into appropriate host cells. These host cells are subjected to further high throughput screening methods to identify the cells with desired phenotypes.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}}

Cell free display systems have been developed to exploit ''in vitro'' protein translation or cell free translation. These methods include mRNA display, ribosome display, covalent and non covalent DNA display, and ''in vitro'' compartmentalization.&lt;ref name=PoluriBook/&gt;{{rp|53}}

===Enzyme engineering===
Enzyme engineering is the application of modifying an enzyme's structure (and, thus, its function) or modifying the catalytic activity of isolated [[enzyme]]s to produce new metabolites, to allow new (catalyzed) pathways for reactions to occur,&lt;ref&gt;['Designer Enzymes' at http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/101236.php] Accessed 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or to convert from some certain compounds into others ([[biotransformation]]). These products are useful as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fuel, food, or agricultural additives.

An ''enzyme reactor'' &lt;ref&gt;[Enzyme reactors at {{cite web |url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/reactors.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502110325/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/reactors.html |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}] Accessed 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a vessel containing a reactional medium that is used to perform a desired conversion by enzymatic means. Enzymes used in this process are free in the solution.

== Examples of engineered proteins ==
Computing methods have been used to design a protein with a novel fold, named [[Top7]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kuhlman|first=Brian|title=Design of a Novel Globular Protein Fold with Atomic-Level Accuracy|year=2003|last2=Dantas|last3=Ireton|last4=Varani|last5=Stoddard|last6=Baker|first2=Gautam|first3=Gregory C.|first4=Gabriele|first5=Barry L.|first6=David|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=302|issue=5649|pages=1364–1368|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1364K|doi=10.1126/science.1089427|pmid=14631033|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sensors for unnatural molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Looger|first=Loren L.|title=Computational design of receptor and sensor proteins with novel functions|year=2003|last2=Dwyer|last3=Smith|last4=Hellinga|first2=Mary A.|first3=James J.|first4=Homme W.|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=423|issue=6936|pages=185–190|bibcode=2003Natur.423..185L|doi=10.1038/nature01556|pmid=12736688|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering of [[fusion protein]]s has yielded [[rilonacept]], a pharmaceutical that has secured [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for treating [[cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome]].

Another computing method, IPRO, successfully engineered the switching of cofactor specificity of Candida boidinii xylose reductase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) redesigns proteins to increase or give specificity to native or novel [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]] and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]. This is done by repeatedly randomly perturbing the structure of the proteins around specified design positions, identifying the lowest energy combination of [[Conformational isomerism|rotamers]], and determining whether the new design has a lower binding energy than prior ones.&lt;ref&gt;The iterative nature of this process allows IPRO to make additive mutations to a protein sequence that collectively improve the specificity toward desired substrates and/or cofactors. Details on how to download the software, implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and experimental testing of predictions are outlined in this paper: {{Citation|title=Computational design of Candida boidinii xylose reductase for altered cofactor specificity|date=October 2009|last1=Khoury|last2=Fazelinia|last3=Chin|last4=Pantazes|last5=Cirino|last6=Maranas|first1=GA|first2=H|first3=JW|first4=RJ|first5=PC|first6=CD|journal=Protein Science|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2125–38|doi=10.1002/pro.227|pmc=2786976|pmid=19693930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computation-aided design has also been used to engineer complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly.&lt;ref name="Ardejani"&gt;{{Citation|title=Stabilization of a Protein Nanocage through the Plugging of a Protein–Protein Interfacial Water Pocket|date=April 2011|last1=Ardejani|last2=Li|last3=Orner|first1=MS|first2=NX|first3=BP|journal=Biochemistry|volume=50|issue=19|pages=4029–4037|doi=10.1021/bi200207w|pmid=21488690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its [[Protein homology|homologs]], it has been found that this protein has a smaller-than-average [[Protein dimer|dimeric interface]] on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial water pocket centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the [[wild type]] EcBfr.  This computational study also converges on the water-bridged [[asparagine]]s. Replacing these two asparagines with [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] amino acids results in proteins that fold into [[Alpha helix|alpha-helical]] monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability.  One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="Ardejani" /&gt;

'''Public transport planning''' or '''transit planning''' is the professional discipline responsible for developing [[public transport]] systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ceder|first1=Avishai|title=Public Transit Planning and Operation: Modeling, Practice and Behavior, 2nd ed|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6391-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; . It is a hybrid discipline involving aspects of [[transport engineering]] and traditional [[urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xie|first1=Feng|last2=Levinson|first2=David L.|title=Evolving Transportation Networks|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-44-19-9803-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many transit planners find themselves involved in discourse with urban-land-use issues such as [[transit-oriented development]].

Transit planners are responsible for developing routes and networks of routes for urban transit systems. These may follow one or more models depending on the character of the communities they serve. For example, in urban areas, a system may attract enough [[Patronage (transportation)|ridership]] to support high frequencies of service. At these high frequencies, services can operate at demand service levels where the specific frequency of service in each [[Transport corridor|corridor]] can be independent and where transfers can reasonably occur at random. In less densely developed areas service may operate somewhat infrequently. To optimize the quality of trips for customers, some systems compensate by operating a [[timed-transfer]] system. In this model, routes are designed to bring [[bus]]es (or [[train]]s or [[ferries]]) together at a central location at predetermined times. Customers then transfer between the vehicles which leave a few minutes later. In systems committed to this system, routes are designed to take travel time into account.

In addition to serving customers' transportation needs, transit planners often consider transportation projects' other impacts. Economic impacts, directly on providers and consumers, on local economies, and on the aggregate level in large economic spheres, often feature prominently in deciding between different projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatta|first1=Saurav Dev|last2=Drennan|first2=Matthew P.|title=The Economic Benefits of Public Investment in Transportation: A Review of Recent Literature|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|date=March 1, 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=288–296|doi=10.1177/0739456X02250317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, concerns about environmental quality have produced a growing interest in developing sustainable transportation and transit planning has evolved to reflect these new concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutton|first1=Barry|title=Planning Sustainable Transport|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84971-391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, impacts on social equity have been paid increasing attention by transit planners in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deakin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Sustainable Development and Sustainable Transportation: Strategies for Economic Prosperity, Environmental Quality, and Equity|journal=Institute of Urban &amp; Regional Development|date=May 1, 2001|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m1047xc|accessdate=2017-02-19&lt;!-- 13:46:01--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Proteins perform several functions in [[life|living]] [[organism]]s, including [[Catalysis|catalytic]] reactions and transport of [[molecule]]s or [[ion]]s within the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, the [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] or the whole [[Human body|body]]. The understanding of the [[biological process|processes]] in human organisms, which are mainly driven by [[Chemical reaction|biochemical reactions]] and [[protein-protein interaction]]s, depends to a great extent on our ability to isolate active proteins in biological samples for more detailed examination of chemical [[structure]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] function. This essential [[information]] can imply an important indication of a [[patient]]'s state of [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As about 30-40% of all known proteins contain one or more [[metallome|metal ion cofactors]] (e.g., [[ceruloplasmin]], [[ferritin]], [[amyloid precursor protein]], [[matrix metalloproteinase]]), especially native metalloproteins have to be isolated, identified and quantified after [[liquid biopsy]]. Many of these cofactors  (e.g., [[iron]], [[copper]], or [[zinc]]) play a key role in vital [[enzyme|enzymatic]] catalytic processes or stabilize [[globular protein]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Electrphoresis Tools.TIF|thumb|255px|''Equipment'' for analytical electrophoresis: electrophoresis chamber, peristaltic pump, fraction collector, buffer recirculation pump and UV detector (in a refrigerator), power supply and recorder (on a table)]] In gel electrophoresis proteins are normally separated by [[Electric charge|charge]], [[Molecular mass|size]], or [[Protein structure|shape]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-polymerization of acrylamide (AA) monomer/[[N,N'-Methylenebisacrylamide]] (Bis-AA) cross-linker initiated by [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS)/[[tetramethylethylenediamine]] (TEMED) reactions, is most efficient at alkaline pH. Thereby, acrylamide chains are created and cross-linked at a time. Due to the properties of the electrophoresis buffer the gel polymerization is conducted at pH 10.00 making sure an efficient use of TEMED and APS as [[catalyst]]s of the polymerization reaction, and concurrently, suppressing a competitive [[hydrolysis]] of the produced acrylamide [[polymer]] network (cf. section ''Principle'').

Additionally, the time of polymerization of a gel may directly affect the peak-elution times of separated metalloproteins in the [[Electrophoretogram|electropherogram]] due to the compression and dilatation of the gels and their pores with the longer incubation times (see figure ''Electropherogram'', cf. subsection ''Reproducibility and recovery''). In order to ensure maximum reproducibility in gel pore size and to obtain a fully polymerized and non-restrictive large pore gel for a PAGE run, the [[polyacrylamide gel]] is polymerized for a time period of 69 hr at [[room temperature]] (RT). The [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic]] heat generated by the polymerization processes is [[Dissipation|dissipated]] constantly while the temperature may rise rapidly to over 75&amp;nbsp;°C in the first minutes, after which it falls slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A shifting peak in the respective electropherogram may indicate that the standardized time of gel polymerization (69 hr, RT) is not implemented in a PAGE [[experiment]]. A lower deviation of the standardized polymerization time (&lt; 69 hr) stands for incomplete polymerization, and thus, for inherent instability due to gel softening during the cross-linking of polymers as the material reaches swelling equilibrium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the relationship between the polymerization time, gel stability (incomplete polymerization, hydrolysis), pH and analytical results had to be investigated addressing the absolute quantification of specific protein molecules:

In 2001 a new basic principle of gel electrophoresis was discovered at the [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]], applied for [[patent]] in 2003 and subsequently issued in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Kastenholz B (2014) [2003]. [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;II=1&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=20050217&amp;CC=WO&amp;NR=2005014147A2&amp;KC=A2 "Method for isolating metal cofactors out from biologically-organic systems involving the use of preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PNC-PAGE)"]. Patent WO2005014147 (A2).&lt;/ref&gt; This invention provided the first conclusive evidence that the time of polymerization of a polyacrylamide gel directly affects the result of [[protein purification]] because the separation properties implying the mechanical and [[chemical stability]] of a gel and its pores are determined by this parameter. As a consequence, the peak-elution times of the separated metalloproteins in the electropherogram may vary considerably (see figure ''Electropherogram''). On the other hand, the results of [[protein electrophoresis]] can be optimized in terms of reliability by strict adherence to a standardized time of polymerization (69 hr). This optimization process of selected electrophoretic parameters paved the way to "quantitative native PAGE" implying high reproducibility in gel pore size and high-yield electroelution of proteins in biological samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the quality, quantity and mixing ratio of TEMED, APS and AA/Bis-AA as well as the ambient temperature are the most important factors to initiate and impel the polymerization reaction of PAGE gels, it is evident that the time of polymerization is the limiting factor in these [[Physical chemistry|physico-chemical]] processes to form an inherently stable network of polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These results are in excellent agreement with that the aging of fresh polyacrylamide gels begins after 69 hr cross-linking and gelation time bringing a shift of the peak-elution times of proteins due to gel swelling induced by hydrolysis of carboxamide groups into carboxylate anions (see figures ''Electropherogram'' and ''Hydrolysis''). Thus, the polymerization time of 69 hr is a pH-independent stability constant in the pH range of about 4 (acrylamide/[[aqueous solution]]) to 10 (acrylamide/buffer solution) for acrylamide gels with total monomer concentrations in the range of 4 to 20% T.

&lt;/ref&gt; Adding salts to complex protein mixtures, however, may induce a shift of isoelectric points, and thus, affect protein structure (shape) and activity. In this context, one study found that [[kosmotropic]] salts (e.g., [[ammonium sulfate]]) that were used for the [[Protein precipitation|precipitation]] of native proteins in solution, subsequently, may result in denatured high molecular weight metalloproteins in the same solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Hawthorne, NY: Aldine de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988, defines communication patterns between relationship partners as the result of endemic ''[[dialectic]]al tensions''.

When making decisions, desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are brought up and lead to dialectical tensions.&lt;ref name="Cheney"&gt;Cheney, G., Christensen, L. T., Zorn, T. E. and Ganesh, S. (2011) Organizational Communication in an Age of Globalization. (Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press), pp 147–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie A. Baxter and  Barbara M. Montgomery exemplify these contradictory statements that arise from individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs such as "opposites attract", but "birds of a feather flock together"; as well as, "two's company; three's a crowd" but "the more the merrier".&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;Baxter, L. A., &amp; Montgomery, B. M. (1996). Relating: Dialogues and dialectics. New York:Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean these opposing tensions are fundamentally troublesome for the relationship; on the contrary, they simply bring forward a discussion of the connection between two parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nasser|first1=Khaled|last2=Dabbous|first2=Yasmine|last3=Baba|first3=Dima|title=From Strangers To Spouses: Early Relational Dialectics in Arranged Marriages Among Muslim Families in Lebanon|journal=Journal Of Comparative Family Studies|date=2013|issue=serial online|pages=387–406|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ssf&amp;AN=88381514&amp;site=ehost-live.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relational dialectic is an elaboration on [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s idea that life is an open monologue and  humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A. (2204). A tale of two voices: relational dialectics theory. ''The Journal of Family Communication'', 4(3&amp;4), 182–192.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baxter includes a list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that  relationships are constantly changing, and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention. Although Baxter's description of relational dialectics is thorough, it by no means is exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways.

==History==
Relational dialectics is the emotional and value-based version of the philosophical [[dialectic]].  It is rooted in the dynamism of the [[yin and yang]].  Like the classic yin and yang, the balance of emotional values in a relationship is always in motion, and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite.&lt;ref name="Bax6"&gt;Baxter, L. A. &amp; Montgomery, B. M. (1996) ''Relating: Dialogues and dialectics'' Guilford Press, New York, {{ISBN|1-57230-099-X}} ;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western world]], these ideas hark back to the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]], who held that the world was in constant flux (like fire), with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process. [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], a Russian scholar most known for his work in [[Dialogic|dialogism]], applied [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[dialectic]] to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism.  He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Emory A. (2003) A First Look at Communication Theory McGraw Hill, Boston, {{ISBN|0-07-248392-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference. Bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces ''centripetal'' (emotional forces tending towards unity) and ''centrifugal'' (emotional forces tending towards divergence). Like the Yin and Yang, Bakhtin's forces have no ultimate resolution.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

Baxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory.  She found a T-Bangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated.&lt;ref name="Bax6"/&gt;  Later authors have added other axes.&lt;ref name="Sahl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sahlstein | first1 = Erin M. | year = 2006 | title = Making plans: Praxis strategies for negotiating uncertainty-certainty in long-distance relationships | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 70 | issue = 2| pages = 147–165 | doi=10.1080/10570310600710042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to Relational Dialectics==
The ''monologic'' approach frames contradictions as either/or, the ''dualistic'' approach frames contradictions as two separate entities, and the ''dialectic'' approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction (both/and).&lt;ref name="West" /&gt;

==Core concepts and assumptions==
There are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics, as well as four major assumptions. Relational dialectics assumes that "(1.) relationships are not linear, (2.) relational life is characterized by change, (3.) contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life, and (4.) communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions".&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West, Richard, and Lynn Turner (2010) ''Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education {{ISBN|0073385077}}  ;&lt;/ref&gt;

The four core concepts of relational dialectics include: contradiction, totality, process, and praxis.

'''Contradictions''' are the core concept of relational dialectics. It is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions. A contradiction is formed "whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent (unity) yet mutually negate one another (negation)".&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Katherine (2002) ''Communication theories: perspectives, processes, and contexts'' McGraw Hill, Boston, {{ISBN|0-7674-0500-5}} ;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance.

'''Totality''' suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation. In other words, the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other. For example, the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy — both work to condition and define the other.

'''Process '''Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social '''processes'''. Movement, activity, and change are functional properties (Rawlins,1989). For example, instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness. In addition, the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication (Miller, 2002, 2005).

'''Praxis''' is a philosophical term for the concept of 'practical behavior' or sometimes 'the experience of practicing'.  In praxis the dialectic tensions are created and re-created through the active participation and interaction.  In other words, the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and value of another.  As the relationship endures one's own needs and values become apparent.  Praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values (dialectical tensions). In turn, the choices and actions themselves create, re-create, and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves.

Research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships, such as in the marriage, in the workplace, etc. Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics, or rather, the idea that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture. From there we also see the raise of public and private/real and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what we see on television in public life, versus what experience within our private lives. Examples of this include politicians as well as TV shows. According to West and Turner, "the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver:  We receive an idealized message of what family life is like, and then when we look at the families we live in, we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life. The tension between these two images forms this dialectic".&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard, and Lynn Turner (2010) Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education {{ISBN|0073385077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialectics==
According to the original relational dialectic [[Conceptual model|model]], there were many core tensions (opposing values) in any relationship.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt; These are autonomy and connectedness, favoritism and impartiality, openness and closedness, novelty and predictability, instrumentality and affection, and finally, equality and inequality.

Autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as a unique individual. An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete, who wants to feel like they are part of a team but also wanting to highlight their individual talents. Favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as "special". For instance, a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades, demonstrating favoritism. Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private. When chatting with a boss about one's weekend, there is the desire to be open, however, closedness is also at play, as certain details are often left out, because of the context. Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new. When creating scheduled meetings for board members, the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule, however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration. Instrumentality and affection, is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship. An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection, but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security. Finally, equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority. A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues, but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

According to the theory, while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness, certainty, and openness in our relationships, the communication is not a straight path towards these goals. Conflicts often produce the exact opposites.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

The table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways. The column that displays examples of Internal Dialect shows "ongoing tensions played out within a relationship".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; The column that displays examples of External Dialect shows "ongoing tensions between a couple and their community".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

'''Integration–separation''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes connection–autonomy, inclusion–seclusion, and intimacy–independence."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others.

'''Stability–change''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes certainty–uncertainty, conventionally–uniqueness, predictability–surprise, and routine–novelty."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Things must be consistent but not mundane. There must be a balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship.

'''Expression–nonexpression''' is "a class of relational dialectics that includes openness–closedness, revelation–concealment, candor–secrecy, and transparency–privacy".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; In a relationship, it is important to keep some things between the two parties, while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about.

==Dialectics in relationships==
According to Michaela Meyer, "relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions. As a result, relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = M. E. | year = 2003 | title = "It's me. I'm it.": Defining Adolescent Sexual Identity through Relational Dialectics in Dawson's Creek | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 262–276 | doi=10.1080/01463370309370156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Leslie A.|title=Dialectical Theory|journal=International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family|date=2003|volume=2nd Edition|url=http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galemarriage/dialectical_theory/0?institutionId=6086}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Joseph P.|last2=Chango|first2=Joanna|last3=Szwedo|first3=David|title=The Adolescent Relational Dialectic and the Peer Roots of Adult Social Functioning|journal=Child Development|date=2014|volume=85|issue=1|pages=192–204|doi=10.1111/cdev.12106|pmc=4030385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studies of romantic relationships, long distance relationships, friendships, and family relationships, researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships.&lt;ref name="Sahl"/&gt;

According to Marsha Linehan, founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy, some people have great difficulty resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships.  Many people with personality disorders, potentially caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing, especially Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and some others, perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict, with resulting instability causing problems in living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities. In DBT's biosocial theory, some people "have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation, and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Little, Hannah; Tickle, Anna; das Nair, Roshan (16 October 2017).

===Romantic relationships===

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erbert | first1 = L. A. | year = 2000 | title = Conflict and dialectics: Perceptions of dialectic contradictions in marital conflict | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 17 | issue = 4–5| pages = 638–659 | doi=10.1177/0265407500174009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 25 [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses. Larry Erbert found that the Openness v. Closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants. Research conducted by Baxter and Montgomery confirmed this finding, and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships.

*'''''Openness with''''':  Refers to an individual's self-disclosure of information to another.  In this idea, three types of information are shared: information deemed to be personal, the individuals feelings or personal opinions, and information regarding one individual's relationship with the other.
*'''''Openness To''''': Often this form of openness is labeled as being attentive or responsive. People respond in cognitive, affective, and behavioral ways.
*'''''Closedness with''''': Describes the type of nondisclosive talk that occurs between individuals. It is most often identified as "small talk", being primarily superficial. The talk is oriented around conversation that requires little or no self-disclosure, allowing for a controlled level informational privacy.
*'''''Closedness to''''': Some people experience stress and discomfort when listening to others' problems. In response to this, some individuals attempt to distance themselves in order to discourage others from confiding in them.&lt;ref name="Bax6"/&gt;

Research has been conducted to examine the autonomy-connection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships. In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Dun's study they found that, "participants' joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction. Both antagonistic and non-antagonistic struggles were evident in these data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sahlstein | first1 = E. | last2 = Dun | first2 = T. | year = 2008 | title = "I Wanted Time to Myself and He Wanted to be Together All the Time": Constructing Breakups as Managing Autonomy-Connection | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Reports In Communication | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 37–45 | doi = 10.1080/17459430802400340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the study discovered that while normally break-ups are retroactively studied, the autonomy-connection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy.

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suter|first1=Elizabeth A.|last2=Daas|first2=Karen L.|title=Negotiating Heteronormativity Dialectally: lesbian couples' display of symbols in future|journal=Western Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=71|issue=3|page= 177|url=http://link.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/apps/doc/A169715265/PROF?u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;sid=PROF&amp;xid=fd2c5572|doi=10.1080/10570310701518443}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples, revealed that while same-sex couples experience similar challenges that opposite-sex partners do, there are unique challenges that arise to these same-sex couples. These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship.

==== Re-marriage ====

In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilder | first1 = S. E. | year = 2012 | title = A Dialectical Examination of Remarriage Dyadic Communication and Communication with Social Networks | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Reports In Communication | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 63–70 | doi = 10.1080/17459435.2012.722163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on dialectics in second marriages, six tensions unique to remarriages emerged.

Three tensions related to the remarried dyad:

*'''''Old-new''''' - Many participants found that within their new marriage, the individuals brought with them ideas and expectations based on their previous, or "old," marriages. However, participants recognized that they had since entered a "new" marriage, which would not necessarily carry over the previous old expectations or experiences.
*'''''Emotional closeness-distance''''' - Participants expressed feelings of both emotional closeness and emotional distance with their new partners. While participants found that they experienced emotional closeness with their second spouse, they also found that either they or their new spouse had other close friends or family with whom they were close to.
*'''''Past-present''''' - Many participants found that they do not discuss prior relationships, or other things that relate to the past, with their new partners. Yet, the new couples remained open about issues and topics related to their present life.

Three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks:

*'''''Their time frame-our time frame''''' - Many participants expressed feeling tensions between adhering to a time frame that felt right to the individual, while acknowledging the expectations that they sensed from their friends and family members in regards to what an appropriate relationship and re-marriage time frame would be.
*'''''Dyadic revelation-network revelation''''' - Participants found that they desired to share information with their social network, however, sometimes their partner did not desire them to share such information with that particular network, resulting in tensions among participants to decide between revealing to their partner and revealing information to their social network.
*'''''Old-new''''' - Participants identified the tension that was created through interactions with friends and family from the "old" marriage while being in the "new" [[marriage]]. Participants managed this tension primarily through recalibration and reaffirmation, where participants recognized that both sides had to be present in order for the relationship to exist.

===Long distance relationships===

Based on research by Sahlstein,&lt;ref name="Sahl"/&gt; the uncertainty v. certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in long-distance relationships. Her work exposed uncertainty v. certainty as a competing yet complementary need. In interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships, contradictions emerged. For example, couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity. Within this, three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged:

*'''''Segmentation''''' - referred to the partners' ability to live separate, independent lives when they were not together.
*'''''Balance''''' - referred to the couple's ability to plan conversations about the future of the relationship.
*'''''Denial''''' - referring to the couple's refusal to admit the effect distance is having on the relationship.

===Friendships===

William Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to [[friendship]]s.  The tension of instrumentality v. affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; Within friendships, importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for "real" friendships opposed to instrumentality for "fake" friendships. [[Aristotle]]'s "friendship of virtue" notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point. The dichotomy of instrumentality v. affection cannot be ignored within friendships, as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends. This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships. While this remains true, the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v. affection is applied.

'''In the workplace'''

'''''Blended Relationships''''' are close friends that are a part of the same work environment. Dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations. It is not necessary, however, to have a friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions. Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Brad W.|last2=Jensen|first2=Katherine C.|last3=Hideko|first3=Sera|last4=Cimbora|first4=David M.|title=Ethics and Relational Dialectics in Mentoring Relationships|journal=Training and Education in Professional Psychology|date=2017|issue=Advance online publication|doi=10.1037/tep0000166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Impartiality vs. Favoritism''''':  Friends within organizations desire to provide each other with special support and assistance but organizations strive for equitable treatment and discourage bias.
*'''''Openness vs. Closedness''''':  It is a tendency of close friends to be open and honest with one another, but organizations often expect a level of confidentiality that places strain on friendships that value the sharing of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Bridge | first2 = K. | year = 1992 | title = Blended relationships: friends as work associates | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 200–225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Novelty and Predictability''''': Feeling excited about a restructuring of your organization but anxious since it may interrupt your routine and put stress on your current relationships.
*'''''Instrumentality and Affection''''':  Inviting a coworker to lunch with the intention of asking for support on a project at work.&lt;ref name="Cheney"/&gt;

=== Family relationships ===

''' Sibling relationships '''

Relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conger|first=K.J.|last2=Little|first2=W.M.|year=2010|title=Sibling relationships during the transition to adulthood|url=|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=4|issue=2|pages=87–94|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2010.00123.x|via=|pmc=2917987}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one sibling begins a new phase of life, this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in his/her new lifestyle, along with a new geographic separation, both of which result in a change in communication. As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond his/her home, the pre-existing sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halliwell | first1 = D | year = 2016 | title = "I Know You, But I Don't Know Who You Are": Siblings' Discursive Struggles Surrounding Experiences of Transition | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 327–347 | doi = 10.1080/10570314.2015.1091493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition, all participants acknowledged that moving away from their sibling(s) resulted in a [[Discourse|discursive]] struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship. Two specific discursive struggles were identified:
*'''''Old relationship-new relationship''''' - For many siblings, family rituals were not continued upon moving out, resulting in a change in relationship and a feeling of missing out, emphasizing the changes that occur during the transition from an old relationship into new ones.
*'''''Certainty-uncertainty''''' - Participants found that the change from seeing a sibling regularly to not seeing him/her often resulted in feelings of uncertainty, resulting in an identity shift&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective|last=Baxter|first=Leslie A.|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the relationship and supporting the discursive struggle of certainty-uncertainty.

While participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions, 8 of the 19 participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brother(s) and/or sister(s).

''' Children and stepparents '''

In a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = D. O. | last3 = Bryant | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Stepchildren's perceptions of the contradictions in communication with stepparents | url = | journal = Journal of Social &amp; Personal Relationships | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 447–467 | doi=10.1177/0265407504044841}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchild-[[Stepfamily|stepparent]] relationship, three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants:
*'''''Dialectics of emotional distance-closeness''''' - While many stepchildren expressed feelings of emotional distance, the participants had varying reasons for keeping the distance. Some participants who still had a positive relationship with their nonresidential parent kept an emotional distance from their stepparent as an act of loyalty that they felt toward their nonresidential parent. Other participants equated emotional distance to the fact that they had little in common with their stepparent. However, many participants expressed feeling some closeness with a stepparent while maintaining an amount of emotional distance. Participants reported that they upheld a relationship with the stepparent that contained honesty, respect, and trust, yet they kept an emotional distance by continuing to address the stepparent by his/her first name, or simply claiming that each individual was very different from the other, causing tension in an effort to promote emotional closeness.
*'''''Stepparent status''''' - Many of the stepchildren in the study also experienced a dialectical tension between desiring for the family authority position to be designated to their one residential parent along with a desire for both the residential parent and the stepparent to share parenting authority. Many participants felt that legitimating their stepparent as a parent would result in the formation of closeness.
*'''''Expression''''' - The participants expressed a desire for open communication with their stepparent, while at the same time, expressing resistance to openness and instead favoring a more careful form of communication due to the fact that the participants often sensed a lack of familiarity with their stepparent.

In another study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braithwaite | first1 = D. O. | last2 = Toller | first2 = P. W. | last3 = Daas | first3 = K. L. | last4 = Durham | first4 = W. T. | last5 = Jones | first5 = A. C. | year = 2008 | title = Centered but not Caught in the Middle: Stepchildren's Perceptions of Dialectical Contradictions in the Communication of Co-Parents | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 33–55 | doi = 10.1080/00909880701799337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents. The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while, at the same time, they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents. The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy-connection dialectic; stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents. However, these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication, particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another. While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening, at the same time, they also wanted to be protected, resulting in a second dialectic of control-restraint. Through this study, the researchers believe that openness-closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships.

One study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braithwaite | first1 = D. | last2 = Baxter | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = "You're My Parent but You're Not": Dialectical Tensions in Stepchildren's Perceptions About Communicating with the Nonresidential Parent | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 30–48 | doi = 10.1080/00909880500420200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on the relationship and communication between college-aged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents, found two underlying contradictions: parenting and not parenting, and openness and closeness. Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were. Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents, they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parent's lack of familiarity with the child's everyday life.

== Theory applications ==

=== End of life care ===
Relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care, specifically [[end-of-life care]], providing a system for [[caregiver]] communication that contains tensions and challenges. The quality of the end-of-life journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oetzel|first=John|last2=Simpson|first2=Mary|date=April 2015|title=Managing Communication Tensions and Challenges During the End-of-Life Journey: Perspectives of Māori Kaumātua and Their Whānau.|journal=Health Communication|volume=30|issue=4|pages=350–360|doi=10.1080/10410236.2013.861306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patients/family members during the process of end-of-life care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amati | first1 = R | last2 = Hannawa | first2 = A | year = 2014 | title = Relational Dialectics Theory: Disentangling Physician-Perceived Tensions of End-of-Life Communication | url = | journal = Health Communication | volume = 29 | issue = 10| pages = 962–973 | doi=10.1080/10410236.2013.815533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When making choices about end-of-life medical care, family members, friends, or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=U.K.|last2=Beyth|first2=R.J.|year=2008|title=Voices of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic surrogates on the burdens of end-of-life decision making|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=23|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0487-7|pages=267–274|pmc=2359470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-makers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decision-making.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toller|first=Paige|year=2009|title=Grieving Together and Apart: Bereaved Parents' Contradictions of Marital Interaction|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family members in charge of making end-of-life decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go; recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep a loved one alive.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ohs | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Trees | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Gibson | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Holding On and Letting Go: Making Sense of End-of-Life Care Decisions in Families | url = | journal = Southern Communication Journal | volume = 80 | issue = 5| pages = 353–364 | doi = 10.1080/1041794X.2015.1081979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the end-of-life journey, it was found that despite the culture's focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony, four communication tensions existed between caregivers (family and friends) and patients: autonomy and connection, conflict and connection, isolation and connection, and balancing the needs of self and other.

==== Grief ====
The human [[Grief|grieving]] process is marked by relational dialectics. After the death of a child, bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their child's permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness, where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family, yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One study,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses, found two discursive contradictions: family members' wishes vs. patient's wishes, and emotionality vs. [[rationality]]. Through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one, researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members, patients, and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go. Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of a loved one, and with that, experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality.

Dialectical [[contradiction]]s have also been found among parents who have lost a child. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toller | first1 = P. W. | year = 2005 | title = Negotiation of Dialectical Contradictions by Parents who have Experienced the Death of a Child | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 46–66 | doi = 10.1080/0090988042000318512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child: openness-closeness, and presence-absence. Parents experienced openness-closeness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss, yet they perceived the outcome as risky, especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on. Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation. When dealing with the presence-absence dialectic, bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child, and the physical absence of the child. Participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child, the physical absence of the child was deeply felt. However, when people chose to remember the deceased child, the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child.

'''&lt;big&gt;Understanding Autistic Communication&lt;/big&gt;'''

As relational dialects’ aim is to analyse competence during interaction, it can suggest an approach to researching on communication competence among people which are with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]]. Applying relational dialects theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction. This approach&lt;ref&gt;Best, S. A. (2012). ''Using relational dialectics theory to better understand autistic communication competence.'' &lt;/ref&gt; can delve into how social contexts, expectations, and roles contribute to the autistics’ competent communication. The investigation of dialects includes integration-separation, expression-privacy, and stability-change enhance the understanding of the communication between people with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].

==Dialogue==

[[Dialogue]] is typically a conversation between two or more people. These conversations are what constitute relationships, as communication is the very foundation of any relationship. According to Cools, "the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1) the self and the other situated in contradictory forces, 2) unfinalizability, 3) the chronotope and the carnivalesque, and 4) heteroglossia and utterance".&lt;ref&gt;Cools, C. (2011). Relational dialectics in intercultural couples' relationships. Kult tuurienvälisten parisuhteiden relationaalinen dialektiikka&lt;/ref&gt; Similarity, in dialogue the following components are the most important: constitutive dialogue, utterance chains, dialectical flux, aesthetic moment, and critical sensibility.

''''Constitutive dialogue''''

While some theorists, along with Baxter, may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship, examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a relationship instead. According to Baxter, "a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines, or constructs, the social world, including our selves and our personal relationships. From a constitutive perspective, then, persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication; instead, communication constitutes these phenomena"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | year = 2004 | title = Relationships as dialogues | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6811.2004.00068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; When initial researchers studied relationships, they found that similarities, backgrounds, and interests are usually what hold people together while self-disclosure is the root of these components. Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

''''Utterance chains''''

To understand utterance chains, we must know that an [[utterance]] is what a person says in one turn of a conversation. When utterances are "linked to competing discourses", they are considered utterance chains. Baxter believes that there are "four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard."&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; These are: cultural ideologies, relational history, non-yet spoken response of partner or utterance, and normative evaluation of third party to utterance. Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance, we must also understand the discourse. She posits "in the broadest sense, a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a group's members and which makes our talk sensical. for example in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as, 'I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person'".&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A., &amp; Braithwaite, D. O. (2008). Relational dialectics theory. Engaging theories in interpersonal communication, 349-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Dialectical flux''''

A dialectical flux is "the unpredictable, unfinalizable, indeterminate nature of personal relationships".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions. Spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity. Spiraling inversion is generally a no-win situation; a struggle between two different thought processes. For example, if you were to do something your parents did not approve of, you could lie about it, but your parents might yell at you for lying. And on the other hand, you could tell them upfront, and they could be completely quiet in shock. Segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation. For example, if you were working at your father's shop as a part-time job, he would be considered your father AND your boss. This could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles.

''''Aesthetic moment''''

Aesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue. There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue. It is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships, such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows, but these moments can be experienced by anyone.

''''Critical sensibility''''

According to Griffin, critical sensibility is "an obligation to critique dominant voices, especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints; a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; This means that both sides of a dialogue are equal to one another. No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other, and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering. This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in Utterance Chains.

==Ethics==

When communicating, we must understand that morals do not apply for all people. Sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication, but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to. There are several times where most people would justify a "white lie", or a lie that causes no harm. For instance, if your mother was in the hospital, you could tell her she still looked beautiful, even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better. Other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called "consequential ethics".&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; According to Sissela Bok, "lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations". Bok believes in the "principle of veracity" which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;

== Critiques ==
According to theorist Leslie Baxter, there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baxter | first1 = L. A. | year = 2004 | title = A Tale of Two Voices: Relational Dialectics Theory | url = | journal = Journal of Family Communication | volume = 4 | issue = 3/4| pages = 181–192 | doi = 10.1207/s15327698jfc0403&amp;4_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter claims that her work has been "too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties", and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties. Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between "two voices". Lastly, Baxter has stated that future research should focus on discourse through time, such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over a longer period of time.

The '''Rod and ring symbol''' is a symbol that is depicted on Mesopotamian [[stela]]s, [[cylinder seal]]s and [[relief]]s. It is held by a god or goddess and in most cases is being offered to a king who is standing, often making a sacrifice, or otherwise showing respect. The symbol dates from the [[Sumerian Renaissance]] to the [[Neo-Assyrian Period]], and is commonly explained as a [[wiktionary:coil|coil]] of [[measuring string]] and a [[yardstick]].&lt;ref name="TJ"&gt;Jacobsen, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories are that they are a [[shepherd's crook]] and a [[nose rope]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallo, W.W. 2005. Sumerian history in pictures: a new look at the ‘Stele of the Flying Angels’, in: Y. Sefati et al (eds), ‘An Experienced Scribe who Neglects Nothing’: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Honor of Jacob Klein. Bethesda, MD: CDL Press, 142-62.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the ring is no rope at all.&lt;ref&gt;Van Buren, E.D. 1949. The rod and ring. ArO 17 (2), 434-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the symbol is seen on the [[Code of Hammurabi]] stela. The most elaborate depiction is found on the  [[Ur-Nammu]]-stela, where the winding of the cords has been detailed by the sculptor. This has also been described as a "staff and a chaplet of beads".&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, Anthony Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia'', Rod and Ring, p 156.&lt;/ref&gt; There is discussion whether the Ur-Nammu-stela is showing the same thing.

==Scepter, throne, and ring: Enuma Elish==
The myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent to the nether world describes how the goddess dresses and prepares herself: "She held the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand."&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.4.1 Inana's descent to the nether world] line 25. The Sumerian has: gi-diš-'''nindan''' '''eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' za-gin&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; šu ba-ni-in-du&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; i.e. taken literally the rod would have the length of one ''nindan'' (6 cubit = 5.94m) and the eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  the surveyor's line - would be ten ''nindan'' in length.&lt;/ref&gt;

In tablet IV of the [[Enuma Elish]], the rod and ring symbol is referenced as:
:"They rejoiced, and they did homage unto him, saying, "[[Marduk]] is King!"&lt;br&gt;They bestowed upon him the scepter, and the throne, and the ring.&lt;br&gt;They gave him an invincible weaponry which overwhelmeth the foe."&lt;ref&gt;Enuma Elish, tablet IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols that appear similar==
*The Egyptian [[Shen ring]] has an identical resemblance.
*The Greek goddess [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]] uses a different type of [[investiture]] symbol for the victor in the sporting races, a ''wreath of laurel'', or a wreath of olive branches, but she is depicted with a ring, a rigid circle.
*The [[Faravahar]], the symbol of [[Zoroastrianism]], also holds a ring.
*The Egyptian [[Ankh]] has a vaguely similar form but is used in very different contexts.
*At the 6th century B.C.E. archaeological site of [[Cancho Roano]], located near [[Zalamea de la Serena]], Badajoz, Spain, a large feature in the shape of the rod and ring symbol was modeled into the floor of the innermost chamber of a [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] temple.
*This symbol also bears a resemblance to an ancient rune called a [[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]] or thorn, which means "frost giant" or "giant".

The [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] defines it as an "International Higher Institute for the Carillon Arts under the High Protection of Her Majesty [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium|Queen Fabiola]]." The school has trained many of the foremost carillonneurs of the twentieth century and houses a rich archive and library.

==History==

The '''Royal Carillon School''' was founded in 1922 by renowned city carillonneur of Mechelen [[Jef Denyn]], in whose honor it was later named, with the support of Americans [[Herbert Hoover]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], and William Gorham Rice.  The first institution of its kind, the school soon gained international acclaim and has trained carillonneurs from numerous countries, including Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ghana, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The institution has developed under the successive leadership of Jef Denyn (1862-1941), Staf Nees (1901-1965), Piet Van den Broek, Jo Haazen (1944-), and its present director Koen Cosaert (1963-). The school has made a significant impact on carillon performance worldwide and is the originating place of the Flemish romantic style of carillon composition and performance.

In 1984, the Royal Carillon School established a branch at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]], and Her Majesty Queen Fabiola conferred her high protection upon the school. Later that year, the school introduced the carillon tradition to Japan. In 1986, the school was elected to membership in the Russian Cultural Committee, and the first Russian students arrived in 1992.  Another branch opened in [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] in 1991, and additional branches now exist in [[Roeselare]], [[Ronse]], and [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]].

The Queen Fabiola International Carillon Competition was established by the school in 1987. Every five years, carillonneurs from the world over converge in Mechelen to compete in the most prestigious carillon competition in history.  The school also organizes carillon composition contests and publishes works for carillon, campanological literature, and carillon methods.

Prominent visitors to the school include cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], the [[Vienna Boys' Choir]], former Hungarian president [[Árpád Göncz]], Russia's first lady [[Lyudmila Putina]], Defense Minister of the Russian Federation [[Sergei Ivanov]], [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and [[Queen Anne of Romania]], American Ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium [[Tom C. Korologos]], and Her Majesty [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium]].

''Malinovi Zvon'' (lit. "bells of Mechelen") is the Russian term for carillon, illustrating the central role of the Royal Carillon School in the dissemination of Belgian culture and the carillon art worldwide.  Since 1995, the [[Flemish Parliament|Flemish government]] has repeatedly conferred the honor upon the school of being Cultural Ambassador of Flanders.

==Facilities==

[[Image:carillon museum2.jpg|thumb|Historic [[carillon]] keyboards in the Museum of the Royal Carillon School]]For many years the Royal Carillon School was housed in the historic building '''t Schipke'', adjoining the Court of Busleyden, which contained the school's carillon and museum. Due to ongoing construction in the Court of Busleyden, 't Schipke was temporarily closed in autumn 2011, so the school and many of the museum holdings are currently (late 2013) located on the Bruul, Mechelen's main shopping street. (The carillon and two rooms at the Court of Busleyden remain available to the school during construction.) In addition to the carillon and museum, school facilities include six practice keyboards, pianos, a set of English handbells, a library of sheet music, and an important historical archive. Rehearsal and lesson time on the Mechelen city carillon in [[St. Rumbold's Cathedral|St. Rumbold's Tower]] is also available to advanced students. The museum and library holdings include an international collection of bells, historic carillon keyboards, rare books, manuscripts, and art objects.

==Academics==

The Royal Carillon School "Jef Denyn" is a state-subsidized educational institute, and its several courses of study fall under the aegis of "part-time arts education" (Dutch: ''deeltijds kunstonderwijs'') in Flanders and Mechelen. It also organizes occasional lectures, symposia, and masterclasses. The full curriculum covers nine or ten years depending on age at entry, but carillonneurs with prior training may graduate as quickly as within one year. Carillon performance, carillon history and campanology, improvisation, theory, harmony, composition, arranging, part-singing, and keyboard instruction comprise the curriculum. Student activities such as carillon trips in Belgium and the Netherlands and to international carillon congresses are organized by the student association Campana, which publishes a newsletter, '''t Schipke'' [http://users.pandora.be/an.lommelen/Campana.htm].

The school maintains connections with higher institutes of art in Belgium, the ''Carillon Instituut Nederland'' [http://www.boudewijnzwart.com/cin.htm] and ''Bourdon Hogeschool voor Muziek'' [http://www.bourdonhogeschool.nl/] in the Netherlands, and [[Missouri State University]] in the United States. The school also maintains an exchange program with the [[Yale Guild of Carillonneurs|Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs]] and relations with the State Conservatory of [[Saratov]] in Russia.

Tuition fees amount to less than 260 € per year.

==Degrees and diplomas==

Diplomas are offered at two levels of secondary education, and advanced students may continue their studies to earn a Final Diploma (Dutch: ''einddiploma'') or the two-year Diploma of Excellence, an honor awarded to only a few students in the school's history with exceptional talent in composition. In association with the ''Carillon Instituut Nederland'' and ''Bourdon Hogeschool voor Muziek'' in the Netherlands, the school began offering bachelor's degrees in 2006. A joint master's degree in carillon with tracks in performance and pedagogy is offered jointly with [[Missouri State University]].

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context ==
The advent of modern K-pop arguably started in 1992, gained significant foothold by 1996 during the industrialization of K-pop, matured through the mid 2000s,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and flourished in the 2010s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Albeit beauty is an ever-present ideal for Korean popular culture, these time periods represent shifts in beauty norms and K-pop ideals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The early 1990s brought a young, individualistic cuteness to the scene with stocky builds and chubby faces, following from the Korean beauty norms of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the 1980s Japanese idol system, idol groups were generated in the late 1990s, often mimicking western boy bands with innocence and sunny dispositions, a product directed domestically. During this time a review committee censored all Korean music and music videos for sexual and other explicit content.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The committee was disbanded in June 1996.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After an economic crisis in 1997 and success of this domestic product outside South Korea, the innocence morphed into a more romantic and hipper image in the early 2000s, which presented the first major signs of sexualization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This transformation was aided by the increased use of music videos.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By 2004 a new generation of K-pop was born, sex became prevalent in K-pop and idol-worshiping adolescents came into being.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within a decade, maturation of K-pop, driven by hyper-popularized music videos, propelled idols into a visual medium, thus transforming K-pop into the modern beauty standard of low body fat, well-toned muscles, and perfected body features.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
The late 2000s brought K-pop into its modern era and introduced it to the international stage with the [[Korean Wave|Korean wave]] in Asia; the early 2010s bolstered K-pop to an international powerhouse with the global Korean wave. K-pop has always been influenced by western musical styles; however, many link its international success to the globalization caused by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout period (during the 1997 South Korean economic crash) in South Korea's neoliberalization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Post-IMF South Korea has incorporated more Westernized (specifically, Americanized) culture into their products (i.e. exports) in order to prosper in international sales, thus pressing the popular music industry to become more westernized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Integration of westernization brought the western male gaze&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the hypersexualization of products, especially in the popular music scene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only was the music itself altered to enhance exportability, but given the modern age of the music video, the performer was also altered.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Combining this with Korea's male dominated society, one that currently ranks the near the bottom of the Global Gender Gap list for modernized societies (presenting the largest gender wage and working condition gaps), produces an overtly sexualized popular music market.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Additionally, proliferation of K-pop allows for South Korea to enter into and even dominate the global “cultural war,” a concept tied to a battle for attention between the globalized cultures in the modern era. Thus, the government of South Korea encourages the use of K-pop to promote global recognition; however, because of the turbulence of popular culture, largely due to sexualization and exploitation, the government maintains no official backing of K-pop but restrains limiting what are allowable K-pop activities.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saeji|first=CedarBough T.|date=December 2013|title=Juvenile Protection and Sexual Objectification: Analysis of the Performance Frame in Korean Music Television Broadcasts|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.18399/acta.2013.16.2.003|journal=Acta Koreana|volume=16|issue=2|pages=329–365|doi=10.18399/acta.2013.16.2.003|issn=1520-7412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ergo, without official sponsorship of K-pop, the government unofficially helps it by reducing governmental constraints on it, especially for exported products.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This allows the idols to become an unofficial representation of the South Korean culture, promoting cultural pride and building the nation into an “idol republic,” meaning that their image (i.e. bodies) belong to the state and represent the state's people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Critical Issues ==
Sexualization in K-pop is mainly driven by economic reasoning and forces females into a globalized normative femininity and males into a globalized normative masculinity.

=== Economic Reasoning ===
Entering the world market to help globalize marketable Korean culture was only a byproduct of the economic conditions behind K-pop's evolution. Early K-pop was not well received critically, but its catchiness and localization enamored the masses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The success was noticed by a few business-oriented musicians that soon capitalized on the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Industrialization of K-pop occurred around the mid 1990s and its popularity grew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Maintaining localization while hybridizing (not assimilating) with Japan's idol methodology and American popular music stylings helped bolster success internally and as an export, albeit initially limited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The promising external success in conjunction with the diverse extant musical acts drove the music industry to facilitate portfolio diversification of their performing groups to maximize success and thus, profits. This meant optimized pandering to the most consumers. Such optimization lead to increasing numbers of performers per group, each individualized to suit different consumers’ tastes, perfecting the performances, and increasing attractiveness of the group to the different consuming cultures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, in the group itself there could be a proverbial “good,” “bad,” cute, or sexy member, while the whole group increased in attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, combining the desires of American culture for blatant sexiness,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unger|first=Michael A.|date=March 2015|title=The Aporia of Presentation: Deconstructing the Genre of K-pop Girl Group Music Videos in South Korea|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpms.12109|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=27|issue=1|pages=25–47|doi=10.1111/jpms.12109|issn=1524-2226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean culture for [[aegyo]] (a compound of cute and lovable),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and Japanese proclivity for [[kawaii]] and patriarchal Lolita ideas made a complex interplay of diverse satisfaction of fantastical desires.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Following this logic, the music companies substantially invested monetarily and temporally in each performer in an effort to tailor them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A base level of attractiveness and skill is required to be considered as a performer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Years of subsequent training and discipline mold performers into what the public wants to see.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are disallowed from dating to maintain innocence,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; have a directed public life and persona (often sexualized or cute), shamed for gaining (or in some cases not losing) weight or not keeping their appearance up, may be required to go through plastic surgery for beautification,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and are required to interact with fans in a desirable manner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All-in-all, K-pop is an industry driven by profit; subsequently, it treats its performers like well-molded commodities in order to adhere to consumer desires, often sexual in nature as in the westernized (male) gaze, and Lolita ideals.

=== Femininity ===
As the flagship cultural commodities of South Korea, female K-pop singers are expected to be sexy, strong, and independent, in conjunction with being a product for the patriarchal South Korean capitalist society, which wants them to be submissive, innocent, cute, and loveable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; To maximize profit and success, the female stars must have the guise of ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ultimately, the ambiguity results as a clash between virgin and whore, which nearly all groups have; however, some of them may be more biased to one side than the other.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazzan|first=Dave|date=|title=K-pop Chords of Sexism|url=http://www.davehazzan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Herizons-v30n2-Fall16.pdf|journal=herizons|volume=30(2)|pages=44-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean ideals nominally press an aegyo image, or one that is “attractive and desirable beyond limits of intimate relations,” providing vulnerability to the idols but keeping them whimsical.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To conform to the westernized male gaze, females take the part of an exotic sexual object,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; often under the dollified Asian motif, leading to thoughts of “convenient Asians.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dollification is a construct of placing sexual desire upon a submissive and uncorrupted object of beauty, something common to Asia due to traditional gender roles and patriarchal structure, and applies exceptionally well to the surgically beautified K-pop females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, dolls are often associated with prostitution or sexual favors, something that idol singers can face when exploited by their employers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dollification also plays into the Japanese desire for submissive kawaii: dolls are inherently cute and can be controlled at will, something that quenches the yearning for totally submissive females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly, the concept of middle-aged Korean males seeing themselves as Samchon-fans (uncle-fans), or enduring uncles to the idols, has been argued as a facade to deny sexual desire when there is actually an underlying sexual gratification from the female bodies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This makes the female idol fill a Lolita role, one which fulfills a market need by supplying a male pedophilic fantasy of a young female with unconscious sexuality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Consequently, girl (female) bodies have become a commodity and given implicit subjugation in the patriarchal structure, the consumption of such is acceptable.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The females may present “girl power” given their high popularity status, but their pawn-like nature under the might of their parent companies keeps this a novelty, not a reality, via pacification.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The justified objectification of girl bodies in such an idol republic, where it is promoted economically and governmentally, makes it a Lolita republic, as argued by Yeran Kim.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More simply, their bodies’ beauty can belong to a national collective.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This beauty and femininity in image is prominently described as that of long legs with “honey thighs” and a perfect face and body, while showing ample skin; breasts are often sexualized but have only recently been presented as cleavage in K-pop due to the lack of cleavage shown in the general Korean culture.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Masculinity ===
Paralleling female idols, male idols are also commodities to be sexualized in an effort to maximize profit and success. Given the rigorous patriarchal gender rolls existing in Korea, the males are normally subjected to the requirement of Korean masculinity, but to optimize for diverse target audiences, they often present vulnerabilities, forming a non-Korean masculinity.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/840865016|title=Korean masculinities and transcultural consumption Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop idols|last=Sun.|first=Jung,|date=2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|oclc=840865016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean (hegemonic) masculinity can consist of patriarchal authority, traditional Confucian masculinity, and violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/46240370|title=Under construction : the gendering of modernity, class, and consumption in the Republic of Korea|last=Laurel.|first=Kendall,|date=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824824075|oclc=46240370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradictorily, non-Korean masculinity contains a range of metrosexuality from charming to chic.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This dichotomy forces bands to be muscular, potent, and appearing sexually virile, while injecting cuteness and innocence into their presentation, creating a transnational “soft masculinity” and “global metrosexual masculinity.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Both a soft masculinity called “flower boys,” and a harder masculinity, called “beast idols,” appear in K-pop groups, but even the hardest K-pop masculinity maintains a globalized cuteness.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/column/k-pop-generation/article/2013/10/22/Kpop_Men_Gender_Roles_Soy/|title=Men in K-Pop: From “Flower Boys” to “Beast-dols”|last=Soyoung|first=Kim|date=October 22, 2013|website=The Harvard Crimson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192647/https://www.thecrimson.com/column/k-pop-generation/article/2013/10/22/Kpop_Men_Gender_Roles_Soy/|archive-date=March 25, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key features of K-pop masculinity are muscular (often nude) torsos and cute actions/personalities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Well-defined muscles, albeit a falsity, can be considered a sign of both individual phallic power in response to feministic movements and nationalistic female desires.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is exemplified by a “body price” (momgap) notion that equates the sexiness of a male body to its (and his) worth,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; with “chocolate abs” being the most desirable trait.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Emasculated actions/personalities are often subtly employed to diversify the K-pop masculine act,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; as previously stated, but have occasionally been stressed by some to help break gender norms.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soompi.com/article/1079057wpp/8-k-pop-idols-challenging-gender-norms-korea|title=8 K-Pop Idols Who Are Challenging Gender Norms In Korea|last=heytoto|first=|date=November 28, 2017|website=soompi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, removing masculinity as a whole is ineffective, as noted by a Korean studies professor Oh Ingyu of Korea University, Seoul, “[a] male star without well-defined muscles, six-pack abs and a handsome smile won’t go far.”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As stated by Sarah Leung “[the K-pop industry’s] ultimate goal? To sell an image to the screaming girls in the crowd.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Manifestation ==
Sexualization of the popular Korean music market takes place in many forms: pushing sexy and attractive performers, conforming the performers to fan fantasies, and presenting sexualized songs or music videos.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Dollification ===
Dollification can be observed in a Japanese quote on the introduction to a performance by [[Girls' Generation|Girls’ Generation]] “I was shocked by their amazingly beautiful legs. The dance was as if dolls were dancing and it was wondrous.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Likewise, employers utilized doll images for advertisement. The idol [[G.NA]]’s body measurements were a hot topic with fans, so her employer promoted her by juxtaposing her with mannequins during photoshoots while calling her body “the mannequin body” because of her small face, large breasts, and small waist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This representation of a dollified human parallels Girl's Generation's “Gee” music video, in which the members are acting as mannequins in a shop's window that soon come alive or [[Girl's Day|Girl's Day]]’s music video for “Tilt my Head,” in which the members act like doll factory automata producing self-similar dolls that magically come alive (both also following the “coming alive” narrative).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Countering the description of a perfect doll image is the group Piggy Dolls, consisting of three heavier set females, engendering diversity in body image.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Female idol bodies ===
In general, K-pop idol bodies are heavily regulated by their employers; in fact, female bodies are not considered their own, as presented by a snarky statement by a member of [[Super Junior]], "[Girls’ Generation] can't get hurt without permission.

A normative male gaze desires long legs, something Girls’ Generation has in multitudes, as exemplified by a Japanese nickname “The Beautiful Legs Group,” and has even spawned a Japanese pornographic film based on their legs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Similarly, bodily perfection is a requirement of the profit-driven entertainment kingpins.

=== Male idol bodies ===
Males are likewise subjected to rigorous body standards, with a requirement to keep up their “body price”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; while balancing their soft masculinity.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The singer Rain is the embodiment of effeminate hyper-masculinity.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/900162636|title=The Korean wave : Korean media go global|last=compilation|first=Kim, Youna, editor of|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415712781|oclc=900162636}}&lt;/ref&gt; His well-defined abs and upper muscular body, often seen naked and oiled (or wet), is contrasted to his cute and young face.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; He is described as having “an angelic face and a killer body” or “a man’s body with a boy’s face.”&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Hyunjoon|date=December 2009|title=Have you ever seen theRain?

To keep this image, rigorous training is required, normally employing trainers and intense daily workout routines.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As with their female counterparts, there is sometimes a need for plastic surgery. Similarly, conjecture exists for who has undergone surgery, but again, some idols have explicitly stated their surgical augmentations. For example, Kwanghee of [[ZE:A]] had eyelid, nose, and forehead alterations, Kim Heechul from Super Junior had eyelid alterations and fixed remnants of a past broken nose with surgery, and his co-star Kyuhyun (of Super Junior) had a double eyelid surgery following his parents example.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; It is important to note some of the gender norm challengers. Kim Heechul of Super Junior hosts a show “Lipstick Prince” to cover makeup for both genders, Ren from [[NU'EST|NU’EST]] modeled dresses, skirts, and other similar clothing, Lee Hong Ki of [[F.T. Island|FTISLAND]] both wears and promotes his nail art, Jo Kwon is a queer culture advocate and crossdresser, and Hansol enjoys makeup and has admitted to being non-heterosexual.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Sexualization in YouTube music videos ===
{{See also|List of banned K-pop videos}}
Given the popularization of K-pop through visual social media such as YouTube,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; many fans would most recognize sexualization in music videos or recorded performances. The advent of music videos to help brand recognition brought a survival-of-the-fittest attitude to the images of the artists; that is, the sexier artists survived.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, sex was commercialized to capitalize on human reproductive nature, allowing sexualization to flourish.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Given the liberalization of sex, sexual content has increased in K-pop music videos; therefore, a video content analysis was performed by Bohye Song by taking MelOn Hot 100 chart listings of the most popular Korean music videos of 2004, 2005, 2014, and 2015 to analyze their sexual content and increases over time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Content observed were sexual innuendos, sexual acts, and provocative clothing while the results were broken down into four parts of changes in physical affection, provocative dress, suggestiveness, and gender variance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It was found that displayed physical affections did not change on average, but implicit sex increased, sexual suggestiveness increased, provocative clothing increased, and female lead singers showed a significant increase in provocative display.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This means that there is a significant increase in the display, mainly through clothing, of sexualized females and some males, but there is not much of an increase in sexual acts (two people in contact) depicted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This can be exemplified with modern music videos. Examples of K-pop music videos with revealing clothing on a female singer include “Marionette” by Stellar, “Roll Deep” by Hyuna, “Ring My Bell” by Girl's Day, “Wild” by [[Nine Muses (band)|Nine Muses]], “Wiggle Wiggle” by [[Hello Venus]], “Like a Cat” by [[AOA (band)|AOA]], “Butt” by I-Ren, and “Dr. Feel Good” by [[Rania (band)|BP RaNia]], among many others.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/K-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-female-edition|title=K-Pop idols' most revealing outfits [Female Edition]|last=|first=|date=May 22, 2017|website=allkpop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114013918/https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/k-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-female-edition|archive-date=January 14, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female singers sported short skirts, short shorts, cleavage, tight clothing, et cetera.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; Correspondingly, male singers have worn see-through shirts and pants, extremely short shorts, and even corsets or skimpy dresses (in drag).&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/K-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-male-edition|title=K-Pop idols' most revealing outfits [Male Edition]|last=|first=|date=May 24, 2017|website=allkpop|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115014357/https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/05/k-pop-idols-most-revealing-outfits-male-edition|archive-date=January 15, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to these are banned-from-broadcast videos, which include, but are not limited to, “MOMMAE” by [[Jay Park]], due to overtly sexualized females; “Abracadabra” by Brown Eyed Girls, for being sexually suggestive; “Mirotic” by [[TVXQ]], for body exposure and explicit language; “One More” by [[Fiestar|FIESTAR]], due to sexual imagery; both “Vibrato” and “Marionette” by [[Stellar (South Korean band)|Stellar]], for sexually suggestive dancing and clothing; “Touch Me” by Ivy, for sexual imagery and suggestive lyrics; “Joker” by [[Dal Shabet]], for sexual choreography; “Shower Later” by Gary, due to sexual innuendos and mature themes; and “Bae Bae” by [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|BIGBANG]], for sexual innuendos.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/10-K-pop-mvs-that-were-deemed-too-sexy-for-tv/|title=10 K-Pop MVs that have been banned for being “Too Sexual”|last=|first=|date=January 6, 2017|website=Koreaboo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107074515/https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/10-K-pop-mvs-that-were-deemed-too-sexy-for-tv/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the transition from innocent to sexualized can be shown by Girls’ Generation music videos.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Their video for “[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]” in 2009 maintained schoolgirl innocence, then their video for “[[Oh! (Girls' Generation song)|Oh!]]” in 2010 kept their innocence but added on a prelude to their dark side at the end when it pitted the innocent schoolgirl cheerleaders against sexier, shadowy versions of themselves.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Finally, their 2011 video for “[[The Boys (Girls' Generation song)|The Boys]]” replaced innocence with mature sexiness.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
Sexualization has a multitude of implications, causing controversies. One key controversy involves the disproportionate sexualization and objectification of females in comparison to males, perpetuating the patriarchal ideal of South Korea.

=== Gender inequalities ===
Both male and female K-pop idols are taken advantage of and objectified; however, females appear to have a disproportionate amount of sexism pitted against them.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Females are subjected to the western male gaze, dollification, and being considered exotic and submissive for their masculine fans in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Femininity is desired to coincide with the neo-Confucian patriarchal social structure so as to maximize profit; idols are normally forced into this definition in conjunction with Korea's inherently well-defined roll for women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Additionally, being below Japan's Global Gender Gap Index and aligned with Muslim-majority countries’, South Korea's Global Gender Gap Index represents the general poor state of gender equality in South Korea.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Xi Lin and Rober Rudolf conducted a survey of 6,317 K-pop fans from 100 countries to determine the egalitarianism of the K-pop consumers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Their study found that more K-pop indulgence correlated to less egalitarianism, with this being most notable in already gender stratified countries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Similarly, the stratification of genders in Korea is actually aided by the government and its patriarchal capitalism, and vice-versa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; That is, sexism and sexualization in K-pop support the success of South Korea's patriarchal capitalism, forcing norms of gender inequalities and the sexual objectification of female K-pop idols.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Supplementary process''' is a method of [[debt collection]] where the debtor who has a court money judgement against him is brought into court, "requiring the judgment debtor to appear at a time and place named therein and submit to an examination relative to his or its property and ability to pay."&lt;ref&gt;M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14 https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter224/Section14&lt;/ref&gt; The process is common in [[Massachusetts]] under M.G.L. Ch. 224, s. 14.  If the debtor does not appear in court, a [[Capias ad respondendum]] may issue where a sheriff brings the debtor into court to respond.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12411">The '''TenTen Corpus Family''' (also called '''TenTen corpora''') is a set of comparable web [[text corpora]], i.e. collections of texts that have been [[Web crawler|crawled]] from the [[World Wide Web]] and processed to match the same standards. These corpora are made available through the [[Sketch Engine]] corpus manager. There are TenTen corpora for more than 35 languages. Their target size is 10 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) words per language, which gave rise to the corpus family's name.&lt;ref name="tenten"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|author-link2=Adam Kilgarriff|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|date=July 2013|title=The Tenten Corpus Family|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/The_TenTen_Corpus_2013.pdf|conference=7th International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|location=Lancaster, UK|publisher=Lancaster University|pages=125–127|access-date=13 June 2017|book-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation of the TenTen corpora, data crawled from the World Wide Web are processed with [[natural language processing]] tools developed by the Natural Language Processing Centre at the Faculty of Informatics at [[Masaryk University]] ([[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]) and by the Lexical Computing company (developer of the Sketch Engine).

== Corpus linguistics ==

In [[corpus linguistics]], a [[text corpus]] is a large and structured collection of texts that are electronically stored and processed. It is used to do hypothesis testing about languages, validating linguistic rules or the frequency distribution of words ([[n-grams]]) within languages. 

Electronically processed corpora provide fast search. Text processing procedures such as [[Lexical_analysis#Tokenization|tokenization]], [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[word-sense disambiguation]] enrich corpus texts with detailed linguistic information. This enables to narrow the search to a particular [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], word sequences or a specific part of the corpus.

First text corpora were created in the 1960s, such as the 1-million-word [[Brown Corpus]] of [[American English]]. Over time, many further corpora were produced (such as the [[British National Corpus]] and the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus|LOB Corpus]]) and work had begun also on corpora of larger sizes and covering other languages than English. This development was linked with the emergence of corpus creation tools that help achieve larger size, wider coverage, cleaner data etc.

== Production of TenTen corpora ==
The procedure by which TenTen corpora are produced is based on the creators' earlier research in preparing web corpora and the subsequent processing thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Baroni|first1=Marco|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|author-link2=Adam Kilgarriff|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|date=July 2013|title=Large linguistically-processed web corpora for multiple languages|url=http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/marco/publications/eacl2006/dewac_eacl.pdf|conference=11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Posters &amp; Demonstrations.

At the beginning, a huge amount of text data is [[Web crawler|downloaded]] from the World Wide Web by the dedicated SpiderLing web crawler.&lt;ref name="crawling"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Efficient web crawling for large text corpora |last1= Suchomel|first1= Vít|last2= Pomikálek|first2= Jan|date=17 April 2012|publisher= Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) on Web as Corpus |book-title= Proceedings of the seventh Web as Corpus Workshop (WAC7)|pages=39–43 |location= Lyon, France |conference= 7th Web as Corpus Workshop|url=https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/~xsuchom2/papers/PomikalekSuchomel_SpiderlingEfficiency.pdf |access-date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later stage, these texts undergo [[Data cleansing|cleaning]], which consists of removing any non-textual material such as navigation links, headers and footers from the [[HTML]] source code of web pages with the jusText tool&lt;ref name="justext"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Pomikálek |first=Jan |date=2011 |title=Removing boilerplate and duplicate content from web corpora |type=PhD |chapter= |publisher=Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://theses.cz/id/nqo9nn/?furl=%2Fid%2Fnqo9nn%2F;lang=en |access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so that only full solid sentences are preserved. Eventually, the ONION tool&lt;ref name="justext" /&gt; is applied to [[Data deduplication|remove duplicate text portions]] from the corpus, which naturally occur on the World Wide Web due to practices such as [[quotation|quoting]], [[citation|citing]], [[copying]] etc.&lt;ref name="tenten" /&gt;

== TenTen corpora data structure ==
TenTen corpora follow a specific metadata structure that is common to all of them. Metadata is contained in structural attributes that relate to individual documents and paragraphs in the corpus. Some TenTen corpora can feature additional specific attributes.

=== Document attributes ===

'''Triple Award Science''' is the name for a course in the United Kingdom which delivers three separate [[GCSE]]s in Biology, Chemistry and Physics although it's commonly referred to as "Triple Science".

The course is usually studied throughout Years 10 and 11 (Years 11 and 12 in Northern Ireland) but may be started in the later stages of Year 9 (Year 10 in Northern Ireland). The course provides the broadest coverage of the main three science subjects at [[Key Stage 4]] available, and incorporates the compulsory programme of study for Science.

The course is offered by the five main awarding bodies in the United Kingdom; [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Edexcel]], [[OCR (examination board)|OCR]], [[Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]] and [[WJEC (exam board)|WJEC]]. In Northern Ireland the awarding board is [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|CCEA]].

There are 3 different types of science:
*Chemistry 
*Biology 
*Physics

==OCR==
[[OCR (examination board)|OCR]] have awarded a Triple Science award since 2007 through their 21st Century Science program. The course aims to develop scientific literacy.

For the 2012 specifications, OCR's singular award science has 3 modules of work. In their double award there are 6 modules. Their Triple Science Award has 7 modules for each science, which are made up of the six modules from double award and an extra one module from each science.
* The Biology module is called "Biology across the Ecosystem"
* The Chemistry module is called "Chemistry for a Sustainable World"
* The Physics module is called "Observing the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/the-courses/triple-science,1423,NA.html&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the exam boards offering triple science have new specifications with first examinations in June 2018. Many schools will begin teaching this to their year 9 in 2015-16. Other schools will begin teaching the new specifications to year 10 in September 2016.

[[File:UTC Library IMG 0680 (842085138).jpg|thumb|Journal issues bound into volumes in a library. ]]
A '''volume''' is a physical [[book]]. It may be printed or [[Codex|handwritten]]. The term is commonly used to identify a single book that is part of a larger [[wikt:collection|collection]]. Volumes are typically identified [[Sequence|sequentially]] with [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or [[Arabic numerals]], e.g. "Volume 3" or "Volume III." and is commonly abbreviated to "Vol."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Volumes may be published directly, or they may be created out of [[Bookbinding|bound]] issues. For instance, a library that subscribes to a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] and wishes to preserve it typically takes a set of the issues and has them bound into a volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BUNN|first=R.M.|date=January 1962|title=BINDING OF PERIODICALS IN THE NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/eb026312|journal=Journal of Documentation|volume=18|issue=1|pages=20–24|doi=10.1108/eb026312|issn=0022-0418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIDNEY DITZION, LEVERETT NORMAN|first=|date=1956|title=Problems of Periodical and Serial Binding|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/5657/librarytrendsv4i3e_opt.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Publishing|publisher]] may also separately publish a volume out of previously published issues; this is common with [[Graphic novel|graphic novels.]] A volume may also be composed of entries, as in an [[encyclopedia]], or chapters, as in a [[monograph]]. 

The term is also used as an identifier for a sequence of periodicals. This is generally based on a single calendar year, but not always. For instance, a school magazine might start each new volume at the beginning of the academic year, or at the beginning of each term/semester. Thus, all issues published in the ''Nth'' term or year will be classified under the ''Nth'' volume.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Journalism-newspapers-magazines-2494/volume-issue.htm|title=All Experts Questions and Answers – Journalism|last=|first=|date=|website=All Experts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202011515/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Journalism-newspapers-magazines-2494/volume-issue.htm|archive-date=2010-02-02|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original function of labelling issues with a volume at publication time was to provide a standard way for libraries to later bind the issues into a physical volume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11069">'''Watershed management ''' is the study of the relevant characteristics of a [[Drainage basin|watershed]] aimed at the sustainable distribution of its resources and the process of creating and implementing plans, programs, and projects to sustain and enhance [[drainage basin|watershed]] functions that affect the [[plant]], [[animal]], and [[human]] communities within the watershed boundary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/wp/Documents/California%20Watershed%20Program.pdf California Watershed Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Features of a watershed that agencies seek to manage include [[water supply]], [[water quality]], [[drainage]], [[stormwater]] runoff, [[water right]]s, and the overall planning and utilization of watersheds. [[Landowners]], [[land use]] agencies, stormwater management experts, environmental specialists, water use surveyors and communities all play an integral part in watershed management.

== Controlling pollution ==
In agricultural systems, common practices include the use of [[buffer strip]]s, grassed waterways, the re-establishment of [[wetland]]s, and forms of [[sustainable agriculture]] practices such as [[no-till farming|conservation tillage]], [[crop rotation]] and [[inter-cropping]]. After certain practices are installed, it is important to continuously monitor these systems to ensure that they are working properly in terms of improving environmental quality. 

In urban settings, managing areas to prevent soil loss and control stormwater flow are a few of the areas that receive attention. A few practices that are used to manage stormwater before it reaches a channel are [[retention basin|retention pond]]s, filtering systems and wetlands. It is important that storm-water is given an opportunity to [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] so that the soil and vegetation can act as a "filter" before the water reaches nearby streams or lakes. In the case of soil erosion prevention, a few common practices include the use of silt fences, [[landscape fabric]] with grass seed and [[hydroseeding]]. The main objective in all cases is to slow water movement to prevent soil transport.

== Governance ==
The 2nd [[World Water Forum]] held in The [[Hague]] in March 2000 raised some controversies that exposed the [[multilateralism|multilateral]] nature and imbalance the demand and supply management of [[freshwater]]. While donor organisations, private and [[government]] institutions backed by the [[World Bank]], believe that [[freshwater]] should be governed as an economic good by appropriate pricing, [[NGOs]] however, held that freshwater resources should be seen as a social good.&lt;ref&gt;	Oweyegha-Afunaduula, F.C., I. Afunaduula and M. Balunywa (2003). NGO-sing the Nile Basin Initiative: a myth or reality? Paper at 3rd World Water Forum, Japan, March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[network governance]] where all stakeholders form partnerships and voluntarily share ideas towards forging a common vision can be used to resolve this clash of opinion in freshwater management. Also, the implementation of any common vision presents a new role for [[NGOs]] because of their unique capabilities in local community coordination, thus making them a valuable partner in [[network governance]].&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;Evans J: ''Environmental governance'' (2012), Routledge, Chapter 4 {{ISBN|978-0415589826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drainage basin|Watersheds]] replicate this [[multilateralism|multilateral]] terrain with private industries and local communities interconnected by a common watershed. Although these groups share a common [[ecological]] space that could transcend state borders, their interests, knowledge and use of resources within the watershed are mostly disproportionate and divergent, resulting to the activities of a specific group adversely impacting on other groups. Examples being the [[Minamata disease|Minamata Bay poisoning]] that occurred from 1932 to 1968, killing over 1,784 individuals and the [[Wabigoon River|Wabigoon River incidence]] of 1962. Furthermore, while some knowledgeable groups are shifting from efficient water resource exploitation to efficient utilization, net gain for the watershed [[ecology]] could be lost when other groups seizes the opportunity to exploit more [[resources]]. This gap in cooperative communication among [[multilateralism|multilateral]] stakeholders within an interconnected watershed, even with the likely presence of the usually reactive and political boundary-constraint state regulations, makes it necessary for the institutionalisation of an ecological-scale cooperative network of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt; Mark L, Mark S, John T and Mihriye M (2002); Watershed Partnerships and the Emergence of Collective Action Institutions American Journal of Political Science, Volume 46 No.1 Page 148-163. Available at: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088419&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;	Dhakal, K. P., &amp; Chevalier, L. R. (2016). Urban Stormwater Governance: The Need for a Paradigm Shift. Environmental management, 57(5), 1112-1124. Available at: http://rdcu.be/mRTi or at: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0667-5&lt;/ref&gt; This concept supports an integrated management style for interconnected natural resources; resonating strongly with the [[Integrated Water Resources Management]] system proposed by [[Global Water Partnership]].

Moreover, the need to create partnerships between donor organisations, private and government institutions and community representatives like [[NGOs]] in watersheds is to enhance an "organisational society" among stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Ewalt, J. G. 2001. Theories of Governance and New Public Management: Links to Understanding Welfare Policy Implementation. Paper Presented at the Annual Conference of the American Society for Public Administration. Also available at: http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/aspa/unpan000563.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This posits a type of [[public-private partnership]], commonly referred to as Type II partnership,&lt;ref&gt;1.	Emma T and Lisa-Ann H (2010); Public-Private Partnerships for Storm Risk Management in the Cayman Islands; Sustainability Research Institute, The University of Leeds. Also available at: http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/research/sri/working_papers/SRIPs-21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which essentially brings together stakeholders that share a common watershed under a voluntary, idea sharing and collectively agreed vision aimed at granting mutual benefits to all stakeholders. Also, it explicates the concept of [[network governance]], which is "the only alternative for collective action",&lt;ref&gt;5.	Milward H and Provan K (2000). “How Networks Are Governed.” In Heinrich C and Lynn L eds. Governance and Performance: Models, Methods and Results, Page 243. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; requiring [[government]] to rescale its role in decision making and collaborate with other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] on a level playing field rather than in an [[Public administration|administrative]] or [[hierarchical]] manner.

Several [[riparian]] states have adopted this concept in managing the increasingly scarce resources of watersheds. These include, the nine [[Rhine]] states, with a common vision of [[pollution control]],&lt;ref&gt;8.	Transboundary River Basin Management Regimes: the Rhine basin case study, Newater, pp1-37.

For instance, essential local coordination and education are areas where the services of NGOs have been effective.&lt;ref&gt;7.

Also available at: http://www.socialsciences-ejournal.org/3.9.%20Prabhakar.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes NGOs the "nuclei" for successful watershed management.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Recently, [[artificial Intelligence]] techniques such as [[neural networks]] have been utilized to address the problem of watershed management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Environmental law ==
{{Main article|Environmental law}}
Environmental laws often dictate the planning and actions that agencies take to manage watersheds. Some laws require that planning be done, others can be used to make a plan legally enforceable and others set out the ground rules for what can and cannot be done in development and planning. Most countries and states have their own laws regarding watershed management.

Those concerned about [[marine biology|aquatic habitat]] protection have a right to participate in the laws and planning processes that affect aquatic habitats. By having a clear understanding of whom to speak to and how to present the case for keeping our waterways clean a member of the public can become an effective watershed protection advocate.
