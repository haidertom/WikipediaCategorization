'''A/B testing''' ('''bucket tests''' or '''split-run testing''') is a [[randomized experiment]] with two variants, A and B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes application of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of [[statistics]]. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The ABCs of A/B Testing - Pardot|url = http://www.pardot.com/blog/abcs-ab-testing/|website = Pardot|access-date = 2016-02-21|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name implies, two versions (A and B) are compared, which are identical except for one variation that might affect a user's behavior.  Version&amp;nbsp;A might be the currently used version (control), while version&amp;nbsp;B is modified in some respect (treatment). For instance, on an e-commerce website the [[purchase funnel]] is typically a good candidate for A/B testing, as even marginal improvements in drop-off rates can represent a significant gain in sales. Significant improvements can sometimes be seen through testing elements like copy text, layouts, images and colors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webics.com.au/blog/google-adwords/split-testing-guide-for-online-retailers/|title=Split Testing Guide for Online Stores|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-28|publisher=webics.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not always.

[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate testing]] or [[multinomial test|multinomial]] testing is similar to A/B testing, but may test more than two versions at the same time or use more controls. Simple A/B tests are not valid for [[observational]], [[quasi-experimental]] or other [[non-experimental]] situations, as is common with survey data, offline data, and other, more complex phenomena.

A/B testing has been marketed by some as a change in philosophy and business strategy in certain niches, though the approach is identical to a [[between-subjects design]], which is commonly used in a variety of research traditions.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christian |first=Brian |url=https://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_abtesting/ |title=The A/B Test: Inside the Technology That's Changing the Rules of Business &amp;#124; Wired Business |publisher=Wired.com |date=2000-02-27 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christian |first=Brian |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/test-everything/ |title=Test Everything: Notes on the A/B Revolution &amp;#124; Wired Enterprise |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cory Doctorow |url=http://boingboing.net/2012/04/26/ab-testing-the-secret-engine.html |title=A/B testing: the secret engine of creation and refinement for the 21st century |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A/B testing as a philosophy of web development brings the field into line with a broader movement toward [[evidence-based practice]]. The benefits of A/B testing are considered to be that it can be performed continuously on almost anything, especially since most marketing automation software now typically comes with the ability to run A/B tests on an ongoing basis.

==Common test statistics==
"Two-sample hypothesis tests" are appropriate for comparing the two samples where the samples are divided by the two control cases in the experiment. [[Z-test]]s are appropriate for comparing means under stringent conditions regarding normality and a known standard deviation. [[Student's t-test]]s are appropriate for comparing means under relaxed conditions when less is assumed. [[Welch's t test]] assumes the least and is therefore the most commonly used test in a two-sample [[hypothesis test]] where the mean of a metric is to be optimized. While the [[mean]] of the variable to be optimized is the most common choice of [[estimator]], others are regularly used.

For a comparison of two [[binomial distribution]]s such as a [[click-through rate]] one would use [[Fisher's exact test]].

==History==

Like most fields, setting a date for the advent of a new method is difficult because of the continuous evolution of a topic. Where the difference could be defined is when the switch was made from using any assumed information from the populations to a test performed on the samples alone. This work was done in 1908 by [[William Sealy Gosset]] when he altered the [[Z-test]] to create [[Student's t-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.gembaacademy.com/2007/06/20/how-beer-influenced-statistics/ |title=Brief history and background for the one sample t-test}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Box |first1=Joan Fisher |title=Guinness, Gosset, Fisher, and Small Samples |journal=Statistical Science |date=1987 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=45–52 |doi=10.1214/ss/1177013437 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177013437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google engineers ran their first A/B test in the year 2000 in an attempt to determine what the optimum number of results to display on its search engine results page would be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first test was unsuccessful due to glitches that resulted from slow loading times. Later A/B testing research would be more advanced, but the foundation and underlying principles generally remain the same, and in 2011, 11 years after Google’s first test, Google ran over 7,000 different A/B tests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==An emailing campaign example==
A company with a customer [[database]] of 2,000 people decides to create an email campaign with a discount code in order to generate sales through its website. It creates two versions of the email with different call to action (the part of the copy which encourages customers to do something&amp;nbsp;— in the case of a sales campaign, make a purchase) and identifying promotional code.
* To 1,000 people it sends the email with the call to action stating, "Offer ends this Saturday! Use code A1",
* and to another 1,000 people it sends the email with the call to action stating, "Offer ends soon! Use code B1".

All other elements of the emails' copy and layout are identical. The company then monitors which campaign has the higher success rate by analyzing the use of the promotional codes. The email using the code A1 has a 5% [[response rate (survey)|response rate]] (50 of the 1,000 people emailed used the code to buy a product), and the email using the code B1 has a 3% response rate (30 of the recipients used the code to buy a product). The company therefore determines that in this instance, the first Call To Action is more effective and will use it in future sales. A more nuanced approach would involve applying statistical testing to determine if the differences in response rates between A1 and B1 were [[statistically significant]] (that is, highly likely that the differences are real, repeatable, and not due to random chance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amazon.com |url=https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/manage/ab-testing/doc/math-behind-ab-testing |title=The Math Behind A/B Testing |publisher=Developer.amazon.com |accessdate=2015-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921174256/https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/manage/ab-testing/doc/math-behind-ab-testing |archivedate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example above, the purpose of the test is to determine which is the more effective way to encourage customers to make a purchase. If, however, the aim of the test had been to see which email would generate the higher [[Clickthrough rate|click-rate]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, the number of people who actually click onto the website after receiving the email – then the results might have been different.

For example, even though more of the customers receiving the code B1 accessed the website, because the Call To Action didn't state the end-date of the promotion many of them may feel no urgency to make an immediate purchase. Consequently, if the purpose of the test had been simply to see which email would bring more traffic to the website, then the email containing code B1 might well have been more successful. An A/B test should have a defined outcome that is measurable such as number of sales made, click-rate conversion, or number of people signing up/registering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Segmentation and targeting==
A/B tests most commonly apply the same variant (e.g., user interface element) with equal probability to all users. However, in some circumstances, responses to variants may be heterogeneous. That is, while a variant A might have a higher response rate overall, variant B may have an even higher response rate within a specific segment of the customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online-behavior.com/testing/advanced-ab-testing-tactics-1356 |title=Advanced A/B Testing Tactics That You Should Know &amp;#124; Testing &amp; Usability |publisher=Online-behavior.com |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the breakdown of the response rates by gender could have been:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|-
! Gender !! Overall !! Men !! Women
|-
! Total sends 
| 2,000 || 1,000 || 1,000
|-
! Total responses 
| 80 || 35 || 45
|-
! Variant A 
| {{sfrac|50 | 1,000}} (5%) || {{sfrac|10 | 500}} (2%) || {{sfrac|40 | 500}} (8%)
|-
! Variant B 
| {{sfrac|30 | 1,000}} (3%) || {{sfrac|25 | 500}} (5%) || {{sfrac|5 | 500}} (1%)
|}

In this case, we can see that while variant A had a higher response rate overall, variant B actually had a higher response rate with men.

As a result, the company might select a segmented strategy as a result of the A/B test, sending variant B to men and variant A to women in the future. In this example, a segmented strategy would yield an increase in expected response rates from &lt;math display="inline"&gt;5\% = \frac{40 + 10}{500 + 500}&lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;6.5\% = \frac{40 + 25}{500+500}&lt;/math&gt;  – constituting a 30% increase.

It is important to note that if segmented results are expected from the A/B test, the test should be properly designed at the outset to be evenly distributed across key customer attributes, such as gender. That is, the test should both (a) contain a [[representative sample]] of men vs. women, and (b) assign men and women randomly to each “variant” (variant A vs. variant B). Failure to do so could lead to experiment [[bias]] and inaccurate conclusions to be drawn from the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drjasondavis.com/2013/09/12/eight-ways-youve-misconfigured-your-ab-test/ |title=Eight Ways You’ve Misconfigured Your A/B Test |publisher=Dr. Jason Davis |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This segmentation and targeting approach can be further generalized to include multiple customer attributes rather than a single customer attribute&amp;nbsp;– for example, customers' age AND gender – to identify more nuanced patterns that may exist in the test results.

==Acceptance==
Many companies use the "designed experiment" approach to making marketing decisions, with the expectation that relevant sample results can improve positive conversion results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete Guide To Conversion Rate Optimization|url=https://www.omniconvert.com/conversion-rate-optimization-cro-guide|publisher=Omniconvert|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an increasingly common practice as the tools and expertise grows in this area. There are many A/B testing case studies which show that the practice of testing is increasingly becoming popular with small and medium-sized businesses as well.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web|url=https://vwo.com/resources/casestudy/|title=A/B Split Testing &amp;#124; Multivariate Testing &amp;#124; Case Studies|publisher=Visual Website Optimizer|accessdate=2015-09-08}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10146">'''Associazione di Fondazioni e di Casse di Risparmio S.p.A.''' is an Italian banking association. The members were the savings banks ({{lang-it|casse di risparmio}} or &lt;small&gt;singular&lt;/small&gt; ''cassa di risparmio'') of Italy, or the foundation that originate from the reform trigger by [[Legge Amato]]. Banks originated from mounts of piety also joined.

==History==
The association was found in 1912 as '''Associazione fra le Casse di Risparmio Italiane''' (ACRI). Due to {{ill|Legge Amato|it}}, the savings banks became banking foundation and their respective "company limited by shares". After 25 years of merger and acquisitions, only 24 member banks (including banks with mount of piety origins) survived, with only 8 of them were owned by their original banking foundations, plus [[Banca Carige]] that went fully publicly owned. The rest of the savings bank that survived from their establishments until 1991, became part of [[Intesa Sanpaolo]], [[UniCredit]], [[Banco BPM]], [[UBI Banca]], [[BPER Banca]], [[Banca Popolare di Bari]], [[Credito Valtellinese]], [[Banca Carige]], [[Cassa di Risparmio di Asti|Banca di Asti]], [[Crédit Agricole Italia]] and other banking group. Moreover, two more savings banks, Cariparma and Biverbanca were not members of ACRI.

The surviving banks were either independent banks (such as [[Banca Carige]], [[Cassa di Risparmio di Ravenna]], [[Südtiroler Sparkasse – Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano|Südtiroler Sparkasse]], etc.), subsidiaries (e.g. [[Banca CR Firenze]] and [[Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna|Carisbo]]) or minority owned by major banking group (e.g. Banca di Asti and Banca Cassa di Risparmio di Savigliano).

ACRI members (the foundations) also owned 18.4% stake collectively in [[Cassa Depositi e Prestiti]]. The members also involved in the investment fund [[Primo Fondo Italiano per le Infrastrutture|F2i First]] and [[Secondo Fondo Italiano per le Infrastrutture|Second Fund]].

In 2015 85 out of 86 member foundations of ACRI (except [[Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Fossano]]) had signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] with [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]] for the new regulation on the assets of the foundations.&lt;ref name=ACRI2014report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.it/_upload/Rapporto/20RAPP.zip|title=VENTESIMO RAPPORTO SULLE FONDAZIONI DI ORIGINE BANCARIA 2014|date=28 September 2015|access-date=15 April 2016|publisher=ACRI|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ACRI, the collective shareholders' equity of 87 out of 88 foundations were €41,243,344,914. (including non-member Roma and Pisa but data from Carige was missing)&lt;ref name=ACRI2014report/&gt; However, the value of the assets were based on the historic price, such as the price of the shares of the bank.

In 2016 the foundations were invited to invest back to banking sector by joining the private equity fund [[Atlante (private equity fund)|Atlante]] that aiming to recapitalize the weak bank and purchase the  [[securitization|securitizated]] non-performing loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-banks-fund-insight-idUSKCN0XC16Q|title=Italy's Atlas fund struggles to stop sky falling on banks|date=15 April 2016|access-date=15 April 2016|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capacity utilization''' or '''capacity utilisation''' is the extent to which an enterprise or a nation uses its installed [[productive capacity]]. It is the relationship between [[output (economics)|output]] that ''is'' produced with the installed equipment, and the potential output which ''could'' be produced with it, if capacity was fully used.

==Engineering and economic measures==
One of the most used definitions of the "capacity utilization rate" is the ratio of actual output to the [[potential output]]. But potential output can be defined in at least two different ways.

===Engineering definition===
One is the "engineering" or "technical" definition, according to which potential output represents the maximum amount of output that can be produced in the short-run with the existent stock of capital. Thus, a standard definition of capacity utilization is the (weighted) average of the ratios between the actual output of firms to the maximum that could be produced per unit of time, with existing plant and equipment (see Johanson 1968). Obviously, "output" could be measured in physical units or in market values, but normally it is measured in market values.

However, as output increases and well before the absolute physical limit of production is reached, most firms might well experience an increase in the average cost of production—even if there is no change in the level of plant &amp; equipment used. For example, higher average costs can arise, because of the need to operate extra shifts, to undertake additional plant maintenance, and so on.

===Economic definition===
An alternative approach, sometimes called the "economic" utilization rate, is, therefore, to measure the ratio of actual output to the level of output ''beyond which the average cost of production begins to rise''. In this case, surveyed firms are asked by how much it would be practicable for them to raise production from existing plant and equipment, ''without raising unit costs'' (see Berndt &amp; Morrison 1981). Typically, this measure will yield a rate around 10 percentage points higher than the "engineering" measure, but time series show the same movement over time.

===Measurement===
[[File:Harddatafredgraph.png|thumb|Capacity utilization (black line) in manufacture in the United States, [[unemployment rate]] (red line, upside down, scale on the right), [[employment rate]] (dotted line)]]
[[File:KapaAuslUSABRDEngl.png|thumb|Capacity utilization in [[manufacturing]] in the [[Germany|FRG]] and in the USA]]
In [[economic statistics]], capacity utilization is normally surveyed for goods-producing industries at plant level. The results are presented as an average percentage rate by industry and economy-wide, where 100% denotes full capacity. This rate is also sometimes called the "operating rate". If the operating rate is high, this is called "full capacity", while if the operating rate is low, a situation of "excess capacity" or "surplus capacity" exists. The observed rates are often turned into indices. Capacity utilization is much more difficult to measure for service industries.

There has been some debate among economists about the validity of statistical measures of capacity utilization, because much depends on the survey questions asked, and on the valuation principles used to measure output. Also, the efficiency of production may change over time, due to new technologies.

For example, [[Michael Perelman]] has argued in his 1989 book ''[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]], Investment Theory and the Economic Slowdown: The Role of Replacement Investment and q-Ratios'' that the US [[Federal Reserve Board]] measure is just not very revealing. Prior to the early 1980s, he argues, American business carried a great deal of extra capacity. At that time, running close to 80% would indicate that a plant was approaching capacity restraints. Since that time, however, firms scrapped much of their most inefficient capacity. As a result, a modern 77% capacity utilization now would be equivalent to a historical level of 70%.

==Economic significance==
If market demand grows, capacity utilization will rise. If demand weakens, capacity utilization will slacken. Economists and bankers often watch capacity utilization indicators for signs of inflation pressures.

It is often believed that when the utilization rate rises above somewhere between 82% and 85%, price inflation will increase. Excess capacity means that insufficient demand exists to warrant expansion of output. 

All else constant, the lower capacity utilization falls (relative to the trend capacity utilization rate), the better the [[bond market]] likes it. Bondholders view strong capacity utilization (above the trend rate) as a leading indicator of higher [[inflation]]. Higher inflation—or the expectation of higher inflation—decreases bond prices, often prompting a higher yield to compensate for the higher expected rate of inflation.

Implicitly, the capacity utilization rate is also an indicator of how efficiently the [[factors of production]] are being used. Much statistical and anecdotal evidence shows that many industries in the developed capitalist economies suffer from ''chronic'' excess capacity. Critics of market [[capitalism]], therefore, argue the system is not as efficient as it may seem, since at least 1/5 more output could be produced and sold, if buying power was better distributed. However, a level of utilization somewhat below the maximum typically prevails, regardless of economic conditions.

===Modern business cycle theory===
The notion of capacity utilization was introduced into modern [[business cycle]] theory by Greenwood, [[Hercowitz]], and Huffman (1988). They illustrated how capacity utilization is important for getting business cycle correlations in economic models to match the data when there are shocks to [[investment spending]].

==Output gap percentage formula==
As a derivative indicator, the "output gap percentage" (%OG) can be measured as the gap between actual output (AO) and potential output (PO) ''divided'' by potential output and ''multiplied'' by 100%:

:%OG = [(AO – PO)/PO] × 100%.

==FRB and ISM utilization indexes==
In the survey of plant capacity used by the US [[Federal Reserve Board]] for the FRB capacity utilization index, firms are asked about "the maximum level of production that this establishment could reasonably expect to attain under normal and realistic operating conditions, fully utilizing the machinery and equipment in place." 

By contrast, the [[Institute of Supply Management]] (ISM) index asks respondents to measure their current output relative to "normal capacity", and this yields a utilization rate, which is between 4 and 10 percentage points higher than the FRB measure. Again, the time series show more or less the same historical movement.

==Data==
The average economy-wide capacity utilization rate in the US since 1967 was about 81.6%, according to the Federal Reserve measure. The figure for Europe is not much different, for Japan being only slightly higher.

The average utilization rate of installed productive capacity in industry, in some major areas of the world, was estimated in 2003/2004 to be as follows (rounded figures):

===Average utilization rate===
* United States 79.5% (April 2008 — Federal Reserve measure)
* Japan 83–86% (Bank of Japan)
* European Union 82% (Bank of Spain estimate)
* Australia 80% (National Bank estimate)
* Brazil 60–80% (various sources)
* India 70% (Hindu business line)
* China perhaps 60% (various sources)
* Turkey 79.8% (September 2008 — [[Turkish Statistical Institute]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=2051 |title=Turkish Statistical Institute |publisher=Turkstat.gov.tr |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22260">'''Central Atlanta Progress''' (CAP), founded in 1941, as the Central Area Improvement Association, is a private, not-for-profit corporation, chartered to plan and promote Atlanta's Central Area, that strives to create a robust economic climate for downtown [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in the [[United States]].

CAP was formed by a merger of the Central Atlanta Improvement Association with the Uptown Association on January 1, 1967.

Central Atlanta Progress (CAP) defines the central area as the central core of Atlanta bounded by the railroad cordon from West End on the south to Brookwood on the north and Boulevard on the east to Vine City on the west.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Celebration of People and Progress, Central Atlanta Progress 20th Anniversary,|last=|first=|publisher=Central Atlanta Progress, Inc.|year=1967|isbn=|location=Atlanta|pages=2, 14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The membership of CAP consists of the chief executives of approximately major corporations and property owners in Central Atlanta, The Board of Directors includes business leaders from the Atlanta area.  CAP is funded through the investment of businesses and institutions.

== First Central Area Study ==

The first '''Central Area Study''' of the city of Atlanta was performed by Central Atlanta Progress. Completed in 1971, the first Central Area Study (CAS I) dealt with the  areas of economic development, transport, housing, urban design, public safety, human services, and marketing.  The study focused on transport conditions and related land use and urban design in the areas proximate to downtown and midtown in Atlanta.  The idea that attracted press attention was the "four level Peachtree corridor" concept which would have buried the vehicular travel along Peachtree Street below the surface of the current road.

=== Study Recommendations ===
The Study states

{{quote|The Goal of this study is to recommend policies, plans, programs, and projects which will permit the study area - Central Atlanta - to reinforce its role as:
* Capitol [sic] of Georgia, and center of the metropolitan region;
* The cultural, educational, business, and transport center of the Southeast; -The focal point of a national and emerging international city; and
* A model in the field of improved human relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study|last =|first =|publisher = Central Area Policy Committee|date = March 12, 1971|isbn =|location =|pages = 4|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the study was written, freeway (and tollway) mileage within the city was expected to be significantly more than it became. Among the abandoned highways were an [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]] separate from the [[Downtown Connector]] by the construction of a west-side freeway, construction of [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|I-485]] as an east-side parallel to the connector, extension of the [[Lakewood Freeway]], and construction of the [[Stone Mountain Freeway|Stone Mountain Expressway]] and its symmetrical sister, the South Cobb Expressway to relieve [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] northwest of the central business district. Fifty specific local surface street improvements were also recommended, at a cost of $69 million (of the total of $326 million in improvements recommended by the study.)

The writers of the first Central Area Study appreciated that it was unreasonable to expect that the streets and parking lots of the Central Business District (CBD) would be sufficient to accommodate every automobile whose occupants' desired to travel there.  Therefore, the study strongly supported the construction of the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] heavy-rail system as one of the means to "intercept the automobile." As recommended by the first Central Area Study, the MARTA referendum was passed in November 1971.

Also part of this interception idea was a people-mover system designed to link some of the key interception points with downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study I "Intercepting the Automobile"|last =|first =|publisher = Central Atlanta Progress|year = 1971|isbn =|location =|pages = 34|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution system was imagined as an above ground, above vehicular right-of-ways, fixed guideway system.

CAS I saw the construction of MARTA rail as an extraordinary opportunity to accomplish several goals. The first of these was to impact land use around the rail stations in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]], [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], and the [[Atlanta|City of Atlanta]]. "Land use plans, zoning and subdivision regulations should be altered to encourage high density residential and commercial development around the stations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study I "Affecting Traffic By Public Policy"|last =|first =|publisher = Central Area Progress|year = 1971|isbn =|location = Atlanta, Georgia|pages = 38|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second opportunity brought about by the construction, and its inconvenience, was to simultaneously rebuild Peachtree Street as a four level transport corridor. This "Peachtree Promenade" would have converted the existing level of Peachtree Street to a pedestrian mall, with fountains and other urban design amenities. On the level immediately below the existing street, north-south vehicular traffic would run. Beneath this north-south spine would be two functions, east-west roadways on a separate grade from [[Peachtree Street|Peachtree]], and the concourses for the MARTA stations. On the third below ground level would be MARTA rail lines. "The construction of the MARTA line along Peachtree will indeed be disruptive for a short time. However, the exploitation of the singular opportunity which this construction presents will result in a more efficient and attractive system of coping with the future. ... Failure to move boldly in this direction would be inexcusable." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study I "Peachtree Promenade"|last =|first =|publisher = Central Area Progress|year = 1971|isbn =|location = Atlanta, Georgia|pages = 42|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the MARTA line was built, and Peachtree remained a vehicular street with at grade intersections.

Other specific Urban Design projects recommended by CAS I included the creation of a multilevel Five Points Park and development of pedestrian malls on Broad Street and on Alabama Street. The study also performed an investigation into the area called "Railroad Gulch" which corresponds to the area just south of the [[Five Points station|Five Points]] area. For this area, the study recommended formulation of a three level movement system, involving pedestrian walkways and air-rights construction over the railroad lines and the MARTA station.

As with most planning studies, CASwas predicated on demographic forecasts, noted in the table.  The forecasts anticipated too much growth in the central area as opposed to the rest of the Atlanta region. In particular, the amount of office space and the number of employees in downtown was overstated by a significant factor. The cities used as a model for the planners in the Central Area Study were older more urban cities rather than the newer suburban form of faster growing cities in the southern and western US.

=== Study Adoption ===
At the time of the first Central Area Study, the CAP Policy Committee consisted of: [[Sam Massell]], Mayor of the City of Atlanta; [[Wyche Fowler]], Alderman; Ira Jackson, Alderman; Wade Mitchell, Alderman; Mills Lane, Chairman of Citizens and Southern Bank; and [[John C. Portman Jr.|John Portman]], President of Central Atlanta Progress.  The Study Director was Robert Leary, the advisor was Robert Bivens, and the secretary was Collier Gladdin, who was Planning Director of the City of Atlanta.

On March 25, 1972, the first Central Area Study was delivered to the Aldermen of the City of Atlanta. Collier Gladdin, moved to achieve quick adoption of this program, which proposed to spend $326.7 million over 23 years to improve access and circulation in the central area of Atlanta. Gladdin did not want this to become another dust-gathering  report, he said "We're going to keep it alive." The study itself cost $200,000 and was funded by the United States Department of Transportation, the City of Atlanta, and Central Atlanta Progress, Inc., and was developed under the guidance of an urban planner, Robert M. Leary, hired as study director, with the assistance of an eight member team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Report Sets Cost for Malls, Parks|last=|first=|date=1972-03-26|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 18A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th of March, Alderman Wyche Fowler, while discussing the plan, stated that no group will ever adopt the plan to rebuild downtown in toto, but that they may approve it as a guide to development.

The idea that had grabbed the attention was the concept of a Four Level Peachtree Street, which had walkways for pedestrians, a rapid transit corridor, and streets for vehicle traffic, as well as automobile interceptor lots on the edge of the study area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Central Area Plan Hearing Delayed|last=Coffin|first=Alex|date=1972-03-30|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 3b|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, John Portman was the President of Central Atlanta Progress, and one of the leading participants in the study. In April 1972, he boasted that Atlanta was one of under a handful of American cities which had a chance to solve its problems. He said "The Central Study can be one of the greatest tools in our history, if we'll only work together to make it happen, and now is the time to start." In the article appearing that day, the Constitution, in its usual manner of accurate reporting, increased the cost of the study to $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Atlanta Can Solve Problems With Growth Plan - Portman|last=|first=|date=1972-04-07|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 15B|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring of 1972 was also the time that new officers were elected to the Board of Directors of CAP. Portman rival [[Tom Cousins|Thomas Cousins]], developer of the off-Peachtree Omni complex, was made 1st Vice President.

A public hearing in late April  was held to discuss the proposed plan, at which there was much discord over the proposal, with demagoguery reaching such heights that one speaker called it "an expensive and totally inappropriate tombstone to a city that committed suicide." The opponents were led by Kathryn Thompson, chair of the Virginia-Highlands Action Committee, and consisted of many environmentalists. It is worth noting that the plan would have converted over 15 square miles of Central Atlanta into pedestrian malls and parks if it had been fully implemented.  Citizen complainants maintained that the Study would not solve the "traffic mess", that there should be more mass transit, that it "Paves Atlanta" when it should "Save Atlanta", that there was no citizen involvement in the plan, only reaction, that the money should be used for neighborhood parks, and that the urban design restrictions were too lax. Those endorsing the Central Area Study were a diverse sample of the planning community including Larry Gellerstadt who was President of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, a Vice President of MARTA, a representative of the state DOT, and a city Traffic Engineer, Clyde Robbins,  a Vice President of Georgia Tech, and Steve Fuller, the chair of Underground Atlanta in its previous incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Speakers Attack Plan to Rebuild Downtown|last=Coffin|first=Alex|date=1972-04-27|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 17A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voting to delay the approval or disapproval of the plan for two weeks on the sixteenth of October, the council avoided making a potentially controversial decision. This move disagreed with project supporter and member of the study's policy committee, Alderman Wyche Fowler, so much that he said "I don't think political pussyfooting on the part of some aldermen is going to win the day." The aldermen he was referring to were Chuck Driebe and Buddy Fowlkes, who offered an amendment that would receive the study as a guide for development with "no designated priorities", and subject to modification after the release of the then upcoming Atlanta Regional Commission's Regional Transportation Plan. Alderman Wade Mitchell moved to change the words "receive the plan" to "approve the plan", at which point Driebe moved to table the bill. Fowler, clearly unhappy with Driebe over this and other issues, said "Driebe knows additional language is superfluous and meaningless. I hope that any members of the board who do not feel that this is a unique study by both the public and the private sector that provides us a chance to channel our growth in an orderly fashion will have the guts to say so." The issue underlying approval of the Central Area Study and causing all of the nastiness was the charter revision, over which Driebe and Fowler had disagreements. Another reason for the opposition was because of the suggestion of the  construction of tollways through inner city areas. Aldermen Panke Bradley, Nick Lambros, and Chuck Driebe introduced legislation calling on the state of Georgia to stop tollway planning until the Atlanta Regional Commission prepared and the aldermanic council approved an alternative to the regional transport problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Aldermen Put Off Mid-City Study Vote|last=Linthicum|first=Tom|date=1972-10-17|work=Atlanta Constitution, p15A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fourth of November, the Atlanta Constitution published an editorial; it said in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;we hope that the aldermen will adopt it as a guideline for the future. We would emphasize that action by the board would not commit the city or the aldermanic board to any specific project or priority of the Central Area Study. But it would commit the city to principles of sound planning for the future, whatever detailed decisions have to be made later. We think that is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Central City - Editorial|last=Editorial staff|first=|date=1972-11-04|work=Atlanta Constitution, p.4A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Aldermen finally approved the Central Area Study on November 7, 1972. Mayor Sam Massell proposed a compromise measure of which he said "Such approval does not carry with it or imply the prior approval of any specific program or project which is proposed or might be represented to implement said plan." and "Each individual improvement contained in this report must meet the test of careful study at the appropriate time to determine its applicability, financial feasibility, and impact prior to being submitted to the effected committee of the mayor and Board of Aldermen."

After this compromise was introduced, only Alderman Cecil Turner voted against the substitute resolution, because he wanted to substitute for accepting the study a statement which called the study "an acceptable statement of plans and goals for downtown Atlanta.  Alderman Fowler called Turner's proposal "legal jabberwocky designed to delay, frustrate and hinder the planning process."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Aldermen OK Central Area Study|last=Linthicum|first=Tom|date=1972-11-07|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 6A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Central Area Study ==

Cochaired by Mayor [[Andrew Young]], Jim Edwards, and Frank Carter, the second Central Area Study (CAS II) was begun in the fall of 1985 and completed in 1987. Like the first study, CAS II was a joint effort with the [[Atlanta|City of Atlanta]] and [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]].  The policy board guiding the study was divided into seven task forces dealing with strategic planning, conventions and tourism, transport and infrastructure, recreation and the  arts, public safety, retail and commercial, and housing. "The primary goal of CAS II is the creation of both the image and reality of Atlanta as a safe and clean city" &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and "The top priority of CAS II is to make the Central Area more livable and inviting to people." &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Central Atlanta Study ll A Plan for Atlanta's future|last=|first=|publisher=Central Atlanta Progress, Inc|year=1987|isbn=|location=Atlanta, Georgia|pages=4, 6, 18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Central Area Study promoted what it called "Pedestrian Peachtree", and said "We want buildings and public spaces designed so that they are hospitable to people. We want retail shops to face the sidewalks so that people are invited in, not shops buried deep within buildings that turn their backs on pedestrians and visitors." This last point is clearly aimed at John Portman's [[Peachtree Center]] complex which has very little street frontage of shops, but has an indoor mall. The idea of the Pedestrian Peachtree is a similar but scaled down version of what was proposed in the first Central Area Study.

CAS II proposed the creation of a Central Atlanta Retail Association. Three issues were to be the focus of this organization: maintenance of the environment, attracting shoppers, and recruiting and retaining desirable retail merchants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Along with a retail association, the study advocated better marketing of downtown, with the creation of a marketing association which would merchandise downtown attractions, create a central information center, and improve signage. Along with this, entertainment facilities are to be clustered in certain districts of the central area. The CARA was also charged with the maintenance of downtown. This means that it is to be responsible for coordinating the repair of sidewalks, waste disposal, and general cleanliness.

The task force on housing maintained that if Atlanta were to remain a 24 hour city, it would have to attract upper and middle income housing. A coordinating agency for housing development, Housing Urban Design Assistance Team (HUDAT), was proposed, although whether the agency was to be new or an already existing agency was undecided.

Making Atlanta a "clean and safe city" was one of the priorities of the study, and to meet this goal, it proposed that the central police zone be reconstituted to include Midtown as well as downtown. This proposal met with some controversy because it essentially proposed making a safe downtown more important than other areas, offending those in other areas.

Funding would be accomplished by the steering of public and private incentives to achieve certain goals. This would be used in particular for promotion of downtown housing and better urban design.

"The focus of CAS I, completed in 1971, was on improving transport and circulation in Central Atlanta." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These recommendations, including, making Spring Street and West Peachtree one-way pairs, improving the interstate system, and the construction of a heavy-rail MARTA system, were generally implemented. CASII suggested further transport improvements, in particular benefitting pedestrian flow, including the creation of pedestrian malls and  reducing vehicle-pedestrian conflictual interaction.

The fundamental difference between the two Central Atlanta Studies was not any particular recommendations. It is rather, that the first study focused on concrete achievable goals, the most important of which were achieved, while the second study much more heavily emphasized human resource type goals, whose success will be harder to measure and see.&lt;ref&gt;The idea is from Paul Kelman, Vice President of Central Atlanta Progress.&lt;/ref&gt; Improving safety, better marketing of downtown retail, and the creation of a "24 Hour City" are for the most part only able to be successful if they are perceived to be successful. From the point of view of downtown merchants, increased police will not have helped unless people feel safer, and spend more time downtown.

== Atlanta Downtown Improvement District ==
The '''Atlanta Downtown Improvement District''' (ADID), founded in 1995 by CAP, is a [[public-private partnership]] that strives to create a livable environment for Downtown Atlanta. With a Board of Directors of nine private and public-sector leaders, ADID is funded through a community improvement district within which commercial property owners pay special assessments.

According to their mission statements, Central Atlanta Progress and the Atlanta Downtown Improvement District are committed to a downtown for the diverse Atlanta community, including property owners, employees, residents, students and visitors.

Archives of Central Atlanta Progress are available at the [[Atlanta History Center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1393">The '''Daniel Pennock Democracy School''' teaches citizens and activists how to use democratic processes through people’s constitutional rights to confront corporate wrongdoing (such as by opposing [[toxic]] dumps, quarries, [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], etc.). In addition it explores the limits of conventional regulatory organizing and offers a new organizing model that helps citizens confront the usurpation by corporations of the rights of communities, people, and the earth.

It is dedicated to the memory of Daniel Pennock, a 17-year-old boy from [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]], who died in 1995 after being exposed involuntarily to land applied [[sewage sludge]].

'''Domingo Bartolomé Francisco Matheu''' (4 August 1765, in Barcelona, Spain &amp;ndash; 28 March 1831, in Buenos Aires, Argentina) was a Spanish-born Argentine businessman and politician.  He was a member of the [[Primera Junta]], the first national government of modern Argentina, and the second president in the end of the [[Junta Grande]] from August to September 1811.

== Biography ==
Domingo Bartolomé Francisco Matheu was born in August 4, 1765, in [[Mataró]]. His parents were Juan Pablo José Benito Matheu Ros and Antonia Xicola. He studied in the school "Pías" of Mataró, and then focused in math and naval studies. He became a pilot, and visited other Spanish territories as [[La Habana]], [[Philippines]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1791, and opposed the trade regulations of the time. He sought both economic and political support among the local society.&lt;ref&gt;National..., pp. 303-304&lt;/ref&gt;

Matheu joined the Regiment of Miñones during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. He was appointed lieutenant of the second company, under the command of [[Juan Larrea (politician)|Juan Larrea]]. On August 19, 1806, a few days after the liberation of Buenos Aires from British rule, Matheu, Larrea and other neighbours requested authorization to create a new military unit, "Urbanos Voluntarios de Cataluña". Viceroy [[Santiago de Liniers]] approved it on September 26. As Larrea got ill, Matheu led this unit during the second British attack in 1807. He retired from the combats in Miserere, and waged [[urban warfare]] from the buildings of the city. He was awarded by a Real Order in January 1809 for his role in the defense of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;National..., p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peninsular War]] in Spain, along with the capture of the king [[Ferdinand VII]] and the fall of the [[Junta of Seville]], escalated political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the [[May Revolution]]. Several criollos thought that the viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]], appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an [[open cabildo]] to discuss it. Azcuénaga attended it, and voted for the creation of a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]] with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. The reasons of Matheu's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between [[carlotism|Carlotists]], [[Martín de Álzaga|Alzaguists]], the military and the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 43-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The May Revolution began the [[Argentine War of Independence]], which was complicated by the lack of weapons in the country. Without enough resources to buy them, the [[Primera Junta]] established armories. The first director, Juan Taragona, was soon replaced by Matheu. Working alongside German gunsmiths as Juan Frye and Fernando Lamping, he directed the creation of several muskets and some pieces of artillery. The armory of Buenos Aires, located at the site of the modern [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Palace of Justice]], had only 90 employees, including seven slaves and seven natives. They had limited technical knowledge, but managed to build and repair nearly three hundred muskets and a hundred of carbines. Matheu gave financial support to the armory with his own wealth. [[Eduard Ladislas Kaunitz, baron von Holmberg|Eduard Holmberg]] was appointed director in 1813, replacing Matheu, but Matheu kept working for the armory anyway. He supervised as well the armory of the [[Tucumán Province]]. He directed later the manufacture of military uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;National..., pp. 305-307&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of Cisneros following the [[May Revolution]] he was designated vocal of the [[Primera Junta]]. The Primera Junta became the [[Junta Grande]] afterwards, and Matheu was designated its president when [[Cornelio Saavedra]] left it to join the battles in the north. Matheu and Larrea supported the national government with the money they obtained from commerce.

He retired from political life in 1817, staying just in commercial activities until his death in 1831.

== Legacy ==
Domingo Matheu led the first armory of Argentina. General [[Manuel Nicolás Savio]] organized the construction of an arsenal in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], named after Matheu. The cornerstone was placed on October 3, 1942, and worked for many decades. The place was used as a detention center during the [[Dirty War]] in the 1970s.

{{Accounting}}
'''Double-entry bookkeeping''',  in [[accounting]], is a system of [[bookkeeping]] so named because every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. The double entry has two equal and corresponding sides known as [[debits and credits|debit and credit]]. The left-hand side is debit and right-hand side is credit. For instance, recording a sale of $100 might require two entries: a debit of $100 to an account named "Cash" and a credit of $100 to an account named "Revenue."{{Explain |Reason='Revenue' is not in the balance sheet accounting equation described below.|date=August 2017}}

The [[accounting equation]]

&lt;math&gt;\text{Assets} = \text{Equity} + \text{Liabilities} &lt;/math&gt;

is an error detection tool; if at any point the sum of debits for all accounts does not equal the corresponding sum of credits for all accounts, an error has occurred. However, satisfying the equation does not guarantee that there are no errors; the ledger may still "balance" even if the wrong [[ledger]] accounts have been debited or credited.

== History ==
{{Main article|Accounting}}
Double-entry bookkeeping was pioneered in the Jewish community of the early-medieval Middle East.&lt;ref&gt; Parker, L. M., “Medieval Traders as International Change Agents: A Comparison
With Twentieth Century International Accounting Firms,” The Accounting
Historians Journal, 16(2) (1989): 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jewish bankers in Old Cairo, for example, used a double-entry bookkeeping system which predated the known usage of such a form in Italy, and whose records remain from the 11th century AD. It has been hypothesized that Italian merchants likely learned the method from their interaction with medieval Jewish merchants from the Middle East, however this question remains an area for further research. &lt;ref&gt;''MEDIEVAL TRADERS AS INTERNATIONAL CHANGE AGENTS: A COMMENT'', Michael Scorgie, The Accounting Historians Journal, Vol. 21, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 137-143&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest European record of a complete double-entry system is the ''Messari'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Treasurer]]'s) accounts of the [[Republic of Genoa]] in 1340. The ''Messari'' accounts contain debits and credits journalised in a [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] form, and include balances carried forward from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a double-entry system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lauwers |first=Luc |last2=Willekens |first2=Marleen |title=Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli |journal=Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management |publisher=Katholieke Universiteit Leuven |year=1994 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=289–304 [p. 300] |url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf |issn=0772-7674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 15th century, the bankers and merchants of [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]] and [[Lübeck]] used this system widely.

However, the double-entry accounting method was said to be developed independently earlier in Korea during the [[Goryeo dynasty]] (918–1392) when [[Kaesong]] was a center of trade and industry at that time. The ''Four-element bookkeeping system'' was said to be originated in the 11th or 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://sjeas.skku.edu/upload/200707/87-114Owen%20Miller.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Reporting in the Pacific Asia Region edited by Ronald Ma&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Global History of Accounting, Financial Reporting and Public Policy: Asia ... By Gary John Previts, Peter Wolnizer&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant accounting records that follow the modern double-entry system in Europe come from [[Amatino Manucci]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] merchant at the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778 |first=Geoffrey A. |last=Lee |year=1977 |title=The Coming of Age of Double Entry: The Giovanni Farolfi Ledger of 1299-1300 |journal=Accounting Historians Journal |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=79–95 |jstor=40697544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manucci was employed by the Farolfi firm and the firm's ledger of 1299-1300 evidences full double-entry bookkeeping. Giovannino Farolfi &amp; Company, a firm of [[Florence|Florentine]] merchants  headquartered in [[Nîmes]], acted as [[moneylender]]s to the [[Archbishop of Arles]], their most important customer.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1977), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sources{{which|date=August 2014}} suggest that [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]] introduced this method for the [[Medici bank]] in the 14th century.

[[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] economist [[Benedetto Cotrugli]]'s 1458 treatise ''[[Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto]]'' contained the earliest known description of a double-entry bookkeeping system, but his manuscript was not officially published until 1573.&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et22a1.html|title=History of Croatian|first=Darko|last=Zubrinic|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIESC 2007 in CROATIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html|title=SIESC Croatia 2|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luca Pacioli]], a [[Franciscan friar]] and collaborator of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], first codified the system in his [[mathematics]] [[textbook]] ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalità]]'' published in [[Venice]] in 1494.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacioli is often called the "father of accounting" because he was the first to publish a detailed description of the double-entry system, thus enabling others to study and use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basicaccountinghelp.com/bookkeeping-instructions-from-the-mid-fifteenth-century/|title=La Riegola de Libro, Bookkeeping instructions from the mid-fifteenth century|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229112252/http://basicaccountinghelp.com/bookkeeping-instructions-from-the-mid-fifteenth-century/|archive-date=29 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Livio |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The Golden Ratio|publisher=Broadway Books |year=2002 |location=New York |pages=130–131 |isbn=0-7679-0816-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41582244 |title=Is this the most influential work in the history of capitalism? |date=23 October 2017 |access-date=23 October 2017 |website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pre-modern]] Europe, double-entry bookkeeping had theological and cosmological connotations, recalling "both [[Lady Justice|the scales of justice]] and the symmetry of God's world".&lt;ref&gt;

== Accounting entries ==

In the double-entry accounting system, at least two accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts. Recording of a debit amount to one or more accounts and an equal credit amount to one or more accounts results in total debits being equal to total credits for all accounts in the general ledger. If the accounting entries are recorded without error, the aggregate balance of all accounts having ''Debit'' balances will be equal to the aggregate balance of all accounts having ''Credit'' balances. Accounting entries that [[debit and credit]] related accounts typically include the same date and identifying code in both accounts, so that in case of error, each debit and credit can be traced back to a journal and transaction source document, thus preserving an [[audit trail]]. The accounting entries are recorded in the "Books of Accounts". Regardless of which accounts and how many are impacted by a given transaction, the fundamental accounting equation of ''assets equal liabilities plus capital'' will hold.

==Approaches==
There are two different ways to memorize the effects of debits and credits on accounts in the double entry system of bookkeeping. They are the Traditional Approach and the Accounting Equation Approach. Irrespective of the approach used, the effect on the books of accounts remains the same, with two aspects (debit and credit) in each of the transactions.

===Traditional approach===
Following the Traditional Approach (also called the British Approach) accounts are classified as real, personal, and nominal accounts.&lt;ref name="V.2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajasekaran V.|title=Financial Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qP3XNPoLO7wC&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=1 September 2011|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-3180-2|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real accounts are accounts relating to assets and liabilities including the capital account of the owners. Personal accounts are accounts relating to persons or organisations with whom the business has transactions and will mainly consist of accounts of debtors and creditors. Nominal accounts are revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Transactions are entered in the books of accounts by applying the following golden rules of accounting:
# Real account: Debit what comes in and credit what goes out.
# Personal account: Debit the receiver and credit the giver.
# Nominal account: Debit all expenses &amp; losses and credit all incomes &amp; gains&lt;ref name="nadu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Accountancy: Higher Secondary First Year|year=2004|publisher=Tamil Nadu Textbooks Corporation|pages=28–34|url=http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/11/Std11-Acct-EM.pdf|edition=First|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyans1916"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward M. Hyans|title=Theory of accounts for accountant students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=7 April 2012|year=1916|publisher=Universal Business Institute, Inc.|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounting equation approach===
This approach is also called the American approach. Under this approach transactions are recorded based on the accounting equation, i.e., Assets = Liabilities + Capital.&lt;ref name="V.2011"/&gt; The accounting equation is a statement of equality between the debits and the credits. The rules of debit and credit depend on the nature of an account. For the purpose of the accounting equation approach, all the accounts are classified into the following five types: assets, liabilities, income/revenues, expenses, or capital gains/losses.

If there is an increase or decrease in a set of accounts, there will be equal decrease or increase in another set of accounts. Accordingly, the following rules of debit and credit hold for the various categories of accounts:
# Assets Accounts: debit entry represents an increase in assets and a credit entry represents a decrease in assets.
# Capital Account: credit entry represents an increase in capital and a debit entry represents a decrease in capital.
# Liabilities Accounts: credit entry represents an increase in liabilities and a debit entry represents a decrease in liabilities.
# Revenues or Incomes Accounts: credit entry represents an increase in incomes and gains, and debit entry represents a decrease in incomes and gains.
# Expenses or Losses Accounts: debit entry represents an increase in expenses and losses, and credit entry represents a decrease in expenses and losses.
These five rules help learning about accounting entries and also are comparable with traditional (British) accounting rules.

== Books of accounts == 
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Each [[financial transaction]] is recorded in at least two different nominal ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the general ledger, i.e. the accounts balance. This is a partial check that each and every transaction has been correctly recorded. The transaction is recorded as a "debit entry" (Dr) in one account, and a "credit entry" (Cr) in a second account. The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a general ledger account, and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a general ledger account. If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a debit balance.

Double entry is used only in nominal ledgers. It is not used in [[Bookkeeping#Daybooks|daybooks]] (journals), which normally do not form part of the nominal ledger system. The information from the daybooks will be used in the nominal ledger and it is the nominal ledgers that will ensure the integrity of the resulting financial information created from the daybooks (provided that the information recorded in the daybooks is correct).

The reason for this is to limit the number of entries in the nominal ledger: entries in the daybooks can be totalled before they are entered in the nominal ledger. If there are only a relatively small number of transactions it may be simpler instead to treat the daybooks as an integral part of the nominal ledger and thus of the double-entry system.

However, as can be seen from the examples of daybooks shown below, it is still necessary to check, within each daybook, that the postings from the daybook balance.

The double entry system uses nominal ledger accounts. From these nominal ledger accounts a [[trial balance]] can be created. The trial balance lists all the nominal ledger account balances. The list is split into two columns, with debit balances placed in the left hand column and credit balances placed in the right hand column. Another column will contain the name of the nominal ledger account describing what each value is for. The total of the debit column must equal the total of the credit column.

==Debits and credits==
{{main article|Debits and credits}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Double-entry bookkeeping is governed by the [[accounting equation]]. If revenue equals expenses, the following (basic) equation must be true:

:''assets = liabilities + equity''

For the accounts to remain in balance, a change in one account must be matched with a change in another account. These changes are made by [[debits and credits]] to the accounts. Note that the usage of these terms in accounting is not identical to their everyday usage. Whether one uses a debit or credit to increase or decrease an account depends on the [[normal balance]] of the account. Assets, Expenses, and Drawings accounts (on the left side of the equation) have a normal balance of ''debit''. Liability, Revenue, and Capital accounts (on the right side of the equation) have a normal balance of ''credit''. On a [[general ledger]], debits are recorded on the left side and credits on the right side for each account. Since the accounts must always balance, for each transaction there will be a debit made to one or several accounts and a credit made to one or several accounts. The sum of all debits made in each day's transactions must equal the sum of all credits in those transactions. After a series of transactions, therefore, the sum of all the accounts with a debit balance will equal the sum of all the accounts with a credit balance.

Debits and credits are numbers recorded as follows:
* ''Debits'' are recorded on the left side of a [[Debits and credits#T-accounts|T account]] in a ledger. Debits increase balances in asset accounts and expense accounts and decrease balances in liability accounts, revenue accounts, and capital accounts.
* ''Credits'' are recorded on the right side of a T account in a ledger. Credits increase balances in liability accounts, revenue accounts, and capital accounts, and decrease balances in asset accounts and expense accounts.
* ''Debit accounts'' are asset and expense accounts that usually have debit balances, i.e. the total debits usually exceed the total credits in each debit account.
* ''Credit accounts'' are revenue (income, gains) accounts and liability accounts that usually have credit balances.

The mnemonic '''DEADCLIC''' is used to help remember the effect of debit or credit transactions on the relevant accounts. '''DEAD''': '''D'''ebit to increase '''E'''xpense, '''A'''sset and '''D'''rawing accounts and '''CLIC''': '''C'''redit to increase '''L'''iability, '''I'''ncome and '''C'''apital accounts.

The account types are related as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
current equity = sum of equity changes across time (increases on the left side are debits, and increases on the right side are credits, and vice versa for decreases)&lt;br /&gt;
current equity = Assets - Liabilities&lt;br /&gt;
sum of equity changes across time = owner's investment (Capital above) + Revenues - Expenses

He is a resident in [[London]].&lt;ref name="aif"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slobodyan|first1=Yelena|title=Кто такой украинский миллиардер Шифрин, который получил гражданство России?|url=http://www.aif.ru/dontknows/file/kto_takoy_ukrainskiy_milliarder_shifrin_kotoryy_poluchil_grazhdanstvo_rossii|accessdate=6 June 2017|work=[[Argumenty i Fakty]]|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Shifrin was born in [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], the son of [[metallurgy]] professor  Vladimir Moiseyevich Shifrin.&lt;ref name="aif"/&gt; From 1977–1983, he attended the [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]], earning a PhD in metallurgy. Over the next 10 years, he worked in [[Zaporizhia]] at the steel company [[Dniprospecstal]], rising from assistant foreman to manager of the steel plant and then head of marketing.&lt;ref name="aif"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wjc"/&gt;  He then rose to prominence as a [[business oligarch]] in newly independent Ukraine, taking control of privatised steelmaker [[Zaporizhstal]]. He co-founded, with [[Alex Shnaider|Alexander Shnaider]], [[Midland Group]], a holding company headquartered in [[Guernsey]] that embraces interests in steel (including Zaporizhstal, Ukraine's fourth largest steel mill), shipping, real estate, agriculture and sports. Together they own a share in [[Trump Tower Toronto]] and formerly owned [[Maccabi Tel Aviv]] and a [[Formula One]] team, [[Midland F1 Racing]].&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Eduard Shifrin|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/eduard-shifrin/|accessdate=6 June 2017|work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Shnaider were best friends since childhood, as their fathers were best friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Министр транспорта евгений червоненко: «я не виноват, что мой друг детства эдуард шифрин — один из владельцев «запорожстали», а я остался женей червоненко»|url=http://fakty.ua/57748-ministr-transporta-evgenij-chervonenko-quot-ya-ne-vinovat-chto-moj-drug-detstva-eduard-shifrin---odin-iz-vladelcev-quot-zaporozhstali-quot-a-ya-ostalsya-zhenej-chervonenko-quot|accessdate=6 June 2017|work=[[Argumenty i Fakty]]|date=4 June 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027193809/http://fakty.ua/57748-ministr-transporta-evgenij-chervonenko-quot-ya-ne-vinovat-chto-moj-drug-detstva-eduard-shifrin---odin-iz-vladelcev-quot-zaporozhstali-quot-a-ya-ostalsya-zhenej-chervonenko-quot|archive-date=27 October 2016|language=ru|quote=I've been friends with Shifrin since birth.

In 1991 he completed his Phd in metallurgy. In 2006, together with his late father, he published a booked titled The Theory of Metallurgical Processes for which he was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine. The last 5-6 years Shifrin has spent studying the Torah and Kabbalah with a particular interest in the intersection of science and religion. He also published a number of Torah Commentaries on the Chabad.org website. In 2018 his book From Infinity to Man – Basic Ideas of Kabbalah in Terms of Information Theory and Quantum Physics, was published in Russia. The English-language edition will be published in early 2019. In 2003 he financed the construction of a Synagogue and Jewish educational centre dedicated to his late father.He also  co-sponsored the construction of the Synagogues in the following cities: Moscow, Volgograd and Zaporozhye. He sponsors 66 Chabad Sunday Schools.

==Net worth==
In the 2006 edition of the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'', Shifrin was listed at No. 59 with an estimated wealth of £920 million.&lt;ref name="premiere"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steel tycoon seals £7m deal for Premiere club|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-jewish-chronicle/20071221/282514359199367|accessdate=6 June 2017|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's ranking of "[[List of billionaires|The World's Billionaires]]" in 2009, Shifrin was ranked 559th with an estimated fortune of $1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World's Billionaires: #559 Eduard Shifrin|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Eduard-Shifrin_EC82.html|accessdate=6 June 2017 |work=[[Forbes]]|date=11 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316055449/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Eduard-Shifrin_EC82.html|archivedate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]]'' magazine estimated his net worth at $893.3 million, making him the No. 20 richest person in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="aif"/&gt;

'''EgyptAir''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مصر للطيران, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Miṣr liṭ-Ṭayarān}}'') is the [[flag carrier]] airline of Egypt.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir receives fourth Boeing 737-800" /&gt; The airline is based at [[Cairo International Airport]], its main hub, operating scheduled passenger and freight services to more than 75 destinations in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Egyptair is a member of [[Star Alliance]] and the [[Arab Air Carriers Organization]].

==History==

===Early years: Misr Airwork (1932–1949)===
Alan Muntz, chairman of [[Airwork Services|Airwork]], visited Egypt in 1931; at that time, he expressed his intention of starting up a new airline in the country. The new enterprise was named ''Misr Airwork'', with ″Misr″ being the Egyptian Arabic for Egypt. On 31 December 1931, the government granted the new company the exclusivity of air transport operations.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} A division of Misr Airwork named ''Misr Airlines'' was established on 7 June 1932,{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} ″to promote the spirit of aviation among Egyptian youth″, becoming the seventh carrier in the world.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir - 'pioneer of air travel'" /&gt; The headquarters of Misr Airwork, S.A.E. was in [[Almaza Air Base|Almaza Aerodrome]], [[Heliopolis, Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Flight International]]''. 28 April 1938. p. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1938/1938%20-%201198.html 416] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6T5QG4M9B?url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1938/1938%20-%201198.PDF Archive]). "MISR AIRWORK, S.A.E., Almaza Aerodrome, Heliopolis."&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial investment was [[Egyptian pound|EG£]]20,000, with ownership split between the [[Banque Misr|Misr Bank]] (85%), Airwork (10%), and Egyptian private investors (5%). Operations started in July 1933, initially linking [[Cairo]] with [[Alexandria]] and [[Mersa Matruh]] using [[de Havilland DH.84 Dragon]] equipment. By August that year, the frequency on the Cairo–Alexandria service had been boosted to twice-daily.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} In late 1933,&lt;ref name="Flight1933-1284" /&gt; a twice-weekly Cairo–[[Aswan]] flight that called at [[Asyut]] and [[Luxor]] was inaugurated.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} Via [[Port Said]], a flight from Cairo that served [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Haifa]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was launched in 1934. On 3 August 1935, a test service via Lydda with final destination in Cyprus began using [[de Havilland D.H.86|D.H.86]] aircraft; the run was terminated on 20 October that year.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} The Alexandria–Port Said–Cairo–[[Minya, Egypt|Minia]]–[[Assiut]] run was opened in late 1935.&lt;ref name="Flight1936-23" /&gt; During 1935, the airline carried 6,990 passengers and {{convert|21830|kg}} of freight; for the year, these regular services flew {{convert|419467|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Flight1936-314" /&gt;

The Alexandria–Assiut route, which called at Port Said, Cairo and Minia, and the Cairo–Cyprus–Haifa–[[Baghdad]] run were the two operative services the carrier had by 1936. [[Hadj]] flights commenced in 1937. Operations to Cyprus resumed in 1938 with a Cairo–Lydda–Haifa–[[Larnaka]] service.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} The carrier operated all-British aircraft in the early years,&lt;ref name="Flight1960-588/9" /&gt;{{rp|588}} and by April 1939 the fleet comprised one [[de Havilland Dragon|D.H. Dragon]], one [[de Havilland Dragonfly|D.H. Dragonfly]], five [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|D.H. Rapìde]]s, two D.H.86s and one [[de Havilland Express|D.H.86B]] that worked on the Alexandria–Cairo, Alexandria–Port Said–Cairo–Minia–Assiut, Cairo–Assiut–Luxor–[[Assuan]], Cairo–Lydda–Haifa–Baghdad and Cairo–Port Said–Lydda–Haifa routes.&lt;ref name="Flight1939-429" /&gt; The Egyptian government took over all the routes in September 1939. In 1940, a service to [[Beirut]] and Palestine was started. Three [[Avro Anson|Avro 19]]s were incorporated into the fleet in 1944. Three accidents that took place in late 1945 prompted strikes for a fleet renewal and caused operations to come to a total halt since February 1946;{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51}} services resumed in May, and by late 1946 the fleet included four [[Avro Anson]]s, one [[AT-11 Kansan|Beech AT-11]], five [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beech C-45]]s, four [[de Havilland D.H.89 Dragon Rapide]]s and two [[North American AT-6 Texan]].{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=51–52}} The carrier benefited from the Allies' regional aircraft disposal station that sold surplus military aircraft being located in Egypt. Two more Beech C-45s were delivered in 1947, and the [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking]] was incorporated in 1948. In May 1949,&lt;ref name="FI1965-606" /&gt; all the capital and the aircraft park was acquired by the government.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} After the Egyptian state became the sole shareholder, the company changed its name to ''Misrair SAE''.&lt;ref name="FI1965-606" /&gt;

===Misrair (1949–1957)===
Misrair continued to fly the same routes as its predecessor.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} In 1951, three [[SNCASE Languedoc|Languedoc]]s were acquired;&lt;ref name="Flight1951-633"/&gt; these were intended for deployment on longer routes.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} The Languedocs replaced the [[Vickers Viking|Viking]]s on flights to [[Geneva]], [[Khartoum]] and [[Tehran]].{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} Three [[Vickers Viscount]]s were ordered in early 1954.&lt;ref name="Flight1954-414"/&gt; During that year, the carrier transported 64,539 passengers. At March 1955, Misrair's fleet comprised one Beechcraft, three Languedocs and seven Vikings; the three Viscounts were still pending delivery.&lt;ref name="Flight1955-307"/&gt; [[Douglas DC-3]]s were subsequently purchased and deployed on domestic routes, as well as to neighbouring Arab countries. Delivery of the first two Viscounts occurred in December 1955; they were put into service in March 1956.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} The number of passengers transported during 1955 had grown to {{cardinal|77050}}.&lt;ref name="Flight1956-475"/&gt; A number of aircraft were lost during the [[Suez crisis]]. In February 1957, Misrair was renamed ''United Arab Airlines''.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} Late that year, two more Viscounts were ordered at a cost of £600,000–800,000, including [[spare part|spare]]s. Prior to this, an aircraft of the type was lost while standing at [[Almaza Airport]] during an air raid.&lt;ref name="Flight1957-203"/&gt;

===United Arab Airlines (1957–1971)===
Following the formation of the [[United Arab Republic]] by Egypt and Syria on {{start date|df=yes|1958|2|1}}, Misrair was renamed ''United Arab Airlines (UAA)'' in March that year.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=55}}{{refn|Despite the ''UAA'' renaming formally taking place in the autumn of 1960 following the merger of Misrair and Syrian Airways,&lt;ref name="FI1965-606" /&gt; Misrair had been using the ″United Arab Airlines″ title since 1958.&lt;ref name="Flight1961-512" /&gt;|group="nb"}} A [[Cairo]]–[[Athens]]–Rome–[[Zurich]] service was launched on 7 July; [[Syrian Airways]] merged into UAA on 23 December, with the latter absorbing both the routes and the equipment of the Syrian carrier.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=55}} By March 1960, the airline had 579 employees. At that time, the fleet comprised one [[Beech D18S]], four [[DC-3]]s, six [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Viking]]s and six [[Vickers Viscount|Viscount]]s.&lt;ref name="Flight1960-504/5" /&gt;{{rp|505}} One of the Viscounts crashed into the [[Mediterranean]] on 10 April, killing 17 passengers and a crew of three.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=55}} With [[Aircraft registration|registration]] SU-ALC,&lt;ref name="Flight1960-850" /&gt; the first of three [[de Havilland Comet|Comet 4C]]s&lt;ref name="Flight1960-855" /&gt; was delivered on 9 June.&lt;ref name="Flight1960-588/9" /&gt;{{rp|588}} Operations using two of these aircraft started on 16 July the same year.&lt;ref name="Flight1960-588/9" /&gt;{{rp|588}} By October 1960, Misrair had Comets deployed on the Cairo–[[Belgrade]]–[[Prague]], Cairo–Rome–London, Cairo–[[Jeddah]] and Cairo–[[Khartoum]] runs,&lt;ref name="Flight1960-588/9" /&gt;{{rp|588}} DC-3s on the Cairo–[[Alexandria]]–[[Mersa Matruh]], Cairo–[[Assiut]]–[[Luxor]], Cairo–Luxor–[[Aswan]] and Cairo–[[Port Said]]–Alexandria services, and [[Vickers Viscount|Viscount]]s were used for the non-stop flights that linked Cairo and Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Flight1960-588/9" /&gt;{{rp|589}} An order for two more Comets was placed in November 1960.&lt;ref name="Flight1960-855" /&gt; Syria's association with UAA ended in October 1961, when [[Syrian Arab Airways]] was established by the [[Syrian government]] in [[Damascus]]; the route network and fleet that had been taken over by UAA was returned to the new company.&lt;ref name="FI1963-542" /&gt;

[[File:United Arab Airlines Comet Soderstrom.jpg|thumb|left|A United Arab Airlines Comet 4C departs [[Geneva Airport]] in 1968.]]
Two more Comets, the {{ordinal to word|4}} and {{ordinal to word|5}} ones,{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=55}} were ordered in early 1961.&lt;ref name="Flight1961-100" /&gt; Three ex-[[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]]s were purchased in April 1961. The Cairo–[[Lagos]] run was extended to [[Accra]] on 12 June and flights to Moscow commenced on 21 June.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=55}} A contract with [[Boeing]] for the purchase of [[Boeing 707-320B]] with delivery dates between November 1961 and April 1964 was signed; the deal fell through when the airline could not find financing.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=55–56}} On 1 November, a new flight to [[Karachi]] and [[Bombay]] was launched, and the sixth and seventh Comets were ordered in December; these were delivered in April 1962.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=56}} Also in 1961, the Cairo–[[Nicosia]] run, suspended since the [[Suez crisis]] in 1956, was restored, flown with Viscount equipment.&lt;ref name="Flight1961-27" /&gt; Routed via [[Bangkok]] and Hong Kong, the Bombay service was extended to Tokyo in May 1962.&lt;ref name="FI1963-546" /&gt; The three-strong crew of a DC-3 that crashed at [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] on 16 May 1962 died, and 26 more people perished in an accident involving a Comet at Bangkok on 19 July the same year. Two more Comets were acquired in August, entering the fleet in September the same year and during 1963. On 15 February 1963, the route to [[Baghdad]] was resumed after a three-year hiatus, but the service was short-lived, as political tensions between Egypt, Iraq and Syria forced the disruption of flights to both this destination and to [[Damascus]]; on 1 April, a new service to [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]] was inaugurated. On 12 May 1963 a DC-3 crashed near [[Alexandria]], killing 27 passengers and a crew of {{cardinal to word|4}} and on 28 July 1963 a Comet crashed into the ocean near Bombay, killing 62. Short of aircraft to serve Tokyo, the route was terminated. In addition, another Comet, SU-ALM, resulted damaged in [[Benghazi]] on 12 September, the {{ordinal to word|9}} and final Comet was delivered in 1964. Also that year, three ex-[[Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-6B|DC-6B]]s were purchased, and another three were acquired from [[Northwest Orient]]; these aircraft were put on service on domestic routes and began replacing the Viscounts. Also aimed at operating domestic services, seven [[Antonov An-24]]s were ordered for {{US$|2.3}}&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=56}}

[[File:United Arab Airlines Ilyushin Il-62 Volpati-1.jpg|thumb|A United Arab Airlines [[Ilyushin Il-62]] at [[Le Bourget Airport]] in 1971]]
By March 1965, seven Comet 4Cs and four Viscounts flew on routes across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, along with a service to Lagos and Accra.&lt;ref name="FI1965-606" /&gt; On 1 August, a subsidiary airline named ''Misrair'' started operations.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=56}}{{refn|The carrier was conceived to operate domestic and regional services.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=52}} Four [[An-24]]s made up Misrair's fleet at the time operations started, and three more were expected by year end. One of these aircraft was lost in an accident at [[Aswan Airport]] on 2 February 1966; a second aircraft was involved in a deadly accident at Cairo on 19 March, killing 30. [[Alexandria]]–[[Athens]], [[Cairo]]–Alexandria, Cairo–[[Luxor]], Cairo–[[Nicosia]] and Cairo–[[Port Said]]–[[El Arish]] were among the routes operated by the carrier. Misrair ceased to exist on {{end date|df=yes|1968|6|1}} due to poor economic performance. Operations were absorbed by ''UAA''.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=53}}|group="nb"}} A contract worth {{US$|30}}&amp;nbsp;million for three [[Boeing 707-320C]]s was signed with Boeing on 15 June 1966 and also included four additional machines on option. On 1 November, the airline suppressed the stop at Prague on the Cairo–Prague–Moscow service, and in January 1967 UAA started the Cairo–Frankfurt–[[Copenhagen]] run. On 22 June 1967, a Comet crashed in Kuwait while landing; there were no fatalities but the aircraft was [[written off]]. In August 1968, the airline took delivery of two [[Ilyushin Il-18]]s.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=56}} The first [[Boeing 707]] was handed over by the aircraft manufacturer on 21 October the same year;&lt;ref name="FI1968-689" /&gt; it was later put into service on the Cairo–London corridor.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=56}} One of the Il-18s was involved in a [[1969 Aswan Ilyushin Il-18 crash|deadly crash]] while attempting to land at Aswan Airport on 20 March 1969. That March, the carrier started services to [[East Berlin]] with Il-18 equipment and in June the route to Tokyo via [[Kuwait City|Kuwait]], Bombay, Bangkok and Hong Kong was resumed.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=56}}

On 14 January 1970 a Comet 4C (SU-ANI) crashed on landing at [[Addis Ababa]] from Cairo; no one of the 14 people on board resulted seriously injured. On 30 January 1970 the [[landing gear]] of an [[Antonov An-24]]V, SU-AOK, collapsed on [[touchdown]] at Luxor. On 19 February SU-ALE, another Comet, aborted [[takeoff]] from [[Munich Riem Airport]] at {{convert|30|ft}}, fell back to the runway, slid until the end of it and hit a fence. Another An-24V, SU-AOC, [[belly landing|belly-landed]] at Cairo on 14 March.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=57}} At March 1970, UAA had 7,810 employees; the fleet comprised seven [[Antonov An-24B|An-24B]]s, three [[Boeing 707-320C|Boeing 707-366C]]s, six Comet 4Cs and three Il-18s.&lt;ref name="FI1970-508" /&gt; The fourth Boeing 707 was delivered in March 1970. An An-24V (SU-ANZ) was on a training flight and crashed near Cairo, killing the three occupants on 19 July.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=57}} On 2 January 1971, a Comet (SU-ALC) hit sand dunes on approach to [[Tripoli]],{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=57}} with the loss of lives of the {{cardinal to word|8}} passengers on board and the crew of {{cardinal to word|8}}.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir - 'pioneer of air travel'" /&gt; On 23 May 1971, the acquisition of two [[Ilyushin Il-62]]s was announced, scheduled for delivery in June the same year.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=57}} June 1971 saw the airline using these aircraft on European routes,{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=57}} supplementing the services operated with the Boeing 707s.&lt;ref name="FI1971-80" /&gt; The Il-62s were introduced on Asian services on 9 jul.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=57}} The name of the airline was changed to ''Egyptair'' on 10 October 1971, following the country changing its name to Arab Republic of Egypt.&lt;ref name="FI1971-677" /&gt;

===EgyptAir (1971–onwards)===
[[File:EgyptAir Boeing 707-320C SU-AVZ ZRH Jun 1978.png|thumb|An EgyptAir [[Boeing 707-320C]] at [[Zurich Airport]] in 1978]]
EgyptAir inherited UAA's staff, equipment, assets and liabilities. On 19 March 1972, a [[Douglas DC-9-32]] carrying [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Aircraft registration|registration]] YU-AHR [[EgyptAir Flight 763|crashed]] into the [[Jebel Shamsan|Shamsam Mountains]], {{convert|4|mi}} southwest of [[Aden]], killing all 30 occupants on board. On 16 Jun, an [[Ilyushin Il-62]] (SU-ARN) was involved in a landing accident with no reported fatalities. In July, {{Cardinal to word|8}} [[Tupolev Tu-154]]s were ordered for {{US$|60}}&amp;nbsp;million, with three of them slated for delivery in July 1973, three in November 1973 and two in March 1974.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48}} Prior to firming the transaction up EgyptAir had also considered the [[Boeing 727]], but financing for these US-manufactured aircraft could not be arranged.&lt;ref name="FI1972-404" /&gt; Under the terms of the contract, light [[Aircraft maintenance|maintenance]] was to be performed in Egypt, whereas airframe and engine overhauling was to be undertaken in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="FI1973-978" /&gt; In July 1972, the acquisition of four [[Boeing 707-320C]]s valued at {{US$|40}}&amp;nbsp;million was announced. At this time, the airline had four [[Boeing 707]]s already in operation. The handover of the new aircraft had been arranged for March, May, June and September 1973.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48}} On 5 December 1972, one of the four 707s already in the fleet (SU-AOW) crashed near Cairo while on a training flight. The crew of {{cardinal to word|6}} perished in the accident. Reports indicating the airframe had been shot down were denied by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="FI1972-854" /&gt; An [[Ilyushin Il-18]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] SU-AOY, was involved in a deadly accident near [[Nicosia]] on 29 January 1973 when it crashed into mountainous terrain, killing all {{cardinal|37}} occupants on board.&lt;ref name="FI1973-184" /&gt; Delivery of the four new Boeing 707s took place during the year, with two more 707-320Cs being ordered in September. In October the three Il-62s were returned to [[Aeroflot]] because of elevated operational costs and technical issues.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48}} Also that month,{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48}} the first Tu-154 entered the fleet and was used for pilot training.&lt;ref name="FI1973-978" /&gt; From Moscow, the handover of the Tu-154s was made through [[London-Heathrow]], where these aircraft were fitted with British-made seats.&lt;ref name="FI1973-978" /&gt;

[[File:EgyptAir Boeing 737-200Adv SU-AYO ZRH Sep 1979.png|thumb|left|An EgyptAir [[Boeing 737-200 Advanced]] on short final to Zurich Airport in 1979]]
The outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 had forced the carrier to suspend the Tokyo service; it was resumed on 15 March 1974 via [[Bombay]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Manila]]. During 1974, the flight to [[Khartoum]] was extended to [[Kinshasa]].{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48}} One of the brand new Tu-154 aircraft, SU-AXO, crashed on 10 July 1974 after takeoff from [[Cairo International Airport]] during a training flight, killing a crew of {{cardinal to word|6}} on board.&lt;ref name="FI1974-51" /&gt; Following the crash EgyptAir requested the return of its Tu-154 fleet to the Soviets and a refund for the price paid for them.&lt;ref name="FI1974-577" /&gt; The capacity shortage caused by the grounding of the Tu-154s was partly alleviated by the [[Aircraft lease|lease]] of aircraft.&lt;ref name="FI1974-530" /&gt; The airline had already been looking for other aircraft to replace them, and an order for {{cardinal to word|6}} [[Douglas DC-9-50]]s was placed in November. On 9 December, an [[Ilyushin Il-18|Il-18]], registration YR-IMK, crashed into the [[Red Sea]]; there were {{cardinal to word|9}} fatalities. In January 1975, the government turned the order with [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] down and moved to [[Boeing]] for the provision of new equipment. An agreement with the Soviets for the return of the Tu-154s was struck on 10 feb; early in the year the An-24s were traded back to the company that represented the Soviets as a partial repayment for the loan taken to acquire the aft-engined Tu-154s. The Boeing order was finalised by March and consisted of {{cardinal to word|4}} [[Boeing 727-200]]s and {{cardinal to word|6}} [[Boeing 737-200]]s. There were plans to trade the first {{cardinal to word|3}} Boeing 707-320Cs in for the new aircraft as part of the deal with Boeing.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48}} Valued at {{US$|60}}&amp;nbsp;million, the transaction was partly financed by the United Arab Emirates.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=48–49}} In May, the order was homogenised to {{cardinal to word|8}} Boeing 737-200s with deliveries slated for April and May 1976. Arrangements were made to sell the four Comets both to raise money to finance the new aircraft and to have an all-Boeing fleet.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=49}}

A link between Cairo and [[Milan]] began in January 1976 and a new flight to [[Vienna]] started in April. Following allegations from the Egyptian parliament that airline officials had been bribed by Boeing to favour the 1975 order, the chairman Gamal Erfan resigned in February. On 22 April, a Boeing 737 flying from Cairo to Luxor was hijacked by {{cardinal to word|3}} Palestinians; an Egyptian commando team regained control of the aircraft with no damages to its structure. The {{cardinal to word|4}} Comets were sold to [[Dan-Air]] on 9 October. During the year, {{cardinal to word|7}} Boeing 737 Advanced entered the fleet.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=49}} A serious accident involving a Boeing 707 took place on 25 Dec when a non-regular flight from Cairo to Tokyo [[EgyptAir Flight 864|crashed]] into a textile mill while on approach to Bangkok, killing all {{cardinal|43}} passengers and a crew of {{cardinal to word|9}}; fatalities and injured people on the ground were also reported.&lt;ref name="FI1977-51" /&gt; Early in 1977, the first arrests related to the bribery case involving the Boeing order took place when a former pilot admitted he had been bribed for {{US$|150000}}. In February, an agreement to lease {{cardinal to word|2}} [[Airbus A300B4]] aircraft from [[Bavaria Germanair|Germanair]] and [[Trans European Airways|Trans European Airlines&lt;!-- this is the name appearing in suporting source --&gt;]] was signed.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=49}}&lt;ref name="FI1977-7" /&gt; On 1 April, services to [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Karachi]] were launched. The first A300 service flew the Cairo–Karachi route on 3 June.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=49}} The lease conditions for the aircraft owned by [[Bavaria Germanair]] changed to a lease/purchase agreement.&lt;ref name="FI1978-6" /&gt; EgyptAir eventually acquired the two leased A300B4 aircraft. On 21 February 1978, a Boeing 707 made an emergency landing at [[Sharjah Airport]] after hitting a flock of birds; the incident caused substantial damage to the fuselage and to the engines.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=49}} During 1979, {{cardinal to word|3}} [[Airbus A300B4-220|A300B4-200]]s were ordered for {{US$|115}}&amp;nbsp;million with a delivery span between September 1980 and September 1981; the carrier took options on {{cardinal to word|4}} more aircraft of the type.&lt;ref name="FI1980-971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FI1979-1543" /&gt; Financing for the {{cardinal to word|3}} firmly ordered aircraft was partly provided by the [[Midland Bank]] and the [[Dresdner Bank]].&lt;ref name="FI1980-971" /&gt;

At March 1980 the number of employees was 9,610 and the fleet consisted of two Airbus A300B4s, seven Boeing 707-320Cs, seven Boeing 737-200s and two [[Beech Baron]]s.&lt;ref name="FI1980-118-310" /&gt; There was a major financial reorganisation in November 1980 when ownership of the company was shared by the [[National Bank of Egypt]] and the Misr Insurance Company.{{sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=49}} In 1981, options for two Airbus A300B4-200s were converted into a firm order. This took the count of A300 aircraft pending delivery to four. At November this year the airline had five aircraft of the type in the fleet, two of them leased.&lt;ref name="FI1981-120-1045" /&gt; Another A300B4-200 was ordered in 1982.&lt;ref name="FI1982-121-106" /&gt; Overall, eight new Airbus A300B4s were introduced during the early 1980s.

EgyptAir is a state-owned company with special legislation permitting the management to operate as if the company were privately owned without any interference from the government. The company is self-financing without any financial backing by the Egyptian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/stb/bip/Documents/bip-ms-casestudy.pdf |format=PDF |title=BAGGAGE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM : EgyptAir CASE STUDY : CAIRO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT |website=Iata.org |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline underwent a major corporate re-engineering in 2002, when its structure was changed from a governmental organization into a holding company with subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir divides operations into six in effort to multiply earnings" /&gt; The move coincided with establishment of the Egyptian Minister of Civil Aviation and the government's ambitious strategy to modernize and upgrade its airports and airline. The airline was given the right to operate without any interference from the government and the duty to do so without any financial backing

EgyptAir wholly owns [[EgyptAir Express]] and [[Air Sinai]]. The airline has stakes in [[Air Cairo]] (60%) and [[Smart Aviation Company]] (20%).

In 2004, EgyptAir became the first [[IATA Operational Safety Audit|IOSA]] certified airline in Africa.

In May 2006,&lt;ref name="MSE-history"&gt;{{cite web|title=EgyptAir Express History |publisher=EgyptAir Express |url=http://express.egyptair.com/AboutUs/History.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424171656/http://express.egyptair.com/AboutUs/History.aspx |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; the airline launched a regional subsidiary called [[EgyptAir Express]] with a fleet of new [[Embraer E-170]] jets with services commencing in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centreforaviation.com/profiles/airlines/egyptair-express-mse|title=Profile on EgyptAir Express – CAPA – Centre for Aviation|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier links Cairo with [[Sharm El Sheikh]], [[Hurghada]], [[Luxor]], [[Aswan]], [[Marsa Alam]], [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Alexandria]] (Egypt) in addition to secondary destinations to complement the parent company's network. In June 2009 the subsidiary received the last of the 12 [[Embraer E-170]] aircraft on order.

This is fortified by huge assets of more than US$3.8&amp;nbsp;billion. The airline's financial year is from July to June.&lt;ref name="ntsb4"&gt;[http://www.ntsb.gov/events/ea990/docket/Ex_2A.pdf NTSB ''Group Chairman's Factual Report'', 18 January 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
For the fiscal year ending 31 July 2007, EgyptAir achieved a record total revenue of US$1.143&amp;nbsp;billion. Total group revenue grew by 14%, as compared with the previous year.

In early 2007, the airline partnered with the Egyptian Ministry of Civil Aviation and 'Egyptian Holding Company for Airports &amp; Air Navigation' to form a new corporate airline, [[Smart Aviation Company]], based at Cairo Airport.

In 2009, EgyptAir's operations at its [[Cairo International Airport]] hub (where it holds 61% of the airport's departure slots) were notably overhauled due to the inauguration of the new Terminal 3 in April 2009. The airline transferred all its operations (international and domestic) to the new terminal that has more than doubled the airport's capacity. Under the Star Alliance "Move Under One Roof" concept at Cairo Airport, all Star Alliance airlines serving Cairo have moved to Terminal 3. In 2010 the airline will overhaul operations at its [[Alexandria]] base by transferring operations from the older facilities at [[Alexandria International Airport (Egypt)|Alexandria International Airport]] to the new airport in [[Borg El Arab Airport]]. The airline's CEO also stated the company was evaluating whether to set up a [[low cost carrier]] subsidiary for its Alexandria operations to address the growth of LCCs in the city.

During the 2009–2010 [[Paris Airshow]], the airline announced a new venture with US lessor Aviation Capital Group (ACG) and other Egyptian private and public shareholders to establish a leasing joint venture focusing on the Middle East and Northern Africa region. The new joint venture – named Civil Aviation Finance and Operating Leases (CIAF-Leasing) will initially focus on narrowbody aircraft.

Following the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|revolution of 2011]], Egyptair is reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/35497/egypts-national-airline-loses-185-million |title=EgyptAir Egypt's national airline loses $185&amp;nbsp;million |publisher=eTurboNews.com |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214015040/http://www.eturbonews.com/35497/egypts-national-airline-loses-185-million |archivedate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have suffered considerable losses. Egypt's civil aviation minister Wael El Maadawi said the airline lost an estimated 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion Egyptian pounds, or around $185&amp;nbsp;million, over the 2012/13 fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in fuel prices, the devaluation of the Egyptian currency and continuous strikes within the company. Losses for 2011/12 were apparently around double the 2012/13 figures. The carrier has reportedly suffered total losses of more than 7bn pounds, or nearly $1bn, since the 2011 uprising.

In the middle of 2012, a group of flight attendants asked for the right to wear [[hijabs]] as part of their work uniform. The company granted their request and hijab-wearing flight attendants first appeared in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egyptair-flight-attendants-fly-hijab-first-time EgyptAir flight attendants fly with hijab for first time] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318184039/http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egyptair-flight-attendants-fly-hijab-first-time |date=18 March 2014 }}." ''[[Egypt Independent]]''. Sunday 11 November 2012. Retrieved on 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, two weeks after the crash that brought down [[Metrojet Flight 9268]] in the [[Sinai peninsula]], [[Rosaviatsiya|Russian authorities]] banned EgyptAir from flying to Russia, citing security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-bans-egypt-air-flights-to-russia-russian-metrojet-plane-crash-sinai/|title=Russia bans inbound Egypt Air flights|date=13 November 2015|publisher=[[CBS News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, EgyptAir was fined {{US$|140000}} for leasing aircraft to [[Sudan Airways]] during 2010–11, breaking economic sanctions imposed on Sudan in 1997.&lt;ref name="US fines Egyptair for Sudanese leases" /&gt;

===Fleet development===
EgyptAir became [[Airbus A330]]/[[Airbus A340|340]]'s {{ordinal|37}} customer in June 1995 when it ordered three [[Airbus A340]]s,&lt;ref name="Egyptair Buys A340" /&gt; scheduled for delivery in December 1996.&lt;ref name="Aircraft news" /&gt; The first, 260-seater aircraft entered the fleet in late 1996, and operated along a [[Airbus A340-300|-300]] version that was on [[Aircraft lease|lease]] from [[Gulf Air]].&lt;ref name="Egyptair introduces the A340-200" /&gt; Also in 1995, the carrier purchased three 308-seater [[Boeing 777-200]]s for {{US$|400|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Orders grow for 777s but 1995 deliveries show decline" /&gt; These [[General Electric GE90|GE-90]] powered aircraft, along with the A340-200s, were ordered for replacement of the [[Airbus A300B4]] and [[Boeing 767-200]] fleet.&lt;ref name="Egyptair introduces the A340-200" /&gt;

Aimed to replace the [[Airbus A300-600R]] fleet, the airline placed an order for seven [[Airbus A330-200]] aircraft in early 2003,&lt;ref name="Marketplace" /&gt; slated for delivery in June 2004,&lt;ref name="EgyptAir chooses Trent 700 for new A330 order" /&gt; and cancelled two [[Airbus A340-600]]s it had previously ordered.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir poised for A330-200" /&gt; In June 2003, EgyptAir signed a deal worth {{US$|150}}&amp;nbsp;million with [[Rolls-Royce Group PLC|Rolls-Royce]] for the provision of [[Rolls-Royce Trent 700|Trent 700]] engines to power these seven A330s.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir chooses Trent 700 for new A330 order" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolls-Royce wins EgyptAir order" /&gt; The {{ordinal to word|1}} [[Airbus A330-300]] was incorporated into the fleet in August 2010.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir in talks to defer A330-300 deliveries" /&gt;

Egyptair's commercial relationship with [[Boeing]] started in 1968 when a [[Boeing 707]] was delivered.&lt;ref name="Boeing Delivers 50th Airplane to EGYPTAIR" /&gt; Six [[Boeing 737-800]]s were acquired in August 2005, with handovers starting in September the following year and a delivery span of three years.&lt;ref name="Egyptair orders six 737-800s, options six more" /&gt; On lease from [[GECAS]], EgyptAir took delivery of its first 346-seater [[Boeing 777-300ER]] in March 2010.&lt;ref name="Boeing Delivers EGYPTAIR's First 777-300ER for Long-Haul Fleet Upgrade" /&gt;

In June 2011, the airframer delivered the airline's {{ordinal|50}} Boeing aircraft, a [[Boeing 737-800|737-800]].&lt;ref name="Boeing Delivers 50th Airplane to EGYPTAIR" /&gt; In {{startdate|2016|7}}, Egyptair was identified as the carrier that ordered nine more aircraft of the type, in a deal worth {{US$|864}}&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="EgyptAir is customer for nine Boeing 737-800s" /&gt; In October 2016 the airline placed a firm order for eight [[Boeing 737-800]]s with deliveries starting in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airwaysmag.com/airlines/egyptair-confirms-boeing-737-800-order/|title=EgyptAir Confirms Boeing 737-800 Order - Airways Magazine|date=21 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BenjaminaEmilija - 1920-30-LABR-Iz218-10.jpg|thumb|150px|Formal portrait taken in a photo-salon in the 1920s.]]
'''Emīlija Benjamiņa''' (sometimes transcribed '''Emilija Benjamin''') (10 September 1881 — 23 September 1941 [[Solikamsk]] [[Gulag|labor camp]], [[Soviet Union]]) became the richest person in pre-[[World War II]] Latvia. She was the universally acknowledged "Press Queen" of the country and became one of the wealthiest women in Europe at the time.

==Early life==
Born Emīlija Simsone, she was the middle daughter of Andris Simsons and Ede Usinš. Simsons was a low level bureaucrat on whose salary the family could barely make its ends meet. Both of her sisters were stage artists, the eldest, Mina (stage name Tusnelda) was an opera singer, while the youngest, Annija (Aicher) was an actress who made a name for herself in both the Latvian and German language theater.

Unlike her sisters, Emīlija early on, was attracted to [[News media|the press]] and to business and started working at the age of 17, as an advertising agent and theater critic, for the German language newspaper, ''Rigaer Tagesblatt'', which was owned by one of the prominent members of this Imperial Russian city's Jewish community, Blankenstein.
 
She married young and became Emīlija Elks. Unfortunately that marriage did not turn out to be the dream that she had envisioned. Elks became an alcoholic and was reported to have beaten her.

==Publishing career==
Sometime in 1904 or 1905 Emīlija met a man named Anton Benjamiņš. He was 21 years older than Emilija and had by that time in his life been a schoolteacher and a failed shop owner. Because he had become bankrupt, he came to Riga to look for work, which he found as the reporter on Latvian issues of the ''Rigaer Tageblatt''. At the time, he also was married to someone else.

Over time Emīlija Elks and Benjamin took over the practical running of the ''Rigaer Tagesblat''. Emīlija ran the business, while Benjamiņš was the editor.  In 1909, Emīlija divorced Elks. For Benjamiņš however that step would prove to be much more complicated and time consuming as his existing spouse did not agree and they had three children.

In 1911 Emīlija and Benjamiņš decided to live together. And, on 8 December, Emīlija founded her own newspaper using funds she had obtained from her divorce settlement. She also persuaded all the Latvian speaking journalists at the various German and Russian language newspapers in Riga to work for her, initially free of charge, to get a truly Latvian newspaper off the ground.  ''[[Jaunākās Ziņas]]'' (The Latest News) was the first, mass distribution newspaper to be published in the Latvian language; Emīlija, as Emīlija Elks, was the publisher and Benjamiņš was her editor-in-chief. Emīlija's business sense and Anton's dedication to hard work soon bore fruit and ''Jaunākās Ziņas'' blossomed. It employed many who would go on to be important names in the development of Latvian literature and culture and indeed of the written Latvian language itself, including the writer [[Kārlis Skalbe]], the linguist Jānis Endzelīns.
  
At the outbreak of [[World War I]] ''Jaunākās Ziņas'' continued to publish as long as it could and made a name and market for itself by publishing  the announcements of refugees searching for their family members, free of charge. But eventually, as four different sides (the [[Imperial German Army]], the [[Bolsheviks]], the pro-German local [[Landswehr]] and finally the Army of the new Latvian Republic) marched through Riga, ''Jaunākās Ziņas'' shut down and during the Bolshevik occupation of Riga, Emīlija and Benjamiņš had to take refuge in [[Berlin]] for some six months.

Just before the war started ''Jaunākās Ziņas'' had received delivery of the latest industrial printing presses from [[Germany]]; now, since Germany was an enemy country of [[Imperial Russia]], the bill no longer had to be paid and still later, when the war was over, the German firm in question was bankrupt and no longer existed. Later, the Bolsheviks "expropriated" the printing plant and used it to print their propaganda leaflets; when they were driven out they abandoned tons of paper. This supplied the newly restarted ''Jaunākās Ziņas'' for free for over a year, a not insignificant commercial advantage at a moment in time when paper was a very precious and expensive commodity in short supply.

==Benjamiņš Publishing==
Anton Benjamiņš was finally able to get his divorce in 1922. And within a few months Emīlija and Benjamiņš were finally, legally, married.

With peace, the Benjamiņšes set about building their publishing empire with vigor. In 1924, they started a new magazine ''Atpūta'' (Leisure) which quickly became the showpiece as well as a prime mover of the Latvian culture now developing after Czarist rule and Baltic-German cultural domination. In 1928, the Benjamiņšes bought the grandest private home in Riga, the so-called "Fābu Palace".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groupeuropa.com/index.php/europa_royale/riga/benjamiu_nama_vsture/2386 {{Lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emīlija also owned a summer home on the beach in the town of [[Jūrmala]] (the beach resort of Latvia), other buildings in Riga and bought a country estate called "Waldeck" near Kandava.
 
By the 1930s the Benjamiņš' publications had saturated the press market in Latvia. During a visit to Paris, she met [[William Randolph Hearst]] who congratulated her with the statement that he wished he could have the same market share in his country that she had in hers.

Emīlija looked to expanding her business empire beyond publishing. To that end, in the latter part of the 1930s she bought a ten hectare industrial estate in [[Ķekava]], by the [[Daugava river]], with the intention of going into chemical manufacturing and color photograph development with her nephew and adopted son, Juris. Juris was by then a chemist and had already developed some new processes for color film printing.

Emīlija had no children from either her first or second marriage. So, to have an heir, in 1926 she had arranged with her younger sister, Annija, to adopt Annija’s oldest son, Georg Aicher (who became "Juris Benjamiņš" after the adoption), as her own.

With financial success came fame and social status which Benjamiņa showed she was worthy of.  The President of Latvia, [[Karlis Ulmanis]] was unmarried during the 1930s and so, in many ways, Emīlija became the "First Lady" of Latvia. She was the one whose social events determined one's place and order in the higher society.

==Alleged prophecy==
At one of Emilija Benjamīņa's lavish parties during this era, an event is reputed to have taken place that is still clouded in legend. Emīlija had invited as a guest a man who was world-renowned at the time as a fortune teller: Eižens Finks (Eugene Finks). About her future he said: "you will die of starvation, lying on bare wooden boards". At the time, all present considered his statement to be a bad joke.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viriesi.lv/eizens-finks-1885.-06.02.1958.g.html {{Lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet era==
In 1938 Emīlija Benjamīņa decided to complement the finest city residence in the Baltics with the finest summer house on the beach and commissioned the German architect, Lange to create what has become known as: The Emilija Benjamin House, in Jūrmala.
 
Anton Benjamiņš died on 14 June 1939, a month shy of his 79th birthday. At the time of his death Anton and Emīlija jointly owned two businesses and twelve properties. It was said that their wealth at the time exceeded 60,000,000 Swiss gold francs.  In his will, Anton arranged for Emīlija to have 51% (the controlling interest) of the businesses. Anton's children from his first marriage promptly challenged the will in Court and publicly declared that their father was insane. But history soon overtook the Court Case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1965/1965rcs0-251/1965rcs0-251.html The case in a modified form was ultimately re-fought in the Canadian Courts in the 1960s.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 1939, the "Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]" generally known as the "[[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]" was signed, and dated a day earlier.
 
The Emilija Benjamin House was finished in the fall of 1939.
 
On 17 June 1940 in accordance with the concept of the Treaty, the [[Red Army]] occupied Latvia and shortly thereafter incorporated the formerly independent country into the Soviet Union. Everything that Emīlija owned was "nationalized" as Soviet people’s property. Right at the beginning of the Soviet occupation the German Government created a safe passage for people to escape and Juris Benjamiņš used that to successfully evacuate the valuables from the Kr. Barona 12 house.  Among them was one of the finest [[Sèvres porcelain]] collections in Europe, and [[Czar Nicolas II]]'s gold cutlery collection that Emīlija had bought in [[Paris]] in the 1920s from [[Prince Felix Yuzupov]] (the man who assassinated [[Rasputin]]). The items were taken to [[Vienna]] but were stolen there and never recovered.

''Jaunākās Ziņas'' was published for the last time on 9 August 1940. The newspaper had strongly advocated the advantages of parliamentary systems like those of the United Kingdom and Sweden and its uncompromising stand against [[totalitarianism]] had antagonized both the [[Communists]] and the [[National Socialists]].

Emīlija apparently thought she herself would be spared. The Swedish ambassador to Latvia offered to marry her, thereby making her a Swedish citizen with diplomatic protection. But he could not offer protection for her adopted son, so she refused his offer. Rudolph Aicher (her younger sister's husband) through his contacts with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], managed to arrange an interview with [[Heinrich Himmler]] in the hopes of getting the German Government's intervention on her behalf. However, after having her and her newspaper's politics investigated, Himmler concluded that she was "Reichswidrig" ("an enemy of the Reich") and would not be helped.  But above all, her former employee, her regular party guest, her friend: Vilis Lacis, the new Communist Interior Minister for the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was the one who decided such things. And so, indeed he did.

Initially, Emīlija had been “moved” from her city residence at Kr. Barona Str. 12 to a small flat at Kr. Barona 19. On 17 June 1941 Soviet police came to the door with a list of names, told her to pack her things and took her away. Juris was also on the list, but they could not find him. Also on the train to Siberia was a wealthy Jewish family that had been neighbors of hers and the young man of that family, who survived the [[Soviet Camps]] related that when they got off the train at the end of the journey, Emīlija had trouble carrying her suitcase, but when someone offered to help she replied, "from now on I will carry my own destiny".

On 23 September 1941, a little over a week after her 60th birthday, Emīlija Benjamiņš died of starvation, lying on a "bed" of bare wooden boards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4696">[[Image:HM Inspectorate of Education in Scotland logo.png|thumb|right|HM Inspectorate of Education Logo]]
'''Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education''' (HMIe) was an [[executive agencies of the Scottish Government|executive agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]], responsible for the [[inspection]] of [[state school|public]] and [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]], [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] [[school]]s, as well as [[further education]] [[college]]s, [[adult education|community learning]], Local Authority Education Departments and [[teacher education]].

HMIe and [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]] were merged in 2011 to create '''[[Education Scotland]]'''.

==History==
The first HM Inspector of Schools (HMI) was appointed in 1840. The rationale for the first appointments of HMI linked inspection to “the improvement of elementary education” and charged HMI to say “what improvements in the apparatus and internal management of schools, in school management and discipline, and in the methods of teaching have been sanctioned by the most extensive experience”. The particular focus in Scotland on combining inspection with self-evaluation has been central to the drive to raise educational standards.

HMIe was headed by [[Her Majesty's Senior Chief Inspector of Education]]. Its remit was far wider than its English counterpart, the [[Office for Standards in Education]]. HMIe's equivalent in Wales, [[Estyn]], had a similar remit, including adult education.

Following the [[Scotland Act 1998]] the Inspectorate was made an Executive Agency of the [[Scottish Government]] in 2001, and HMIe was answerable to the Scottish Ministers for the running of the Inspectorate and the whole inspection system in Scotland.

In 2003 it employed 178 staff who were based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Inverness]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/inspectorate-jobs-to-leave-capital-1-493172 |title=Inspectorate jobs to leave capital |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=8 November 2003 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A policy to disperse public sector jobs then led to the relocation of the headquarters from Edinburgh to [[Livingston, West Lothian]] along with the opening of new offices in [[Dunbartonshire]] and [[Ayrshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/school-inspectors-hq-to-move-west-1-903593 |title=School inspectors' HQ to move west |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=8 November 2003 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 October 2010 the Cabinet Secretary for Education announced that HMIe would be brigaded with [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]] into a new executive agency of the Scottish Government to be known as the ''Scottish Education Quality and Improvement Agency''. This was later renamed [[Education Scotland]], and came into existence on 30 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2011/fa_1011_hm_inspectorate_education.pdf |title=Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education. Annual Report on the 2010/11 audit |publisher=[[Audit Scotland]] |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Chief Inspector 1999 to 2002: Bill Clark&lt;br&gt;
Senior Chief Inspector in 2009: Graham Donaldson&lt;br&gt;
Senior Chief Inspector 2010 to 2017: Dr Bill Maxwell&lt;br&gt;
Senior Chief Inspector from December 2017: Gayle Gorman&lt;br&gt;

==Remit==
HMIe was charged with inspecting the quality of education in [[pre-school]] centres, [[primary school]]s, [[secondary school]]s, [[special school]]s, [[adult education|community learning and development]], [[further education colleges]], [[teacher education|initial teacher education]], residential educational provision and the education functions of [[Local government of Scotland|local authorities]] and services for children.

Following the passing of the [[Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. 2000 Act]] the focus of HMIe shifted to how this legislation is being implemented. It brought new statutory powers to inspect the education functions of local authorities.

A '''house painter and decorator''' is a [[tradesman]] responsible for the painting and decorating of buildings, and is also known as a '''decorator''' or '''house painter'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Painting and Decorating |author= Alf Fulcher|year= 2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1254-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMD"&gt;''The Modern Painter and Decorator'' volume 1 1921 Caxton&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of painting is to improve the appearance of a building and to protect it from damage by water, rust, corrosion, insects and mold.

==History of the trade in England==
In England, little is known of the trade and its structures before the late 13th century, at which paint [[guild]]s began to form, amongst them the Painters Company and the Stainers Company. These two guilds eventually merged with the consent of the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] in 1502, forming the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. The guild standardised the craft and acted as a protector of the [[trade secret]]s. In 1599, the guild asked Parliament for protection, which was eventually granted in a bill of 1606, which granted the trade protection from outside competition such as [[plaster]]ers.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

The Act legislated for a seven-year [[apprenticeship]], and also barred plasterers from painting, unless apprenticed to a painter, with the penalty for such painting being a fine of £5. The Act also enshrined a maximum daily fee of 16 [[old pence]] for their labour.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

[[File:painter paints a room arp.jpg|thumb|A paint master]]
;The Paint Master
Enforcement of this Act by the Painter-Stainers Company was sought up until the early 19th century, with [[master craftsman|master painters]] gathering irregularly to decide the fees that a [[journeyman]] could charge, and also instigating an early version of a [[job centre]] in 1769, advertising in the [[London]] [[newspaper]]s a "house of call" system to advertise for journeymen and also for journeymen to advertise for work. The guild's power in setting the fee a journeyman could charge was eventually overturned by law in 1827, and the period after this saw the guild's power diminish, along with that of the other guilds; the guilds were superseded by [[trade union]]s, with the Operative United Painters' Union forming sometime around 1831.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

In 1894, a national association formed, recreating itself in 1918 as the National Federation of Master Painters and Decorators of England and Wales, then changing its name once again to the British Decorators Association before merging, in 2002, with the Painting &amp; Decorating Federation to form the Painting &amp; Decorating Association. The Construction Industry Joint Council, a body formed of both unions and business organizations, today has responsibility for the setting of pay levels.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

==Activities of the trade==
Historically, the painter was responsible for the mixing of the [[paint]]; keeping a ready supply of [[pigment]]s, [[oil]]s, [[paint thinner|thinner]]s and [[Oil drying agent|drier]]s. The painter would use his experience to determine a suitable mixture depending on the nature of the job. In modern times, the painter is primarily responsible for preparation of the surface to be painted, such as patching holes in [[drywall]], using masking tape and other protection on surfaces not to be painted, applying the paint and then cleaning up.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

Larger firms operating within the trade were generally capable of performing many painting or decoration services, from creating an [[accent wall]] to [[signwriter|sign writing]], to the [[gilding]] of objects or the [[wood finishing|finishing]] or refinishing of [[furniture]].&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;  

More recently, professional painters are responsible for all preparation prior to painting. All scraping, [[sanding]], [[wallpaper]] removal, [[caulk]]ing, drywall or [[wood]] repair, patching, [[stain removal]], filling [[nail (fastener)|nail]] holes or any defects with plaster or [[putty]], cleaning, [[adhesive tape|taping]], preparation and priming are considered to be done by the professional [[independent contractor|contracted]] painter.

'''hybridica''' is an international [[trade fair]] for the development and manufacture of [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] components. It was founded by [[Messe München|Messe München International]] and is held at the New Munich Trade Fair Centre. hybridica celebrated its premiere there in Hall C2 from November 11 – 14, 2008 – i.e. at the same time as [[Electronica (trade fair)|electronica]].
[[File:Logo hybridica.jpg|thumbnail|right|The logo of hybridica]]

The fair revolves around hybrid components that are made of a combination of materials and depicts their entire value chain in industrial manufacturing – from raw materials, development and prototyping to tool and die manufacturing, production plants, machines, automation technology, concrete applications and finished products.
[[File:Eingang hybridica 2008.JPG|thumbnail|right|The entrance at hybridica 2008]]
The [[composite materials]] that are used the most are metals, plastics and, to an increasing extent, ceramics. The resulting components are primarily used in the [[electronics]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[automotive]] sectors. Other application sectors include information and communications technology, medicine, power engineering, building-services and sanitary engineering, the consumer-goods industry and white and brown goods. Hybrid solutions made of multiple materials are also increasingly being used in the lightweight-design sector.
[[File:Hybridica 2008 Halle C2.JPG|thumbnail|right|hybridica 2008: Hall C2]]
When it was first held in 2008, hybridica had 130 exhibitors from ten countries and more than 7,800 visitors from 21 countries. The following hybridica took place in Munich from November 13 – 16, 2012.

[[File:EA-6B Prowler maintenance check.jpg|thumb|Maintenance check of electronic equipment on a U.S. Navy aircraft.]]
An '''inspection''' is, most an organized [[Observational study|examination]] or formal evaluation exercise. In engineering activities inspection involves the [[measurement]]s, [[test (assessment)|test]]s, and [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]] applied to certain characteristics in regard to  an object or activity. The results are usually compared to specified [[requirement]]s and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets, often with a [[Standard Inspection Procedure]] in place to ensure consistent checking. Inspections are usually non-destructive.

Inspections may be a [[visual inspection]] or involve sensing technologies such as [[ultrasonic testing]], accomplished with a direct physical presence or remotely such as a [[remote visual inspection]], and manually or automatically such as an [[automated optical inspection]]. [[3D scanner|Non-contact optical measurement]] and [[Photogrammetry]] have become common [[Nondestructive testing|NDT]] methods for inspection of manufactured components and design optimisation.

A 2007 Scottish Government review of scrutiny of public services (the Crear Review, 2007&lt;ref name="Crear"&gt;Crerar, Professor Lorne D, September 2007 The Crerar Review: The report of the independent review of regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling of public services in Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/82980/0053065.pdf]) defined inspection of public services as "... periodic, targeted scrutiny of specific services, to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards, legislative and professional requirements, and the needs of service users."

A ''surprise inspection'' tends to have different results than an announced inspection. Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what  happens. If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes. This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process. See section 4.12 of the Crear report.&lt;ref name="Crear" /&gt;

==Specific inspection==

=== Manufacturing ===

[[File:Thickness Measurement.png|thumb|Inspection and measurement of the thickness of the different layers of an electronic chip using THz and X-ray radiation. THz has the privilege of being non-ionizing (non-destructive) but the resolution of X-ray is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahi|first1=Kiarash|title=Terahertz characterization of electronic components and comparison of terahertz imaging with X-ray imaging techniques|journal=SPIE Sensing Technology+ Applications|date=2015-05-13|page=94830K-94830K-15|doi=10.1117/12.2183128|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278034592_Terahertz_characterization_of_electronic_components_and_comparison_of_terahertz_imaging_with_x-ray_imaging_techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Quality related in-process inspection/verification is an essential part of quality control in manufacturing.

Inspection in manufacturing includes measuring, examining, testing, or gauging one or more characteristics of a product or process and comparing the results with specified requirements to determine whether is the requirements are met for each characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Quality Glossary |url= http://asq.org/glossary/i.html |publisher= American Society for Quality (ASQ) |access-date=2015-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[AS9100]] Revision C, Clause 7.6 Control of Monitoring and Measurement Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;  Common examples of inspection by measurement or [[Gauge (instrument)|gauging]] include using a [[Calipers|caliper]] or [[micrometer]] to determine if a dimension of a manufactured part is within the [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|dimensional tolerance]] specified in a drawing for that part, and is thus acceptable for use.

[[Design for Inspection]] (DFI) is a concept that should complement and work in collaboration with [[Design for Manufacturability]] (DFM) and [[Design for Assembly]] (DMA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality.

[[Photogrammetry]] is a modern way of visual inspection, delivering high accuracy and traceability for various industries. The portable 3D system is a versatile optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) with a wide range of capabilities.  Highly accurate point measurements can be taken with inspection carried out directly to CAD models, geometry or drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicaldigital.com/services/3d-scanning-services/|title=3D Scanning Services {{!}} Physical Digital|last=Ltd|first=Digital Parent Company|website=www.physicaldigital.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;(DFI)

===Fire Equipment===
Most fire equipment needs to be inspected to make sure in the event of a fire, every effort has been taken to make sure it doesn't get out of control. Extinguishers are to be inspected every month by law and inspected by a servicing company at least once a year.Fire extinguishers can be heavy, so it's a good idea to practice picking up and holding an extinguisher to get an idea of the weight and feel.

===Business===
In [[international trade]] several destination countries require [[pre-shipment inspection]]. The importer instructs the shipper which inspection company should be used. The inspector makes pictures and a report to certify that the goods that are being shipped and produced are in accordance with the accompanying documents.

Commodity inspection is other term that is used between buyers and sellers. The scope of work for commodity inspection depends to the buyers. Some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for pre-shipment inspections i.e. visual quality, quantity, packing, marking and loading inspections and some others request for higher level inspections and ask inspection agencies to attend in the vendor shops and inspect commodities during manufacturing processes. Normally inspection is done based on an agreed inspection and test plan (ITP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection-for-industry.com/commodity_inspection.html |title=Commodity Inspection Services. Retrieved on 02-18-2013 |publisher=Inspection-for-industry.com |date= |accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
In government and politics, an ''inspection'' is the act of a monitoring authority administering an official review of various criteria (such as [[document]]s, facilities, records, and any other assets) that are deemed by the authority to be related to the inspection. Inspections are used for the purpose of determining if a body is complying with regulations. The inspector examines the criteria and talks with involved individuals. A report and evaluation follows such visits.

The [[Food Safety Inspection Service]] is charged with ensuring that all meat and egg products in the United States are safe to consume and accurately labeled. The [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to order meat inspections and condemn any found unfit for human consumption. The [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] is a regulatory body that inspects for [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The [[The Care Commission|Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care]] regulates and inspects  care services in Scotland.

===Road vehicles===
A [[vehicle inspection]], e.g., an annual inspection, is a necessary inspection required on vehicles to conform with laws regarding safety, emissions, or both.  It consists of an examination of a vehicle's components, usually done by a certified mechanic. Vehicles pass a pre-warranty inspection, if, and only if, a mechanic provide evidence for the proper working condition of the vehicle systems specified in the type of inspection.

===Engineering, mechanics===
A mechanical inspection is usually undertaken to ensure the safety or reliability of structures or machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0071453998
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe bodies involved in engineering inspection may be assessed by accreditation bodies according to ISO 17020 "General criteria for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection". This standard defines inspection as "examination of a product, process, service, or installation or their design and determination of its conformity with specific requirements or, on the basis of professional judgment, with general requirements".&lt;ref&gt;BS EN ISO/IEC 17020: "Conformity assessment - Requirements for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection", pp. 1 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|nondestructive testing}}
Non-destructive examination (NDE) or [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT) is a family of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as [[fractures]] or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, [[industrial computed tomography scanning]], [[microscopy]],  [[dye penetrant inspection]], [[magnetic-particle inspection]], [[X-ray]] or [[radiographic testing]], [[ultrasonic testing]], [[eddy-current testing]], [[acoustic emission testing]], and [[thermographic inspection]]. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a [[checkweigher]]. [[Stereo microscope]]s are often used for examining small products like [[circuit boards]] for product defects.

Inspection and technical assistance during turnarounds helps to decrease costly downtime as well as ensures restart of operations quickly and safely.

===Medical===
A ''[[Inspection (medicine)|medical inspection]]'' is the thorough and unhurried visualization of a patient, this requires the use of the naked eye.

===Military===
An [[examination vessel]] is a craft used to inspect ships entering or leaving a port during wartime.

===Railroad===
The railroad's [[inspection locomotive]] were special types of [[steam locomotive]]s designed to carry railroad officials on inspection tours of the railroad property.

===Real estate===
A [[property condition assessment]] is the examination for purposes of evaluating a commercial or business property's condition often as a part of a [[due diligence]] investigation for a company to know what it is buying. Building code officials do a [[building inspection]] to determine code compliance in new or altered buildings before issuing a certificate of occupancy. Residential inspections not for code compliance are called a [[home inspection]]. There are numerous types of more specific real estate and infrastructure inspections such as [[windstorm inspection]], [[energy audit]], and [[pipeline video inspection]].

===Software engineering===
{{main|Software inspection}}
[[Software inspection]], in software engineering, refers to peer review of any work product by trained individuals who look for defects using a well defined process.

The '''International Defence Exhibition &amp; Conference''', or '''IDEX''', is a biennial arms and defence technology sales exhibition. According to the [[Jane's Defence Weekly]] website, IDEX is the largest arms exhibition in the [[Middle East]]. The business conducted at the 2005 IDEX totalled 2 billion US dollars. According to [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], the arms sales of the SIPRI Top 100 arms-producing and military services companies in 2013 (outside China) totalled 402 billion US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/media/pressreleases/2014/SIPRI-Top-100-December-2014|title=Sales by largest arms companies fell again in 2013 but Russian firms’ sales continued rising - SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDEX for the past several show have been held in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (U.A.E.) at [[Abu Dhabi]] and will again host in 2015. Sheikh [[Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], President of the UAE and Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces is the show's benefactor. It was previously held at the [[Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre]] and will be held at the same place again in 2015.

As of 2010 well known exhibitors for the 2011 show are [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Airbus|Airbus Group]], Jobaria Defence, Streit Group, [[Oshkosh Corporation]] and [[Saab Group|Saab]].  The show is organized through the state-run Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company ([[ADNEC]]), managed by [[Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri]].

'''Keith Wilson Hay''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CBE|size=85%}} (13 December 1917 – 2 January 1997) was a New Zealand homebuilder, entrepreneur, local body politician and conservative Christian political activist.

Born in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], Hay was the only son of Scottish immigrant William Hay and Elsie Major, who had married three years previously. In 1930, Hay left school at standard six to split fenceposts for a retired headmaster at [[Kohukohu, New Zealand|Kohukohu]], who taught the young man accountancy during the evenings. In 1933, Hay relocated to [[Auckland]] and obtained a job at the KDV Morningside box factory. In 1938, he tried to start his own caravan business, but later found that he was more talented at home building.

In 1942, Hay married Enid Paris in [[Mount Eden]], having joined the New Zealand Army Service Corps in 1941. Although he was initially involved in the Mount Eden branch of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]], he unsuccessfully stood as candidate for breakaway Labour MP [[John A. Lee]] and his [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]] at the [[New Zealand general election, 1943|1943 New Zealand general election]].

During his time at the Army Service Corps, Hay pioneered a number of innovative home building and relocation procedures, and these were to stand him in good stead in civilian life when he started Keith Hay Homes in 1949. In 1953, he moved his company to [[Mount Roskill]].

==Local body politics: 1950–1992==

At the same time as he relocated his company to Mount Roskill, Hay entered local body politics in that semi-rural borough, becoming first a borough councillor (1950) and then Mayor of Roskill Borough (1953–1974). As Mayor, he sold council plant, contracted out services and constructed amenities. After his retirement as Roskill Mayor, Hay was then elected to the [[Auckland Regional Council]], and also served on the [[Auckland International Airport]] Committee. As a civic leader, he was honoured with an OBE in 1966, and a CBE in 1977.

==Political activism: 1972–1987==
Hay was a devout Protestant Christian. As Mount Roskill mayor, he always started his meetings with a prayer service and was responsible for Mount Roskill's status as Auckland's "[[Bible Belt]]." By 1988, it was estimated that there were twenty-six churches for the borough's 35,000 inhabitants.

In 1969, Hay helped to organise a nationwide New Zealand [[Billy Graham Crusade]]. 1972, he was a principal organiser for the [[Marches for Jesus]] that year, which involved an estimated 70,000 people. He then became involved in bitter controversy when he opposed passage of New Zealand's [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]], and earned the enmity of New Zealand's lesbian and gay communities. He established the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]] along with [[Peter Tait (mayor)|Sir Peter Tait]] in 1986, but that organisation failed to achieve its objective of curtailing passage of that legislation. Thereafter, Hay became more reticent, retiring from local body politics and devoting himself to civic charity work.

In 1997, Hay died at [[Auckland City Hospital]], aged seventy-nine. His son, [[David Hay (Auckland politician)|David Hay]], later became Auckland City Deputy Mayor under Mayor [[Les Mills]], and was also noted for his opposition to the [[LGBT rights in New Zealand|gay pride movement]], attacking Auckland's lesbian and gay [[Hero Parade]] in the mid-nineties. Today, David Hay's former home houses the [[Maxim Institute]]'s office.

There is a park and sports field area, [[Keith Hay Park]] in Mt Roskill, named after him.

{{Property law}}

A '''listing contract''' (or '''listing agreement''') is a [[contract]] between a [[real estate broker]] and an owner of [[real property]] granting the broker the authority to act as the owner's agent in the sale of the property.&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listing-agreement.asp | title=Listing Agreement | publisher=Investopedia, LLC | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the broker is a member of the [[National Association of Realtors]], the agreement must include all of the following terms:

#A beginning date and a termination date.
#The ''list price'' at which the property will be offered for sale.
#The amount of compensation offered to the broker, whether it is in the form of a flat fee or percentage of the sales price.
#The terms and conditions under which the brokerage fee shall be paid by the seller.
#Authorizes the broker to co-operate with other brokers as sub-agents or buyer's agents and details the compensation to be offered to those brokers in the event they procure a buyer.
#Authorizes the broker to reveal or not to reveal the existence of offers previously received.

In addition, other terms which may appear in the agreement can include:

*Authorization to the broker to post a sign, to advertise the property, and to put a lockbox on the door, as well seller's obligations to advise the broker on the condition of the property, and broker's obligations to advise the seller about regulations and laws which may affect the sale.

Typically, separate listing agreements exist for the sale of residential property, for land, and for commercial or business property.
&lt;ref name="Emeraldbb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emeraldbb.ca/small-business-for-sale-a-brief-primer/ | title=Things to know before posting business for sale | publisher=Emerald Business Board | accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

Upon listing the property, the real estate agency tries to obtain a buyer for the property and, in consideration of successfully finding a satisfactory buyer, the broker anticipates receiving a commission (fee) for the services the brokerage provided.

==Payment of a commission or fee==
Although the terms of the contract could vary, usually the payment of a commission (or fee) to the brokerage is contingent upon:
*the successful negotiation of a [[real estate contract|purchase contract]] between a satisfactory buyer and seller and the subsequent ability and willingness of the buyer to close the deal, or
*finding a satisfactory buyer who is ready, willing, and able to pay the full listing price (or more) for the real estate for sale without any contingencies.

If the seller refuses to sell the real estate when one of the above two conditions applies, it is typically considered that the real estate agent has done their job of finding a satisfactory buyer and the seller must still pay the commission, although the details are determined by the listing contract.  Unless [[closing (real estate)|closing]] (or "settlement" or "close of escrow", as it is known in some parts of the country) is a condition of the listing agreement, the buyer's failure to complete the transaction may not require the seller to pay a commission to the broker.

The commission is usually a percentage of the sales price of the property ranging from  2 or 3% up to about 10%, but usually in the range of about 3 - 7% for houses.  The commission could also be a flat fee or some combination of flat fee and percentage, based on the rate you negotiate.  Commission rates and fees are negotiable and not regulated. The average days to sale in your market, advertising, labor costs, length of term, and competition may influence the rate acceptable by the listing real estate broker before entering a listing agreement.

The commission is paid by the seller to the listing real estate broker, who will then compensate their listing agent and any co-operating brokers/agents from this commission by separate agreements with them.

==Listing price and final contract price==
The listing contract typically also includes a '''listing price''' for the property and a date of [[wikt:expiration|expiration]] by which the contract expires.  However, if the property is sold at a lower or higher price, the seller pays a commission at a proportionally lower or higher amount.  If the seller does not accept a price lower than the listing price, then the broker will have to wait until a satisfactory sale to earn the commission.

In the event of multiple offers being presented, the seller may accept whichever offer is most suitable to him/her, even if the price is not the highest.  The percentage commission will be paid according to the accepted price.  The seller, often in concurrence with the real estate agent, may choose to accept an offer that is lower than the highest offer for various reasons, such as terms or contingencies in the purchase contract offered or perceived differences in financial qualification of the competing buyers.

Typically, the real estate agent has the experience and data to determine a suitable listing price for the seller's property and will recommend a listing price to the seller.  The seller can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different listing price for the contract.  If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property.

==Expiration date==
Listing a property commonly incurs certain expenses for the listing broker and takes some time and effort for the listing salesperson. To make it worthwhile, they want a certain minimum listing time period to have a good chance of selling the property.  However, the listing contract must have an expiration date.  A typical listing period is often three to six months. If the property is not sold or under a [[real estate contract|purchase contract]] by then, the seller may decide to re-list the property, perhaps with a different listing price, with the same or a different broker or agent, or not list it at all.  The listing of the property can start at a date later than the date the listing contract is signed to allow the seller time to prepare the property for showing or sale.

==Types of listing contracts==
There can be several types of listing contracts:

*'''Exclusive right to sell''': The seller must pay the brokerage a commission if, by the expiration date in the listing contract, the real estate is sold, regardless of whether the buyer is obtained through the agency or not.  Even if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, a commission is still owed to the brokerage.  Furthermore, the seller cannot list the property with any other broker until the listing expires with the property unsold.

:Brokers who are REALTORS and, thus, are members of [[National Association of Realtors|NAR]] are obliged to enter the property into the local [[Multiple Listing Service|MLS]] system and offer compensation to co-operating brokers.

*'''Exclusive Agency''': The seller can only list the property with one brokerage until the listing contract expires with the property unsold.  The seller must pay the broker a commission if the real estate is sold to a buyer obtained through that brokerage.  By agreement, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.  Since there will be no co-operating broker involved, the property will not be listed in the MLS.
*'''Open Agency''': A seller can enter into an agreement to sell their property with more than one brokerage in open agency listings.  The seller must pay a commission only to the brokerage which brings the buyer for the real estate.  Typically, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.&lt;ref name = "investopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nar3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realtor.org/handbook-on-multiple-listing-policy/key-definitions/section-3-definitions-of-various-types-of-listing-agreements | title=Section 3: Definitions of Various Types of Listing Agreements | publisher=National Association of Realtors | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
'''Mind share''' relates generally to the development of consumer awareness or popularity, and is one of the main objectives of [[advertising]] and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]. When people think of examples of a product type or category, they usually think of a limited number of [[brand name]]s. The aim of mind share is to establish a brand as being one of the best kinds of a given product or service, and to even have the brand name become a synonym for the product or service offered.&lt;ref&gt; Madden, Charles S. "Marketers Battle for Mind Share," ''Baylor Business Review'' Vol. 9 (Spring, 1991). 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, a prospective buyer of a college education will have several thousand colleges to choose from. However, the evoked set, or set of schools considered, will probably be limited to about ten. Of these ten, the colleges that the buyer is most familiar with will receive the greatest attention.

Marketers and promoters of mind share try to maximize the popularity of their product, so that the brand co-exists with deeper, more empirical categories of objects. [[Kleenex]], for example, can distinguish itself as a type of tissue. But, because it has gained popularity amongst consumers, it is frequently used as a term to identify any tissue, even if it is from a competing brand.  Q-tips and band-aids would be other examples of this.

One of the most successful firms to have achieved pervasive mind share is [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]], whose name has been synonymous with [[vacuum cleaner]] in the UK for many decades. Similarly, the term "[[googling]]", describing the act of [[Web search engine|online searching]], was derived from the Internet search engine [[Google]]; however, since Google remains the world's most popular search engine, it remains to be seen if the term will become generic for all searches.

Popularity can be established to a greater or lesser degree depending on product and market. For example, in the Southern U.S. it is common to hear people refer to any [[cola]]-flavored [[soft drink]] as a "coke", regardless of whether it is actually produced by [[Coca-Cola]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popvssoda.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal risk of such popularity is that the name may become so widely accepted that it becomes a [[Genericized trademark|generic]] term and loses [[trademark]] protection.{{citation needed|reason=Does it really lose trademark protection by becoming a generic term?|date=February 2018}} Examples include "[[escalator]]", "[[Paracetamol_brand_names#Panadol|panadol]]", "[[chapstick]]", "[[tupperware]]", and "[[bandaid]]".

Other objectives of mind share include short or long term increases in [[sales]], [[market share]], [[product information]], and [[reputation]].

==Career==

===Early life===
Mohammed Al Shaibani graduated from the United States of America in 1988 with a [[Bachelor of Computer Science]]. He started his career at [[Dubai Ports Authority]] and [[Jebel Ali Free Zone]], where he worked for seven years. After that, he moved to [[Singapore]] where he spent four years as Managing Director of Al Khaleej Investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.dubaiworld.ae/board-of-directors/he-mohammed-al-shaibani/|website=Dubai World|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government roles===
Since 1998 Al Shaibani has held the status of President at the Dubai Office, a private management entity for the Royal Family of Dubai. In this capacity, he represented the interests of the ruling family in London for eight years from 1999 to 2007. He currently oversees the functioning of this office from Dubai.

Mohammed Al Shaibani is also a member of the Executive Council, Government of Dubai, which was created in 2003 to support government authorities in maintaining the stability and organization of the emirate, in addition to developing its society and economy. Moreover, the Executive Council is responsible for setting and implementing the general strategy of Dubai, as well as enforcing local laws. The Council also sets the annual budget for the Government of Dubai, and ensures the smooth functioning of government bodies among other administrative duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Executive Council|url=http://www.tec.gov.ae/tec/|website=The Executive Council|publisher=Government of Dubai|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HH The Ruler's Court, Government of Dubai, in 2012.jpg|thumb|right|The Ruler's Court of the Government of Dubai in Bur Dubai in 2012]]Al Shaibani also serves as the Vice Chairman of the Supreme Fiscal Committee (SFC) of Dubai since its inception in 2007. This five-man [[committee]] supervises the Dubai Financial Support Fund, which provides [[loans]] on a commercial basis to government and government-related entities that are of strategic importance to the development of the Emirate of Dubai. The SFC assesses and approves the loan criteria needed to grant the financial support to entities and projects, and reviews applications proposed by the fund's board. It also determines the size and terms of each loan as well as the nature of the related [[securities]] and [[guarantees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish|first1=John|last2=Graham|first2=Patrick|title=FACTBOX-The men behind Dubai's supreme fiscal committee|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/07/22/dubai-finance-idINLM18740020090722|website=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Al Shaibani was appointed Director General of The Ruler’s Court, Government of Dubai, by Emiri decree issued by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai. The Ruler’s Court or Diwan is the traditional seat of power in Dubai and various government units operate under its umbrella, such as the Department of Finance, Dubai Courts and the Executive Council, to name a few. In this role, Mohammed Al Shaibani initiated in 2008 a wave cracking down corporate corruption in Dubai.

===Business involvement===
Mohammed Al Shaibani’s strong knowledge of [[Islamic finance|Islamic financial services]] led him to be selected as Chairman of the [[Board of Directors]] of [[Dubai Islamic Bank]] (DIB) in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammed Al Shaibani appointed Chairman of Dubai Islamic Bank|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/Mohammed_Al_Shaibani_appointed_Chairman_of_Dubai_Islamic_Bank/29042.htm|website=UAEinteract|publisher=UAE National Media Council|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; one the U.A.E’s largest banks. [[Dubai Islamic Bank|DIB]] is also considered as the first bank in the world to apply [[Islamic]] principles in all its practices.

Such assets contribute to the growth of Dubai and range from leading [[financial services]] companies to local [[real estate]] giants, including renowned [[transportation]] and [[utilities]] corporations.

In 2010, Al Shaibani has been appointed as a member of the Board of Directors of [[Dubai World]], the government-owned holding focused on urban development.

'''Hajj Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan''' ([[Arabic]]: موسى بن عبد الرحمن بن حسن) was an [[Omani]] businessman, tribal leader, landlord &amp; a Gulf icon; he was born in the old town of Muscat in 1902 and finished his studies in the American Mission School. He established a firm in 1927 in supplying coals and foodstuffs to British ships &amp; frigates in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]].&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.moosagroup.com/ourgrp.asp Moosa AbdulRahman Group Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postal services==
Haji Moosa was one of the pioneer users and establishers of the Post Office Box in the [[Sultanate of Oman]]. Omanis abroad (especially East Africa, other Gulf States and India) used to send him mails to his personal mailbox and he used to deliver them to people later on, hence it was like a public address for anyone to use. The company still maintains the same P.O. Box 4 Muscat.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.moosagroup.com/ourgrp.asp Moosa AbdulRahman Group Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking and finance==
Hajj Moosa also established a money transfer service between the 1940s and 1960s through his well established &amp; recognized P.O. Box 4 Muscat, which functionally operated as a first money transferring &amp; wiring service hub for many Omanis who were living &amp; working in [[East Africa]], [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] and [[India]]. This complimentary service was introduced to aid Omanis, who were living abroad back then, to send and receive money, as it proved difficult due to the lack of professional &amp; commercial banking services at that time. It’s worth mentioning, this free of charge financial service was provided well before [[Western Union]] was established in the region. 
Furthermore, he was a founding member &amp; the local director of [[The British Bank of The Middle East]], which was established in 1948. The bank is one of the oldest banks not only in the Oman, but also in the entire region. Later on in the mid 1970s, he was involved in establishing Bank of Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait, which was a joined venture with [[Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait]] (BBK).

==Business and trade==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MoosaEstBuilding.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan Establishment's Head Office in the late 1940s.]] --&gt;

Muscat, well through the early to mid part of the 20th century, was recognized as the center of trade between the Arabian Peninsula, Indian Coast, East Africa and other parts of Oman. Hajj Moosa traded variety of goods including dates, dried fish and timber. Furthermore, he housed the travelling traders in his residence, which later on was converted to a hall that is used to host various social occasions.

Due to his involvement of trading in kerosene, which was the main source of energy at that time, Hajj Moosa was chosen by [[The British Petroleum Company]] (BP) to become their representative in Oman. He owned a network of BP filling stations in Muscat and Batinah's coast.

He also got into a partnership with the British Gary McKenzie, and Oman's W.J.Towell &amp; Co., which formed Gary McKenzie Moosa Towell Group Of Companies, which later became Oman United Agencies. The company catered supplies and logistics for oil companies in Oman, which also had a foodstuff division and a travel agency.  Hajj Moosa originally formed the company in 1956 before it partnered up with other partners.

Moosa Furniture, which was the furnishing arm of the establishment, has successfully done furnishing projects for many ministries and government owned organizations especially in the 1970s. 
Hajj Moosa also represented brands such as [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] cameras, [[Eterna]] Matic Swiss watches in the Omani market throughout the 1970s, until these agencies were sold to other merchants in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.jepeterson.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Oman_Diverse_Society_Southern_Oman.pdf Oman's Diverse Society by J.E. Peterson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture and irrigation ==
Hajj Moosa has ventured with a leading firm from the UK in order to construct a project from water supply in Muscat and Mattrah. He also represented various UK companies that are involved in water pumps and diesel generators, which helped to boost the agricultural sector in Oman very fast. They were supplied and disturbed to many regions of Oman and The United Arab Emirates.
[[Al Khaleej (newspaper)|Al Khaleej]] Daily Newspaper, on its 17 February 2012 issue,&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.alkhaleej.ae/portal/0809fc08-fa30-4580-92f0-2e6fcd12ebc6.aspx Sheikh Zayed's Efforts In The Agricultural Sector In The 1960s]&lt;/ref&gt; stated his contributions with late [[Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] in the agricultural sector of the United Arab Emirates, specifically in Al Dhaqdaqah irrigation project in Ras al Khaimah.

==Electricity==
As stated earlier, Hajj Moosa was the supplier of kerosene, which was the primary source of energy back then, as well as the distributor of diesel generators. Both of them were needed in order to supply the country’s demand for energy and electricity. He also formed the first electricity company in Mattrah-Oman, with two other partners, in order to cater the increasing demand for energy in the country.

==Construction and real estate development==
Moosa AbdulRahman Establishment was also involved in the construction sector when it partnered with the British Contracting firm, Costain, which was involved in building the Postal Office Building in Muscat, the expansions in Bait Al-Falaj in Ruwi area of Muscat, as well as defense camps in Bait Al-Falaj and Bidbid. He also partnered with Oman's leading businessmen late [[Qais Al-Zawawi]], Suhail Bahwan and Mohsin Haider Darwish to establish Qurum Contracting Company,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jepeterson.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Oman_Diverse_Society_Southern_Oman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest local contracting companies back then. 
The company was one of the pioneer investors in Madinat Al-Sultan Qaboos Project. Today the company owns and develops many commercial and residential real estate projects in Oman, UAE, Lebanon, The [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]] among others.

==Automotive==
Hajj Moosa was an automotive dealer in the 1950s being successful in acquiring the agency of [[Holden]], which makes him one of the oldest automotive dealers not only in Oman, but in the entire region as well. He further became the agent of Bedford Trucks, which was also supplied for the Omani Army. In the 1960s the automotive division got more agencies and represented Vauxhall and India Super Tires. In the 1970s &amp; 1980’s, he became the distributor of [[Pontiac]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle &amp; Engine|Kawasaki]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Opel]], [[Suzuki]], Foton, Mantra and many other leading global automotive brands. The defense and military division also kept growing by supplying specially built vehicles for the Omani Army.

==Governmental roles==
Hajj Moosa AbdulRahman, played an instrumental role in establishing the first municipal council in Oman in the 1950s.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moosa Abdulrahman in his office in 1950s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan in his office in the late 1950s]] --&gt;

In addition, Oman's Currency Board was established in 1972 by a Royal Decree; Hajj Moosa was the Vice Chairman of the board and the Secretary of Finance of the board.

His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al-Said, issued a Royal Decree on 21 May 1972 to establish a committee to resolve commercial disputes, which consisted of the late Hajj Moosa, late [[Qais Al-Zawawi]], Mohammed Al-Zubair, Mohsin Haider Darwish, late Ali Dawood Al-Raisi, late Hajj Jafar AbdulRahim and late Hajj Ali Sultan.
He was also assigned in the 1970s in the committee to form Oman's Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

[[His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said]], Sultan of Oman; granted late Hajj Moosa AbdulRahman in 1983 Oman's Civil Medal for his social, economical &amp; political contributions to Oman &amp; to Omani civil societies.

Hajj Moosa died on 21 April 1987, leaving a long legacy of accomplishments and services to his country &amp; community, he is survived by two sons (Abdullah &amp; Ali), who are the family’s patriarchs &amp; looking after family’s business, social &amp; governmental interests.

'''New Belgrade''' ({{lang-sr|Нови Београд/Novi Beograd}}, {{IPA-sh|nôʋiː beǒɡrad|pron}}) is a [[Subdivisions of Belgrade|municipality]] of the city of [[Belgrade]]. It is the [[central business district]] in [[Serbia]] and one of the major ones in [[Southeast Europe]]. It was a [[Planned community|planned]] municipality, built since 1948 in a previously uninhabited area on the left bank of the [[Sava]] river, opposite old Belgrade. In recent years, it has become the central business district of Belgrade and its fastest developing area, with many businesses moving to the new part of the city, due to more modern infrastructure and larger available space. With 212,104 inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.popis2011.stat.rs/2011/prvi_rezultati.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tab-2_10112011.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the second most populous [[municipalities of Serbia|municipality of Serbia]] after [[Novi Sad]].

==Geography==

New Belgrade is located on the left bank of the [[Sava]] River, in the easternmost part of the [[Srem]] region. Administratively, its northeastern section touches the right bank of the [[Danube]], right before the Sava's confluence. It is generally located west of the 'Old' Belgrade to which it is connected by six bridges ([[Gazela Bridge|Gazela]], [[Branko's Bridge]], [[Old Railway Bridge, Belgrade|Old Railway Bridge]], [[New Railway Bridge, Belgrade|New Railway Bridge]] and [[Ada Bridge]]).  [[European route E75]], with five [[grade separation]]s, including a new double-looped one at the [[Belgrade Arena]], goes right through the middle of the settlement.

The municipality of New Belgrade covers an area of {{convert|40.74|km2|sqmi}}. Its terrain is flat, which poses a high contrast to the old Belgrade, built on 32 hills total. Except for its western section, [[Bežanija]], New Belgrade is built on a terrain that was essentially a swamp when construction of the new city began in 1948. For years, kilometers-long [[conveyor belt]]s were transporting sand from the Danube's island of [[Malo Ratno Ostrvo]], almost completely destroying it in the process, and only a small, narrow strip of wooded land remains today. Thus, it is romantically said that New Belgrade is actually built on an island. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008|reason=please give a link where that is said}}

Other geographic features are the peninsula of [[Mala Ciganlija]] and the island of [[Ada Međica]], both on the Sava and the bay of ''Zimovnik'' (''winter shelter''), engulfed by Mala Ciganlija, with the facilities of the ''Beograd'' [[shipyard]]. The [[loess]] slope of [[Bežanija#Bežanijska Kosa|Bežanijska Kosa]] is located in the western part of the municipality, while in the southern, the ''Galovica'' river canal flows into the Sava.

Though it has no forests in the real sense, of all municipalities of Belgrade, Novi Beograd has the largest green areas, with a total of {{convert|3.47|km2}}, or 8.5% of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Srpska-prestonica-u-ciframa.lt.html|title=Srpska prestonica u brojkama|language=Serbian|author=Daliborka Mučibabić|publisher=[[Politika]]|date=26 April 2008|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of these are made up of the large [[Ušće]] park. The latest addition to Belgrade parks, [[Park Republika Srpska]] from 2008, is also located in the municipality.

There are no separate settlements within the municipality, as the entire area administratively belongs to the Belgrade City proper and is statistically classified as part of Belgrade (''Beograd-deo''). The area located around the municipal assembly building and the nearby [[roundabout]] is considered to be New Belgrade's center.

As it was planned and constructed, New Belgrade was divided into blocks. Currently, there are 72 blocks (with several sub-blocks, like 70-a, etc.). Old core of the village of Bežanija, Ada Međica, and Mala Ciganlija, as well as the area along the highway west of Bežanijska Kosa are not divided into blocks, while due to the administrative borders changes, some of the blocks (9, 9-a, 9-b, 11, 11-c and 50) belong to the municipality of [[Zemun]], extending north of New Belgrade as one continuous built-up area.

In September 2018, Belgrade's mayor [[Zoran Radojičić]] announced that the construction of a dam on the Danube, in the Zemun-New Belgrade area, will start soon. The dam should protect the city during the high water levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = J.D. | title = Gradiće se brana na Dunavu! | trans-title = A dam will be built on the Danube | newspaper = [[Večernje Novosti]] | language = Serbian | date = 18 September 2018 | url = http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/beograd.74.html:750114-Gradice-se-brana-na-Dunavu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Tanjug]] | title = Uskoro gradnja brane na Dunavu kod Novog Beograda | trans-title = Soon building of the dam on the Danube at New Belgrade | newspaper = [[Blic]] | language = Serbian | date = 17 September 2018 | url = https://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/uskoro-gradnja-brane-na-dunavu-kod-novog-beograda/n3dfdxn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such project was never mentioned before, nor it was clear how and where it will be constructed, or if it's feasible at all. Radojičić clarified after a while that he was referring to the temporary, mobile [[flood wall]]. The wall will be {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} long, stretching from the [[Branko's Bridge]] across the Sava and the neighborhood of [[Ušće]], to the ''Radecki'' restaurant on the Danube's bank in the Zemun's [[Gardoš]] neighborhood. In case of emergency, the panels will be placed on the existing construction. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019 and to finish in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dejan Aleksić | title = Umesto džakova, mobilna brana protiv poplava | trans-title = Mobile dam against the flood, instead of sandbags | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 September 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/411597/Umesto-dzakova-mobilna-brana-protiv-poplava}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Novi most.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ada Bridge]]

Bežanija is the oldest part of today's New Belgrade, where a settlement existed from the [[neolithic]] to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period.

In the book ''Kruševski pomenik'' from 1713, which is kept in the Dobrun monastery near [[Višegrad]], settlement of Bežanija was mentioned for the first time under its present name as far as 1512, as a small village with 32 houses, populated by [[Serbs]].&lt;ref name="imperija"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/221990/Bezanija-od-imperije-do-tranzicije|author=Nikola Belić|title= Bežanija, od imperije do tranzicije|date=11 June 2012 |publisher=[[Politika]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time, the village was under the administration of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary (medieval)|Kingdom of Hungary]], and was part of the [[Syrmia County]]. The inhabitants of the village crossed the Sava river and settled in Syrmia after fleeing the fall of the medieval [[Serbian Despotate]] under the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (hence the name ''bežanija'', "refugee camp" in archaic Serbian).

In 1521, the village became part of the Ottoman Empire. From 1527 to 1530, Bežanija was part of [[Radoslav Čelnik]]'s Duchy of Syrmia, an Ottoman vassal, until its subsequent organization into the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Syrmia]]. The [[Habsburg Monarchy]] conquered it temporarily during the [[Great Turkish War]] (1689-1691), but it remained under Ottoman administration until 1718. In 1718, the village became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and was placed under military administration. It was part of the Habsburg [[Military Frontier]] ([[Petrovaradin]] regiment of [[Slavonian Krajina]]). During the 17th and 18th century, hunger and constant Turkish intrusions devastated the village, but it was constantly being repopulated by the refugees from central Serbia. In 1810, population census counted 115, mostly Serbian households. By the 1850s, Austrians colonized a large number of Germans in Bežanija.&lt;ref name="imperija"/&gt; In 1848-1849 it was part of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]], an ethnic Serb autonomous region within the Austrian Empire, but in 1849 was again placed under administration of the Military Frontier.

As the Frontier was abolished in 1881-1882, it became part of the [[Syrmia County]] within the autonomous Habsburg kingdom [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], which was located within the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1910, the largest ethnic group in the village were [[Serbs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3899/vojvodina1910.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007194009/http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3899/vojvodina1910.png |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sizable ethnic groups were [[Germans]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Croats]]. After dissolution of Austria-Hungary, in autumn of 1918, Bežanija became part of the newly formed [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 24 November 1918, as part of [[Syrmia]] region, the village became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], and on December 1, it became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (future [[Yugoslavia]]).

From 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County and from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia Oblast. Bežanija became part of the wider [[Belgrade]] area for the first time in 1929 after [[coup d'état]] conducted by the king [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], who, among other things, draw a new map of Yugoslavia's administrative division creating a new administrative unit ''Uprava grada Beograda'' or ''Administration of the City of Belgrade'' which comprised [[Belgrade]], [[Zemun]] (with Bežanija) and [[Pančevo]].

===Inter-war period===
Between the two world wars of the 20th century, communities sprung up closer to the Sava river in Staro Sajmište and Novo Naselje. The idea of building a new settlement across the Sava was officially presented in 1922 and the first urbanization plans for Belgrade's expansion to the Sava's left bank were drawn up in 1923, but a lack of either funds or the manpower needed to drain out the swampy terrain put them on hold indefinitely. The project was conceived by Đorđe Kovljanski and it included an idea of creating an island from the [[Savamala]] neighborhood (he coined the term "Sava amphitheatre") in old Belgrade.&lt;ref name="Ponos"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mučibabić, Nikola Belić| title = Ponos socijalističke gradnje – centar biznisa i trgovine | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 19 | language = Serbian | date = 11 April 2013 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He even envisioned the bridge across the northern tip of [[Ada Ciganlija]], across the Sava, which realized in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Nikola Belić  | title = Gorostasi nad rekama kao svedoci istorije | newspaper = Politika | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 4 January 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/203395/Gorostasi-nad-rekama-kao-svedoci-istorije}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Petar Kokotović opened a [[kafana]] on [[Tošin Bunar]] with the prophetic name ''Novi Beograd''. After 1945 Kokotović was president of the local community of Novo Naselje–Bežanija which later grew into the municipality of Novi Beograd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|author-link=Dragoljub Žarković|title=Bitka za Beograd|newspaper=[[Politika]]|page=11|language=Serbian|date=2008-04-11|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 an airport was built in Bežanija and in 1928 the ''Rogožerski'' factory was constructed. In 1934 plans were expanded to include the creation of a new urban tissue which connected Belgrade and Zemun, as Zemun was administratively annexed to the city of Belgrade in 1929, losing separate city status in 1934. A [[King Alexander Bridge]] was also built over the Sava River and a tram line connecting Belgrade and Zemun was established. Also, a Zemun airport was built.

A sandy beach with the cabins, [[kafana]]s and barracks, used as sheds by the fishermen, occupied the area of the modern [[Ušće]] quay, north of the [[Branko's Bridge]]. It was one of the favorite vacation spots of Belgraders during [[Interbellum]]. People were transported from the city by small boats and the starting point was a small kafana "Malo pristanište" in [[Savamala]]. Occupying the left bank of the Sava, it was on the location of the access ramp for the future King Alexander Bridge so it had to be removed. The objects were demolished manually, including numerous kafanas: "Ostend", "Zdravlje", "Abadžija", "Jadran", "Krf", "Dubrovnik", "Adrija", etc. The only one that wasn't demolished was "Nica", predecessor of the modern Ušće restaurant. In total, 20 proper objects and 2,000 cabins, barracks, sheds, etc. were demolished, jointly by the municipalities of Zemun and Bežanija, which owned half of the land each, and the proprietors of the objects. The plan was to build an embankment instead. However, the beach itself survived the construction of the bridge in 1934 as it only made access easier. The beach was finally closed in 1938 when the construction of the embankment began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/beograd.74.html:528774-Seoba-sa-savskog-kupalista | author = Zoran Nikolić | title = Beogradske priče: Seoba sa savskog kupališta | trans-title = Belgrade stories: Moving out from the Sava beach | date = 14 January 2015 | publisher = Večernje Novosti | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The beach itself was called Nica (Serbian for [[Nice]], in [[France]]) after one of the kafanas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mučibabić &amp; Nikola Belić| title = Ponos socijalističke gradnje – centar biznisa i trgovine | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 19 | language = Serbian | date = 11 April 2013 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Danish investors offered to the city government their project of constructing a new settlement between Belgrade and Zemun, on the left bank of the Sava. In February 1937 they sent a very elaborate proposal with maps to the then mayor of Belgrade, [[Vlada Ilić]]. Danes offered to do it for 94 million 1937 dinars and the city administration replied that the project got their fullest attention, but that citizens of Belgrade and Zemun should have a say, too, about this new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Danci nude da naspu i urede Novi Beograd između Beograda i Zemuna| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 4 March 1937 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August Danish investors held a meeting with mayor Ilić. This time, they offered to build the entire modern neighborhood for free, but to retain the right to sell the lots to private buyers who are interested into building houses in the neighborhood, in the total amount of over 80 million dinars, while the city would remain the owner of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Danci i dalje nude da podignu naselje između Zemunskog mosta i Zemuna| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 29 August 1937 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A contract was signed on 24 February 1938. Danish representatives announced that their ships will reach Belgrade by 12 to 15 May 1938. Among them, there was one special ship. It was to dredge the bottom of the Danube in the vicinity of Great War Island and to eject the dredged earthy materials through pipes in the swamp, filling it. It was planned to fill the area on the right side of the Zemun road, which extended across the King Alexander Bridge across the Sava. It was expected that the work, estimated at 30 million dinars, will be finished by 1940 when the area was to become a nice, dried and elevated filled terrain suitable for the start of the construction of the "newest Belgrade". The project was described as the "displacement of the Sava's confluence into the Danube".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Premešta se ušće Save u Dunav | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 17 April 1938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the deal never materialized.

In 1930s members of Belgrade's affluent elite began to buy land from the villagers of Bežanija, which at that time, administratively spread all the way to the King Alexander Bridge, which was a dividing point between Bežanija and Zemun. From 1933 a settlement, consisting mostly of individual villas, began to develop. Also, a group of [[Belarus]] [[white émigré|emigrants]] built several small buildings, mostly rented by the [[bullocky|carters]] who carried goods across the river. As the settlement, which became known as New Belgrade, was built without building permits, authorities threatened to demolish it, but in 1940 government officially "legalized the informal settlement of New Belgrade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/beograd.74.html:594635-Beogradske-price-Novi-Beograd-rodjen-na-Starom-sajmu|author=Zoran Nikolić|title= Beogradske priče – Novi Beograd rođen na Starom sajmu|date=9 March 2016|publisher=[[Večernje Novosti]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, the city already semi-officially recognized the new settlement, as it helped with building its streets and pathways. By 1939 it already had several thousands inhabitants, a representative in the city hall, and was unofficially called New Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = "Elitno" naselje "Novi Beograd" napreduje| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = | language = Serbian | date = 12 June 1939 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, for the purpose of hosting [[Belgrade Fair]], a complex of buildings was erected next to the already existing community. Spread over 15 thousand square metres, it hosted fairs and exhibitions designed to show off the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]'s developing economy. Also this year, the municipality of Belgrade signed a contract with two Danish construction companies, [[Kampsax]] and [[MT Højgaard|Højgaard &amp; Schultz]], to build the new neighbourhood. Engineer Branislav Nešić was entrusted with leading the project. He even continued his involvement on the project after 1941 when the Nazis conquered, occupied, and dissolved the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because of this, the new communist authorities who came to power after 1945 put Nešić on trial as a collaborator. As the complex never hosted any fairs again and the new Belgrade Fair was built across the river, the area became known as [[Staro Sajmište]] ("Old Fairground").

On 22 February 1941, mayor of Belgrade [[Jovan Tomić]] and architect [[Dragiša Brašovan]] held a press conference, announcing plans for the future. The plans were made for New Belgrade and the Sava's bank in "Old" Belgrade. The new town was to be built on {{convert|6|km2|abbr=on}} and have 500,000 inhabitants, even though the entire Belgrade at that time had a bit over 350,000 people. Tomić issued a ban for the private owners to purchase the land, so that all land designated for the future town will remain city owned. He also asked from the state government to banish all private land owners on the Sava's right bank, located between the [[Belgrade Main railway station]] and the river and to confiscate the land. Further plans included the filling of the arm of the Danube and turning the Great War Island into the peninsula and erection of the monumental memorial on it. The project also included two new bridges across the Sava, which would connect the old and the new part of the city, one on the location of the modern Gazela bridge (which was built in 1970) and another in the continuation of the [[Nemanjina Street]]. Because of the latter bridge, Tomić planned to demolish the building of the Belgrade Main railway station and relocate the facility in the neighborhood of [[Prokop (Belgrade)|Prokop]], thus clearing further {{convert|1|km2|abbr=on}} of space for the commercial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | author = Nenad Novak Stefanović | title = Dom oca Novog Beograda | trans-title = Home of the New Belgrade's father | newspaper = Politika-Moja kuća | page = 1 | language = Serbian | date = 29 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the new railway station in Prokop indeed began, but in 1977 and as of 2018 is still not finished, though in 2017 it took over the domestic transportation.

===World War II===
In 1941, German forces occupied much of Yugoslavia. [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] secret police, [[Gestapo]], took over the fairgrounds (''Sajmište''). They encircled it with several rings of barbed wire turning it into a "collection centre". It eventually became an [[extermination camp]], the [[Sajmište concentration camp]]. Until May 1942 it was mostly used to kill off [[Jews of Serbia|Jews]] from Belgrade and other parts of Serbia, and from April 1942 onwards, it also held political prisoners. Executions of captured prisoners lasted as long as the camp existed. November 1946 report released by the Yugoslav State Commission for Crimes of Occupiers and their Collaborators claims that close to 100,000 prisoners came through the Sajmište's gates. It is estimated that around 48,000 people perished inside the camp.

===Rapid development===
[[File:Novi Beograd - The SIV building.jpg|thumb|SIV 1 or [[Palace of Serbia|Palata Srbije]]]]
[[File:Novi Beograd nocu.jpg|thumb|left|View of New Belgrade at night]]

First sketches of urbanistic plans were developed by [[Nikola Dobrović]] in 1946 and preparations began in 1947.&lt;ref name="Ponos"/&gt; Architect [[Mihajlo Mitrović]] called New Belgrade "an obsessive vision of Dobrović".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Mihajlo Mitrović | title = Savograd: helidrom za ptice i feniksa | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 15 October 2010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A monograph on the construction of New Belgrade by Slobodan Ristanović described what the area looked liked before the city was built: "In the thick reeds and bulrush there were many snakes and frogs, fishes and leeches. Above this swamp, flocks of birds were circling and the swarms of mosquitos and other insects were going up and down. Just few houses and occasional shack in the marsh around the Zemun airport, so as the derelict neighborhood of Staro Sajmište attested the human presence in that inhospitable ambience."&lt;ref name=sedam&gt;{{ cite news | author = Ana Vuković, Dejan Aleksić | title = Sedam decenija grada brigadira | trans-title = Seven decades of the brigadiers' city | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 11 April 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/401713/Sedam-decenija-grada-brigadira }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on 11 April 1948, three years after [[World War II]] ended, that the ground was broken on a huge construction project, which would give birth to what is known today as New Belgrade. During first three years of construction alone, over 200,000 workers and engineers from all over the freshly liberated country took part in the building process. Work brigades, parts of the [[Youth work actions]] made up of villagers brought in from rural Serbia provided most of the manual labour. Even high school and university student volunteers took part. It was backbreaking labour that went on day and night. With no notable technological tools to speak of, mixing of concrete and spreading of sand were done by hand with horse carriages only used for extremely heavy lifting. The concept of Youth work actions continued up to 1990 and the objects built this way include the Studentski Grad, Block 7, Block 7a, Paviljoni, Gazela Bridge, Hospital Bežanijska Kosa, SIV, etc.&lt;ref name=sedam/&gt;

Before the actual construction started, the terrain was evenly covered with sand from the Sava and the Danube rivers in an effort to dry out the land and raise it above the reach of flooding and underground streams.

Among the first to go up was the SIV 1 building, which housed the [[Federal Executive Council (Yugoslavia)|Federal Executive Council]] (SIV). The building has 75,000 square metres of usable space. Built during the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], it was also used during the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] before its dissolution. The building was renamed to Palata Srbije, and now houses some departments of the Serbian government.

First buildings for classic residential purposes were built as pavilions close to the area known as [[Tošin Bunar]] (Toša's Well). [[Studentski Grad (Belgrade)|Studentski Grad]] (Student City) complex was also built around the same time to meet the residence needs of the growing [[University of Belgrade]] student body that came from other parts of [[Yugoslavia]].
[[File:Palace of Serbia 2.jpg|thumb|900px|center|SIV 1 or [[Palace of Serbia|Palata Srbije]]]]

Buildings sprung up one after another and by 1952, New Belgrade was officially a municipality. In 1955 the municipality of Bežanija was annexed to New Belgrade. It was for years the biggest construction site in [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] and a huge source of pride for country's [[communist]] authorities that oversaw the project.

In general, development of New Belgrade is divided in four major phases, all of which have a landmark buildings constructed in that periods:&lt;ref name="Ponos"/&gt;

a) First phase (1948-1958)
* completion of the first residential blocks, 7 and 7a;
* founding of the first local community “Pionor” (now [[Paviljoni]]);
* completion of the [[Studentski Grad (Belgrade)|Studentski Grad]] (1949-1955).

b) Second phase (1958-1968)
* Friendhip Park and [[Palace of Serbia|SIV]] completed in 1961;
* Building of the Municipality of New Belgrade finished (1961–64);
* [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade|Museum of Contemporary Art]] finished in 1965;
* [[Ušće Tower]], completed in 1964
* [[Hotel Jugoslavija]] Opened 1968

c) Third phase (1968-2000)
*  Residential blocks 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 45 and 70 (first half of the 1970s)
* [[Sava Centar]] with Hotel Intercontinental (now [[Crowne Plaza Belgrade]]) opened in 1977.
* [[Western City Gate]] finished in 1980

d) Modern period (from 2000)
* [[Belgrade Arena]], finished in 2004
* [[Delta City]], opened in 2007
* [[Belville (Belgrade)|Belville Complex]], opened in 2009
* [[Sava City]] Opened in 2009
* [[Airport City Belgrade]]
*  Ušće Shopping Mall, opened in 2009

==Neighbourhoods==
Just like other municipalities of Serbia, New Belgrade is further divided into ''local communities'' (Serbian: ''mesna zajednica''). Apart from Bežanija and [[Staro Sajmište]], no other neighbourhoods have historical or traditional names, as Novi Beograd did not exist as such. However, in the five decades of its existence, some of its parts gradually became known as distinct neighborhoods of their own.

==Architecture==
=== Ikarus building ===

As of 2018, one of the oldest surviving buildings in New Belgrade is the former administrative building of the ''Ikarus'' company, built in 1938. It is located in the modern Block 9-a, at 3-a ''Gramšijeva'' street. In June 2017 it was announced that the building will be demolished so that private investor can build a [[highrise]] instead. Locals organized in an effort to adapt the building into the museum instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author =Ana Vuković | title = Stanari sanjaju muzej, investitor planira šestospratnicu | newspaper = Politika | pages = 17 | language = Serbian | date = 21 June 2017| url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/383360/Stanari-sanjaju-muzej-investitor-planira-sestospratnicu}}&lt;/ref&gt; City government, which in 2015 stated that the building will not be demolished, issued a demolition permit in February 2018. Citizen protested, demolished the [[construction hoarding]] and physically preventing the investor to destroy the building, so police intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.danas.rs/politika/inicijativa-ne-davimo-beorgad-necemo-dozvoliti-da-zgradu-ikarusa-sruse/ | author = U.

Still, a heavy demolition machinery was brought so citizens protested again in March. Inheritors of the pre-World War II owners of the "Ikarus" company, which was nationalized after 1945, applied for the restitution.&lt;ref name=ikarus&gt;{{ cite news | author = Ana Vuković, Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Komšije uplašene za sudbinu zgrade "Ikarusa" | trans-title = Neighbors afraid for the future of the "Ikarus" building | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date =  5 March 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/399455/Komsije-uplasene-za-sudbinu-zgrade-Ikarusa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative building of the former airplane factory was a symbol of the industrial development of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during the Interbellum. Apart from being one of the oldest preserved objects in New Belgrade, it was the only representative of the [[Art Deco]] in the municipality. Citizens proposed that the building might be adapted into the Museum of New Belgrade or a branch of the [[Museum of Aviation, Belgrade|Museum of Aviation]]. The building was not protected by the law.&lt;ref name=ikarus/&gt; Still, the building was demolished in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nspm.rs/hronika/beograd-srusena-upravna-zgrada-ikarusa-nekadasnje-fabrike-aviona-i-jedne-od-najstarijih-zgrada-na-novom-beogradu.html | title = Београд: Срушена управна зграда Икаруса, некадашње фабрике авиона и једна од најстаријих зграда на Новом Београду | trans-title = Belgrade: the administrative building of Ikarus, former airplane factory and one of the oldest buildings in New Belgrade, was demolished | date = 3 July 2018 | publisher = [[Nova srpska politička misao]] | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1945 ===
[[Image:Belgrade. Bulevar Mihajla Pupina.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Šest kaplara buildings]]

Architects who are most deserving for New Belgrade's development are Uroš Martinović, Milutin Glavički, Milosav Mitić, Dušan Milenković and Leonid Lenarčić. They drafted the city's regulatory plan in 1962 which encompassed all the previous ideas, solutions and propositions.&lt;ref name="Ponos"/&gt;

New Belgrade developed on [[Le Corbusier]]'s principles of the "[[Ville Radieuse|sun city]]", which includes lots of green areas and infrastructure which can easily be upgraded. In general, city developed in the style of urban [[modern architecture]] and is considered to be a major representative of that style, along with [[Brasilia]] in [[Brazil]], [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]] and [[Velenje]] in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="Ponos"/&gt;

Characteristic for the buildings in New Belgrade is that many of them got nicknames. Best known ones include:&lt;ref name="Ponos"/&gt;
* "Šest kaplara" (Six corporals), Block 21, as most apartments were settled by the military personnel and their families;
* "Televizorka" (TV-screen building), Block 28, due to the look of its windows;
* "Tri sestre" (Three sisters), Fontana, three identical buildings;
* "Potkovica" (Horseshoe), Block 28, due to its shape; 
* "Pendrek", "Sirotica" and "Besna kobila" (Police baton, Poor girl and Mad mare), near Studentski Grad, as the first was populated by the policemen's families, second by the socially endangered and third by the well-to-do members of the Communist party;
* "Mercedes", Block 38, three connected buildings in the shape of the car's logo;
* "Lamela" or "Meander", Block 21; next to "Šest kaplara", with {{convert|972.5|m|abbr=on}} it is the longest residential building in [[former Yugoslavia]]. It was built from 1960 to 1966 and officially named "B-7";&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Goran V.

Ever since the construction began in 1948, New Belgrade experienced explosive population growth, but this trend stopped during the 1990s and became negative. As of 2011, the municipality of New Belgrade has a population of 212,104 inhabitants.

==Economy==
[[File:Novi Beograd - 25 block - A business building.JPG|thumb|Corner of Block 25]]
[[File:Usće tower and the Moon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ušće Tower]]]]

As all of the [[socialist]] governments considered [[heavy industry]] to be the driving force of the entire economy, it for decades dominated New Belgrade's economy too: [[Industry of Machinery and Tractors]] (IMT), Metallic [[cast iron]] factory (FOM), [[shipyard]] "Beograd" (formerly "Tito"), large heating plant in Savski Nasip, "MINEL" electro-construction company, etc. All of these complexes will be removed and develop in business and residential areas.

In the 1990s with the collapse of gigantic state-owned companies, New Belgrade's local economy bounced back by switching to commercial facilities, with dozens of [[shopping mall]]s and entire commercial sections such as [[Mercator Center Belgrade]], [[Ušće Tower|Ušće Mall]], [[Delta City Belgrade]] etc. These activities are further enhanced in the 2000s (decade). The 'Open Shopping Mall' or the Belgrade's [[flea market]] is also located in New Belgrade.

New Belgrade became the main business district in Serbia and one of major in Southeast Europe. Many companies choose New Belgrade for regional centers  such as [[IKEA]], [[Energoprojekt holding]], [[Delta Holding]], [[MK Group]], [[DHL Express|DHL]], [[Air Serbia]], [[OMV]], [[Siemens]], [[Société Générale]], [[Telekom Srbija]], [[Telenor Serbia]], [[Unilever]], [[Vip mobile]], [[Yugoimport SDPR]], [[Ericsson]], [[Colliers International]], [[CB Richard Ellis]], [[SNC-Lavalin]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Huawei]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[Arabtec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:474967-Iz-Beograda-osvajaju-Balkan|title=Iz Beograda osvajaju Balkan|publisher=Večernje novosti|language=Serbian|date=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Belgrade Stock Exchange]] is also located in New Belgrade. Other notable structures built not too long afterwards include convention and congress hall [[Sava Center]], [[Hotel Jugoslavija]], Genex condominium, [[Genex Tower]] sports and concert venues [[Hala sportova|Hala Sportova]] and [[Belgrade Arena]], and 4 and 5-star hotels [[Crowne Plaza Belgrade]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[Hyatt Regency]], [[Tulip Inn]] etc., with around 1700 rooms,... Many structures are currently under construction like [[Airport City Belgrade]], [[Elektroprivreda Srbije]] HQ., [[West 65]] business-residential complex, etc.

Many IT companies choose New Belgrade as regional center like [[NCR Corporation]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[SAP AG]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[ComTrade Group]],
[[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Huawei]], [[Samsung]]. One of [[Microsoft]]'s development centers is also located in New Belgrade.

Currently finished projects in New Belgrade are [[Delta City]], [[Sava City]], [[Univerzitetsko Selo]], [[Ada Bridge]], [[Banca Intesa Beograd|Intesa]] HQ and [[Ušće Tower]].

== Transportation ==
{{Railways and trams in New Belgrade RDT}}
Several important thoroughfares run through New Belgrade, along with numerous wide boulevards that criss-cross most of its territory.

The [[A3 motorway (Serbia)|A3 motorway]] (carrying [[European route E70|E70]] and [[European route E75|E75]]) runs northwest to southeast, with five exits. It crosses the [[Sava|Sava River]] via [[Gazela Bridge]]. New Belgrade is served by two more road bridges – [[Branko's Bridge]] and [[Ada Bridge]], and by the road-tram [[Old Sava Bridge]].

With services started in 1985, tram transportation plays an important role in New Belgrade transportation, despite it having just two tracks which mostly run along the several kilometers long Jurija Gagarina street. Four tram lines serve the municipality (7, 9, 11 and 13) and there is a tram depot in Đorđa Stanojevića street.

Since the 1970s, New Belgrade has been served by two railway lines connecting it to the city center and by one line to {{rws|Zemun}}. Virtually the entire length of these lines is on an embankment, with an elevated segment on the approach to the [[New Railroad Bridge]], and a tunnel toward Zemun. Two railway stations exist, the larger being the {{rws|Novi Beograd}} which is located above the Antifašističke borbe street and is served by [[BG Voz]] and other local and international lines. The other railway station is {{rws|Tošin Bunar}} which is a 2-track stop located just outside Bežanija tunnel.

The international fairway on the Sava runs along the banks of New Belgrade. The only public river transportation is run by two seasonal boat lines from Blok 70 to [[Ada Ciganlija]], and by another one connecting Blok 44 to [[Ada Međica]].

Belgrade's main shipyard is located on New Belgrade's Sava bank. On the [[Danube]], the base of the 2nd River Squadron of [[Serbian River Flotilla]] is located next to the confluence of the Sava, which restricts navigation around [[Little War Island]].

From 1927 to 1964 the international [[Dojno polje Airport]] was located on the territory of today's New Belgrade.

==Culture and education==
For a settlement of such size, New Belgrade has some unusual cultural characteristics, influenced by the Yugoslav communists' ideas how a new and modern city should look like. If it can be understood why there were no churches built, a fact that a city of 250,000 has no theaters and only one museum (out of the residential area) is much less comprehensible, underlying the decades long Belgrader's feel of New Belgrade being nothing more but a big dormitory.

[[Museum of Contemporary Art (Belgrade)|Museum of Contemporary Art]] is located in Ušće which is also projected by the city government as the location of the future [[Belgrade Opera]]. The issue became highly controversial in the 2000s (decade) as the general feel of the population, ensemble of the opera and most prominent architects and artists is that it is a very bad location for the opera, while the city government stubbornly insists against the popular wishes.

For decades, the only church in the municipality was an old Church of Saint George in Bežanija. Construction of the new church in Bežanijska Kosa, the Church of Saint Basil of Ostrog, began in 1996, while the construction of the Church of Saint Demetrius of Salonica, which is considered the first church in New Belgrade, began in 1998. Both are still not completed.

===Schools===
[[File:Megatrend univerzitet na Novom Beogradu.JPG|thumb|Main building of the [[Megatrend University]] in New Belgrade]]

Education fared much better than culture, as there are numerous elementary and high schools, as well as [[University of Belgrade]]'s residential campus - Studentski Grad.

List of schools in New Belgrade:
* [[Ninth Belgrade Gymnasium]]
* [[Tenth Belgrade Gymnasium]]
* [[University of Arts in Belgrade|University of Arts]]' [[Faculty of Dramatic Arts]] (FDU)
* [[Megatrend University]]
* Graphic Design Secondary School
* Polytechnical Academy
* Technical School
* Russian School

==Night life==
New Belgrade offers rich night life along the banks of [[Sava]] and [[Danube]], right up to the point where the two rivers meet. What started mostly as raft-like social clubs for river fishermen in the 1980s expanded into large floats offering food and drink with live [[turbo folk]] performances during the 1990s.

Today, it is unlikely that one would walk a {{convert|100|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} stretch along the rivers without encountering a float. Some of them grew into entire entertainment complexes rivaling clubs in Belgrade's downtown core. While most of the floats used to be synonymous with turbo folk in what was essentially a stereotypical ''[[kafana]]'' setting, a recent trend saw many turned into full-fledged clubs on water with elaborate events involving world-famous DJs spinning live music.

Not much attention was paid to detail and subtlety when New Belgrade was being built during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The objective was clearly to put up as many buildings as fast as possible, in order to accommodate a displaced and growing post-World War II population that was in the middle of a [[Post-WW2 baby boom|baby boom]]. This across-the-board [[brutalist|brutalist architectural approach]] led to many apartment buildings and even entire residential blocks looking monumental in an awkward way. Although the problem has been alleviated to certain extent in recent decades by addition of some modern expansion ([[Hyatt Regency Belgrade|Hyatt]] and Intercontinental hotels, luxury Genex [[condominium|condos]], [[Ušće Tower]], [[Belgrade Arena]], [[Delta City]], etc.), many still complain about what they see as New Belgrade's "grayness" and "drabness". They often use the derisive term "spavaonica" ("dormitory") to underscore their view of New Belgrade as a place that does not inspire creative living nor encourage healthy human interaction, and is only good for overnight sleep at the end of the hard day's work.  This opinion has found its way into Serbian pop culture as well.

In an early 1980s track called 'Neću da živim u Bloku 65', popular Serbian band [[Riblja čorba]] sings about a depressed individual who hates the world because he's surrounded by the concrete of New Belgrade, while a more recent local cinematic trend sees New Belgrade presented somewhat clumsily as the Serbian version of [[Ghetto#United States|New York ghettos]] like those found in [[Harlem]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[The Bronx]]. The most obvious example of the latter would be 2002 movie ''1 na 1'', which portrays a bunch of Serbian teenagers who rap, shoot guns, play street basketball and seem to blame many of their woes on living in New Belgrade. Other films like ''Apsolutnih 100'' and ''[[The Wounds (film)|The Wounds]]'' also implicitly paint New Belgrade in the negative light but they have a more coherent point of view and place their stories within the context of the 1990s when war and [[international isolation]] truly did push some Serbs, including those inhabiting New Belgrade, to desperate acts.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
New Belgrade is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the following cities and municipalities:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://novibeograd.rs/lokalna-samouprava/medjunarodna-saradnja|title=Međunarodna saradnja|language=Serbian|publisher=novibeograd.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Dixon''' (born 1957) is an author and business consultant, often described as a [[futurist]], and chairman of the trends forecasting company Global Change Ltd.&lt;ref name=t50&gt;Ciaran Parker, ''The Thinkers 50''. [[Praeger Publishers]], 2005. {{ISBN|0-275-99145-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also founder of the international AIDS agency [[ACET (AIDS charity)|ACET]] and Chairman of the ACET International Alliance.

In 2005, he was ranked as one of the 20 most influential business thinkers alive according to the ''Thinkers 50'' (a private survey printed in 'The Times').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkers50.com/results-2005 Thinkers 50 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725200153/http://www.thinkers50.com/results-2005 |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Des Dearlove |author-link1=Des Dearlove|author2=[[Stuart Crainer]] |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/graduate_management/article597997.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |title=The Most Influential Management Gurus |newspaper=The Times| date=1 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611190429/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/graduate_management/article597997.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |archivedate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dixon was also included in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'''s 2010 "[[Happy List]]", with reference to ACET and his other work tackling the stigma of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-iiosi-happy-list-2010--the-100-1953745.html The IoS Happy List 2010 – the 100], Independent on Sunday, 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
Patrick Dixon studied Medical Sciences at [[King's College, Cambridge]] and continued medical training at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], London.&lt;ref name=t50/&gt; In 1978, while a medical student, he founded the IT startup Medicom, selling medical software solutions in the UK and the Middle East, based on early personal computers. After qualifying as a physician he cared for people dying of cancer at [[St Joseph's Hospice]] and then as part of the Community Care Team based at [[University College Hospital]], London, while also continuing IT consulting part-time.

In 1988&lt;ref name=t50/&gt; he launched the AIDS charity '''[[ACET (AIDS charity)|ACET]]''', following publication of his first book ''The Truth about AIDS'', which warned of an unfolding catastrophe that has since hit many nations in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. ACET grew rapidly, providing home care services across London and other parts of the UK, as well as a national sex education programme in schools, reaching more than 450,000 students.

Dixon no longer practices as a physician, but remains actively involved as Chairman of the ACET International Alliance. This is now a network of independent national AIDS care and prevention programmes, sharing the same name and values, active in 23 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acet-international.org www.acet-international.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends analysis, business consulting and writing==
Patrick Dixon now advises large corporations in many different industries on trends, [[strategic management|strategy]], [[risk management]] and opportunities for [[innovation]], giving [[keynote]]s to thousands of business leaders at corporate events each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighbureau.com/speakers/pdixon/ Patrick Dixon], speaker's profile at [[Leigh Bureau]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s Dixon has written 15 books covering a wide range of issues and macro-trends including [[social media]], [[multichannel marketing]], consumer shifts, [[demographics]], rise of [[emerging economies]], health care, [[biotechnology]], social issues, [[sustainability]], politics and [[business ethics]].

''Futurewise'', first published in 1998, uses the word FUTURE as a mnemonic standing for "Six Faces of the Future" which will impact every large business: '''F'''ast, '''U'''rban, '''T'''ribal, '''U'''niversal, '''R'''adical and '''E'''thical.&lt;ref name=t50/&gt; Dixon is optimistic about the capacity of human innovation to solve complex challenges: &lt;blockquote&gt;This millennium will witness the greatest challenges to human survival that we have ever seen, and many of them will face us in the early years of the first century.  It will also provide us with science and technology beyond our greatest imaginings, and the greatest shift in values for over 50 years. ''Futurewise'', page xi&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Building a Better Business'', published in 2005, describes a new approach to leadership, management, marketing, teams, brands, customer relations, innovation, strategy, corporate governance and values. The book applies lessons from [[volunteering]] and non-profit organisations in motivating and inspiring large numbers of people to achieve great things. In it, Dixon argues that all successful leadership derives from an appeal to a common desire for a better future—for customers, workers, [[shareholder]]s and [[community|communities]].  He attacks the "dangerous" obsession with [[shareholder value]] in many global corporations: {{quote|Our society has come to see that a strategy to build shareholder value without a clear mission based on robust ethical values, is a complete nonsense.  In fact it has proved one of the fastest ways of destroying an entire global business.}}

''Sustainagility'', published in 2010 and co-authored by Johan Gorecki, describes [[green technology]] and innovations across a wide range of industries, which Dixon believes will help to transform and protect the world.

==Personal life==
Dixon is married to Sheila, with four grown up children including the pop artist [[Paul Dixon (musician)|Paul Dixon]] (known as fyfe, previously David's Lyre), and lives in London where the family is active in local church and community life.

==Works==
Patrick Dixon publishes video messages on his web TV site. He claims over 15 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalchange.com/cv.htm Patrick Dixon CV] on Global Change website&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube shows over 5 million video views on his channel there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/pjvdixon/about About] Patrick Dixon, Youtube.

'''Paul Conway''' (born 1978) is a Scottish [[butcher]] and businessman and is proprietor of Paul's Quality Butchers, in [[Scotland]], with a branch in Condorrat . He has won several trade and business awards,&lt;ref name=KNC17102006/&gt;&lt;ref name =craftbutcher/&gt;&lt;ref name="YEYA"/&gt;&lt;ref name =iblf/&gt;&lt;ref name =scottishfoodanddrink/&gt;&lt;ref name=kilsythchronicle/&gt; and is involved in community philanthropy.&lt;ref name= chronicle2/&gt;&lt;ref name= chronicle3/&gt;&lt;ref name= chronicle4/&gt;

==Background and training==
Paul Conway gained work experience from 12 years of age in the local butcher's shop. After leaving school, Conway became an apprentice with a local butcher, gaining experience in different butchers' shops. Due to the financial pressure of having a young family, Conway went into debt. He approached The [[Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust]] (PSYBT) who approved his business plan awarding a start up loan. Conway benefited from the help of his mentor, Mr. Rogers.

With the help of the Princes Trust, Mr Conway put together a business plan that allowed him in 2006 to buy the [[Bonnybridge]] premises that now operate as a butchery/bakery business.&lt;ref name=TBIE2006/&gt; Conway's business has thrived. He now employs 30 part and full-time staff in six premises with a turnover of over a million pounds a year.&lt;ref name="YEYA"/&gt;
The Kilsyth branch is now closed.

==Awards==
Conway took gold medals in two categories—traditional steak pie and speciality pie (steak and sausage) on 26 September 2007, at the Steak Pie evaluation organised by the [[Scottish Federation of Meat Trades]] held at the Garfield House Hotel, Stepps.&lt;ref name=KNC17102006&gt;Kilsyth News and Chronicle, 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He also came away with overall Scottish third place and first place for the West of Scotland at the Scottish Pork Sausage Championships held in Perth on 12 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craftbutchers.co.uk/index.php?ID=95 Speciality Sausage Awards (first place Pork Sausage Championships)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he won silver awards for his Pork &amp; Cracked Pepper Sausage and Cumberland Sausage.&lt;ref name =craftbutcher&gt;[http://www.craftbutchers.co.uk/index.php?ID=77&amp;CATEGORY=45Best%20Pork%20Sausages Speciality Sausage Awards (Pork &amp; Cracked Pepper Sausage and Cumberland Sausage)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Per Lindstrand''' (born 8 September  1948) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[aeronautical engineer]], [[Aviator|pilot]], [[adventurer]] and [[entrepreneur]]. He is particularly known for his series of record-breaking trans-oceanic [[hot air balloon]] flights and, later, attempts to be the first to fly a [[Rozière]] balloon around the Earth – all with [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entrepreneur]], Sir [[Richard Branson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/703496/Per-Lindstrand Per Lindstrand. (2010). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved May 13, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the founder of eponymous [[Lindstrand Balloons]] hot air balloon manufacturer based in [[Oswestry]], England.

Lindstrand not only flies balloons, but many other aircraft as well, and holds an airline transport pilot's licence for single and multi-engined land and sea aeroplanes and helicopters, and a commercial pilot's licence for [[autogyro]]s, [[airships]] and [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]]. His long standing dream to make a flight around the world in a hot air balloon (as opposed to a [[Rozière]] or [[gas balloon]] which requires no constant source of heated air) still remains unrealized. His distance, duration and altitude records have made him one of the best known balloonists and [[aerostat]] designers and engineers in the world.

==Early life==

Lindstrand's aeronautical career began in the [[Swedish Air Force]] where he was an Engineering Officer. His first balloon flight in the early 1970s was the result of a bet. He built a makeshift balloon and successfully flew it across the runway while in the Swedish Air Force to claim victory. (When he flew more conventional military aircraft, he chose to use call sign, ''Polar Per''.)

Lindstrand later gained a [[masters degree]] in [[aeronautical engineering]] and worked for [[Saab Group|Saab]] Aircraft in [[Sweden]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in the [[United States]]. He saw his second hot air balloon in 1975 when a neighbour in Sweden purchased it from a British company. When Lindstrand learned that this new balloon was supposed to be ''[[state-of-the-art]]'', he decided that he could do better.

==Company history==
With Swedish aircraft engineer and entrepreneur, [[Håkan Colting]], he formed Colting Balloons which operated in [[Ireland]] from 1976. In 1978 the company moved to [[Oswestry]], [[England]], to be closer to major markets in the [[UK]] and [[Europe]]. When Håkan Colting moved to [[Canada]], Lindstrand continued to run the renamed Colt Balloons (later Thunder &amp; Colt Balloons after acquiring UK-based Thunder Balloons).

In December 1991 Lindstrand founded [[Lindstrand Balloons]] Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindstrandtech.com/about_us.html Lindstrand Technologies: Per Lindstrand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804062900/http://www.lindstrandtech.com/about_us.html |date=2010-08-04 }}, accessed 2010-05-13&lt;/ref&gt; and later created a specialized aerospace company, [[Lindstrand Technologies]] Ltd. (both based in Oswestry) to manufacture and repair [[moored balloon|aerostats]], [[airship]]s, [[gas balloon]]s, passenger-carrying tethered aerostats and other fabric engineering products (including architectural structures, innovative fire-safety devices for road tunnels and inflatable flood defence barriers).  In 2002, Lindstrand Balloons was asked to manufacture the complex parachute for the [[Mars]]-lander, [[Beagle 2]]. Beagle 2 was launched in June 2003 but unfortunately failed to land successfully on the Planet Mars on Christmas Day 2003.

Lindstrand Balloons, in partnership with [[Daimler Chrysler]] Aerospace of [[Germany]], was awarded a design contract by the [[European Space Agency]] to develop a high altitude long endurance airship for possible use in the telecommunications market. Resulting from this, Lindstrand was awarded the German-based ''Korber Prize'' for engineering excellence.

==Record flights==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:launch-web.jpg|thumb|Launch of the ''Virgin Global Flyer'' Balloon, [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]]] --&gt;
[[File:Balloon crash Hawaii.jpg|thumb|A 1998 attempt at an around-the-world balloon flight by Branson, Fossett, and Lindstrand ends in the Pacific Ocean on 25 December 1998.]]
From early in his business career, Lindstrand's main interest and ambition lay in pushing the boundaries of lighter-than-air technology and he subsequently captured every absolute world record for [[hot air balloon]] flight.

Ascending from [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], [[Texas]], on 6 June 1988, Lindstrand set a new world altitude record for [[hot-air balloon]]s, reaching 19,811 meters (64,997 feet). The record stood until 26 November 2005, when [[Vijaypat Singhania]] exceeded it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4467766.stm Anonymous, "Indian sets balloon flight record," bbc.com, 26 November 2005, 12:11 GMT.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://balloonboise.com/ballooning-history/ balloonboise.com Ballooning History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1991, in  the ''Virgin Pacific Flyer'' (a hot air balloon measuring 74,000 m³ (2,600,300&amp;nbsp;ft³), designed and built by Thunder &amp; Colt), Lindstrand and Branson completed the longest flight in [[lighter-than-air]] history when they flew 6761 miles from [[Japan]] to Northern [[Canada]]. Their flight set two new world records for distance and duration and they broke their own ground speed record, recording  245&amp;nbsp;mph (395&amp;nbsp;km/h).  The ''Virgin Pacific Flyer'' still remains the largest hot air balloon ever built.

In an attempt to be the first to fly a balloon of any type around the world, in December 1998, Lindstrand, partnered by Richard Branson and [[Steve Fossett]], flew for 7 days and covered over 20,000&amp;nbsp;km in a [[Rozière]] balloon, launching from [[Morocco]] and landing in the [[Pacific Ocean]] near to rescue services in [[Hawaii]].

Rather less successful was his attempt in 1983 to achieve the world altitude record for hot-air balloons. Sponsored by the English and Welsh Milk Industry, a vast balloon emblazoned with "[[Milk's Gotta Lotta Bottle]]" was prepared for launch to be broadcast on live television early one Saturday morning. Adverse weather conditions led to the mission being aborted, but the balloon filled with air whilst being towed along the ground. Lindstrand was holding one of the ropes, and was lifted 30 feet into the air. On letting go, he fell to the ground, sustaining a dislocated shoulder. The accident, including the fall, was seen and heard on the television broadcast.

==Recognition==

Lindstrand received the [[Royal Aero Club]]'s Gold Medal from [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] twice, in 1989 and 1991, and the Royal Aero Club’s ''[[Britannia Trophy]]'' in 1988. He is a recipient of America's highest flying award, the [[Harmon Trophy]], given to him by [[Dan Quayle|Vice President Quayle]] in the [[White House]]. In February 2006, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] for "his highly innovative work in the field of inflatables and their application to habitable structures". Lindstrand is also in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Hall of Fame]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1181">The '''process window''' is a graph with a range of parameters for a specific manufacturing process yields a defined result. Typically multiple parameters are plotted in such a graph with a central region where the process behaves well, while the outer borders define regions where the process becomes unstable or returns an unfavourable result. A statistical evaluation of the process performance is further performed by the calculation of the associated [[Process Window Index]].

==Applications==
Typical applications are found in [[photolithography]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Chris|title=Swing curves and the process window|url=http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/litho_tutor/TUTOR20%20%28Winter%2098%29.pdf|work=Tutorials on Photolithography|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the response of a photoresist to parameters like temperature, radiation intensity, critical dimension and sidewall angle of the structures, etc. are plotted versus an optical parameter such as the [[numerical aperture]] to optimize the design of an exposure tool or to achieve a reproducible result and high yield.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">'''Reassignment centers''' are holding facilities for the [[New York City Department of Education]], where more than 600 teachers accused of [[misconduct]] have been paid to work full-time doing nothing for months or years at a time while awaiting resolution of their cases.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=NYC to stop paying teachers to do nothing|date=2010-04-15|author=Sara Kugler| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9032803}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among teachers they are referred to as '''[[Padded cell|rubber rooms]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/education/10education.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Where Teachers Sit, Awaiting Their Fates | first=Samuel G. | last=Freedman | date=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city has 13 reassignment centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/0717,altman,76433,15.html village voice &gt; nyclife &gt; Class Dismissed by Mara Altman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Rubber Room]]'', it is also claimed that the city's teacher [[trade union|union]], the [[United Federation of Teachers]], neglects to provide proper representation to teachers assigned to reassignment centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03122007/news/regionalnews/rubber_room_teachers_demand_rights_regionalnews_david_andreatta____education_reporter.htm | work=New York Post | title='Rubber-Room' Teachers Demand Rights | first=DAVID ANDREATTA | last=Education | date=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exonerated teachers often become [[Absent Teacher Reserve|absent teacher reserve]] teachers.

==Uses==
The Department of Education blamed union rules that made it difficult to fire teachers. Some teachers assert that they have been sent to reassignment centers because they are [[whistleblowers]] against administrators for falsifying student test results or publicly challenging former [[New York City School Chancellor|Schools Chancellor]] [[Joel Klein]].&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;uft.org/news/teacher/top/axed/Whistle-blower axed — again&lt;/ref&gt; Three Department of Education employees speaking to the UFT's "New York Teacher," confirmed teachers' allegations that [[Fordham High School for the Arts]] principal Iris Blige filed allegations against the school's UFT [[shop steward|chapter leader]], to place her in a reassignment center, in order to intimidate her and to set an example to the school's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Callaghan, "Bronx principal alleged to have teacher 'hit list' still on job," "New York Teacher," April 23, 2009 {{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reassignment centers arose as a budgetary concern in bureaucratic studies and press coverage in Spring 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2008/05/04/2008-05-04_teachers_in_trouble_spending_years_in_ru.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Teachers in trouble spending years in 'rubber room' limbo that costs $65M | first=Erin | last=Einhorn | date=May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost the city more than $65 million per year in labor expenses.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  In April, 2010, the city and teachers' union reached an agreement to end the practice.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  This agreement came in the midst of the first public presentation of a documentary on the centers.&lt;ref name="origin.ny1.com"&gt;http://origin.ny1.com/9-staten-island-news-content/news_beats/education/116973/doe-to-end--rubber-room--practice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the rubber room agreement, the only substantive change has been that there are no longer large rooms filled with reassigned teachers. Teachers are typically reassigned within their own schools, or to other Department of Education buildings throughout the city. Although teachers are now being charged more quickly, it still takes several years to complete the hearing process and for the arbitrator to render a decision. Many teachers are subsequently brought up on "3020-a" charges, which refer to the section of the New York State education law dealing with the discipline of tenured teachers. Unlike any other school district in New York State, no independent panel must vote to prefer charges against a tenured teacher in New York City. The 3020-a trial is held before an independent arbitrator, who is paid by the [[New York State Education Department]] but is selected jointly by the New York City Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers.

In June 2012 it was revealed that the New York State Education Department had not paid its arbitrators for several years, and collectively owed them millions of dollars for cases they had completed, or were in the process of hearing. In frustration, ten of the 24 arbitrators on the New York City panel have quit, while the remaining 14 refuse to hear any testimony or issue any decisions until their back wages have been paid in full. This could take several more years to negotiate, further exacerbating the backlog of reassigned teachers.

==Documentary==
Filmmakers Jeremy Garrett and Justin Cegnar of Five Boroughs Productions produced an [[independent film|independent]] documentary on the centers, called [[Rubber Room (film)|''The Rubber Room'']],&lt;ref name="origin.ny1.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubberroommovie.com Rubber Room Movie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1232 This American Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis for a segment on the radio program ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=350&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}
  
In [[United States]] [[business law]], a '''registered [[agent (law)|agent]]''', also known as a '''resident agent'''&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Nevada Revised Statutes [http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-014.html#NRS014Sec020 § 14.020].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''statutory agent''',&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Ohio Revised Code [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/1701.07 § 1701.07].&lt;/ref&gt; is a business or individual designated to receive [[service of process]] (SOP) when a [[business entity]] is a party in a [[legal action]] such as a lawsuit or summons.&lt;ref name="Colley"&gt;{{cite book | title=Corporate Governance | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnK2o1GvEt0C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22registered+agent%22&amp;sig=RVc6ARalLRcqWlxGgnaV9BkoJWc| last=Colley| first=John L. | year=2003| publisher=McGraw–Hill Professional| isbn=0-07-140346-9| page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registered agent's address may also be where the state sends the paperwork for the periodic renewal of the business entity's charter (if required). The registered agent for a business entity may be an officer or employee of the company, or a third party, such as the organization's lawyer or a service company. Failure to properly maintain a registered agent can affect a company negatively.&lt;ref name="Colley" /&gt;

==The function of a registered agent==

Most businesses are not [[self-employed|individuals]] but instead [[business entity|business entities]] such as [[corporation]]s or [[Limited Liability Company|limited liability companies (LLCs)]]. This is because there are substantive (and substantial) liability protections as well as tax advantages to being "[[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]]" as opposed to being "[[self-employed]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Writing|first1=Alexis|title=What Are the Tax Benefits of Incorporating a Business?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/tax-benefits-incorporating-business-408.html|website=Small Business Chronicle|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most jurisdictions in the United States require that any business entity that is formed or doing business within their borders designate and maintain a "registered agent".&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Code of Virginia, Section 13.1-634; Pennsylvania law refers only to the "agent who maintains the registered office for the corporation", 15 Pa.Consol.Stat. §108(a), but this person is customarily referred to as the "agent".&lt;/ref&gt; This person may be known as the "resident agent"&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Code of Maryland, Corporations and Associations Article, Section § 2-108.&lt;/ref&gt; or "statutory agent",&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Arizona Revised Statutes, Section 10-501.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the laws of the individual jurisdiction in which the business entity is registered. The purpose of a registered agent is to provide a legal address (not a [[Post office box|P.O. Box]]) within that jurisdiction where there are persons available during normal business hours to facilitate [[service of process|legal service of process]] being served in the event of a [[legal action]] or [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', California Corporations Code, Section 1701.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the registered agent is also the person to whom the state government sends all official documents required each year for tax and legal purposes, such as [[franchise tax]] notices and [[annual report]] forms. It is the registered agent's job to forward these suit documents and notices to the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Code of Virginia, Section 13.1-634(B).&lt;/ref&gt; Registered agents generally will also notify business entities if their state government filing status is in "good standing" or not. The reason that these notifications are a desired function of a registered agent is that it is difficult for a business entity to keep track of legislative changes and report due dates for multiple jurisdictions given the disparate laws of different states.

Penalties for not maintaining a registered agent generally will cause a jurisdiction to revoke a business’s corporate or LLC legal status as well as in some cases, assess additional penalty fees on the entity.{{Citation needed|reason=This is true, however it should be cited|date=March 2014}}

If a registered agent fails to perform their function, it can have dire consequences for the business entity. For example, if a customer fell inside a store and sued the store, and the store's registered agent failed to notify the business entity of a summons to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit, then when the case went to trial, nobody would appear to defend the store and the customer would win by a [[default judgment]]. Additionally, the store would likely not be able to get the [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] overturned on appeal because they had been properly served. This is one of the most common reasons that business entities generally will utilize a third party as their registered agent be it a commercial service company, an attorney, or in some cases, a CPA.

The person at the [[business]] entity that maintains contact with the registered agent is the corporate secretary or governance officer.

==Who can perform the function of a registered agent==
Different states have different requirements for registered agents. Typically, the agent must be a natural person resident of the state in question or, in states that allow entities to serve as registered agents, an entity having a business office within the state and authorized to do business in the state.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', New Hampshire Revised Statutes [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXVII/293-A/293-A-5.01.htm § 293-A:5.01](1)(i): "An individual who resides in this state . . . " or an entity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Virginia Code § 13.1-634.&lt;/ref&gt; In some states a [[business entity]] is legally allowed to act as its own registered agent, if at least one of its officers is a resident of the state, but other jurisdictions may require that a business entity designate a third party as its registered agent.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', D.C. Code Section 29-101.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because most states permit one business entity to serve as a registered agent for others, some businesses exist to serve that exact function, charging a fee to act as the registered agent for hundreds or thousands of businesses in a given state.

==Designating a registered agent==

In most all cases, the registered agent for a [[business entity]] is assigned in the formation documents filed in a jurisdiction when the entity is originally created.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Code of Maryland, Corporations and Associations Article, § 4A-204(a)(3) requires the articles of organization of a limited liability company to include "the name and address of its resident agent".&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person forming a corporation in the State of [[Nevada]] or [[Delaware]], would designate the registered agent along with the agent's address on the articles of incorporation filed with the [[Nevada Secretary of State]] or [[Delaware Secretary of State]] respectively. If the agent cannot sign the articles to be filed, some states such as [[Nevada]] provide that the registered agent may be designated using a separate "Registered Agent Acceptance" form with the appropriate acceptance and signature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=866 Example of "Registered Agent Acceptance" form (Nevada)]&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the business or the individual accepting responsibility as registered agent must sign to accept the responsibility of acting as agent. In most states it is a crime to knowingly file a false document with the office of the [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], although the penalties vary widely. For example, in Nevada it is a Class "D" [[felony]] to forge this signature, but in [[Michigan]] it is only a [[misdemeanor]].

==Changing a registered agent==

For varying reasons a business entity might at some point wish to change their registered agent to another party after a registered agent has already been designated. This is accomplished by obtaining a form from the secretary of state where the business entity is registered, completing said form, and filing it with that state office along with any requisite fees which may vary from state to state. In some cases the required form may simply be a dedicated change of registered agent form, and in other cases, such as in Delaware, an actual amendment to the articles of the business entity must be filed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corp.delaware.gov/faqs.shtml#coa Delaware Change of Agent FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registered agent information==

Information about persons or entities that may be willing to act as registered agents/resident agents by state is usually maintained by the respective [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]]. Most states also offer free access to their databases to find a business entity's registered agent.

==Model Registered Agents Act==

The ''Model Registered Agents Act'' (MoRAA) is an effort spearheaded by the [[American Bar Association]] Business Law Section and the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA) – Business Organization Section (BOS) to standardize [[business entity]] laws as they relate to annual reports, registered agents and other laws and forms used to file business entities.&lt;ref name="Model RA Act"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Registered%20Agents%20Act,%20Model%20(2006)%20(Last%20Amended%202011)|title=Model Registered Agents Act (2006) (Last Amended 2011)|accessdate=2018-04-11|publisher=Uniform Law Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also creates two distinct classes of registered agent: "commercial" and "non-commercial." The National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) organized a drafting committee composed of commissions, ABA, and IACA representatives who drafted the act's language. NCCUSL adopted MoRAA at its 2006 annual meeting. It was amended in 2011.[http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Registered%20Agents%20Act,%20Model%20(2006)%20(Last%20Amended%202011)] Eleven US jurisdictions (Arkansas, District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) have since adopted the model act, and Delaware did not adopt the act, but did adopt the "commercial registered agent" provision.&lt;ref name=Adoption&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Registered Agents Act - Technical Challenges of Implementation|url=http://www.iaca.org/iaca/wp-content/uploads/01_ITS_MORAA_NCR.pdf|publisher=International Association of Commercial Administrators|accessdate=2014-03-03|author=International Association of Commercial Administrators|pages=4–5|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem this effort seeks to alleviate is that disparate laws, filing requirements, and forms in all of the US jurisdictions where business entities are filed creates a quagmire for any company seeking to register to do business in those jurisdictions. By adopting a common set of laws, the Model Registered Agents Act seeks to create a uniform and simple process of filing and maintaining a business entity in any jurisdiction adopting it.

==Government listings==

Some state business entity laws name the Secretary of State's office or business entity filing office as the registered agent of last resort, in the event the named registered agent can't be found. By law, service may be made on the office if the entities registered agent can not be found. However, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to service the registered agent before it may serve the Secretary of State. The state laws vary in how to complete service on the Secretary of State and the amount of fees charged. Some of the states that may have this statutory provision are listed below. MoRAA eliminated this provision but some of the states that adopted MoRAA maintained this provision.

==Overview==
The show is hosted by [[Sarah Harris (journalist)|Sarah Harris]] and features a panel of investors whom are the "sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. The sharks do receive money for their participation, but they invest their own money. These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their own money to help market and mentor each contestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/shark-tank/about|title=About - Shark Tank|first=Network|last=Ten|website=TenPlay - About - Shark Tank|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  potential exists, if one of the sharks is interested, for a deal to be made right there on the show. However, if all of the sharks decline, the contestant leaves with nothing. Shark Tank has been described as demonstrating "the drama of pitch meetings and the interaction between the entrepreneurs and tycoons."&lt;ref name="Biz Insider"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://au.businessinsider.com/abc-to-humiliate-struggling-entrepreneurs-on-national-television-2009-3 | title=ABC To Humiliate Entrepreneurs On National TV | publisher=Business Insider (Australia) | date=31 March 2009 | accessdate=21 March 2013 | author=Lewis, Hilary | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410162807/http://au.businessinsider.com/abc-to-humiliate-struggling-entrepreneurs-on-national-television-2009-3 | archivedate=10 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 investigation by [[Fairfax Media]] revealed that, in 2017, 50 products resulted in 27 deals, however, only four investments actually went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/i-m-out-shark-tank-bites-fail-to-net-deal-once-show-goes-to-air-20180517-p4zfsl.html|title='I'm out': Shark Tank bites fail to net deal once show goes to air|first=Cara|last=Waters|date=17 May 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The a2 Milk Company Limited'''  (previously known as '''A2 Corporation''') is an [[S&amp;P/ASX 200|ASX 200]] public listed company that commercialises intellectual property relating to [[a2 milk]], as well as the milk and related products like infant formula.

==History==
The a2 Milk Company is the successor of A2 Corporation Limited, a New Zealand company founded in 2000 by [[Corran McLachlan|Dr Corran McLachlan]], who was researching health effects of A1 beta-casein; and Howard Paterson who was one of New Zealand's richest men, a significant dairy farmer, and an important stakeholder in [[Fonterra]], a [[Agricultural cooperative|dairy cooperative]].&lt;ref name=FourCorners /&gt;&lt;ref name="A2 protein milk supply on horizon"/&gt; The company commercialised a [[genetic test]] to determine whether a [[cow]] will produce milk without the A1 protein, and to market a2 Milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 31 March 2003 [http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/transcripts/s820943.htm Transcript of "White Mischief"], [http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/20030331_white_mischief/ an episode] of ''Four Corners'', an investigative journalism series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2 protein milk supply on horizon"&gt;Staff, New Zealand Herald. 14 May 2001 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=188650 A2 protein milk supply on horizon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truswell"&gt;{{Citation |last=Truswell |first=A.S. |title=The A2 milk case: a critical review |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=623–631 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602104 |pmid=15867940 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n5/full/1602104a.html |accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, A2 Corporation focused on dairy farm [[breeding program]]s to develop herds that would produce only a2 milk.&lt;ref name="landline" /&gt;  However the launch of a2 milk was delayed by opposition from Fonterra, which had protected contracts under New Zealand law with about 98% of New Zealand dairy farms.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Smith for Just-food.  2 July 2003 [http://www.just-food.com/analysis/a2-milk-launched-as-controversy-churns-on_id93493.aspx A2 milk launched as controversy churns on]&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking leverage in the battle with Fonterra over access to farmers, and over patent rights,&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt; Paterson led the company into litigation against Fonterra, asking the New Zealand High Court to order Fonterra to put health warnings on its conventional milk concerning risks of type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia due to the presence of A1 beta-casein, and to force Fonterra to publicly disclose all the information it had about the links between A1 beta-casein and health risks.&lt;ref name=Litigation&gt;Deborah Hill Cone for Share Chat 1 November 2002 [http://www.sharechat.co.nz/article/4d8b820a/a2-accuses-dairy-giant-of-suppressing-milk-defects.html A2 accuses dairy giant of suppressing milk defects] Quote: "The lawsuit risks inflicting catastrophic damage to New Zealand's international reputation and foreign earnings as Fonterra turns over $14 billion and makes 20% of the country's total offshore receipts. As if that would not be enough of a PR disaster as the country tries to maintain its position as a clean, green food producer...."&lt;/ref&gt; The litigation threatened New Zealand's economy and international reputation as at the time Fonterra was responsible for 20% of New Zealand's exports.&lt;ref name=Litigation/&gt;  The press over the litigation and public concern over the claims of A2 Corporation led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Health and the [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] to issue statements confirming the safety of conventional milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/20030331_white_mischief/statement.pdf Supporting documents for "White Mischief" story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Minister&gt;Office of the Minister of Food Safety, New Zealand Food Safety Authority. 27 November 2007 [http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Milk_Arrangements-Advises_Cabinet.pdf A1-A2 Milk: Arrangements for Upcoming Reviews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821101932/http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Milk_Arrangements-Advises_Cabinet.pdf |date=21 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A2 Corporation was able to obtain agreements with enough dairy farmers to launch A2 milk in New Zealand at the end of April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Stock Exchange. [https://www.nzx.com/markets/NZSX/securities/ATM/analysis a2 Milk Company Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of 2003, both founders of the company died.  In July, Paterson was found dead in his hotel room during a business trip at the age of 50,&lt;ref&gt;Staff, ''New Zealand Herald''. 5 July 2003 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3510994 Obituary: Howard Paterson]&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later [[Corran McLachlan|Dr Corran McLachlan]] died of cancer at the age of 59.&lt;ref name=AR2003/&gt;  In New Zealand it is illegal to make health claims about a food product without providing scientific evidence and registering the food as a medicine, and in November 2003 the New Zealand [[Commerce Commission]] advised that A2 Corporation Ltd and its licensed A2 producers had agreed to amend the health claims in their promotional material following a warning from the commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Food_Safety-Nzfsa_Been.pdf Stuart A.

The company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] in October&lt;ref name=liquidates/&gt; and was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="landline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=liquidates&gt;Shelley Lloyd for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 17 November 2004 [http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/qld/stories/s1245678.htm A2 milk liquidates]&lt;/ref&gt; A $1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Finance_and_Public_Administration/Completed%20inquiries/2004-07/reg_partner_prog/index Australian Senate finance and public administration references committee report on Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programs, October 2005, pages xiv, 97–100]&lt;/ref&gt; A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A2 herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.&lt;ref name="landline" /&gt;

In December, A2 Corporation sold its interests in A2 Australia to [[Fraser &amp; Neave]], a [[food marketing]] giant in Asian markets, for about $1.1 million.  A2 Corporation had lost about $1.3 million for 2004, the same as it has lost the year before; the sale allowed A2 Corporation to rely on Fraser &amp; Neave to build the Australian and Asian businesses.&lt;ref name=QuickSale&gt;Ellen Read for the New Zealand Herald. 30 December 2004 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=9004964 Quick sale likely for A2 Corp]&lt;/ref&gt; A2 Corporation focused on recovering from the deaths of its founders organizationally and financially, relied on its New Zealand licensees to develop the New Zealand market, and turned its focus to developing overseas markets.&lt;ref name=QuickSale/&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006, A2 Corporation business continued to grow. [[Dairy Australia]], the national association of the Australian dairy industry, and market competitors like [[Parmalat]] in response have consistently stated that there is no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest A1 proteins are dangerous and have warned that criticism of normal milk is damaging the entire dairy industry.&lt;ref name="landline"&gt;{{cite web |last=Courtney |first=Pip | author-link = Pip Courtney |title=The A2 milk story |work=Landline |publisher=ABC Television |date=6 August 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1702999.htm |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Peter |title=A2 attacks milk |newspaper=The Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=3 |date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Simone |title=It's a matter of genetics |newspaper=The Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=107 |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rival"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Mark |title=Rival watering down A2 Milk claims |newspaper=The Age |location=Melbourne |pages=8, 28–29 |date=24 May 2014 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/rival-seeks-to-water-down-a2-milk-claims-20140523-38uef.html |accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Binsted |first=Tim |title=Parmalat boss hits out at A2 |newspaper=Australian Financial Review |page=8 |date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconsolidation and succession as The a2 Milk Company ===

In 2006, A2 Corporation was on sound enough footing to buy back A2 Australia from Fraser &amp; Neave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10376408| title=A2 set to buy back Australian unit| date=6 April 2006| publisher=NZ Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, it lost about $1 million, after having lost $9 million the year before, but revenues had approximately doubled.  In that year it warned shareholders not to expect profit for another three years.&lt;ref name="landline"/&gt;

Commercial development proceeded, and by 2010 some 40 million litres of a2 Milk were being produced by 12,000 A2-certified cows across Australia, with milk processed at four plants in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland,&lt;ref name="simonegenetics"&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Simone |title=It's a matter of genetics |newspaper=Weekly Times |location=Melbourne |page=107 |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yoghurt made with a2 Milk went on the market in Australia in April 2010.&lt;ref name=Formula&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Christopher |title=A2 gets ready to launch baby formula |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |location=Auckland |date=10 September 2013 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11121927 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 A2 Corporation announced it had a made a profit over a half-year for the first time; in the six months ending 31 December 2010, it made a net $894,000, or 17 cents/share.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation Press Release 18 February 2011 [http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/a2-corp-declares-a-maiden-profit/ A2 Corp Declares a Maiden Profit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120543/http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/a2-corp-declares-a-maiden-profit/ |date=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 A2 Corporation announced it would attempt to raise $20 million and list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange main board,&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Bond for the National Business Review. 5 December 2012 [http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/a2-corp-sets-sights-nzx-20-million-equity-raising-gb-133540 A2 Corp sets sights on NZX with $20 million equity raising]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would use the funds to grow its Chinese infant formula and UK milk businesses.  It listed in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, The Headliner. 7 March 2013. [http://www.headliner.co.nz/news/11412.html A2 Corporation to Step Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a2 Milk whole milk powder and a2 Milk Ice Cream products were launched.&lt;ref name="2015pres"&gt;{{cite web |title=FY Results Presentation 2015 |url=https://www.thea2milkcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FY-Results-Presentation-2015.pdf |website=The a2 Milk Company |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2014–2015 Financial year, The a2 Milk Company reported its Australian and New Zealand segment revenue grew by 40% vs pcp; and sales on a2 infant formula increased by 650%.&lt;ref name="2015pres"/&gt;

In December 2017 the company announced that in the summer of 2018 Geoffrey Babidge, who had been nearing retirement age, would step down and [[Jayne Hrdlicka]] would take over as CEO; at that time she was CEO of [[Jetstar Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand's A2 Milk names Jayne Hrdlicka as CEO |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/a2-milk-company-ceo/new-zealands-a2-milk-names-jayne-hrdlicka-as-ceo-idUSL4N1OD095 |work=Reuters |date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took over in July 2018.  At that time the company was experiencing strong growth via sales in China and had ramped up spending to further increase Chinese sales and to expand the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A2 Milk outlook shows Jayne Hrdlicka has two big tasks |url=https://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/a2-milk-outlook-shows-jayne-hrdlicka-has-two-big-tasks-20180712-h12kqn |work=Financial Review |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please do not add new content here.  Please add it to the body of [[A2 milk]] and if it rises to the [[WP:LEAD]] of that article, update the lead, then copy that here. Per [[WP:SYNC]] --&gt;
a2 claims that milk containing A1 proteins are harmful, but a 2009 [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) review of scientific literature found there was insufficient evidence to prove that bioactive peptides in A1 milk have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=European Food Safety Authority |title=Review of the potential health impact of β-casomorphins and related peptides |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=231r |date=3 February 2009 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2009.231r |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/231r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[casein|A1 and A2 beta-casein]] are [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] of the beta-casein milk protein that differ by one [[amino acid]]. The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow's milk in Europe (excluding France), the USA, Australia and New Zealand. A genetic test, developed by the A2 Milk Company, determines whether a cow produces the A2 or A1 type protein in its milk. The test allows the a2 Milk Company to license milk producers once proven their cows produce only A2 beta-casein protein in their milk, to the exclusion of the A1 beta-casein protein type.&lt;ref name=EFSA/&gt;

==Intellectual property==
A2 Corporation licensed patents filed in the 1990s by the New Zealand Dairy Board, and filed its own patents on [[genetic tests]] to determine what form of beta-casein cows produce in milk, and concerning potential adverse health consequences of A1 milk.&lt;ref name=FourCorners/&gt;&lt;ref name="truswell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/EP0789842A1?cl=zh EP0789842A1 Google patents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Stevenson for the New Zealand Herald. 21 December 2000 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=165973 A2 Corp pays $8m for milk patent rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 A2 Corporation had developed a worldwide suite of intellectual property, including trademarks, trade secrets, and patents covering products, the genetic test and methods to develop A2 producing herds, as well as methods to check the protein content and fatty acid content of milk, [[dietary supplements]] with A2 beta-casein, and even therapeutic uses of A2.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Babidge, Managing Director &amp; CEO of A2 Corp. April 2012 [http://aboutthea2milkcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a2C-presentation-Apr-121.pdf A2 Corporation Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The a2 Milk Company continues to develop a portfolio of intellectual property, including trademarks and patents. The a2 Milk Company also invests in targeted research and development associated with the benefits of the A2 protein.&lt;ref name="2015pres"/&gt; In September 2017, It was reported that A2 Milk got approval to keep selling its products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/a2-milk-gets-china-tick-of-approval-20170928-gyqe3k.html|title=A2 Milk gets China tick of approval|last=Gray|first=Darren|date=2017-09-28|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===

Sales of a2 Milk in Australia and New Zealand boosted significantly following 2007, after the publication of a book, ''Devil in the Milk'' by Keith Woodford, about A1 beta-casein and its perceived dangers to health&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation Press Release, November 2007.

A2 Corporation changed its name to The a2 Milk Company Limited effective April 2014, and at that time had about 8% market share of the milk products market in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, A2 Corporation. 31 March 2014 [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1403/S00975/a2-changes-name.htm A2 changes name]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NZHlion/&gt;

===United States===
In August 2003, The a2 Milk Company exclusively licensed patent and trademark rights to US-based Ideasphere Incorporated (ISI) to market a2 Milk products in North America.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation [https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/21_Annual_Report_2004.pdf A2 Corporation 2004 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  ISI acquired [[Twinlab]] in September 2003, followed by another string of acquisitions in the [[dietary supplement]] market.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Engredea. 3 July 2005 [http://newhope360.com/supply-news-amp-analysis/ideasphere-intends-acquire-non-ephedra-metabolife-assets Ideasphere Intends to Acquire Non-Ephedra Metabolife Assets]&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2005, ISI and A2 Corporation agreed to form a joint venture, a2 Milk Company LLC.&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation [https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/11_Interim_Report_2005.pdf A2 Corporation Half-Yearly Report for the half-year ending September 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210205746/https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/11_Interim_Report_2005.pdf |date=10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 A2 Corporation announced a deal in which the joint venture would license rights to the Original Foods Company, whose branding the a2 Milk product would carry, and in which the product would be sold in several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern states]] through the [[Hy-Vee]] supermarket chain.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Burgess for the New Zealand Herald. 25 April 2007 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10435998 A2 to tap into US milk market]&lt;/ref&gt;

In A2 Corporation's 2009 Annual Report, the company announced that the joint venture had regained all rights to the US market through a settlement with the Original Foods Company, and that "The US dairy milk market remains intensely competitive and continues to be a major challenge."&lt;ref&gt;A2 Corporation [https://www.nzx.com/files/documents/companies/ATM/12_Annual_Report_2009.pdf A2 Corporation Annual Report 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 The a2 Milk Company bought out all but less than 1% of ISI's share in the joint venture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Baldwin for National Business Review. 5 October 2010 [http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/a2-corporation-takes-full-control-us-marketing-arm-131022 A2 Corporation takes full control of US marketing arm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rune Torbjörn Evrell''' (March 29, 1920 – April 22, 2008) was a Swedish [[inventor]] and [[businessman]] who made major innovations in folding knife construction, knife designs and knife production methods at [[EKA-knivar| EKA-knivar AB]]  [[Eskilstuna]], Sweden.

==Life and career==

Born 1920 in Stockholm, Lidingö. Between 11 and 12 years of age he lived in [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]] Indiana, USA. His father, [[Kaleb Evrell]], developed a patent for an automatic transmission for passenger cars for [[BorgWarner|Warner Gears]]. After the US experience the family moved to [[Eskilstuna]].

Torbjörn Evrell received his degree mechanical engineering in 1945 from the [[Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan|Royal Institute of Technology]]. His first job was at Centrala Torpedverkstaden, CTV (Torpedo factory of the Swedish Defence Industries) in [[Motala]].

In 1946 Torbjörn Evrell took management of  [[Eka-knivar|Eskilstuna Knivfabriks AB]] (EKA) knife making company when the owner [[John Elmquist]] (Evrells father in law) unexpectedly died. Evrell, specialist in submersible motors and pumps, now became President of EKA at the age of 26. He took over a company, which in many respects was using production methods of the late 1800s, with a rather outdated machinery with many processes with belt drive from hydropower. Evrell started modernisation . Production technology was improved and the old knife range cut down and new modern knives had to be developed. Evrell first task was to clean up the knife range. He took out a full sales statistics and noted that many models were marginal to sales or outdated. He considered that he could immediately reduce the number of models from 91 to 37. Moreover, he introduced standard components which could be used in several knives.

Evrell also introduced a new systematic production planning, improved methods and machinery were upgraded. Everything to make better knives cheaper. Evrell started using subcontractors and concentrated construction and production to knives.

He was throughout his career continuously involved in all areas of the company including knife innovation, production and marketing. There are a number of influential knife patents in his name. Out of the one time many dozens of knife making companies of Eskilstuna, his was the only one to survive by constant innovation and adaptions to new conditions.

Evrell was the president of EKA until 1985, when he was succeeded by his daughter [[Karin Ingelson]]. Torbjörn Evrell continued as an advisor to EKA, especially in product development, for ten more years.&lt;ref name=marmer&gt;{{cite book|pages= 63–70| title=Knivar från Eskilstuna: Knives from Eskilstuna |author= Arne Marmér|isbn= 9789163081767 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Knivar_fr%C3%A5n_Eskilstuna.html?id=Jw20tgAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Samtek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions in knife design, construction and production==
Prior to 1970, all knives were riveted. Riveting was done by hand, and all work with assembly and adjustment, requires craftsmanship which is very labor-intensive. It took at least three to four years for a workman to reach the skill and speed required in production. Evrell realized the problems and wanted to find a faster and less labor-intensive method, while at the same time make the world's best folding knife with one blade. An effort started in November 1967 to come up with a new construction to hold a knife together. The final version of the knife was improved by two external consultants to the company: Olle Nordlund and the industrial designer [[Sigvard Bernadotte]] {{US patent|D227071}}. The results were presented in March 1970 when Evrell could launch the first bolted folding knife in the ''Swede series''. The first two models were named Swede 38 (design Sigvard Bernadotte) and Swede 45. The special features of the Swede knives is that the scales are screwed in place. The knife scales can easily be removed, with a screwdriver or coin, for cleaning and lubrication of the blade and inside. The screws are also used to adjust the blade folding mechanism. This new way to manufacture folding knives was completely revolutionary and came to mean a big international breakthrough for EKA. The Swede series started with the EKA Swede 38 knife with plastic scales (offered in several colors) and brass screws with a blade in either carbon steel or stainless steel. The Swede 45 had wooden scales. These first models have been followed by several models with incremental developments.

Another of Evrells inventions is a small folding knife where the whole knife including the folding mechanism is welded together.

With increasing demand EKA-knivar continually made improvements to production methods. The production capacity was increased significantly. In 1971 the company with factory and office in central Eskilstuna was moved to newly built premises at Sättargatan 4 in Vilsta industrial area.

==Marketing==
[[Image:EKA Swede 38 45 knives.jpg|thumb|340px|right|EKA Swede 38 and Swede 45 models]]
Torbjörn Evrell was very aware of the value of marketing a knife. In 1967 he established a dedicated marketing department within his company, which was of great importance to the company's continued expansion. He also took advantage of the marketing value in a knife. All knife models have been available for branding and adaptation as promotional gifts to mark a sign of quality.

'''Trafficking of children''' (aka "Child Labor" and "Child Exploitation) is a form of [[human trafficking]] and is defined as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, and/or receipt" of a child for the purpose of 
slavery, forced labor and exploitation.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt;{{Rp|Article 3 (c)}} This definition is substantially wider than the same document's definition of "trafficking in persons".&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt;{{Rp|Article 3 (a)}} Children may also be trafficked for the purpose of [[adoption]].

Though statistics regarding the magnitude of child trafficking are difficult to obtain, the [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ILO|ILO-IPEC]]|title=Child Trafficking - Essentials |url=https://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/download.do?type=document&amp;id=14616 |publisher=ILO |location=Geneva|year=2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the (UNODC) United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reports the percentage of child victims had risen in a 3 year span from 20 per cent to 27 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arkofhopeforchildren.org/child-trafficking/child-trafficking-statistics|title=What are the statistics on human trafficking of children?|work=Ark of Hope for Children|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of every three child victims, two are girls and one is a boy.

Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic increase in research and public action. A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The main international documents dealing with the trafficking of children are the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the 1999 [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|I.L.O. Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] and the 2000 [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]].

== Definition ==
The first major international instrument dealing with the trafficking of children is part of the 2000 United Nations [[Palermo protocols]], titled the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]]. Article 3(a) of this document defines child trafficking as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and/or receipt" of a child for the purpose of exploitation.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt; The definition for child trafficking given here applies only to cases of trafficking that are transnational and/or involve organized criminal groups; in spite of this, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ILO |last2=UNICEF |last3=UN.GIFT|title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation – Textbook 1: Understanding Child Trafficking|year=2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/Textbook_1.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] expands upon this definition by asserting that movement and exploitation are key aspects of child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; The definition of "child" used here is that listed in the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states, "a child means every human being below the age of 18 years, unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier."&lt;ref name="United Nations 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |year=1989 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction outlined in this definition is important, because some countries have chosen to set the "age of majority" lower than 18, thus influencing exactly what legally constitutes child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

=== Related legal instruments ===
Many international, regional, and national instruments deal with the trafficking of children. These instruments are used to define what legally constitutes trafficking of children, such that appropriate legal action can be taken against those who engage in and promote this practice. These legal instruments are called by a variety of terms, including conventions, protocols, memorandums, joint actions, recommendations, and declarations. The most significant instruments are listed below:&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

* Multilateral cooperation agreement to combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in West and Central Africa, 2006
* Mekong sub regional cooperation agreement to fight human trafficking (COMMIT), 2004

==== National law ====
{{see also|Human trafficking in the United States|Human trafficking in the United Kingdom}}
National laws pertaining to child trafficking continue to develop worldwide, based on the international principles that have been established. Anti-trafficking legislation has been lauded as critical by the [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]], because it ensures that traffickers and trafficking victims are treated accordingly: for example, "if migration laws are used to pursue traffickers, it is often the case that the victims too are prosecuted as illegal migrants, whereas if there is a specific category of 'trafficker' and 'trafficked person,' then it is more likely that the victim will be treated as such."&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; The existence of national laws regarding child trafficking also enables trafficking victims and/or their families to take appropriate civil action.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

== Types of child trafficking ==
The intended or actual after-sale use of the child is not always known.

=== Forced labour ===
{{see also|Child labour}}
The objective of child trafficking is often forced child labour.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Child labour refers specifically to children under a stipulated minimum age, usually 14 at the lowest, being required to work.&lt;ref name="min age conv 1973"/&gt; [[UNICEF]] estimates that, in 2011, 150 million children aged 5–14 in developing countries were involved in child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNICEF|title=State of the World's Children 2011: Adolescence, an Age of Opportunity|year=2011|url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc2011/pdfs/SOWC-2011-Main-Report_EN_02092011.pdf|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this number, the [[International Labour Organization]] reports that 60% of child workers work in agriculture.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Fast Facts on Child Labour 2010|year=2010|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_126685.pdf|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO also estimates that 115 million children are engaged in hazardous work, such as the sex or drug trade.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010" /&gt;  Overall, child labor can take many forms, including domestic servitude, work in agriculture, service, and manufacturing industries. Also, according to several researchers, most children are forced into cheap and controllable labor, and work in homes, farms, factories, restaurants, and much more (Beyrer 16; Gozdziak and MacDonnell 171; Vinkovic 88). Trafficked children may be sexually exploited, used in the armed forces and drug trades, and in child begging.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; In terms of global trends, the ILO estimates that in 2004–2008, there was a 3% reduction in the incidence of child labor; this stands in contrast to a previous ILO report which found that in 2000–2004, there was a 10% reduction in child labor.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010" /&gt; The ILO contends that, globally, child labour is slowly declining, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of child workers has remained relatively constant: 1 in 4 children aged 5–17 work in this region.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010"/&gt; Another major global trend concerns the number of child laborers in the 15-17 age group: in the past five years, a 20% increase in the number of these child workers has been reported.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2010" /&gt; A surprised example has occurred in the United States as McCabe (2008) indicates that in the 1990s, huge companies such as Gap and Nike were using industries “sweatshops” that use trafficked children to make their desired products (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref&gt;Mccabe, K.

[[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|The Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] is a protocol of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], formally adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations|title=Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|year=2000|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310131154/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm|archivedate=March 10, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, this protocol formally requires states to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org"/&gt; According to the [[International Labour Organization]], sexual exploitation of children includes all of the following practices and activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=I.L.O.|title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "The use of girls and boys in sexual activities remunerated in cash or in kind (commonly known as child prostitution) in the streets or indoors, in such places as brothels, discotheques, massage parlours, bars, hotels, restaurants, etc."
* "The trafficking of girls and boys and adolescents for the sex trade"
* "Child sex tourism"
* "The production, promotion and distribution of pornography involving children"
* "The use of children in sex shows (public or private)"
Though measuring the extent of this practice is difficult due to its criminal and covert nature, the [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that there are as many as 1.8 million children sexually trafficked worldwide, while UNICEF's 2006 State of the World's Children Report reports this number to be 2 million.&lt;ref name="I.L.O"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents: The I.L.O.'s Response|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNICEF|title=The State of the World's Children 2006: Excluded and Invisible|year=2006|url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/index.php|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] has found that girls involved in other forms of child labour - such as domestic service or street vending - are at the highest risk of being pulled into commercial child sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="I.L.O"/&gt; Likewise, Kendall and Funk justifies how “young girls age 12 and under are malleable and more easily trained into their prospective roles as prostitutes, and because virginity is highly prized by certain consumers willing to pay a premium” (31).A variety of sources, including the [[International Labour Organization|I.L.O]], and scholars Erin Kunze and D.M.

=== Children in armed forces ===
{{Main article|Military use of children}}
[[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|The Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] is a protocol of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], formally adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations|title=Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|year=2000|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-conflict.htm|accessdate=March 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304201115/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-conflict.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the protocol states that while volunteers below the age of 18 can voluntarily join the armed forces, they cannot be conscripted.

=== Children in drug trades ===
Children are also used in drug trades in all regions of the world.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Specifically, children are often trafficked into exploitation as either drug couriers or dealers, and then 'paid' in drugs, such that they become addicted and further entrapped.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Due to the illicit nature of drug trafficking, children who are apprehended are often treated as criminals, when in reality they are often the ones in need of legal assistance.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt; While comprehensive worldwide statistics regarding the prevalence of this practice are unknown, several useful regional studies have been conducted. For example, the [[International Labour Organization|I.L.O]] has recently investigated the use of Afghan children in the heroin trade and child involvement in the drug trades of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy|title=Afghan Children Ensnared in Heroin Trade with Iran|url=http://www.humanrightsanddrugs.org/category/issues/trafficking/|accessdate=March 9, 2012|date=February 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429014857/http://www.humanrightsanddrugs.org/category/issues/trafficking/|archivedate=April 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Brazil Children in Drug Trafficking: A Rapid Assessment|year=2002|url=http://www.dreamscanbe.org/Reasearch%20Page%20Docs/Souza%20e%20Silva%20and%20Urani%20-%20Brazil%20Children%20in%20Drug%20Trafficki.pdf|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Luke Dowdney specifically studied children in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; he found that children involved in the drug trades are at significantly higher risk of engaging in violence, particularly murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowdney|first=Luke|title=Children of the Drug Trade|year=2003|publisher=Viveiros de Castro Editora Ltda|url=http://www.coav.org.br/publique/media/livroluke_eng.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205213532/http://www.coav.org.br/publique/media/livroluke_eng.pdf|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child begging ===
Forced child begging is a type of begging in which boys and girls under the age of eighteen are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"&gt;Delap, Emily. "Begging For Change: Research findings and recommendations on forced child begging in Albania/Greece, India, and Senegal". Anti-Slavery International, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as "the activity of asking for money as charity on the street".&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"&gt;Cherneva, Iveta. "Human Trafficking For Begging". Buffalo Human Rights Law Review 17 (2011): 25. LexisNexis Academic: Law Reviews.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that forced begging is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent [[UNICEF]] study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; The United Nations protocol affirms that "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article."&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), [[European Union|the European Union]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), and the [[United Nations]], among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;  The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating "trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent and worrying phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgium.iom.int/STOPConference/Conference%20Papers/brudeclaration.pdf Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617051511/http://www.belgium.iom.int/STOPConference/Conference%20Papers/brudeclaration.pdf |date=2012-06-17 }}, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that forced begging is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;

==== Demographics ====
By definition child begging occurs in persons younger than eighteen, though forced begging has been found by UNICEF to exist among children as young as the age of two.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt;  Incidences of this practice have been recorded by the [[World Bank]] in South and Central Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and West Africa.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;World Bank [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/244362-1239390842422/6012763-1239905793229/Human_Trafficking.pdf Social Development Notes: Conflict, Crime, and Violence], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most research, such as studies done by UNICEF, suggests that boys are much more likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2006"&gt;"Action to Prevent Child Trafficking Report". UNICEF, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;

While concrete figures are difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that there are at least 600,000 children involved in forced begging.&lt;ref&gt;Craig 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"&gt;Pumin, Yin. "Saving Child Panhandlers". Beijing Review 54.9 (2011). 18-19. EBSCOhost. 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by [[Human Rights Watch]] projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though there is no way of knowing whether it was through forced means.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;UNICEF. "[http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/ZIM_01-805.pdf Study On Street Children In Zimbabwe]" (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang networks involving forced begging have been found to occur in populations of 500 or greater.&lt;ref name="Burke, Jason 2011"&gt;Burke, Jason, and Saad Hammadi. "Bangladesh Arrest Uncovers Evidence of Children Forced to Beg". The Guardian [London] 9 Jan. 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
Children may be trafficked for the purposes of adoption, particularly international adoption.  Children are sourced from orphanages or kidnapped, or parents may be tricked, cajoled or coerced into relinquishing custody. {{Source needed|date=January 2018}}  Disreputable international adoption agencies then arrange international adoptions, charging high fees to prospective adoptive parents.  The [[Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in regard to Intercountry Adoption]] is an international agreement designed to protect children from such exploitation and to assist in preventing such illegal intercountry adoptions.

==== Causes ====

===== Economic factors =====
Forced begging is a profitable practice in which exploiters are motivated by economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked for the purpose of begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer.&lt;ref&gt;Delap 2009, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing [[Capability approach|capabilities]]. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families.&lt;ref&gt;Delap 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===== Political factors =====
According to the World Bank forced begging is most commonly found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which does little to combat the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kevin. "A Generation's Future Goes Begging". The Washington Post [Jakarta, Indonesia] 7 Sept. 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cultural factors =====
There are several cultural factors that support begging. In Europe begging is found in a number of minority cultures, especially popular within Roma and nomadic communities.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; In Turkey familial networks of beggars have been documented across three generations, making it deeply ingrained within their survival schemas.&lt;ref name="Craig, Gary 2010"&gt;Craig, Gary. "Child Slavery Now". Portland: The Policy Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that while these may be culturally rooted practices, juvenile begging by way of familial pressure still falls under the realm of forced begging.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; The transport of children, even one's own, for the purposes of exploitation through begging is a form of trafficking outlined by the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt;

Another cultural practice is the resolution of familial debts through the kidnapping and exploitation of one of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Sidner, Sarah. "[http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/04/gang-profits-from-maimed-child-beggars/ Gang Profits from Maimed Child Beggars]". CNN Freedom Project (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== General abuses ====
UNICEF has found that children who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2006"/&gt; The process of [[Mutilation|maiming]], popularized by the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'', is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit cries, and administering forced injections of drugs that will increase a child's energy and alertness.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.&lt;ref name="Burke, Jason 2011"/&gt;

The conditions in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside.&lt;ref name="Wells 2010"&gt;Wells, Matthew. "Off the Backs of the Children: Forced Begging and Other Abuses Against Talibes in Senegal". New York, New York: Human Rights Watch, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many of the gangs which run networks of forced begging have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts in order for them to become further reliant on their exploiters.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt;

==== Long-term implications ====
Studies have shown that children forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars have been shown to engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

==== Solutions ====

===== International action =====
A victim-centered human rights approach to combating trafficking has been internationally renowned as the best possible strategy when addressing this issue, with recourse focusing on punishing the exploiter and rehabilitating the child.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; Some countries who emphasize this method include the United States, with the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000]] affirming "victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked."&lt;ref name="TVPA 2000"&gt;U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act 2000, p.1468.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other supported methods, such as those outlined by the Buffalo Human Rights Center, include relying on three Ps: protection, prosecution, and prevention.&lt;ref name="Cherneva, Iveta 2011"/&gt; Protection starts with enforcing strict measures on the matters of both trafficking and begging. For many nations the first step is the criminalization of begging and trafficking.&lt;ref name="Craig, Gary 2010"/&gt; Prosecution should be instituted in the form of greater legal ramifications for traffickers, with punishment focused on the exploiter rather than the exploited.&lt;ref name="TVPA 2000"/&gt; This becomes difficult with respect to victims of familial trafficking, considering this would require changes in care placement and strict monitoring of each displaced child's welfare.&lt;ref name="Delap, Emily 2009"/&gt; Many organizations affirm that prevention begins with discouraging donations and improving services so that children, and families as a whole, have greater capabilities.&lt;ref name="Wells 2010"/&gt; Though well-intentioned, by giving child beggars money, individuals only make this practice more profitable, and soon these funds find their way into the hands of the child's abuser.&lt;ref name="Wells 2010"/&gt;

===== Government response =====
In Senegal, where the abuses against  [[talibes]] are extensive, there have been several initiatives with the help of [[World Bank|the World Bank]] to put an end this exploitation. First, there is intervention on a community level with education on the validity of some of these Quranic institutions provided to rural villages that typically send their children there. This is supplemented by improved regulation of schools within the nation to ensure that they remain places of education, followed by a greater enforcement of preexisting laws banning trafficking and exploitative begging. Finally, rehabilitation services have been provided with the help of [[Civil Society Organization|CSOs]] to recovered children to provide them with the capabilities they have been denied.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

In Zimbabwe policy has adapted to ensure the safety of all persons under the age of sixteen with the Children's Protection and Adoption Act, however, the government admits that a lack of resources and capital play a critical role in inadequate enforcement.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

In Bangladesh, where there are an estimated 700,000 beggars, a law passed in 2009 banning the practice, though officials report some trouble with enforcement.&lt;ref name="Burke, Jason 2011"/&gt;

In China, the Ministry of Public Security has established a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are those responsible for the child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"/&gt;

===== NGO initiatives =====
Many NGOs have initiated movements focusing on informing the public on the dangers of donations. As recently reported by UNICEF  "certain behaviors, such as giving money to child beggars can also indirectly motivate traffickers and controller to demand children."&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2006"/&gt; The Mirror Foundation's Stop Child Begging Project of Thailand is one such organization that emphasizes eliminating the demand. Their initiatives are focused on educating passersby on the forced begging of trafficked Cambodians within their country to decrease the likelihood of donations.&lt;ref&gt;humantrafficking.org, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Other methods =====
In China, where the kidnapping and forced begging of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"/&gt; Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children whose families believe have been abducted for the purpose of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.&lt;ref name="Pumin, Yin 2011"/&gt;

In instances where begging is religiously sanctioned it has been suggested by [[USAID|USAid]] that religious leaders should outwardly condemn this practice. For talibes religious leaders have been asked to take a stance against begging using passages cited from the Quran, such as "Except paradise, you should not beg anything for the sake of Allah" (8:23), which would help strip the practice of its religious foundation.&lt;ref&gt;"Study on the Practice of Trafficking in Persons in Senegal". USAid (2004). United States Agency For International Development.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the time of president Clinton - a former president of the United States-, he took the responsibility of providing protection against child abuse through Internet Service providers (ISP) that can help the law enforcement tracking any suspicious activities including child pornography (McCabe, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;247).&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, K.A. (2008). The role of internet providers in cases of child pornography and	child protection. Social Science Computer Review, 26(2), 247-251.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child exchange ===
In China, in response to adult starvation, some children were exchanged, killed, and eaten. According to Robyn Meredith, "peasants [in the People's Republic of China (possibly in ''ca.'' B.C.770)] turned into skeletons. The nation's farmers, including the residents of Xiaogang,&amp;nbsp;.... [among some] starving families[,] resorted to a practice called ''易子而食'' [meaning "exchanging children to eat"]:... they traded a child for a neighbor's child, then killed and ate the skinny youngster, with the sickening knowledge that their neighbors were devouring their own."&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Robyn, ''The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What It Means For All of Us'' (N.Y.: W. W. Norton, 1st ed., hardcover 2007 ({{ISBN|978-0-393-06236-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;19 &amp; nn.&amp;nbsp;10 &amp; 11 (People's Republic of China &amp; ''ca.'' 1958 per p.&amp;nbsp;18) ("a number of Chinese and Western scholars have documented starvation and cannibalism during Mao's Great Leap Forward, but these accounts of what happened in China's countryside are taken from" Becker, Jasper, ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine'' (N.Y.: Free Press, 1996), per ''The Elephant and the Dragon'', ''id.'', p.&amp;nbsp;19 n.&amp;nbsp;11).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Peasant]]s, traditionally farmers who might be slaves, serfs, or free}}{{Efn|[[Xiaogang (disambiguation)]], one of several places in China}}{{Efn|[[Great Leap Forward]], a campaign under Mao Zedong to quickly move China from being agrarian to industrializing and collectivizing to become communist}}

=== Sales motivated by cash ===
In [[ancient Rome]], according to Keith Bradley, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote that "there were indigent parents selling their children because they needed the cash."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Keith, ''Slavery and Society at Rome'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pbk. 1994 ({{ISBN|0-521-37887-7}})), p.&amp;nbsp;37 (book on "central period of Roman history", ''ca.'' 200 B.C. to ''ca.'' A.D. 200) (author prof. classics, [[University of Victoria|Univ. of Victoria]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Nepal, parents of poor families sell their children to [[orphanage]]s (or sometimes simply hand them over without any payment). The orphanage then misrepresent them as "orphans", ensuring an income for the orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/Unreported-World/episode-guide|title=Unreported World|work=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/dateline/story/transcript/id/601840/n/Nepal-s-Orphan-Trade|title=Nepal's Orphan Trade|work=News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
In general, child trafficking takes place in three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002"/&gt; Recruitment occurs when a child is approached by a recruiter, or in some cases, directly approaches a recruiter themselves.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Then, movement will occur - locally, regionally, and/or internationally - through a variety of transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1" /&gt; Ultimately, the final goal of child trafficking is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt; Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.

=== Supply and demand framework ===
Child trafficking is often conceptualized using the economic model of [[supply and demand]].&lt;ref name="United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feingold|first=David A.|title=Human Trafficking|journal=Foreign Policy|year=2005|volume=150|jstor=30048506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, those who are trafficked constitute the "supply", while the traffickers, and all those who profit from the exploitation, provide the "demand".&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Two types of demand are defined: consumer demand and derived demand. Consumer demand is generated by people who actively or passively buy the products or services of trafficked labor.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; An example of this would be a tourist purchasing a T-shirt that has been made by a trafficked child. Derived demand, on the other hand, is generated by people who directly profit from the practice of trafficking, such as pimps or corrupt factory owners.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Scholar Kevin Bales has extensively studied the application of this economic framework to instances of human trafficking; he contends that it is central to an accurate understanding of how trafficking is initiated and sustained.&lt;ref name=Bales&gt;{{cite book|last=Bales|first=Kevin|title=Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bales, along with scholars Elizabeth M. Wheaton, Edward J. Schauer, and Thomas V. Galli, have asserted that national governments should more actively implement policies that reduce both types of demand, thus working towards the elimination of trafficking.&lt;ref name="United States Department of State 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Department of State|title=Trafficking in Persons Report|year=2011|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/164452.pdf|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheaton|first=Elizabeth M.|author2=Edward J.

=== Social mechanisms ===
Various international organizations, including the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]] have linked child trafficking to poverty: Living in poverty has been found to increase children's vulnerability to trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNESCO|title=Poverty, Gender, and Human Trafficking in Sub-Saharan Africa: Rethinking Best Practices in Migration Management|year=2005|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001432/143227e.pdf|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gozdziak 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gozdziak|first=Elzbieta M.|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|year=2008|volume=81|issue=4|title=On Challenges, Dilemmas, and Opportunities in Studying Trafficked Children|jstor=25488246}}{{paywall|via=[[Fondren Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, poverty is only one of many social "risk factors" that can lead to trafficking. As [[UNICEF]] and the [[World Bank]] note, "Often children experience several risk factors at the same time, and one of them may act as a trigger that sets the trafficking event in motion. This is sometimes called 'poverty plus,' a situation in which poverty does not by itself lead to a person being trafficked, but where a 'plus' factor such as illness combines with poverty to increase vulnerability."&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The World Bank|title=Human Trafficking: A Brief Overview|journal=Social Development Notes: Conflict, Crime, and Violence|date=December 2009|issue=122|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/244362-1239390842422/6012763-1239905793229/Human_Trafficking.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]], [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] and several scholars, including Una Murray and Mike Dottridge, also contend that an accurate understanding of child trafficking must incorporate an analysis of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dottridge|first=Mike|title=Trafficking in Children in West and Central Africa|journal=Gender and Development|year=2002|volume=10|series=1|pages=38–42|jstor=4030680|doi=10.1080/13552070215890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Una|title=Good Practices: Gender Mainstreaming in Actions Against Child Labor|year=2003|publisher=International Labour Organization|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in many countries, girls are at a higher risk of being trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dott /&gt; In addition, these international agencies and scholars contend that giving women and men an equal voice in anti-trafficking policy is critical to reducing the incidence of child trafficking.&lt;ref name=Dott /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt;

Studies throughout Europe have identified risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation that are also causes and contributing factors of child trafficking. These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children’s rights to a safe and healthy development.&lt;ref&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre (2008), [http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/iwp_2008_05.%20pdf Young People’s Voices on Child Trafficking: Experiences from South Eastern Europe, Innocenti Working Paper No. IWP-2008-05]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Florence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre (2008), Child Trafficking in Europe, A Broad Vision to Put Children First, Innocenti Insight, Florence, pp. 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children (2007), Children Speak Out, Trafficking risk and resilience in Southeast Europe, Regional Report, pp. 20-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification ==
The complex definition of child trafficking and the differences in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging. For example, the European debate on child trafficking lacks consensus on how child trafficking is to be distinguished from other contexts of exploitation, from [[social dumping]] of migrants, the sale of children and the smuggling of migrants.&lt;ref&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in the Nordic Countries, Rethinking strategies and national responses, A Technical Report, 2012, pp. 34-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a potential victim has come into contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Trafficking in Human Beings: Identification of Potential and Presumed Victims, A Community Policing Approach, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norway: Coordination Unit for Victims of Trafficking, Guide to Identification of Possible Victims of Trafficking, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweden: Handbook for the identification of child victims of trafficking developed by National Board of Health and Welfare with UNICEF Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denmark: Guidelines for identification of victims of trafficking developed by the Danish Centre against Trafficking in Human Beings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identified victims of child trafficking are entitled to special safeguards that all child victims of crimes are entitled to under international law. These safeguards include the right to [[guardianship]], legal assistance and representation, safety and protection, support for physical and psychological recovery and [[social integration|social reintegration]], regularisation of [[Immigration|immigration status]], the right to compensation, and the right to act as a party, or plaintiff, in criminal proceedings. An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, UNICEF Technical Notes, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the exploitation of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse can be considered a victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that they have a right to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013, pp. 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in the Nordic Countries, Rethinking strategies and national responses, A Technical Report, 2012, pp. 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
It is difficult to obtain reliable estimates concerning the number of children trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gozdziak 2008"/&gt; It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; This process of gathering data is only complicated by the fact that very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

=== Worldwide ===
Trafficking of children has been documented in every region of the world.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons (ICAT)|title=An Analytical Review 10 Years on from the Adoption of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol|year=2010|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/ICAT_Backgound_Paper.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely used figure regarding the prevalence of this practice is provided by the [[International Labour Organization]], which estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year; this estimate includes cross-border and internal trafficking.&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O.|title=Every Child Counts: New Global Estimates on Child Labour|year=2002|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/viewProduct.do?productId=742|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional ===
Regionally, the [[International Labour Organization]] has provided the following estimates for trafficking of children by region per year:&lt;ref name="I.L.O. 2002"/&gt;
* Asia/Pacific: 250,000 children
* Latin America &amp; the Caribbean: 550,000 children
* Africa: 200,000 children
* Transition economies: 200,000 children
* Developed/industrialized economies: unknown

As the numbers above indicate, child trafficking occurs the most frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean. Child trafficking is also the most prevalent in developing countries, though it does occur in developed and industrialized economies as well.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="United States Department of State 2011"/&gt; Notably, the [[United States Department of State]] publishes an annual "Trafficking in Persons" report which provides ample data regarding the prevalence of human and child trafficking in the majority of countries.&lt;ref name="United States Department of State 2011"/&gt;  The University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work released a study that estimated as many as 300,000 American youth may be at risk of commercial sexual exploitation at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf |title=SP2.upenn.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History (England)===
According to anthropologist Samuel Pyeatt Menefee, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, in Britain, parents in poverty "sold their children (actually, their children's services, but to all intents and purposes their persons as well)".&lt;ref&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale: An Ethnographic Study of British Popular Divorce'' (N.Y.: St. Martin's Press, 1981 ({{ISBN|0-312-88629-2}})), p. 163 and see pp. 163–165 and p. 133 n. 4 for a quotation from ''Jackson's Oxford Journal'' (Oxford, Oxfordshire), Aug. 12, 1797, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Sale motivations were more economic than for wife sales&lt;ref name="WivesForSale-p165"&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''id.'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; and prices, drawing from limited data, "appear to have been fairly high".&lt;ref&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''id.'', p. 165 &amp; n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the boys sold were climbing boys for chimney sweeps until they were no longer small enough.&lt;ref&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''op. cit.'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution was another reason for selling a child, usually a girl.One sale was of a niece; another was the sale by a man of the daughter of a woman domestic partner who also ran his business. Some children were stolen and then sold.&lt;ref name="WivesForSale-p164"&gt;Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'', ''id.'', pp. 164–165 &amp; nn. 19 &amp; 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==

=== Children and families ===
According to [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]], child trafficking has the most significant impact on trafficked children and their families.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT&gt;{{cite journal|last=UN.GIFT|title=An Introduction to Human Trafficking: Vulnerability, Impact, and Action|journal=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|year=2008|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/An_Introduction_to_Human_Trafficking_-_Background_Paper.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, trafficking can result in the death or permanent injury of the trafficked child.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; This can stem from a dangerous "movement" stage of trafficking or from specific aspects of the "exploitation" stage, such as hazardous working conditions. Moreover, trafficked children are often denied access to healthcare, effectively increasing their chances of serious injury and death.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Trafficked children are also often subject to domestic violence; they may be beaten or starved in order to ensure obedience.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;  In addition, these children frequently encounter substance abuse; they may be given drugs as "payment" or to ensure that they become addicted and thus dependent on their trafficker(s).&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; As opposed to many other forms of crime, the trauma experienced by children who are trafficked is often prolonged and repeated, leading to severe psychological impacts.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt; [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] reports that trafficked children often suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;

Effects on families are also severe. Some families believe that sending or allowing their children to relocate in order to find work will bring in additional income, while in reality many families will never see their trafficked children again.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; In addition, [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] has found that certain forms of trafficking, particularly sexual exploitation in girls, bring "shame" to families.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;  Thus, in certain cases, children who are able to escape trafficking may return to their families only to find that they are rejected and ostracized.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;

=== Communities ===
Child trafficking has also been shown to have a major effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community becomes aware that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

=== Nations ===
On a national level, economic development is severely hindered by the lack of education of trafficked children; this results in a major loss of potentially productive future workers.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt; Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their lack of education, and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt; Furthermore, the persistence of child trafficking indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt; As a result, [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]] has cited child trafficking as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;

== Proposed solutions ==
Solutions to child trafficking, or "anti-trafficking actions", can be roughly classified into four categories:&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=I.L.O |last2=UNICEF |last3=UN.GIFT|title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation - Textbook 2: Action Against Child Trafficking at Policy and Outreach Levels|year=2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/CP_Trg_Manual_Textbook_2.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Broad protection: "To prevent children and former victims from being (re)trafficked"
* Prevention: "Of the crime of child trafficking and the exploitation that is its end result"
* Law enforcement: "In particular within a labour context and relating to labour laws and regulations"
* Protection: "all steps towards the redress of their grievance, rehabilitation and helping to establish her/him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2065674/Child_Trafficking_Problems_and_Solutions|title=Child Trafficking: Problems and Solutions|author=Bianca Daw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad protection actions are geared towards children who could potentially be trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and [[conditional cash transfer]] programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking|UN.GIFT]], the [[International Labour Organization|I.L.O]], and [[UNICEF]] involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education.&lt;ref name=UN.GIFT /&gt;&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinheiro|first=Paulo Sergio|title=World Report on Violence against Children|year=2006|
url=https://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/reports/SG_violencestudy_en.pdf |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities from all over the world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.

Preventative actions are more focused on addressing the actual practice of child trafficking, specifically by implementing legal frameworks that are aimed to both deter and prosecute traffickers.&lt;ref name="United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; This involves the adoption and implementation of the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization's]] [[international labour standards]], as well as the development of safe and legal migration practices.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt;

Law enforcement refers to the actual prosecution of traffickers; [[UNICEF]] maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is the surest way to send a message that child trafficking will not be tolerated.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt; Traffickers can be "caught" at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as [[child labour]] laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by [[UNICEF]] which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.&lt;ref name=TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2 /&gt;Protection begins first with victim identification; child trafficking laws must specifically and appropriately define what constitutes a "trafficking victim".&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; Legal processes must then be in place for removing children from trafficking situations, and returning them either to their families or other appropriate settings.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; Victims should also be provided with individualized and supportive physical and [[Psychological trauma|psychological]] rehabilitation in order to establish him or her self. This recuperation can take quite a length of time but, with the individual having the correct support, they can work towards a functional life.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; Finally, steps should be taken to avoid "double victimization" - in other words, to ensure that formerly trafficked children are treated as victims, and not as criminals.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2" /&gt; An example of "double victimization" would be a child who was illegally trafficked into sexual exploitation in the United States, and then, once free from trafficking, is prosecuted for being an illegal migrant. The End Trafficking Project is the initiative to raise awareness about child trafficking and help people take action to protect children. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/protect/trafficking|title=Child Trafficking|work=UNICEF USA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNICEF has come up with ways to help children from child exploitation and the risk factors that need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/protect/trafficking|title=Child Trafficking|work=UNICEF USA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

* Helping parents provide a living wage, so the children won't have to support the family
* Lobbying governments and others to develop laws and strengthen child protection systems to prevent violence and abuse
* Supporting the training of professionals working with children,and police and border officials to help stop trafficking.
* Working with communities and organizations to change societal norms that make children more vulnerable to exploitation
