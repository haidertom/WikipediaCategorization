'''Adrian Mikołaj Głębocki''' (8 September 1833, [[Panki, Silesian Voivodeship|Panki]] - 15 May 1905, [[Warsaw]]) was a Polish painter, lithographer and art teacher.

==Biography==
After completing secondary school in 1850, he studied at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw until 1857, where his primary instructor was [[Rafał Hadziewicz]]. This was followed by studies in Paris, Vienna and Munich. After completing his studies, he worked briefly in Warsaw as a scenery painter for the set designer, Antonio Sacchetti (1790–1870).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/cgi-bin/obiekt.cgi?act=1&amp;qt=1462656852&amp;nr=12225 Biographical notes] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1863, he lived in  [[Częstochowa]], where he taught at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. 
[[File:Głębocki-JasnaGora.jpg|thumb|350px|Pilgrims Arriving at Jasna Góra]] 
During this time, he created numerous works related to the [[Kalisz Region]]. Many of the buildings he depicted no longer exist, so his paintings have acquired great documentary value. His work includes an album of 52 watercolors of the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] and the ceremonies there. He often accompanied his works with descriptions and commentary, and wrote several articles on the monuments of the region.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.absolwenci.sieniu.czest.pl/index.php?show=art&amp;which=665 Brief biography] @ Absolwenci Sienkiewicza.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1873, he moved to Warsaw. There, he began to provide illustrations for ''Kłosach'' (Ears), ''{{ill|Biesiada Literacka|pl}}'' (Literary Feast) and the ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]''. He also wrote a major article about his work in Częstochowa for the literary journal ''Wiek'' and continued teaching at a school for the deaf as well as giving private lessons.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;  

Many of his lithographs are arranged in "cycles" on religious and historical themes. He also produced several art books for children, including some with cut-out patterns for toys.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

[[File:Angstloch.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An ''angstloch'' at [[Wildenburg Castle (Eifel)|Wildenburg Castle]]]]

An '''''angstloch''''' (apparently "fear hole", but more probably from the [[Latin|Lat.]] ''angustus'' "narrow" and German ''Loch'' "hole") was a small hole in the floor of [[medieval]] [[castle]]s and [[fortress]]es that led to a cellar or basement room below. The term is German and has no English equivalent, although a door, where there is one, to such a hole is called a [[trapdoor]] (German: ''Falltür''). 

An ''angstloch'' is usually located above the basement of a fighting tower or ''[[bergfried]]''. The description of these basement rooms as "[[dungeon]]s" stems from the romanticised castle studies of the 19th century. There is no evidence to indicate that prisoners were really lowered through the ''angstloch'' into the dungeon using a rope or [[rope ladder]] as these 19th century accounts suggest. Archaeological finds, by contrast, indicate the use of these basement spaces as store rooms. For example, piles of stones have been found in such rooms that suggest they were used as a store for projectiles to be used in time of [[siege]].

In 1938, the club started as gatherings to listen to commented jazz music, which remains the main activity of the club today (info {{as of|lc=y|2016}}).&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt;

Since 1950, the club also started organizing concerts.&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; Among the famous jazz musicians who have performed in Antwerp in the 1950s and 1960s, due to the ''AJC'', are: [[Willie "The Lion" Smith]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]], [[Earl Hines]], [[Memphis Slim]], [[Buck Clayton]], [[Bill Coleman]], [[Buddy Tate]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Ray Bryant]] and [[Guy Lafitte]].&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://issuu.com/jazzmozaiek/docs/jm0801_vol_web/21|editor1=Luc De Baefs|editor2=Bernard Lefèvre|publisher=Muziekmozaïek vzw|year=2008|issue=1|page=21|magazine=Muziekmozaïek|first=Bernard|last=Lefèvre|title=Antwerpse Jazzclub 70!

On the club's seventy-year jubilee, the club honoured its own history by means of showing its own concert recordings, lengthy documentation and imagery during its Tuesday-sessions.&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70" /&gt;

On 18 August 2016, the Antwerp cinema "Cinema Zuid" (the new name of the Antwerp "Filmmuseum" since 12 September 2009, after it had moved to the Antwerp district "[[Zuid, Antwerp|South]]" in 2004 under the [[Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp|Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemazuid.be/nl/contacteer|title=Over Cinema Zuid|access-date=13 September 2016|website=Cinema Zuid}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the ''AJC'', organized a screening of two documentaries about the Belgian jazz musician and [[Conducting|conductor]] [[Stan Brenders]] and about the jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Cinema-Zuid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemazuid.be/nl/film/manneken-swing-swing-guitar-genius-django-reinhardt|title=MANNEKEN SWING + SWING GUITAR: THE GENIUS OF DJANGO REINHARDT|publisher=Cinema Zuid|access-date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 8 November 1994, ''AJC'' holds its sessions in a bar called "Den Bengel" in Antwerp.&lt;ref name="Den-Bengel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denbengel.be/Jazz_New.html|website=Cafe Den Bengel|title=Verenigingen gevestigd in "Den Bengel". ANTWERPSE JAZZCLUB|date=27 February 2016|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, the clubhouse of  ''AJC'' is housed in the same building as that bar (which occupies the ground floor), yet on the second floor.&lt;ref name="Lionel-Hampton" /&gt; The building is actually an old [[guildhall|guild house]] ({{lang-nl|ambachtshuis}}) called "Ambachtshuis de Mouwe" (alternative names: "de gulde Mouwe" or "het Cuypershuys"), which is registered and protected as a monument since 2 September 1976 into the Flemish inventary of [[immovable property]], part of the [[heritage registers in Belgium]].&lt;ref name="Inventaris-Onroerend-Erfgoed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/4034|title=Ambachtshuis de Mouwe. inventaris bouwkundig erfgoed \ bouwkundig relict|id=4034|publisher=Onroerend Erfgoed (Flemish Government)|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's ground floor is dated 1579, its [[gable]] is dated 1628. The building was originally the "house" of the [[craft]] of [[cooper (profession)|cooperage]] ({{lang-nl|kamer van het Kuipersambacht}}). The architectural style of the building is [[renaissance architecture]], it was designed by Léonard Blomme, and restaured in 1907. The top of the building is crowned with a triangular [[pediment]] which holds a gilded statue of [[Saint Matthias]], the [[patron saint]] of the coopers.&lt;ref name="Inventaris-Onroerend-Erfgoed" /&gt;

== Notable persons ==

One of its board members is Piet Van De Craen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antwerpse jazz club |website=willy's blog |access-date=13 September 2016 |archive-url=https://blog.seniorennet.be/cowboy/tvblog.php?startaantal=5 |url=https://blog.seniorennet.be/cowboy/tvblog.php?startaantal=5 |archive-date=24 August 2016 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a full-time&lt;ref name="Piet-Van-De-Craen_Professor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.vub.ac.be/food-history/piet-van-de-craen|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]|access-date=13 September 2016|series=Research &gt; Social &amp; Cultural Food Studies|title=Piet Van De Craen}}&lt;/ref&gt; language professor of Dutch Linguistics and of General Linguistics at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]],&lt;ref name="Piet-Professor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vrijzinnigwestvlaanderen.be/deze-maand/evenementdetail/904/-/jazz-koksijde3-0-met-piet-van-de-craen|title=Jazz@Koksijde3.0 met Piet van de Craen|publisher=Vrijzinnig West-Vlaanderen|first=Marc|last=Van Muylen|location=VOC de koepel, Westhoek, Houtsaegerlaan 21, 8670 Koksijde, Belgium|date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has been called a major force behind the jazz club. For the occasion of the seventy-year jubilee of the ''AJC'' in 2008, Piet Van De Craen published a monograph about [[Duke Ellington]] (the first ever publication about him in Dutch) which features a concise biography and discography, looks at Ellington as a pianist/composer and at Ellington's co-operation with [[Billy Strayhorn]] and "The Ellingtonians" before and after 1943.&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70" /&gt; In the same year, Piet Van De Craen also criticized the lack of references to jazz history in the United States:

{{quote|text=The United States doesn't learn anything from the history. Everytime there is a new president, one starts all over again. It is a country where connections are not made. And then it happens that, for example with [[Oscar Peterson]], recently died, the press doesn't make any reference to [[Art Tatum]], just as if Peterson arose out of nowhere ... that kind of profundity is lacking.&lt;ref name="Antwerpse-Jazzclub-70" /&gt;}}

=== Presidents ===

==== Hans Philippi ====

Hans Philippi (born 17 December 1905) founded both the ''AJC'', as well as the ''Hot Club Basel'', a jazz club in [[Basel]], Switzerland. He was an early advocate of the recognition of jazz as an art. He had his own radio series, held jazz music presentations by means of playing sound records throughout Switzerland and was acquainted with jazz musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and jazz experts such as [[Hugues Panassié]] and [[Charles Delaunay]].&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Introduction"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.jazzdocumentation.ch/mario/philippi/1einleitung.pdf|date=24 March 2006|title=Jazz in der Schweiz 1924-1976. Zeitdokumente des Hans Philippi aus Basel. Das Verzeichnis|chapter=Einleitung|author=Mario Schneeberger|access-date=12 September 2016|website=JAZZdocumentation.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss jazz musician Mario Schneeberger compiled a list of notable documents regarding Hans Philippi, from the memorial albums of Philippi, after an acquaintance of Schneeberger had told him that they were about to be put up as garbage disposal following a [[house clearance]] in February 2004.&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Introduction" /&gt;

In this archive by Mario Schneeberger, it is noted that Hans Philippi was president of the ''AJC'' in 1938, as from a booklet of that year produced by the ''AJC'' called "Jazz-Leven".&lt;ref name="Schneeberger-Places"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.jazzdocumentation.ch/mario/philippi/3orte.pdf|date=24 March 2006|title=Jazz in der Schweiz 1924-1976. Zeitdokumente des Hans Philippi aus Basel. Das Verzeichnis|chapter=Orte|author=Mario Schneeberger|access-date=12 September 2016|website=JAZZdocumentation.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Louis Vaes and François Vaes ====

The activities of the club were coordinated by Louis Vaes (1920—1998) from 1946 until 1998.

Later, his brother François Vaes (born 1939), nicknamed "Sus",&lt;ref name="Muziekmozaiek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muziekmozaiek.be/index.php?action=nieuwsdetail&amp;nieuws=2336&amp;titel=Antwerpse+Jazz+Club+in+rouw&amp;select_onderdeel=4090|title=Antwerpse Jazz Club in rouw|series=JAZZ. Jazzweblog|publisher=Muziekmozaïek|date=12 August 2012|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; became president of the club,&lt;ref name="Club" /&gt; until he died after a "short disease" on 9 August 2012. François Vaes advocated for youths to appreciate the roots of jazz, as opposed to being seemingly merely interested in new or trendy jazz music.&lt;ref name="Muziekmozaiek" /&gt;

An '''artist development deal''' is often the first of a [[recording artist]]'s contracts with a major [[record label]]. In lieu of high [[royalties]] or other desirable rights, the label will promise to develop the skills and [[public profile]] of the artist. These types of deals are sometimes most helpful to the artist, but the label often takes control of the artist's management and publishing rights. Historically, such deals have been abused by both record labels and managers.

'''Bonaventura Peeters (I)''' or '''Bonaventura Peeters the Elder''' (23 July 1614 &amp;ndash; 25 July 1652) was a Flemish [[painter]], draughtsman and etcher. He became one of the leading [[marine art]]ists in the Low Countries in the first half of the 17th century with his depictions of marine battles, storms at sea, shipwrecks and views of ships in rivers and harbours.&lt;ref name="vlieghe"&gt;Hans Vlieghe (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AS_NXFoY0M4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Flemish Art and Architecture, 1585-1700]''.

==Life==
Peeters was born in [[Antwerp]] as the son of Cornelis Peeters and Catharina van Eelen.&lt;ref name=bran&gt;F. J. Van den Branden, 'Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool', 2 vols (Antwerp, 1883), pp. 1046–1050 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was baptised in the church of St. Walpurgis in Antwerp on 23 July 1614.&lt;ref name=jan&gt;[http://johnnyvanhaeften.com/media/blog/PEETERS%20Bonaventura%20VP4742%20shipping%20in%20choppy%20seas%20(2).pdf Bonaventura Peeters the Elder, ''Shipping in choppy Seas off Willemstad''] at Johnny van Haeften&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of the seascape painters [[Jan Peeters I|Jan the Elder]], [[Gillis Peeters the Elder|Gillis the Elder]] and [[Catharina Peeters]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/373225 Catharina Peeters] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bonaventura Peeters (I) - Seascape with Sailors Sheltering from a Rainstorm.jpg|left|thumb|270px|Seascape with Sailors Sheltering from a Rainstorm]]

Nothing is known about his early training although it is possible that [[Andries van Eertvelt]], a specialist of stormy sea paintings, was his master.  Bonaventura became a master in Antwerp's [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in 1634.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;  On 5 July 1638 he received a commission of the pensionary of Antwerp to produce maps of the [[Battle of Kallo|Siege of Kallo]] and Verrebroek which had occurred only one month earlier.  He was able to deliver the maps half a month later. This earned him a subsequent commission from the pensionary for a large painting of the Siege of Kallo, which he completed in collaboration with his brother Gillis.&lt;ref name=bran/&gt;  He became one of the few marine specialists active in the Southern Netherlands during the mid-17th century.&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

Initially he shared a studio in Antwerp with his older brother Gillis. However, he moved in 1641 to [[Hoboken (Antwerp)]] where he lived in a spacious residence and worked in a studio with his pupils Catharina and Jan Peeters (I).&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;&lt;ref name=mar&gt;Margarita Russell. "Peeters, Bonaventura, I." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 18 Oct. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He was the teacher of his siblings Catharina and Jan Peeters (I).&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

Peeters never married and died in Hoboken, aged 38 after suffering from ill health the last years of his life.&lt;ref name=moust&gt;[http://www.jeanmoust.com/index.cfm?page=artist-index&amp;cat=4149&amp;subcat=9207&amp;aid=734403&amp;artist=Peeters,%20Bonaventura%20I,%20Tangier About Bonaventura Peeters I] at Jean Moust&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Bonaventura Peeters (I) - Icebear Hunt on the Coast of Norway (?).jpg|thumb|320px|Polar Bear Hunt on the Coast of Norway]]

Bonaventura's marine paintings comprise the whole range of battle scenes, storms, shipwrecks, views of ships in rivers, coastal waters and harbours, night scenes etc.  His earliest marine paintings are panoramic views.  His intimate and accurate knowledge of ships may hint at an early life spent at sea. He paid particular attention to the detailed depiction of clouds and waves.&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;

His earlier works show a similarity to the tonal phase of Dutch [[landscape painting]].  Later paintings reflect the stronger colours of Italianate [[classicism]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe" /&gt; This shift follows the general change in artistic style at the time.&lt;ref name=mar/&gt;  Dramatic shipwrecks with dark billowy clouds form a significant part of his oeuvre, as do serene ports and "[[portrait]]s" of ships.&lt;ref name="vlieghe" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0187.htm Bonaventuur Peeters biography] in: [[Arnold Houbraken]], ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'', 1718 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bonaventura Peeters-Port in Orient mg 3001.jpg|thumb|left|280px|A port in the Orient]]

Many of Peeters' paintings depict actual locations along the [[North Sea]] and the river [[Scheldt]] and these subjects form the bulk of his artistic production.  He may have even travelled along the coast of [[Scandinavia]] as is shown by his views of the port of [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] in Northern Russia one of which offers a scene of reindeers or elks pulling sledges.  His other views of Scandinavian ports and scenes support the view that he may have travelled there.&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;  Bonaventura Peeters the Elder repeatedly returned to the portrayal of seaports with shipping in the foreground.  Peeters the Elder developed something of a speciality in the portrayal of seaports with shipping in the foreground.  His first such view dates to 1634, the year in which he became a master in the Antwerp guild.  It depicts [[:File:Bonaventura Peeters (I) - The 'Hercules' and 'Eenhorn' off the port of Hoorn.jpg|''The 'Hercules' and 'Eenhorn' off the port of Hoorn'']] (1634, [[National Maritime Museum]], London). Peeters’ oeuvre includes a number of smaller examples of this type, including three views of Willemstad, taken from different angles, and a view of Brouwershaven, in Rotterdam.&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

His many views of far-away [[Mediterranean]] and [[Middle Eastern]] ports reflect a growing taste for the exotic and are probably completely imaginary or derived from prints, including those by his younger brother Jan who had travelled in Southern Europe.&lt;ref name="vlieghe" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mar/&gt;&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;  This tradition developed simultaneously in [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with many artists, including Peeters, working in both Antwerp and in the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe" /&gt;  For his views of Brazil Bonaventura may have relied on descriptions or depictions by his brother Gillis, who had travelled to South America.&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;
[[File:Bonaventura Peeters (I) - The 'Hercules' and 'Eenhorn' off the port of Hoorn.jpg|thumb|320px|The 'Hercules' and 'Eenhorn' off the port of Hoorn]]

Bonaventura Peeters is known also for his drawings and engravings with maritime subjects. One of them entitled ''Ships in a storm'' ([[Plantin-Moretus Museum]] in Antwerp) has a poem by him on its back in which he compares the dangers at sea with the dangers that man has to face over a lifetime.&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;  His drawings, as well as those of his family members Jan Peeters I and Bonaventura Peeters II, were used in the preparation of the [[Laurens van der Hem|Blaeu's Atlas Maior of the whole world]] (Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blaeuvanderhem.com/default.aspx?pageid=5 Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem] at Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonaventura collaborated with other family members and artists in Antwerp.  For instance, he collaborated with his brother Gillis on a painting of the ''[[Battle of Kallo]]''.  As he was a gifted [[staffage]] painter he was asked by other painters to paint the figures in their compositions.  His collaboration with father and son [[Pieter Neeffs I|Pieter Neeffs the Elder]] and [[Pieter Neeffs II|the Younger]], painters of church interiors, is documented in the signed examples in the [[National Gallery]] in London and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name=moust/&gt;

'''Book trade in the United Kingdom''' has its roots as far back as the 14th century, however the emergence of [[E-commerce|internet]] [[booksellers]] such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] partnered with the introduction of the [[e-Book]] has drastically altered the scope of the industry. Book retailers such as the [[Borders Group]] have failed to adjust to these changes, thus there has been a steep decline in the number of operating traditional and independent bookshops. However, still heavily influential on the trade globally, British publishers such as [[Penguin Books]] and  [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] remain dominant players within the industry and continue to publish titles gloablly.

==History==

By the 14th century a commercial book trade had been established in the UK, and before printing was introduced to Europe by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 the trade consisted of scribes who wrote manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)P.9&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century the majority of those engaged in these activities were situated in London and belonged to a trade guild called the Company of [[Stationers]].&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)p.23&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 16th century publishers and printers controlled the book trade and introduced a commercial aspect, relying for much of their income on the sales of popular religious books, almanacs, prognostications and similar literature.&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 20th century, as literacy became increasingly universal within society and disposable income increased, publishers were faced with new opportunities. In 1900 the [[Net Book Agreement]] was introduced to ‘help to maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles’&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005) P150&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction and demise of the [[Net Book Agreement]] heavily impacted the [[publishing industry]]. First established in 1900, the Act involved an agreement between booksellers and publishers to fix the price of books in order to "help maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles"&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
The structure of the industry within the UK has altered significantly over the last few decades, which now establishes itself as part of wider industry globally dominated by international giants such a [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] (UK), [[Muse Corporation]] (United States), and [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] (France). The gap between small independent booksellers and giant chain sellers has vastly increased, leading to the dissolution of many medium-sized companies; "Overall the number of significant companies has dropped by ten percent in the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Paul; Taylor, Graham, ''A Guide to the UK Publishing Industry'', (London: The Publishers Association, 2008) p15&lt;/ref&gt; 
Technology has extensively affected developments within the publishing industry. Due to having one of the highest levels of internet connectivity in Europe, the industry in the UK experiences the prevalent threat and the vast opportunity of revolutionary technological advances such as the [[e-book]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]; almost all book publishers in the UK now utilize the standard book number.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Paul; Taylor, Graham, ''A Guide to the UK Publishing Industry'', (London: The Publishers Association, 2008)p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookshops have begun to decline over the years, with just over 73 closures in 2013 alone, the UK lost 7% of its remaining Independent book stores.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Alison, ''Decline in Independent Bookshops continues with 73 closures in 2012'', The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/22/independent-bookshops-73-closures-2012) [accessed 03/12/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of independent book shops has now fallen below 1,000 (2014) whilst even bigger booksellers such as [[Borders]] went into liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Mike,''Borders forced to liquidate, Close all stores'', The Wall Street Journal (http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303661904576454353768550280) [accessed 03/12/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the publishing contributed to the UK creative economy with 231,000 jobs that had an almost equal split between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/industries/publishing/publishing-facts-and-figures], The Creative Industries website, accessed 10 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014, brick and mortar shops have been performing better, seeing a light at the end of the Recession period and the boom of the Kindle. Looking at the data provided, Richard Mollet, chief executive of The Publishers Association, explains that "those who ever tried to maintain that this was a binary choice have been shown to have been posing the question in the wrong way. It is not a question of either physical or digital winning out, but rather of the sector coalescing around a balanced marketplace where all formats have place. While publishing has been efficient and effective in its adaptation, the underlying driver of the evolution is of course the reader. What the 21st-century consumer desires above all is choice. As long as publishers can give readers the option of paper or screen, the market will - and is - taking care of itself. The ebook is no more a challenge to the lifespan of paper than television is to the theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = PA statistics yearbook 2014|last = Clee|first = Nicholas|publisher = Publishers Association|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0853863694|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bran Nue Dae''''' is a 2009 Australian [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Rachel Perkins]] and written by Perkins and [[Reg Cribb]]. A feature [[film adaptation]] of the 1990 stage musical ''[[Bran Nue Dae]]'' by [[Jimmy Chi]], the film tells the story of the coming of age of an [[Aboriginal Australian]] teenager on a road trip in the late 1960s.

==Plot==
In [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] in 1969, Willie Johnson ([[Rocky McKenzie]]) is having trouble wooing his girl Rosie ([[Jessica Mauboy]]), who ends up with a bandleader named Lester ([[Dan Sultan]]). His mother Theresa ([[Ningali Lawford]]) sends him back to [[boarding school]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to continue his education for the priesthood. One night, he and several others steal food from the college kitchen but are caught. Willie admits to being the thief, but runs away before he can be punished. He spends the night on the streets of Perth before meeting up with 'Uncle' Tadpole ([[Ernie Dingo]]), who offers to help him get home. They go to [[Fremantle]] where Tadpole allows himself to be run over by a [[Volkswagen Type 2|Kombi van]], hoping that the two hippies inside will help him. Not realising how far it will be to Broome, the hippies, 'Slippery' the German ([[Tom Budge]]) and Annie ([[Missy Higgins]]), his girlfriend, agree to drive them.

Father Benedictus ([[Geoffrey Rush]]), head of the College, has seen Willie's potential and determines to locate him; through Tadpole's homeless friends, he learns that Willie is heading to Broome. The travellers drive north, stopping at a [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] where Willie meets the tarty 'Roadhouse Betty' ([[Magda Szubanski]]). Tadpole steals some food, a bottle of wine, and an audio tape, nearly causing them to get shot by Betty, but they manage to escape. Slippery becomes disillusioned, and leaves Willie and Tadpole behind in the middle of nowhere; Tadpole curses the hippies by [[Kurdaitcha|pointing a bone]], and the van promptly breaks down.

Willie then gets a ride with a passing truck carrying the members of a football team. They end up in Port Hedland where he meets flirty Roxanne ([[Deborah Mailman]]), who takes him to the 'condom tree' and offers to 'show him a good time', but her boyfriend turns up and a fight ensues. Willie is rescued by Tadpole, who says that all young men end up there at some point. The next morning, they are driving along a desert road when a hung-over Roxanne emerges from the back seat, startling everyone. While smoking some pot, they are discovered by police and arrested, despite Annie's attempts at stopping the police from arresting them. At the police station, Slippery reveals that his real name is Wolfgang Benedictus. The police then put them in a jail cell for a night.

They are released next morning, and drive on to Broome, where they go to the bar where Rosie is performing. Willie tries to win her back, but ends up in a fight with Lester, only to be disrupted by a church [[Temperance movement|temperance march]], which invites everyone to the beach to testify. Willie tells Rosie he loves her, and they kiss. At the beach, Willie's mother reveals that she had a son to another man, who turns out to be Father Benedictus. Wolfgang is their son. Tadpole is spotted by Willie's mother, and she tells Willie that he is Tadpole's son.

===Critical reception===
The film received generally mixed reviews. Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 56% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 61 reviews with an average score of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus is: "It's original and high-spirited, but ''Bran Nue Dae'' is also uneven and sometimes overly kitschy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bran-nue-day/ |title=Bran Nue Dae (2010) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 5022 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bran-nue-dae |title=Bran Nue Dae Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said "It retains that dated once-almost-hip look – like [[Up with People]]", but it contained "blandly stereotypical characters in a trite road-trip narrative" and in regards to younger audiences, claimed "There's scant real dancing, mostly forgettable, showtune-type songs and no ethnic authenticity."&lt;ref name=varietyrev&gt;{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/bran-nue-dae-1200476072/|title=Bran Nue Dae|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Mathieson]] of [[SBS Television|SBS Films]] commented that "''Bran Nue Dae'' has a daffy, garish energy that's reflected in brisk pacing and up-tempo tunes". On director Perkins, he stated "Visually, Perkins is not a natural fit for this material", comparing it to her 1998 feature ''[[Radiance (1998 film)|Radiance]]'', but "here she enthusiastically takes to the moments of farce and productions numbers." Mathieson added that the "frames feel cluttered, with an occasional echo of the amped-up musical melodrama" but concluded approvingly that ''Bran Nue Dae'' was similar to the 1982 Australian musical film ''[[Starstruck (1982 film)|Starstruck]]'' in that it "carries the day with energy and self-belief."&lt;ref name=sbsreview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/movies/review/bran-nue-dae-review |title=Bran Nue Dae Review |work=[[SBS Television|SBS Films]] |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |date=11 August 2009|accessdate=16 March 2018|last=Mathieson|first=Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Age]]''{{'}}s Philippa Hawker praised the cast, stating Dingo was "terrific as Uncle Tadpole", for Rush who "brings an idiosyncratic physical energy and an extravagant German accent to the role" and newcomer [[Jessica Mauboy]] brought "sweetness and confidence to the role of Rosie".&lt;ref name=agereview&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawker|first=Philippa|title=Indigenous film's world premiere introduces some Bran Nue stars|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2009/08/07/1249350685435.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=8 August 2009|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3251">The '''Breac Maodhóg''' is a house-shaped Irish [[reliquary]], today in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. It is thought to date from the second half of the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/Medieval-Ireland-1150-1550 Medieval Ireland 1150-1550]". National Museum of Ireland. Retrieved 6 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; although periods as early as the 9th century have been proposed, the later dating is believed more likely based on the style of its decoration.&lt;ref name="gm136" /&gt; The shrine is made from large plates of bronze on a wooden base, on which are placed series of [[relief]] figures on bronze plaques. At a height of 190mm and width of 92mm, it is relatively large compared to similar objects of its type.&lt;ref name="gm136"&gt;Murray (2005), 136&lt;/ref&gt; It was for centuries kept in a small decorated leather satchel, which was slightly too small for the shrine and is thought to have been designed to hold a manuscript.&lt;ref name="gm136" /&gt;


House-shaped reliquaries date back to at least the 8th century. The figures in the Breac Maodhóg are made from bronze, but so finely [[Molding (process)|moulded]] that they resemble [[wood carving]]s.&lt;ref name="ot86"&gt;O'Toole (2013), 86&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly [[cleric]]s, saints and [[apostles]], they are placed in groupings, some of which are now lost or badly damaged. The surviving figures are given highly individualistic facial feature, expressions and poses. They wear elaborate hairstyles&lt;ref&gt;Laing (2006), 144&lt;/ref&gt; and are dressed in luxurious finery, and the folds of their flowing robes are highly detailed.&lt;ref name="ot86" /&gt;

The most well known figures (pictured above) are of two saints or clerics on the right hand side of the middle register. The saint on the left has a melancholy expression, drooping eyes, and holds his head in one hand, as if sighing. The musician on one side of the front-plate is playing what is thought to be the oldest extant visual representation of a [[harp]].&lt;ref name="ot86" /&gt;

The Breac Maodhóg was thought in the early modern period to have originated at [[Drumlane]] monastery, [[County Cavan]], however its first mentioned, in a 15th century "Life of the saint", describes its donation to the village of [[Rossinver]], [[County Leitrim]] by the Bishop [[Máedóc of Ferns]].&lt;ref name="gm136" /&gt; Its provenance for many centuries is unclear, one account notes that the shrine was "preserved for centuries in Drumlane, and was stolen in the present century from the Roman Catholic priest of that parish".&lt;ref name="gm137"&gt;Murray (2005), 137&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bulla''', an [[amulet]] worn like a locket, was given to male [[children of Ancient Rome|children]] in [[Ancient Rome]] nine days after birth. Rather similar objects are rare finds from Late Bronze Age Ireland.

==Roman bullae==
Roman bullae were enigmatic objects of lead, sometimes covered in gold foil, if the family could afford it. A bulla was worn around the neck as a locket to protect against evil spirits and forces. Bullae were made of differing substances depending upon the wealth of the family.

===Roman boys===
Before the age of manhood, Roman boys wore a bulla, a neckchain and round pouch containing protective amulets (usually [[Fascinum|phallic symbols]]), and the bulla of an upper-class boy would be made of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/clothing.html |title=Roman Clothing |at=Part I |publisher=Vroma.org |access-date=2012-11-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials included leather and cloth.

A freeborn Roman boy wore a bulla until he came of age as a [[Roman citizen]]. Before he put on his ''[[toga]] virilis'' ("toga of manhood") he placed his boyhood bulla in the care of his parental household deities ([[Lares]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, John R., ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 BC-AD 250. Ritual, Space and Decoration,'' illustrated, University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton, 1992, pp. 9-10; citing [[Propertius]], 4.1.13 &amp; [[Persius]], ''The Satires'', 5.30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some modern sources interpret [[Macrobius]]'s single reference to an amulet worn by a triumphal general during his procession as evidence that the childhood bulla was also a standard item of [[Roman triumph|triumphal regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Beard, Mary]]: ''[[The Roman Triumph]]'', The Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Mass., and London, England, 2007, pp. 229-230, 375-376, note 29; citing see also Macrobius, 3. 6. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman girls===
{{main|Lunula (amulet)}}
A girl child did not wear a bulla per-se,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J.L. |last1=Sebesta |first2=L. |last2=Bonfante |title=The World of Roman Costume |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |year=2001 |page=47 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but another kind of amulet, called a [[Lunula (amulet)|lunula]], until the eve of her [[marriage]], when it was removed along with her childhood [[toy]]s and other things. She would then stop wearing child's clothes and start wearing women's [[Roman Dress]].

==Bronze Age Ireland==
A small number of bullae have been found in Ireland; they are called “bullae” based on their resemblance to the Roman form.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Other than superficial resemblance, Irish and Roman bullae have no known connection.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish bullae so-far found were made of base metal&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Irish bullae are usually made of lead, but also tin. Bullae made of clay are rare.&lt;/ref&gt; – sometimes clay – covered with a folded over piece of gold foil. The Irish bullae date to the Late Bronze Age, between about 1150&amp;nbsp;BCE–750&amp;nbsp;BCE.

They were presumably worn suspended round the neck with a cord running through the hole below the flat top. The body of the bulla has roughly vertical sides before making a semi-circle or inverted pointed arch at the bottom. The gold is incised with geometrical decoration.

Whether they were purely for adornment or had an amuletic or other function is unclear.  Despite the small weight of gold used they would have been only available for elite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/bullae |title=Bullae |series=Bronze Age objects |publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme |location=UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808090352/http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/bullae |archive-date=8 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=d0214472-a18a-4fc4-b0c4-018a181ce345 |title=Bulla |dead-url=yes |date=November 2016 |publisher=National Museum of Ireland |df= |access-date=2013-08-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130818160504/http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=d0214472-a18a-4fc4-b0c4-018a181ce345# |archive-date=2013-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wallace |editor1-first=Patrick F.|editor2-last=O'Floinn |editor2-first=Raghnall |title=Treasures of the National Museum of Ireland |series=Irish Antiquities |volume=3 |page=18 |year=2002 |publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan |location=Dublin, EI |ISBN=0-7171-2829-6 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Joan J. |year=1980 |title=Bronze Age Goldwork of the British Isles |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |via=Google Books |pages=65&amp;nbsp;ff |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''camera operator''', sometimes informally called a '''cameraman''', is a professional [[operator (profession)|operator]] of a [[Movie camera|film]] or [[video camera]]. In [[filmmaking]], the person designing the lighting is the [[cinematographer]] or director of photography, who is also informally called a "cameraman" though it is a different job. A camera operator in a [[video production]] may be known as a  '''television camera operator''', '''video camera operator''', or '''[[videographer]]''', depending on the context and technology involved, usually operating a [[professional video camera]].  

The camera operator is responsible for physically operating the camera and maintaining [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] and [[camera angle]]s throughout a given scene or shot. In narrative filmmaking, the camera operator will collaborate with the director, director of photography, actors and crew to make technical and creative decisions. In this setting, a camera operator is part of a [[film crew]] consisting of the [[director of photography]] and one or more camera assistants. In documentary filmmaking and news, the camera is often called on to film unfolding, unscripted events. In 2006, there were approximately 27,000 television, video, and motion picture camera operators employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] |year = 2008 |title = Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition |url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ |chapter = Television, Video, and Motion Picture Camera Operators and Editors |chapterurl = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos091.htm |pages =  |publisher = [[United States Department of Labor]] |isbn = 1-59804-409-5 |accessdate = 10 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Important camera operator skills include choreographing and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]], knowledge of and the ability to select appropriate [[camera lens]]es, and other equipment ([[Camera dolly|dollies]], [[camera crane]]s, etc.) to portray dramatic scenes. The principles of dramatic story telling and [[film editing]] fundamentals are important skills as well. The camera operator is required to communicate clearly and concisely on sets where time and [[film budget]] constraints are ever present.

'''Celtic art''' is associated with the peoples known as [[Celts]]; those who spoke the [[Celtic languages]] in [[Europe]] from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the [[La Tène]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation &amp; that their article will only cover the La Tène period.&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Early Celtic art''' is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent "Late Celtic art" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and "Late Celtic art" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.  This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws&lt;/ref&gt;  Energetic circular forms, [[triskele]]s and spirals are characteristic.  Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from [[Pictish stones]] and the Insular [[high crosses]], large [[monumental sculpture]], even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly the few standing male figures found, like the [[Warrior of Hirschlanden]] and the so-called [[Glauberg#The Keltenf.C3.BCrst .28Celtic Prince.29 of Glauberg .E2.80.93 Germany.27s oldest monumental sculpture.3F|"Lord of Glauberg"]], were originally common in wood.

Also covered by the term is the visual art of the [[Celtic Revival]] (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by [[Modern Celts]], mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and [[nationalism]], and became popular well beyond the [[Celtic nations]], and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from [[Celtic cross]] [[funerary art|funerary monuments]] to interlace [[tattoo]]s.  Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age.  Another influence was that of late La Tène "vegetal" art on the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.

Typically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: "Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover  precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ancient peoples now called "Celts" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier [[Hallstatt culture]] and [[La Tène culture]]. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Brian "Saxons, Vikings, and Celts" (2008) W.W.

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

The term "Celt" was used in classical times as a synonym for the [[Gauls]] (Κελτοι, ''Celtae''). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as [[Edward Lhuyd]] brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]—and [[Goidelic]]—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland.
Then in the 18th century the interest in "[[primitivism]]", which led to the idea of the "[[noble savage]]", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and [[Druid]]ic. The "Irish revival" came after the ''[[Catholic Emancipation]] Act of 1829'' as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the "[[Celtic Revival]]".

==Pre-Celtic periods==
The earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture, comes from the early European Iron Age, ca. 800-450 BC.  Nonetheless the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on "Celticization" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions.  [[Megalithic art]] across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many [[rock drawings]] left by the [[Neolithic]] [[Brú na Bóinne|Boyne Valley culture]] in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later.  Other centres such as [[Brittany]] are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today.  Other correspondences are between the [[gold lunula]]s and large collars of [[Bronze Age]] Ireland and Europe and the [[torc]]s of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck.  The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration.

==Iron Age; Early Celtic art==
[[File:Stone sculpture of celtic hero.jpg|thumb|[[Mšecké Žehrovice Head|Stone head from Mšecké Žehrovice]], Czech Republic, wearing a [[torc]], late La Tène culture]]
Unlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern "Celtic nations", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for "town", [[oppidum]], is now used.  The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves.  The work of the German émigré to Oxford, [[Paul Jacobsthal]], remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his ''Early Celtic Art'' of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Raftery, 184-185; for a preview or summary, see Jacobsthal (1935), and for a long summary in a review see Hawkes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles.  Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as "Celtic".

As Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek [[krater]] from the [[Vix Grave]] in [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which was made in [[Magna Graecia]] (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited.  It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/index.php?page=38 Le Musée du Pays Châtillonnais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230222/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/index.php?page=38 |date=2016-03-03 }} Vix Krater (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another huge Greek vessel in the [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave]] is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman&lt;/ref&gt;  Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roquepertuse-Guerriers.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture from [[Roquepertuse]], including "skull-niches" and seated figures]]

Figures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are "cult wagons" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect.  There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a "leaf crown" — two flattish rounded projections, "resembling a pair of bloated commas", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.&lt;ref name="Raftery, 186"&gt;Raftery, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Human heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based.  Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions.  In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large.  There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 121-126, 138-142&lt;/ref&gt;

The most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including [[relief]]s, come from southern France, at [[Roquepertuse]] and [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]], close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed.  These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier.

In general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people.  There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offerings&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/l/la_t%C3%A8ne.aspx British Museum highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221406/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/l/la_t%C3%A8ne.aspx |date=2015-09-23 }}, La Tène&lt;/ref&gt;), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the [[Waterloo Helmet]], often have no similar other finds for comparison.  Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear.

==La Tène style==
[[File:Gold torque 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Torc]] from the [[Vix Grave]], 480 BC]]
About 500 BC the [[La Tène]] style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction.  The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-5102_1996_num_108_2_1954|title=Manufatti in ferro di tipo La Tène in area italiana : le potenzialità non sfruttate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modern Hungary.  In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all.  Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including [[Scythian art]] and that of the Greeks and [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]] among others. The occupation by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 226-233; Laings, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;  La Tène style is "a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes".&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display.  Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Chapters 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich "princely" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from [[inhumation]] burials to [[cremation]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 21-26; 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[torc]] was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner.  Bracelets and armlets were also common.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 72-79&lt;/ref&gt;  An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant.  The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, [[Chamalières]], France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at [[Clermont-Ferrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Megaws; in the [[Musée Bargoin]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Couvercle bronze gaulois - La Fosse Cotheret (Val d'Oise).jpg|thumb|left|Bronze fitting from France in the "vegetal" style]]

Several phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain.  In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the "early" or "strict" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the "vegetal", "Continuous Vegetal", "[[Waldalgesheim style]]", or De Navarro II, where ornament is "typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface".&lt;ref name="Raftery, 186"/&gt;

After about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into "plastic" and "sword" styles, the latter mainly found on [[scabbard]]s and the former featuring decoration in high [[relief]].  One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a "[[Disney]] style" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an "Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC".  De Navarro distinguishes the "insular" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V,&lt;ref&gt;Megaws (Oppida period); Megaw and Megaw, 10-11, with more detail on these schemes; Laings, 41-42, 94-95; also see Harding, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 233 and Chapter 9; Laings, 94&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Britishmuseumsnettishamgreattorc.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Torc from Snettisham]], England, 1st century BC.]]

The often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other "foreign" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic.  So a torc in the rich [[Vix Grave]] terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the [[Snettisham Hoard]] that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up.  The 1st century BC [[Gundestrup cauldron]], is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69&amp;nbsp;cm, height 42&amp;nbsp;cm), but though much of its [[iconography]] seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of [[Thracian]] manufacture.  To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, A K &amp; Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Antiquity 61'': 10-24&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Agris Helmet]] in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs.

By the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements.

A form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticmirrors.org/ Celtic mirrors website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126064442/http://celticmirrors.org/ |date=2010-01-26 }}, with good pictures and information.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Staffordshire Moorlands Pan (1284837406).jpg|thumb|The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]], 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel.]]

Despite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality.  Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard [[chape]]s, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern [[Northern Ireland]], notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion.  It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 127-133&lt;/ref&gt;

But in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations.  Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south.&lt;ref&gt;Garrow, 2, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lZj9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover google books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231906/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lZj9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a [[Irish Dark Age|period of instability]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially [[Ancient Roman pottery]], of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including [[figurine]]s of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles.  [[Roman Britain]] produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the [[fibula]] but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 125-130&lt;/ref&gt; for example a "hinged brass collar" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/hinged_brass_collar.aspx Hinged brass collar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170209/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/hinged_brass_collar.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }}, British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain also made more use of  [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of [[champlevé]] technique was probably important to the later [[Medieval art]] of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element.  Enamel decoration on [[penannular brooch]]es, "dragonesque" brooches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/d/dragonesque_brooch.aspx|title=Dragonesque brooch |publisher=[[British Museum]]|author=|date=|website=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hanging bowl]]s appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.

===Post-Roman Ireland and Britain===
Celtic art in the [[Middle Ages]] was practiced by the peoples of [[Ireland]] and parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 700-year period from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of [[Romanesque art]] in the 12th century.  Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe.

In Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period.  The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late [[Iron Age]] La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134, 172-173&lt;/ref&gt;  With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish  contacts with the [[Anglo-Saxons]], creating what is called the Insular or [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before [[Viking]] raids severely disrupted monastic life.  Late in the period [[Scandinavia]]n influences were added through the [[Vikings]] and mixed [[Norse-Gael]] populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style.

The [[interlace (art)|interlace]] patterns that are often regarded as typical of "Celtic art" were in fact introduced to Insular art from the Mediterranean, both directly and via the [[Animal style#Germanic animal style|animal Style II]] of Germanic [[Migration Period art]], though they were taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: [[Gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]], chalices like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], and [[penannular brooch]]es like the [[Tara Brooch]].  These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the [[Viking]] attacks sharply set back cultural life.
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ardagh Chalice]], silver and [[millefiori]] glass. Irish. Early 8th century AD.]]

In the 7th and 9th centuries [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Celtic missionaries]] travelled to [[Northumbria]] in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]], which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon [[metalworking]] knowledge and [[motif (art)|motifs]]. In the [[monastery|monasteries]] of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the [[Anglo-Saxon]] art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the [[Tara Brooch]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]]. New techniques employed were [[filigree]] and [[chip carving]], while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The [[Book of Durrow]] is the earliest complete [[insular script]] illuminated [[Gospel Book]] and by about 700,  with the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed [[carpet page]]s that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the [[Book of Kells]], the most elaborate Insular manuscript.  Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]].

In the 9th and 11th century plain [[silver]] became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver [[penannular brooch]]es were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. [[Sculpture]] began to flourish in the form of the "[[high cross]]", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at [[Monasterboice]] and the [[Ahenny]] High Cross.
[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christ in Majesty]], [[Book of Kells]].]]

The impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Ringerike style|Ringerike]] and [[Urnes style]]s, for example the [[Cross of Cong]] and [[Shrine of Manchan]]. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of [[Dublin]], but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at [[Kilfenora]] and crosses at the [[Rock of Cashel]].

===Picts (Scotland)===
From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the [[Picts]] is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts.  The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including [[Iona]], and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south.  After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced [[Pictish art]], with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.

The heavy silver [[Whitecleuch Chain]] has [[Pictish symbols]] on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the [[Norrie's Law hoard]]. These are thought to be relatively early pieces.  The [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]] of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of [[Pictland]] and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD.   

[[Pictish stones]] are assigned by scholars to 3 classes.  Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the [[Pictish Beast]], and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror).  The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others.  This is often taken to symbolise a woman.  Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east [[Scotland]] from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]].  Good examples include the [[Dunnichen Stone|Dunnichen]] and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones ([[Aberdeenshire]]).
[[File:Pictish Stones in the Museum of ScotlandDSCF6250 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pictish symbols and a rider on a [[Pictish stone]]]]

Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces.  The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the [[Insular art|Insular style]].  On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes.  Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so.  The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures.  Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology.  Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle ([[Perthshire]]), [[Aberlemno]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Nigg, Highland|Nigg]], [[Shandwick]] and [[Hilton of Cadboll]] ([[Easter Ross]]).

Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols.  Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, [[Perthshire]]).  These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century.  Examples include the [[sarcophagus]] and the large collection of cross-slabs at [[St Andrews]] ([[Fife]]).

The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle ([[Perthshire]]), [[St Vigeans]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]) and [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrew's Cathedral]] ([[Fife]]) (all [[Historic Scotland]]), the [[Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]] (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, [[Forfar]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Inverness Museum]], [[Groam House Museum]], [[Rosemarkie]] and Tarbat Discovery Centre, [[Portmahomack]] (both [[Easter Ross]]) and Tankerness House Museum, [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]].

==Celtic revival==
[[File:Boyscuchulaincover.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Boys' [[Cuchulain]]'', 1904, in fact closer to Viking [[Urnes style]].]]
{{main article|Celtic Revival}}
The revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in [[Celtic literature]].  By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries.  Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades.  The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as [[Louis Sullivan]], and in [[stained glass]] and wall stenciling by [[Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy]], both based in [[Chicago]] with its large [[Irish-American]] population.  The "plastic style" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into [[Art Nouveau]] decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the [[Isle of Man|Man]]xman [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who did much work for [[Liberty &amp; Co.]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, [[Thomas Bodkin]], writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, "National art all over the world has burst long ago, the  
narrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation." George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. "Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walker, The Modern History of Celtic Jewellery, Walker Metalsmiths, Andover, NY 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlace, which is still seen as a "Celtic" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] setting. ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is an [[animation|animated]] feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.

By the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th-century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carroll, post 1170 in Discussion of Celtic Art, Yahoo Groups 2001, accessed Aug. 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries. &lt;ref&gt;Walker, pg 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

June 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://celticlife.com/international-celtic-art-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021004000/https://celticlife.com/international-celtic-art-day/ |archivedate=2017-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic art types and terms==
[[File:Hanging bowl DSCF6984.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[hanging bowl]] from [[Sutton Hoo]]]]
&lt;!--Note: this is a list of classes or types or terms, not specific pieces--&gt;
*[[Hanging bowl]]. According to the traditional theory, these were created by Celtic craftsmen during the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquests of England. They were based on a Roman design, usually made of copper alloy with 3 or 4 suspension loops along the top rim, from which they were designed to be hung, perhaps from roof-beams or within a tripod. Their art-historical interest mainly derives from the round decorated plaques, often with enamel, that most have along their rims.  Some of the finest examples are found in the hoard at [[Sutton Hoo]] (625) which are enamelled. The knowledge of their manufacture spread to Scotland and Ireland in the 8th century. However, although their styles continue popular Romano-British traditions, the assumption that they were made in Ireland is now questioned.
*[[Carpet page]]. An illuminated manuscript page decorated entirely in ornamentation. In Hiberno-Saxon tradition this was a standard feature of Gospel books, with one page as an introduction to each Gospel. Usually made in a geometric or interlace pattern, often framing a central cross. The earliest known example is the 7th century [[Bobbio Orosius]].
*[[High cross]]. A tall stone standing cross, usually of [[Celtic cross]] form.  Decoration is abstract often with figures in carved relief, especially [[crucifixion]]s, but in some cases complex multi-scene schemes.  Most common in Ireland, but also in Great Britain and near continental mission centres.
*[[Pictish stone]]. A cross-slab&amp;mdash;a rectangular slab of rock with a cross carved in relief on the slab face, with other pictures and shapes carved throughout. Organised into three Classes, based on the period of origin.
*[[Insular art]] or the [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, from the 6th to 9th centuries. The fusion of pre-Christian Celtic and Anglo-Saxon metalworking styles, applied to the new form of the religious illuminated manuscript, as well as sculpture and secular and church metalwork.  Also includes influences from post-classical Europe, and later Viking decorative styles.  The peak of the style in manuscripts occurred when Irish Celtic missionaries traveled to Northumbria in the 7th and 8th centuries. Produced some of the most outstanding Celtic art of the Middle Ages in illuminated manuscripts, metalworking and sculpture.
*[[Celtic calendar]]. The oldest material Celtic calendar is the fragmented [[Gaulish]] [[Coligny calendar]] from the 1st century BC or AD.

'''''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater''''' ([[1821 in literature|1821]]) is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account written by [[Thomas De Quincey]], about his [[laudanum]]  [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and its effect on his life. The ''Confessions'' was "the first major work De Quincey&lt;!--"De Quincey" is always capitalized--&gt; published and the one which won him fame almost overnight..."&lt;ref&gt;Judson S. Lyon, ''Thomas de Quincey'', New York, Twayne, 1969; p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published anonymously in September and October 1821 in the ''[[London Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''London Magazine'', Vol. IV, No. xxi, pp. 293–312, and No. xxii, pp. 353–79.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Confessions'' was released in book form in 1822, and again in 1856, in an edition revised by &lt;!--De is always capitalized in his case--&gt;De Quincey.

==Synopsis==
As originally published,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''Confessions of an English Opium Eater'', edited by Alethea Hayter, New York, Penguin Books, 1971, provides the original magazine text.&lt;/ref&gt; De Quincey's account was organized into two parts:&lt;ref&gt;About the structure of the novel based on paradigms, see (in French)  [[:fr:Yann Tholoniat|Yann Tholoniat]], « Thomas de Quincey et le paradigme perdu ». In ''Lectures d'une œuvre'': Confessions of an English Opium-Eater – Thomas de Quincey. Paris, Éditions du Temps, 2003 : 93–106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I begins with a notice "To the Reader", to establish the narrative frame: "I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable period in my life...." It is followed by the substance of Part I,
** ''Preliminary Confessions'', devoted to the author's childhood and youth, and concentrated upon the emotional and psychological factors that underlay the later opium experiences — especially the period in his late teens that De Quincey spent as a homeless runaway in Oxford Street in London in 1802 and 1803.
* Part II is split into several sections:
** A relatively brief introduction and connecting passage, followed by
** ''The Pleasures of Opium'', which discusses the early and largely positive phase of the author's experience with the drug, from 1804 until 1812;
** ''Introduction to the Pains of Opium'', which delivers a second installment of autobiography, taking De Quincey from youth to maturity; and
** ''The Pains of Opium'', which recounts the extreme of the author's opium experience (up to that time), with insomnia, nightmares, frightening visions, and difficult physical symptoms.
* Another "Notice to the Reader" attempts to clarify the chronology of the whole.

[[File:Cover of Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an Opium Eater.JPG|thumb|The cover of Thomas De Quincey's book ''Confessions of an Opium-Eater''. This version was published by the Mershon Company in 1898.]]

Though De Quincey was later criticized for giving too much attention to the pleasure of opium and not enough to the harsh negatives of addiction, ''The Pains of Opium'' is in fact significantly longer than ''The Pleasures''. However, even when trying to convey darker truths, De Quincey's language can seem seduced by the compelling nature of the opium experience:

::"The sense of space, and in the end, the sense of time, were both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, &amp;c. were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to conceive. Space swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for 70 or 100 years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any human experience."&lt;ref&gt;See Alethea Hayter's Penguin edition, pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
From its first appearance, the literary style of the ''Confessions'' attracted attention and comment. De Quincey was well-read in the English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and assimilated influences and models from Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and other writers. Arguably the most famous and often-quoted passage in the ''Confessions'' is the [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] to opium in the final paragraph of ''The Pleasures'':

::"Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for 'the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,' bringest an assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed pure of blood...."

De Quincey modelled this passage on the apostrophe "O eloquent, just and mightie Death!" in Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''History of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, pp. 83, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in ''The Pleasures of Opium'', De Quincey describes the long walks he took through the London streets under the drug's influence:

::"Some of these rambles led me to great distances; for an opium-eater is too happy to observe the motions of time. And sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating all the capes and headlands I had doubled in my outward voyage, I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such enigmatical entries, and such sphinx's riddles of streets without thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of porters, and confound the intellects of hackney-coachmen."&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Confessions'' represents De Quincey's initial effort to write what he called "impassioned prose", an effort that he would later resume in ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845) and ''[[The English Mail-Coach]]'' (1849).

==The 1856 revision==
In the early 1850s, De Quincey prepared the first collected edition of his works for publisher James Hogg. For that edition, he undertook a large-scale revision of the ''Confessions'', more than doubling the work's length. Most notably, he expanded the opening section on his personal background, until it consumed more than two-thirds of the whole. Yet he gave the book "a much weaker beginning" and detracted from the impact of the original with digressions and inconsistencies; "the verdict of most critics is that the earlier version is artistically superior".&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

"De Quincey undoubtedly spoiled his masterpiece by revising it... anyone who compares the two will prefer the unflagging vigour and tension of the original version to the tired prosiness of much of the revised one".&lt;ref&gt;Alethea Hayter's Introduction to the Penguin edition, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Confessions'' maintained a place of primacy in De Quincey's literary output, and his literary reputation, from its first publication; "it went through countless editions, with only occasional intervals of a few years, and was often translated. Since there was little systematic study of narcotics until long after his death, De Quincey's account assumed an authoritative status and actually dominated the scientific and public views of the effects of opium for several generations."&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet from the time of its publication, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' was criticized for presenting a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, ''Advice to Opium Eaters'', was published "to warn others from copying De Quincey."&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Berridge and [[Griffith Edwards]], ''Opium and the People: Opiate Use in Nineteenth-Century England'', New Haven, Yale University Press, 1987; p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — [[Francis Thompson]], [[James Thomson (B.V.)|James Thomson]], William Blair, and perhaps [[Branwell Brontë]] — were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge and Edwards, p. 53; Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s 1860 translation and adaptation, ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, ''[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]'' (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the ''Confessions''. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, pp. 93–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' influenced [[psychology]] and [[abnormal psychology]], and attitudes towards dreams and imaginative literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alethea Hayter]], ''Opium and the Romantic Imagination: Addiction and Creativity in de Quincey, Coleridge, Baudelaire and Others'', revised edition, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, Crucible, 1988; pp. 101–31 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater'' also served as inspiration to one of [[Hector Berlioz]]'s most famous pieces, ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The play ''The Opium Eater'' by [[Andrew Dallmeyer]] was also based on ''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater'',&lt;ref name=Caper&gt;{{cite web|title=Opium Eater by Andrew Dallmeyer|url=http://www.capercailliebooks.co.uk/shop/fairplay-press/opium-eater-by-andrew-dallmeyer/|website=Capercaillie Books|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150223180854/http://www.capercailliebooks.co.uk/shop/fairplay-press/opium-eater-by-andrew-dallmeyer/|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been published by [[Capercaillie Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsD/dallmeyer-andrew.html|title=ANDREW DALLMEYER|publisher=Doollee The Playwrights Database |date=|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vagabondproductions.weebly.com/miss-julie-reviews.html|title=Miss Julie Fringe Sell Out show 2012|publisher=Vagabond Productions|date=|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Vincent Price]] starred in the full-length film ''[[Confessions of an Opium Eater]]'' which was a reimagining of De Quincey's ''Confessions'' by Hollywood producer [[Albert Zugsmith]].

'''Federico Ferrari''' (born 15 September 1969) is an Italian [[philosopher]] and [[art critic]]. He teaches Philosophy of Art at [[Brera Academy]], in Milan, Italy.

== Career ==
Under the influence of [[Maurice Blanchot]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] he has published many essays on philosophy, as well as literature. He has written two books with [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]: the first on the subject of nude,&lt;ref&gt;Ginette Michaud, ''Nus sommes [la peau des images], de Federico Ferrari et Jean-Luc Nancy'', Spirale, Montreal, n. 192, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the second on the iconography of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Mavrikakis]], ''Iconographie de l’auteur, de Federico Ferrari et Jean-Luc Nancy'', Spirale, Montreal, n. 204, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, he has been working on the deconstruction of the museum in post-modernity, on the issue of art and/in time and on the ontological status of the image.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.teknemedia.net/magazine_detail.html?mId=8842/ Il re è nudo]" by Antonello Tolve in "Arskey"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/contemporanea/il-mondo-immagine-e-l%E2%80%99insieme-vuoto/ Il mondo-immagine e l'insieme vuoto]" by Fabrizio Migliorati in "doppiozero"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 he theorized the aesthetics of "Arte Essenziale", which manifested itself in the show held at [[Collezione Maramotti]] ([[Reggio Emilia]], Italy) and at [[Frankfurter Kunstverein]] (Germany).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fkv.de/files/111031_besucher_a4_arte_rz04.pdf/  Shortguide of the exhibition]" by FKV&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eugenio Viola]] writes of Ferrari, "In a time when many continue to lament what they see as the inexorable decline of theory’s role in criticism, “Arte essenziale” (Essential Art), curated by philosopher Federico Ferrari, does its part to placate concerns with an exploration of the ties that link artistic practice and philosophical speculation. The show focuses on the Wesen, or essence, of a work of art—a notion that has always been inextricably linked with a search for the new."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://artforum.com/picks/id=28538&amp;view=print/  Arte essenziale]" by Eugenio Viola in "Artforum"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">The term '''Formalesque''' was coined in 1994 by Australian art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]] to replace 
[[Modernism]] as the name of the [[Art styles, periods and movements|artistic style]] of the period from around 1890 to 1960, now that this is no longer "modern".

''[[Modernism]]'' had emerged as a generic term to replace ''[[Post-Impressionism]]'' for the paintings of [[Manet]], [[Cézanne]], [[van Gogh]], and [[Gauguin]]. According to Smith, the key emphasis in such work is the importance of ''form'' and ''flatness''. The term was soon applied also in architecture (e.g. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]]) and sculpture (e.g. [[Jacob Epstein|Epstein]] and [[Brâncuși]]).

After 1960, Modernism was displaced by [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]], and then by the art still at present referred to as "[[contemporary art]]". Since [[Modernism]] is no longer "modern", Smith argues that it requires a more appropriate [[Art styles, periods and movements|period style]] name to distinguish it: hence his introduction of '''Formalesque'''. Like "romanesque" and "arabesque", the name is intended to indicate a style that arose by the development of a basic interest in form (but without the specific connotations of the term [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]]).

'''''Freedom of Worship''''' or '''''Freedom to Worship''''' is the second of the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' oil paintings produced by the American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The series was based on the goals known as the [[Four Freedoms]] enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in his [[State of the Union Address]] delivered on January 6, 1941.  Rockwell considered this painting and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' the most successful of the series. ''Freedom of Worship'' was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' alongside an essay by philosopher [[Will Durant]].

==Background==
''Freedom of Worship'' is the second of a series of four oil paintings by [[Norman Rockwell]] entitled ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''. The works were inspired by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[State of the Union Address]] delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, known as [[Four Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=April 11, 2008|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the [[United States Constitution]] are [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=FSP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574406903628933162|title=Free Speech Personified: Norman Rockwell's inspiring and enduring painting|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=October 10, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cole, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' World War II policy statement, the [[Atlantic Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&amp;pg=PA49|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&amp;pg=PA287|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"/&gt; The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', accompanied by essays from noted writers: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''Freedom of Worship'' (February 27), ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' (March 6) and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' (March 13).&lt;ref name=NRFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814161913/http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archivedate=August 14, 2007|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=The Countryman Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the essay accompanying ''Freedom of Worship'', ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame.

Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the [[Series E bond|U.S. Government War Bond]] Drive.&lt;ref name=AASfaWP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63|title= Art/Architecture; Salve for a Wounded People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 2001|author=Marling, Karal Ann|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415212052/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63 |archivedate = April 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ILTPP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK102&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=27em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world."|source=—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]]}}
The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with [[Kippah|his head covered]] carrying a religious book who is [[American Jews|Jewish]], an older woman who is [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]], and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding [[rosary beads]] who is [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; In 1966, Rockwell used ''Freedom of Worship'' to show his admiration for [[John F. Kennedy]] in a ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' story illustration entitled ''JFK's Bold Legacy''. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to ''Freedom of Worship'' along with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Freedom of Worship original draft.jpg|thumb|The original draft of ''Freedom of Worship'' was set in a barbershop.]]
The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair.&lt;ref name=S207&gt;Solomon, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; His first workup was a {{convert|41|×|33|in|cm|adj=on}} oil on canvas depicting tolerance as "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services.&lt;ref name=C311&gt;Claridge, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like.&lt;ref name=HaK100&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should.&lt;ref name=C311-2&gt;Claridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.&lt;ref name=S209&gt;Solomon, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches,&lt;ref name=AASfaWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK96&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works.&lt;ref name=S204&gt;Solomon, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the ''Post'' was worried about Rockwell's progress on the ''Four Freedoms'' and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on ''Freedom of Worship'', his second painting in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942)&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; on this work, that was inspired by the phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." His [[Arlington, Vermont]], neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary,&lt;ref name=M128&gt;Meyer, pp. 128–33.&lt;/ref&gt; even though she was actually Protestant of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center).&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with ''The Post'' who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his [[fez (hat)|fez]], was too obviously foreign to offend."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;  The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns.  The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.&lt;ref name="HaK102"/&gt;

Rockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to ''Freedom of Worship'', "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over."&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;

==Critical review==
''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs said of ''Speech'' and ''Worship'', "To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The ''Four Freedoms'' did&amp;nbsp;— and do."&lt;ref name="MaM 59"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] wrote, "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it."&lt;ref name="MaM 69"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell believed that ''Freedom of Worship'' and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' were his better results in the series.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; [[Laura Claridge]] has written that the inspirational phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" is a "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Thirteen Articles of Faith]]'' by [[Joseph Smith]]."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published.&lt;ref name=MaM50/&gt; The expression "according to the dictates of his conscience" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqOopdewZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Blueprint for Judicial Reform|author1=McGuian, Patrick B. |author2=Rader, Randall R.|isbn=978-0-942522-08-2|pages=301–5|publisher=The Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in ''Freedom of Religion''.&lt;ref name=ILTPP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|date=June 21, 1943|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claridge feels that &lt;blockquote&gt;the tight amalgam of faces&amp;nbsp;... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking.&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Claridge stated that the earlier version was "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the "storytelling style" that Rockwell is known for.&lt;ref name=MaM50&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]] considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat "didactic".&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;  Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/bio_1706.html|title=Maureen Hart Hennessey|accessdate=June 29, 2014|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive.&lt;ref name=HaK100/&gt; Bruce Cole of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Rockwell's "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable."&lt;ref name="FSP"/&gt;

'''Hans Feibusch''' (15 August 1898 – 18 July 1998) was a [[German people|German]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[sculptor]] of Jewish heritage who lived and worked in Britain from 1933 until his death.  He is best known for his murals, particularly in Anglican churches.  In all he worked in thirty Anglican churches (28 as a muralist, and two—including [[Ely Cathedral]]—as sculptor only) and produced what is probably the largest body of work in his particular métier by any artist in the history of the [[Church of England]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Early life in Germany==
Feibusch was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]] to Jewish parents.  His father was a dental surgeon and his mother was an amateur painter.  He served with the German Army on the Russian front during the [[First World War]], from 1916 to 1918.

After the war he studied art in [[Munich]]. Subsequently, he worked under [[Karl Hofer]] at the Berlin University of the Arts, and then in [[Paris]] with [[Andre Lhote]].  He returned to Frankfurt in 1925 to work as an artist, with a studio in the former [[:de: Karmeliterkloster (Frankfurt am Main)|Carmelite convent]] alongside [[Rudolf Heinisch]] and [[Benno Elkan]].  He was awarded a prize by the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] in 1931 for his painting ''The Fishmonger''.

After the [[Nazi party]] came to power, he emigrated to England in 1933.  His works were subsequently exhibited in the 1937 exhibition of [[Entartete Kunst]] (Degenerate Art).  Feibusch was one of a minority of artists included whose work was relatively conservative, and he was probably included for his Jewish heritage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} His works in that exhibition, now lost, were two paintings of angels.  His work ''Zwei schwebende Figuren'' ("Two floating figures"), confiscated from the Städtischen Galerie in Frankfurt, was displayed with works by [[Jankel Adler]] and [[Marc Chagall]] as part of the exhibition entitled "Offenbarung der jüdischen Rassenseele gezeigt" ("Revelation of the Jewish racial soul")

==Life in England==
[[File:P1310033HansF.JPG|thumb|upright|"The Baptism of Christ" in Chichester Cathedral]]

Feibusch joined the [[London Group]] of artists in 1934 and the following year he married Sidonie Cranmer, a daughter of [[David Gestetner]] and the divorced wife of Max Cramer.

He swore an oath of allegiance to the British Crown in 1940.  He first exhibited work at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1944.

After the war, he became known for his church murals, working on around separate 30 churches.  He converted to [[Christianity]] and was baptized and confirmed into the Church of England in 1965.  He worshipped at the church of [[St Alban the Martyr, Holborn]], where he painted his largest mural.

Feibusch wrote a book ''Mural Painting'', published in 1946, and published in a number of journals about mural painting.  A celebration of his life work was held by the [[Twentieth Century Society]] in 1993, which was the first event of a reappraisal of his work.

He was awarded the Officer's Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (Verdienstkreuz 1. Klasse) in 1967, and advanced to the Commander's Cross or Great Cross of Merit (Großes Verdienstkreuz) in 1989.

Feibusch died four weeks short of his 100th birthday, just after attending a celebration of his work and life held at the [[Royal College of Art]]. His estate bequeathed the entire contents of his studio at the time of his death to the [[Pallant House Gallery]] in Chichester.  He died at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in [[Camden, London]].  In the last years of his life he reverted to the Jewish faith of his youth and was buried with Jewish liturgy at [[Golders Green Jewish Cemetery]].

==Work in England and Wales==
Feibusch's work was always representational but he developed early on an [[Expressionist]] use of colour and intensity of vision. Feibusch used colour to accentuate intent and meaning.  The composition, often of closely grouped figures, are [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] in their arrangement and mannered poses.

His first public mural in England was ''The Footwashing'', for the New Methodist Hall in [[Colliers Wood]], a commissioned by Edward D. Mills in 1937.  He was befriended by [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Chichester]], whose influence caused him to receive the first of his church commissions for murals on religious themes.  Among the first of these is the mural in the bishop's private chapel in the episcopal palace in Chichester.  This made use of the medieval wall already existing at the chapel's west end, containing blocked windows.  Feibusch depicted people looking out of the windows.  Many though not all of his murals are in the [[Diocese of Chichester]], including a [[Pilgrim's Progress]] at [[St Elisabeth's Eastbourne]], [[Christ in Majesty]] at [[St Mary's Church, Goring-by-Sea]], the [[Prodigal Son]] in [[All Saints, Iden]], and St John Baptising Christ in the baptistery at [[Chichester Cathedral]], a nativity cycle at [[St Wilfrid's Church, Brighton]].  Others works are at churches in [[Coventry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This incredible religious mural was bricked up for 40 years – until now|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/whats-on/arts-culture-news/incredible-religious-mural-bricked-up-12935352|accessdate=6 January 2018|publisher=Coventry Telegraph|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wellingborough]], Preston, Paulsgrove, and [[Exeter]]; [[Christchurch Priory]] in [[Dorset]]; and others at [[St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate]] and St Alban the Martyr, Holborn in London.  He created a mural of the Trinity in Glory for St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, in 1966, his largest single work, together with fourteen [[stations of the cross]] and a bronze figure of Christ for the outer wall of the church.  Another large work in London is the Adoration of the Cross at St Michael and All Angels in Harrow. More work in London at [[St John's Church, Waterloo]]. For nearly forty years the artist [[Phyllis Bray]] collaborated with Feibusch on producing his church murals.&lt;ref name=LTMpb&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/people/item/1996-5723|title=Phyllis Bray, 1911–1991|date=|accessdate=4 April 2018|work=London Transport Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also produced non-religious work at the village of [[Portmeiron]] in [[Wales]] as a result of his friendship with [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], and his portrait of Williams-Ellis is held in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]].  He also decorated civic buildings in [[Dudley]] and Newport.  A series of 12 murals by Feibusch, each over {{convert|20|ft|m}}, around the central hall of [[Newport Civic Centre]], tell the history of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]].  They were commissioned by [[Newport City Council|Newport Corporation]] in 1960 and painted during the period 1961–1964. The [[Dolman Theatre]] in Newport houses a mural of an early travelling theatre painted by Feibusch in 1967.

A '''''hazzan''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑː|z|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hazzan "hazzan"].

&lt;/ref&gt; In English, this prayer leader is often referred to as [[cantor]], a term also used [[Cantor (Christianity)|in Christianity]].

== ''Sh'liaḥ tzibbur'' and the evolution of the hazzan ==
The person leading the congregation in public [[prayer]]s is called the ''[[Shaliah|sh'liaḥ]] tzibbur'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "[[wikt:emissary|emissary]] of the congregation"). [[halakha|Jewish law]] restricts this role to adult Jews.&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml 
|title=The Cantor |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, any lay person can be a ''sh'liaḥ tzibbur''; most synagogue-attending Jews will serve in this role every now and again. Someone with good Hebrew pronunciation is preferred. In practice, those with the best voice and the most knowledge of the prayers serve most often. As public worship was developed in the [[Geonim|Geonic]] period and as the knowledge of the Hebrew language declined, singing gradually superseded the [[didactic]] and [[hortatory]] element in the worship in the synagogue. Thus, while the idea of a cantor as a paid professional does not exist in classical rabbinic sources, the office of the ''hazzan'' increased in importance with the centuries, evolving a specialized skill set and becoming a career in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.jta.org/2008/08/15/life-religion/rip-orthodox-cantoring?_ga=2.170917606.757822227.1543719664-232171041.1543719664
|title=R.I.P. Orthodox cantoring? |date=August 15, 2008  |website=JTA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
Even in the earliest times the chief qualifications demanded of the ''hazzan'', in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature as well as the prayer motifs (known as ''steiger''), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The ''hazzan'' was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna|Isaac of Vienna]] (13th century), a young ''hazzan'' having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. [[Maimonides]] decided that the ''hazzan'' who recited the prayers on an ordinary [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he might even have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach at the time of his appointment.

But all these moderations of the rule disappeared on holidays; then an especially worthy ''hazzan'' was demanded, one whose life was absolutely irreproachable, who was generally popular, and who was endowed with an expressive delivery. Even a person who had ever litigated in a non-Jewish court, instead of a Jewish court, could not act as ''hazzan'' on those days, unless he had previously done penance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulkhan Arukh]], Orah Hayyim, 581&lt;/ref&gt; However many authorities were lenient in this regard, and as long as a cantor was "merutzeh l'kehal," desired by the congregation, he was permitted to lead the prayers even on the holiest of days.

Today, a ''hazzan'', particularly in more formal (usually not Orthodox) synagogues, is likely to have academic credentials—most often a degree in music or in sacred music, sometimes a degree in music education or in Jewish religious education or a related discipline. The doctor of music degree is sometimes awarded to honour a ''hazzan''.

==Professional status==
The role of ''hazzanim'' as a respected full-time profession has become a reality in recent centuries. In the last two centuries Jews in a number of European communities, notably Germany and Britain, came to view professionally trained ''hazzanim'' as clergy and the ''hazzan'' as the deputy rabbi. After the enlightenment, when European nations gave full citizenship and civil rights to Jews, professionally trained ''hazzanim'' were accepted by the secular governments as clergy in the same way as rabbis.

In a paradoxical turn of events, the United States government recognized cantors as the first Jewish clergy, even before [[rabbi]]s were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who would not have the expertise in liturgy a hazzan would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a hazzan for a synagogue (and made sure that a kosher butcher was established in the neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the hazzan (and the butcher) as a more immediate need. The hazzan therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.

In the United States, many hazzanim supplement their ministry by also earning certification as and working as [[mohel]]s, for [[bris]] ceremonies.

In the United States there are three main organizations for professionally trained ''hazzanim'', one from each of the major Jewish denominations:

*[[American Conference of Cantors]]—[[Reform Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rj.org/acc/ American Conference of Cantors]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cantors Assembly]]—[[Conservative Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantors.org/ Cantors Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cantorial Council of America—[[Orthodox Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yu.edu/belz/ Belz School of Jewish Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Many members of the [[Cantors Assembly]] are trained at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America#Cantorial School|H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. Many members of the [[American Conference of Cantors]] are trained at the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music at [[Hebrew Union College]]—Jewish Institute of Religion, School of Sacred Music (New York) Reform. Both of these programs offer a five-year training program. Members of the Cantorial Council can train at the [[Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music]] at [[Yeshiva University]] in New York City.

ALEPH, the movement for Jewish Renewal, includes a cantorial training program as part of its ordination program.

Full cantorial training is also offered by the Cantorial School of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (California)]] in Los Angeles, the Cantorial Program at the similarly named [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]] in New York, and the School of Jewish Music at [[Hebrew College]]. These institutions are unaffiliated with any particular Jewish denomination.

The curricula for students in these programs generally include, but are not limited to:

{{Div col}} 
* Hebrew: modern, Biblical (Torah), and liturgical (''[[siddur]]'')
* ''[[Nusach]]'' (liturgical tradition)
* Laws and traditions pertaining to Jewish prayer service
* History and content of the ''siddur''
* Music theory, sight-reading
* Playing an instrument, usually a piano or guitar
* Singing technique
* [[Cantillation]]—tropes for the liturgical chanting of biblical books
* Choral conducting
* Jewish history
* [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible)
* Jewish music history
* Pastoral care and counseling
* Theology
{{Div col end}}

===Non-Orthodox titles===
Until 2012, neither the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] nor [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] streams used the term "ordained" for trained cantors; saying "invested" precluded confusion with those they titled rabbi.&lt;ref name=MyCant&gt;{{cite web 
|title=What Is A Cantor (Hazzan or Chazan)?
|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-cantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conservative has stayed with that distinction.

==Female cantors in non-Orthodox Judaism==
Traditionally a ''hazzan'' was always a man.

Today most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism no longer maintain gender distinctions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=examining the concept of gender role ideology

==Golden age==
The period between the two world wars is often referred to as the "golden age" of ''hazzanut'' (cantorial performance). The greats include [[Zavel Kwartin]] (1874–1953), [[Moritz Henle]] (1850–1925), [[Yossele Rosenblatt|Joseph "Yossele" Rosenblatt]] (1882–1933), [[Gershon Sirota]] (1874–1943), and [[Leib Glantz]].

In the post–World War II period, prominent cantors were [[Moshe Koussevitzky]], [[David Werdyger]], [[Frank Birnbaum]], [[Richard Tucker]] and [[Abraham Lopes Cardozo]] (1914–2006). Operatic tenor [[Jan Peerce]], whose cantorial recordings were highly regarded, was never a cantor by profession but often served as one during the [[High Holidays|high holidays]].

Popular contemporary cantors include [[Shmuel Barzilai]], [[Naftali Hershtik]], [[Yitzchak Meir Helfgot]], Chazzan Avraham Aharon Weingarten, Ari Klein, [[Yaakov Lemmer]], [[Joseph Malovany]], [[Benzion Miller]], Jacob (Jack) Mendelson, Aaron Bensoussan, Aaron Aderet, Alberto Mizrahi, Yaakov Yoseph Stark, Jochen (Yaacov) Fahlenkamp, and Eli Weinberg.

{{Quran}}

The '''history of Quran''' refers to the oral revelation of the [[Quran]] to Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and its subsequent written compilation into a manuscript. It spans several decades and forms an important part of early [[Islamic history]].

According to Muslim belief and Islamic scholarly accounts, the revelation of the [[Quran]] began in 610 C.E. when the angel [[Gabriel]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جبريل, ''Jibrīl'' or جبرائيل, ''Jibrāʾīl'') appeared to Muhammad in the cave [[Hira]] near [[Mecca]], reciting to him the first [[Ayat|verse]]s of [[Sura]] [[Iqra]] (al-`Alaq). Throughout his life,  Muhammad continued to have revelations until before his death in 632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donner|first=Fred|title=Muhammad and the Believers: at the Origins of Islam|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=London, England|isbn=978-0-674-05097-6|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran as it is known in the present, was first compiled into book format by [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] and other scribes under the third [[caliph]] [[Uthman]] ([[R.#Historiography|r.]] 644–56). For this reason, the Quran as it exists today is also known as the Uthmanic codex.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} According to Professor [[Francis Edward Peters]] (1927), what was done to the Quran in the process seems to have been extremely conservative and the content was formed in a mechanical fashion to avoid redactional bias.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, The Quest of the Historical Muhammad, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 23, No. 3 (August 1991), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin according to Islamic tradition==
{{See also|Wahy}}
{{Muhammad}}
According to traditional Islamic beliefs, the Quran was revealed to [[Muhammad]], starting one night during the month of [[Ramadan]] in 610 AD, when he, at the age of forty, received the first revelation from the angel Gabriel, who had given him the responsibility for inscribing these messages from [[God in Islam|God]] to give to mankind.&lt;ref name=WSU&gt;{{cite web|author=Muslim Information Service of Australia |url=http://www.missionislam.com/quran/beginrevelation.htm |title=Beginning of Revelation |publisher=Missionislam.com |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran uses the term ''ummi'' to describe Muhammad. The majority of Muslim scholars interpret this word as a reference to an illiterate individual, though some modern scholars instead interpret it as a reference to those who belong to a community without a [[People of the Book|scripture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Illiterate Prophet (Nabi Ummi): An inquiry into the development of a dogma in Islamic tradition|volume=57|journal=Islam|page=58-68|year=1980|last1=Goldfield|first1=Isaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reza Aslan|title=No God But God: The Origins, Evolution and Future of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP1zoWqpqg4C&amp;pg=PA6|date=2 December 2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-0928-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] (810–870), Muhammad's wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] described that the first Quranic revelation occurred when the angel Gabriel visited Muhammad and asked him to recite. Muhammad responded ''ma ana bīqāre'u'', which could be translated into a number of ways: 'I do not read' or 'what am I to read/recite?' or 'I will not read/recite'. Gabriel pressed him "until all the strength went out of me; thereupon he released me and said: 'Read!'" This was repeated three times and upon the third, Gabriel released him and said, "Read in the name of the Sustainer who created humankind from a clot! Read! And your Sustainer is the most Beautiful."&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Esack|first=Farid|title=The Qur'an: A User's Guide|year=2005|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford England|isbn=978-1851683543}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–41}} After this Muhammad continued to have revelations sporadically over a period of twenty-three years, until shortly before his death in 11/632.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Muslims believe that Gabriel brought the word of God to Muhammad verbatim, without any alteration or change. The Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text and that he had no authority to change it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|15|s=r|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. There is nothing in the Quran that suggests that Muhammad saw God during his revelations.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 540–543"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=540–543|chapter=Revelation}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Muhammad, the revelations were real and he believed the context was objective, but he was only able to describe the experience through metaphorical terms.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 540–543"/&gt;

When asked about the experience of revelation, Muhammad reported:

:''"Sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell. This form of inspiration is the hardest of them all and then it passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."''&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

At times, it was also reported that the experience was painful for Muhammad. For example, he had been heard saying, "Never once did I receive a revelation without thinking that my soul had been torn away from me."&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

After Muhammad would receive revelations, he would later recite it to his companions, who also memorized it or wrote it down. Before the Quran was commonly available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching it to others. The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practiced among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in Arabic. This fact, taken in the context of 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al Faruqi|first=Lois Ibsen|title=The Cantillation of the Qur'an|journal=Asian Music|year=1987|volume=19|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.2307/833761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslim people questioned the nature and modes of Muhammad's revelations. The [[Meccan]]s interpreted the Quranic revelations based on their understanding of 'inspiration'. For them, poetry was closely connected to inspiration from a higher spiritual source. For this reason when Muhammad began preaching and reciting the Quran, the Meccans accused him of being a poet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|5|s=r|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a "poet possessed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|36|s=r|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=540–543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that the Quran was revealed in disjointed verses and chapters, a point came when it needed to be gathered into a coherent whole text. There are disagreements among both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars as to when the Quran was first compiled. A hadith in [[Sahih Bukhari]] states that the caliph Abu Bakr commanded [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] to compile  the [[Mus'haf|written Quran]], relying upon both textual fragments and the memories of those who had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'ān|publisher=Cambridge|editor=Jane Dammen MacAuliffe|page=145-155|last1=Leemhuis|first1=Fred|year=2006|isbn=9780521539340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/93/53|publisher=Sunnah.com|access-date=14 October 2018|title=Sahih Bukhari, Book of Judgements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Shia Muslims believe that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] was the first to compile the Quran into one written text, a task completed shortly after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia |editor=Cenap Çakmak|page=11116-1120|year=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610692175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad===
The society during the time of [[Muhammad]] was predominantly oral and for this reason he would recite the Quranic verses to his Companions for them to memorize. Therefore, it is unknown whether the Quran was ever written and collected during the time of Muhammad. While writing was not a common skill during Muhammad's time, Mecca, being a commercial center, had a number of people who could write. Some scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} believe that up to 48 scribes including [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] and [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]] recorded verses of the Quran. This provides an explanation as to how the Quran existed in written form during the life of Muhammad, even if it was not compiled into one text.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|83}}

[[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] scholars generally believe that the Quran was written down in its entirety at the time of Muhammad's death.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Muhammad's cousin [[Ibn Abbas]] describes the way in which the final version of the Quran was fixed: "the prophet recited the book before Gabriel every year in the month of Ramadan, and in the month in which he died he recited it before him twice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rippin|first=Andrew|title=The Blackwell Companion to the Qur'an|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-8820-3|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the term "reciting the Quran twice" means compiling all the Quranic revelations into a complete and final version. It is understood{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} that toward the end of Muhammad's life a special act of revelation occurred in which a final and complete version of the Quran was created. The term 'recite', which is used here, is referring to the custom where a Quranic scholar recites the entire Quran from beginning to end a number of times before a senior scholar. According to this tradition the act of recital is being performed by Muhammad, with angel Gabriel playing the role of superior authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rippin|first=Andrew|title=The Blackwell Companion to the Qur'an|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-8820-3|pages=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the hadith Muhammad supposedly said, "I leave among you two things of high estimation: the Book of God and my Family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibn al-Hajjaj|first=Muslim|title=Sahih Muslim, Book 31, #5920|url=http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/031-smt.php#031.5920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that this provides evidence that the Quran had been collected and written during this time because it is not correct to call something ''al-kitab'' (book) when it is merely in the [people's] memories. The word ''al-kitab'' signifies a single and united entity and does not apply to a text which is scattered and not collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument some Shia and Sunni scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} bring up is the importance that Muhammad attached to the Quran. They{{who|date=February 2018}} believe that since Muhammad put so much importance to the Quran he had to have ordered the writing of it during his lifetime. For example, Zayd ibn Thabit reported, "We used to record the Quran from parchments in the presence of the Messenger of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors{{who|date=February 2018}} believe that, as long as Muhammad was alive, there was always the expectation of further revelation as well as occasional abrogations. Any formal collection of the material already revealed could not properly be considered a complete text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modarressi|first=Hossein|title=Early Debates on the Integrity of the Qur'an: A Brief Survey|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1993|volume=77|page=8|doi=10.2307/1595789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ali ibn Abu Talib===
{{Ali}}
Shia scholars are unanimous{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} that [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]] possessed a personal transcript of the Quran, which he collected six months after Muhammad's death, and that this was the first compilation of the Quran. The unique aspect about this version is that it was collected in the order it was sent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=30–31|chapter=Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mainstream Shi'ism hold is the only difference between the Quran we have today and Ali's.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}

A few Shia scholars argue that Ali presented his Quran to the community, but they refused to acknowledge his copy. One report states, "he had brought the complete Book [of God], comprising the interpretation and the revelation, the precise and ambiguous verses, the abrogating and the abrogated verses; nothing was missing from it, [not even] a letter ''alif'', nor ''lam''. But they did not accept it from him"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that Ali's version of the Quran contained verses that are not seen in the Uthmanic codex we have today. They believe changes in the order of verses and suras did take place and that there were variant readings, ''tabdil'', exchange of words such as ''umma'' to ''imma'', rearrangement of words and deletion of words pertaining to the right of Ali being the first caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=30–31|chapter=Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary Shia scholar [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]] provides a counter argument to this belief. He states that even if Ali's Quran incorporated additions that are not part of the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abu Bakr===
According to Sunni scholars, during the life of Muhammad parts of the Quran, though written, were scattered among his [[Sahaba|companions]], much of it as private possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAsSiddeeq/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAs-siddeeq#page/n505/mode/2up|title=The Biography of Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of Scribes was 43 companions. And there were many people who though were not scribes also were complete memorizers. After Muhammad's death, [[Abu Bakr]] initially exercised a policy of ''laissez faire'' as well. This policy was reversed after the [[Battle of Yamama]] in 633.&lt;ref name="sunnah.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/93/53|title=Hadith - Book of Judgments (Ahkaam) - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=Sunnah.com|date=2012-04-26|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Usmani1&gt;{{cite book|last=Usmani|first=Mohammad Taqi|editor=Abdur Rehman, Rafiq|translator=Siddiqui, Mohammed Swaleh|title=An approach to the Quranic sciences|publisher=Darul Ish'at|year=2000|location=Birmingham|pages=191–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, 700 [[Hafiz (Quran)|Muslims who had memorized the Quran]] were killed. The death of Salim, however, was most significant, as he was one of the very few who had been entrusted by [[Muhammad]] to teach the Quran. Consequently, upon [[Umar]]'s insistence, Abu Bakr ordered the collection of the hitherto scattered pieces of the Quran into one copy.&lt;ref name="sunnah.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=collection&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasan|first=Sayyid Siddiq|author2=Nadwi, Abul Hasan Ali|translator=Kidwai, A.R.|title=The collection of the Qur'an|publisher=Qur'anic Arabic Foundation|year=2000|location=Karachi|pages=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zayd ibn Thabit]], Muhammad's primary scribe, was assigned the duty of gathering all of the Quranic text. He gives an insight into what happened during the meeting between Abu Bakr, Umar, and himself:

:''" Abu Bakr sent for me at a time when the Yamama battles had witnessed the martyrdom of numerous Companions. I found 'Umar bin al-Khattab with him. Abu Bakr began,''' '''Umar has just come to me and said, 'In the Yamama battles death has dealt most severely with the qurra',[Reciters of the Quran] and I fear it will deal with them with equal severity in other theatres of war. As a result much of the Quran will be gone. " 'I am therefore of the opinion that you should command the Quran be collected.'" Abu Bakr continued, "I said to 'Umar, 'How can we embark on what the Prophet never did?' 'Umar replied that it was a good deed regardless, and he did not cease replying to my scruples until Allah reconciled me to the undertaking, and I became of the same mind as him. Zaid, you are young and intelligent, you used to record the revelations for Muhammad, and we know nothing to your discredit. So pursue the Quran and collect it together." By Allah, had they asked me to move a mountain it could not have been weightier than what they requested of me now". (Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Jam'i al-Qur'an, hadith no. 4986; see also Ibn Abu Dawud, al-Masahif, pp. 6-9)

His reaction to the task and its difficulties are further explained:

:''"...By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Quran... So I started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men.{{sup|[Bukhari {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|6|60|201}}]}}

Al-Zarakhsi comments,&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"/&gt;

:What Zaid means in fact is that he sought out verses from scattered sources, to collate them against the recollections of the ''huffaz''. In this way everyone participated in the collection process. No one possessing any portion of it was left out, and so no one had reason for expressing concern about the verses collected, nor could anyone complain that the text had been gathered from only a select few.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"/&gt;

Zayd also said:
:''"So I started looking for the Holy quran and collected it from (what was written on) palm-leaf stalks, thin white stones, and also from men who knew it by heart, until I found the last verse of Surat at-Tauba (repentance) with Abi Khuzaima al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 478).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//archive.org/stream/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAsSiddeeq/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAs-siddeeq#page/n507/mode/2up|title=The Biography of Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] draws special attention to Zayd's statement, "I found two verses of Sura al-Bara'a with Abu Khuzaima al-Ansari," as demonstrating that Zayd's own writings and memorisation were not deemed sufficient. Everything required verification.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', p.83. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hajar further comments:
:Abu Bakr had not authorised him to record except what was already available [on parchment]. That is why Zaid refrained from including the final ayah of Sura Bara'a until he came upon it in written form, even though he and his fellow Companions could recall it perfectly well from memory.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"/&gt;

The task required Zayd ibn Thabit to collect written copies of the Quran, with each verse having been validated with the oral testimony of at least two companions. The Quran was collected under the auspices of committee of four senior ranking Companions headed by Zayd ibn Thabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/26|title=Hadith - Book of Virtues of the Qur'an - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=Sunnah.com|date=2012-04-26|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compilation was kept by the Caliph Abu Bakr, after his death by his successor, Caliph [[Umar]], who on his deathbed gave them to [[Hafsa bint Umar]], his daughter and one of Muhammad's widows.&lt;ref name="Usmani1"/&gt;

It should be noted that Sunnis dismiss the Shia version of the Quranic compilation as nothing more than Twelver Shia fabrications. They point to the fact that Zaydi Shias who form the oldest living Shia sect believe in the above events described in Sahih Bukhari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQICAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Religion+and+Mysticism+in+Early+Islam:+Theology+and+Sufism+in+Yemen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ypk8VYWjBsXXPcmDgdAJ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sunna&amp;f=false|title=Religion and Mysticism in Early Islam: Theology and Sufism in Yemen|author=Muhammad Ali Aziz|publisher=Google Books|date=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uthman ibn Affan and the canonization===
{{Uthman}}
The Quranic canon is the form of the Quran as recited and written in which it is religiously binding for the Muslim community. This canonical corpus is closed and fixed in the sense that nothing in the Quran can be changed or modified. The process of canonization ended under the third caliph, [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (r. 23/644–35/655), which was about twenty years after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136–139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=136–139|chapter=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Uthman's caliphate, there was a perceived need for clarification of Quran reading. The Caliphate had grown considerably, expanding into Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Iran, bringing into Islam's fold many new converts from various cultures with varying degrees of isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Conquest of Iraq, Southwestern Persia, and Egypt|year=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-88706-876-6|pages=2–6|others=Gautier H. A. Juynboll (trans.)|editor1=Ihsan Abbas|editor2=C. E. Bosworth|editor3=Jacob Lassner|editor4=Franz Rosenthal|editor5=Ehsan Yar-Shater}}&lt;/ref&gt; These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman felt it was important to standardize the written text of the Quran into one specific Arabic dialect. Another reason for compiling the Quran was that many Muslims who had memorised the Quran in its entirety (''[[Hafiz (Quran)|huffaz]]'') were dying, especially in battle.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

According to the dominant version narrated by [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], the reason for the final collection of the Quran was a dispute between Muslim forces from Iraq and Syria over the correct way of reciting it during communal prayers while on an expedition to Armenia and Azerbaijan.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

It is believed that the general [[Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman]] reported this problem to the caliph and asked him to establish a unified text. According to the history of [[al-Tabari]], during the expedition there were 10,000 Kufan warriors, 6,000 in Azerbaijan and 4,000 at Rayy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Crisis of the Early Caliphate|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7914-0154-5|page=8|others=Stephen Humphreys (trans.)|editor1=Ihsan Abbas |editor2=C. E. Bosworth|editor3=Franz Rosenthal|editor4=Ehsan Yar-Sharter}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of soldiers disagreeing about the correct way of reciting the Quran may have caused Hudhayfah to promote a unified text. An example of the confusion at this time is seen during a campaign in Tabaristan, where one of the soldiers asked, Hudhayfah "How did the Messenger of God pray?" Hudhayfah told him the soldier prayed before fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Crisis of the Early Caliphate|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7914-0154-5|page=42|others=R. Humphreys (trans.)|editor1=Ihsan Abbas |editor2=C. E. Bosworth |editor3=Franz Rosenthal|editor4=Ehsan Yar-Sharter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed upon Hudhayfah's request Uthman obtained the sheets of the Quran from Ḥafṣa and appointed a commission consisting of Zayd and three prominent Meccans, and instructed them to copy the sheets into several volumes based on the dialect of Quraysh, the main tribe of Mecca.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

Uthman's reaction in 653 is recorded in the following:
:''"So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Quran so that we may compile the Quranic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you." Hafsa sent it to Uthman. Uthman then ordered [[Zaid bin Thabit]], Abdullah bin Az Zubair, [[Sa'id ibn al-'As|Said bin Al-As]] and Abdur Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Quran was revealed in their tongue." They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Zayd bin Thabit added, "A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Quran and I used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. [That verse was]: 'Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.'"{{Quran-usc|33|23}}{{sup|[Bukhari {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|6|61|510}}]}}''

When the task was finished Uthman kept one copy in Medina and sent others to Kufa, Baṣra, Damascus, and, according to some accounts, Mecca, and ordered that all other variant copies of the Quran to be destroyed. This was done everywhere except in Kufa, where some scholars argue that, Ibn Masʿūd and his followers refused.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"&gt;{{cite journal|title=al-Kur'an|journal=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|year=2012|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-kuran-COM_0543|editors=Bearman, Bianquis, Bosworth, van Donzel, Heinrichs|publisher=Brill Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important that the compilation of the Quran during the time of Caliph Abu Bakr which was inherited by Caliph Umar's daughter Hafsa (and a wife of Muhammad) was not destroyed but was passed back to her. This would imply that the first compilation, during the time of Abu Bakr, was not at variation with the Uthmanic compilation.

It is generally accepted that the Uthmanic text comprises all 114 suras in the order known today.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136–139"/&gt;

According to Ayatollah Khu'i there is no doubt that Uthman collected the Quran during his time, but not in the sense that he collected the verses and suras in one volume, but in the sense that he united the Muslims on the reading of one authoritative recension. He also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the most contested issues and an area where many non-Muslim and Muslim scholars often clash.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136–139"/&gt;

==Origin according to academic historians==
The origin of the Quran has been a subject of sustained academic research.&lt;ref name=OB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Andrew Rippin|title=Qur'an|encyclopedia=Oxford Bibliographies|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0066.xml|subscription=yes|quote= How the Qurʾan came into being and why it looks the way it does has proven to be a continual focus of attention for scholarship. Most accounts accept the basic framework of the Muslim memory, with the role of Muhammad as the recipient of revelation and the role subsequent caliphs in bringing the text together clearly separated. Some scholarship has wanted to challenge the originality and source of the text itself, tracing it to other religious communities (especially Christian: Lüling 2003; Luxenberg 2007). Others have tried to refine the Muslim accounts of revelation and collection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars accept the basic outlines of the traditional account, which separates Muhammad's role as the recipient of revelation from the role played by the early caliphs in compiling the text.&lt;ref name=OB/&gt; There have also been a number of proposals for refinement of the traditional view and even its fundamental reevaluation.&lt;ref name=OB/&gt; [[Fred Donner]] summarized the state of the field as of 2008 in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Donner|title=The Qur'an in Recent Scholarship|volume=The Quran in its historical context|editor=Gabriel Said Reynolds|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Qur'anic studies, as a field of academic research, appears today to be in a state of disarray. Those of us who study Islam's origins have to admit collectively that we simply do not know some very basic things about the Qur'an – things so basic that the knowledge of them is usually taken for granted by scholars dealing with other texts. They include such questions as: How did the Qur'an originate? Where did it come from, and when did it first appear? How was it first written? In what kind of language was – is – it written? What form did it first take? Who constituted its first audience? How was it transmitted from one generation to another, especially in its early years? When, how, and by whom was it codified? Those familiar with the Qur'an and the scholarship on it will know that to ask even one of these questions immediately plunges us into realms of grave uncertainty and has the potential to spark intense debate. To put it another way, on these basic issues there is little consensus even among the well-trained scholars who work on them.}}

Some scholars, such as [[John Wansbrough]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], and [[Patricia Crone]], have been unwilling to attribute the entire Quran to Muhammad (or Uthman), arguing that there "is no hard evidence for the existence of the Quran in any form before the last decade of the 7th century...[and that]...the tradition which places this rather opaque revelation in its historical context is not attested before the middle of the eighth." "There is no proof that the text of the Quran was collected under Uthman, since the earliest surviving copies of the complete Quran are centuries later than Uthman. (The oldest existing copy of the full text is from the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World'', Crone, Patricia &amp; Cook, Michael, p. 3 Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;) They contend that Islam was formed gradually over a number of centuries after the Muslim conquests, as the Islamic conquerors elaborated their beliefs in response to Jewish and Christian challenges.&lt;ref&gt;P. Crone and M. Cook, ''Hagarism: The Making Of The Islamic World'', 1977, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that such scholars have been proven wrong by subsequent scientific evidence, including carbon dating of early manuscripts of the Quran. "The opening chapters of Fred Donner's ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' claims to refute the theoretical and methodological flaws of the skeptical school and instead dates the composition of the Quran, as a closed canon, to an Arabian context of early believers preceding ... the first civil war in 656."&lt;ref&gt;Emran El- Badawi "Sectarian Scripture: The Quran's Dogmatic Re-articulation of the Aramaic Gospel Tradition in the Late Antique Near East"  Research Dissertation University of Chicago., p 16&lt;/ref&gt; Donner's perspective now represents mainstream scholarly opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Emran El- Badawi "Sectarian Scripture: The Quran's Dogmatic Re-articulation of the Aramaic Gospel Tradition in the Late Antique Near East"  Research Dissertation University of Chicago., p 17&lt;/ref&gt; The findings in 2015 of the Birmingham Manuscripts lead Joseph E.

[[File:Temple Mount.JPG|thumb|Dome of the Rock. The structure, the oldest extant example of early Islamic architecture, was completed in 691 AD]]
The [[Dome of the Rock]] with its inscriptions are interesting in the dating of the text.&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"&gt;Estelle Whelan, ''Forgotten Witness: Evidence For The Early Codification Of The Qur'an'', 1988, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 1998, Volume 118, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions have been known to scholars for more than a century and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, yet little attention has been paid to the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"/&gt;

Wansbrough wrote in a dense, complex, almost hermetic style,&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"/&gt; and has had much more influence on Islamic studies through his students than he has through his own writings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} His students Crone and Cook co-authored a book called ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'' (1977), which was extremely controversial at the time as it challenged not only Muslim orthodoxy, but the prevailing attitudes among secular Islamic scholars.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Crone, Wansbrough, and Nevo argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150&amp;ndash;300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda D. Nevo]] "Towards a Prehistory of Islam," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, vol.17, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1994 p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wansbrough]] The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition of Islamic Salvation History, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1978 p,119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia Crone]], ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam,'' Princeton University Press, 1987 p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of contemporaneous corroborating material from the very first century of Islam has raised numerous questions as to the authenticity of the account provided by later traditionalist sources. All that is preserved from this time period are a few commemorative building inscriptions and assorted coins.&lt;ref name="gazellebookservices.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/ISBN/1591026342.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905011505/http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/ISBN/1591026342.htm |archivedate=September 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars deny such a belittlement of key sources from the era. Besides the Dome of the Rock inscriptions mentioned above, there are also brief Quranic passages on coins issued from the time of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] from the period 697-750. These passages include, in addition to the shahadah, verses 112:1-3 (or 4) complete (except for the initial ''basmallah'' and the introductory word "say"), and part of 9:33, but with some variations: "He sent him with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion". In parallel to the contemporary inscriptions at the Dome of the Rock these extracts are clearly intended to declare the primacy of the new religion of Islam over Christianity, in particular.&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"/&gt;

Skeptical scholars, nonetheless, point out that the earliest account of Muhammad's life by [[Ibn Ishaq]] was written about a century after Muhammad died and all later narratives by Islamic biographers contain far more details and embellishments about events which are entirely lacking in Ibn Ishaq's text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone, [[Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam]], pp. 203-30, where she argues that much of the classical Muslim understanding of the Koran rests on the work of storytellers and that this work is of very dubious historical value. These storytellers contributed to the tradition on the rise of Islam, and this is evident in the steady growth of information: "If one storyteller should happen to mention a raid, the next storyteller would know the date of this raid, while the third would know everything that an audience might wish to hear about it." 53 Then, comparing the accounts of the raid of Kharrar by Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi, Crone shows that al-Waqidi, influenced by and in the manner of the storytellers, "will always give precise dates, locations, names, where Ibn Ishaq has none, accounts of what triggered the expedition, miscellaneous information to lend color to the event, as well as reasons why, as was usually the case, no fighting took place."&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia Crone, studying the origins of the Quran, has focused on the examination of the vast body of the [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] accounts of non-Muslim neighbors of the 7th and 8th centuries which in many cases contradict the traditional Islamic narratives. She argues that the consistency of the non-Muslim sources spread over a large geographic area would tend to rule out a non-Muslim anti-Islamic motive to these sources.&lt;ref name=Crone15&gt;[[Patricia Crone]], ''Slaves on Horses'', pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The skeptic approach has been further expanded by [[Christoph Luxenberg]], who supports claims for a late composition of the Quran, and traces much of it to [[The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran|sources other than Muhammad]]. Luxenberg is known for his thesis that the Quran is merely a re-working of an earlier Christian text, a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[lectionary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Syro-Aramaic Reading Of The Qur'an'', 2007 English edition&lt;/ref&gt; (See also the articles [[Gerd R. Puin]], and [[Alexander the Great in the Quran]].)

[[Fred Donner]] has argued for an early date for the collection of the Quran, based on his reading of the text itself. He points out that if the Quran had been collected over the tumultuous early centuries of Islam, with their vast conquests and expansion and bloody incidents between rivals for the caliphate, there would have been some evidence of this history in the text. However, there is nothing in the Quran that does not reflect what is known of the earliest Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'', Donner, Darwin Press, 1998, p. 60, {{ISBN|0-87850-127-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, during the restoration of the Great Mosque of [[San'a]] in [[Yemen]], laborers stumbled upon a "paper grave" containing tens of thousands of fragments of parchment on which verses of the Quran were written. Some of these fragments were believed to be the oldest Quranic texts yet found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What Is the Quran?|first=Toby|last=Lester|journal=The Atlantic|date=January 1999|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest in origin of the Quran is the discovery of parchments of the Quranic text discovered by University of Birmingham, the parchment (the material) has been radiocarbon dated to the period between AD 568 and 645 with 95.4% accuracy. The test was carried out in a laboratory at the University of Oxford. The result places the parchment close to the time of Muhammad, who is generally thought to have lived between AD 570 and 632. Researchers conclude that the parchment is among the earliest written textual evidence of the Quran in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Press Office|first=University of Birmingham|date=22 July 2015|title=Birmingham Qur'an manuscript dated among the oldest in the world|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2015/07/quran-manuscript-22-07-15.aspx|work=University of Birmingham Press Office|location=Birmingham, England|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities to the Bible===
{{Main|Biblical narratives and the Quran}}
Skeptical scholars account for the many similarities between the Quran and the Jewish and Hebrew Scriptures by saying that Muhammad was teaching what he believed to be a universal history, as he had heard it from the Jews and Christians he had encountered in Arabia and on his travels - as well as his exposure to the [[Hanif]] tradition by way of his paternal-grandfather, [[Abdul Muttalib]]. These scholars also disagree with the Islamic belief that the whole of the Quran is addressed by God to humankind. They note that there are numerous passages where God is directly addressed, or mentioned in the third person, or where the narrator swears by various entities, including God.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the Qur'an'' 2nd Edition, Richard Bell, W. Montgomery Watt, Edinburgh University Press, 1970, {{ISBN|0-7486-0597-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0597-2}} p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varying codices and the start of the canonization==
Before Uthman established the canon of the Quran, there may have been different versions or codices in complete state, though none has yet been discovered. Such codices as may exist never gained general approval and were viewed by Muslims as individuals' personal copies.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|93}} With respect to partial codices, there is opinion that "the search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman's alleged recension in the 640s has not yielded any differences of great significance".&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, The Quest of the Historical Muhammad, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 23, No. 3 (Aug.,1991), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The two most influential codices at this time are ʿ[[Abdullah ibn Mas'ud|Abdullah ibn Masʿud]]s and [[Ubayy ibn Kab|Ubayy ibn Kaʿb]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Al-Qurazi recounted seeing the ''mushafs'' used by Ibn Mas'ud, Ubayy, and Zaid b. Thabit and finding no differences between them.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami5"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', p.197. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ʿAbdullah ibn Masʿud's codex===
The most influential of the allegedly varying codices was that of ʿ[[Abdullah ibn Masud|Abdullah ibn Masʿud]], an early convert who became a personal servant to [[Muhammad]]. It is reported that he learned around seventy suras directly from Muhammad, who appointed him as one of the first teachers of Quranic recitation. Later he was appointed to an administrative post in Kufa by the caliph ʿUmar, where he became a leading authority on the Quran and hadith. Some sources suggest that Ibn Masʿud refused to destroy his copy of the Quran or to stop teaching it when the ʿUthmanic codex was made official.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

There are two points on which Ibn Masʿud's version is alleged to differ from the ʿUthmanic text: the order of the suras and some variants in the readings. [[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] lists three reports concerning the omission of three suras, ([[Al-Fatiha]] and [[Al-Mu'awwidhatayn]], the two short suras with which the Quran ends (Suras 113 and 114)), he then states that "early scholars such as [[al-Nawawi]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] denounced these reports as lies fathered upon Ibn Mas'ud."&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami6"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', pp.199-201. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other differences involve only altered vowels with the same consonantal text, which caused variations in recitation.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

===Ubay ibn Ka'b's codex===
The second most influential codex was that of [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]], a Medinan Muslim who served as a secretary for Muhammad. It is believed that he may have been more prominent as a Quranic specialist than Ibn Masʿud during Muḥammad's lifetime. There are reports that he was responsible for memorizing certain important revelations on legal matters, which from time to time Muhammad asked him to recite. In a few ''hadiths'', Ubay is seen in a variety of roles. For instance, the "sheets" of Ubay are sometimes mentioned in some instances instead of those of Ḥafsa, and sometimes he is also mentioned in some ''hadiths'' instead of Zayd, dictating the Quran to scribes.

His version of the Quran is said to have included two short suras not in the Uthmanic or Ibn Masʿud texts: ''Sūrat al-Khal'', with three verses, and ''Sūrat al-Ḥafd'', with six. The order of suras in Ubayy's codex is said to have differed from that of Uthman's and Ibn Masʿud's as well,&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt; although these are structural differences rather than textual variations.

The first sura, entitled ''al-Khal'' ("separation"), is translated as: "O Allah, we seek your help and ask your forgiveness, and we praise you and we do not disbelieve in you. We separate from and leave him who sins against you."

The second sura, entitled ''al-Hafd'' ("haste"), is translated as: "O Allah, we worship You and to You we pray and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers." These two pieces are said to constitute ''qunut'' (that is, supplications which Muhammad sometimes made in morning prayer or in ''witr'' prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran). They are in fact identical to some parts of ''qunut'' reported in the collections of ''hadiths''. (See Nawawi, ''al-adhkar'', Cairo, 1955, pp. 57–58.)

The single additional so-called ''aya'' is translated: "If the son of Adam were given a valley full of riches, he would wish a second one; and if he were given two valleys full of riches, he would surely ask for a third. Nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and Allah is forgiving to him who is repentant." This text is known to be a ''[[hadith]]'' from Muhammad. (Bukhari, VIII, No. 444-47.) According to Ibn 'Abbas (No. 445) and 'Ubay (No. 446) this text was at times thought to be part of the Quran. However, Ubay himself clarifies that after sura 102: "I had been revealed, [the sahaba] did not consider the above to be part of the Quran." (Bukhari, VIII, No. 446.)

This explanation of Ubay also makes it very clear that the companions of Mohammad did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what was not part of the Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the ''hadith'' appeared in the ''mushaf'' of Ubay because it was for his own personal use; that is, in his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and ''hadith'', since the notebook was not meant for public use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. All companions of Mohammad are said to have had their own copies of the Quran, with notes, for personal use.

The Islamic reports of these copies of the Quran of the companions of Mohammad only tell of various differences according to reports that reached them (''e.g.'', the ''hadith'' in Bukhari, VIII, No. 446, that Ubay at some early stage held this sentence to be part of the Quran). However, the tangible manuscripts of these copies of the Quran have not survived but were destroyed, having been considered obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicbulletin.org/free_downloads/quran/ul_umal_quran.pdf|format=PDF|title=An Introduction to the Sciences of the Qur'an |author=Ahmad von Denffer |publisher=Islamicbulletin.org|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early manuscripts to the final canonical text==
{{Further|Early Quranic manuscripts}}
After Uthman had the other codices destroyed there were still variations in the reading and the text of this Quran. However, scholars deny the possibility of great changes of the text arguing that addition, suppression or alteration would have led to controversy 'of which there is little trace'. They further state that even though Uthman became unpopular among Muslims, he was not charged with alteration or mutilation of the Quran in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the Qur'an'', Richard Bell, W. Montgomery Watt, Edinburgh University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0748605972}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the manuscript age, the Quran was the most copied Arabic text. It was believed that copying the Quran would bring blessings on the scribe and the owner.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=384–389|chapter=Manuscript and the Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic script as we know it today was unknown in Muhammad's time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was preserved through memorization and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible due to the absence of diacritical marks (''a'jam''). Vowelling marks (''tashkil'') to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script as we know it today, the ''scripta plena'', which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|92}}

===Umayyad Period (44/661–132/750) – Hijazi script===
The earliest known manuscripts of the Quran are collectively called the Hijazi script, and are mostly associated with the Umayyad period.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt;

Most of the fundamental reform to the manuscripts of the Quran took place under [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], the fifth Umayyad caliph (65/685–86/705).&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt; Under Abd al-Malik's reign, Abu'l Aswad al-Du'ali (died 688) founded the Arabic grammar and invented the system of placing large colored dots to indicate the tashkil. The Umayyad governor [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf Al-Thaqafi|al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi]] later enforced this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|page=131|chapter=Calligraphy and the Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem in 72/691–92 was done, which was complete with Quranic inscriptions. The inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock in fact represent the earliest known dated passages from the Quran. In these inscriptions, many letters are already provided with diacritical points.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt;

The earliest codices of the Quran found in the Umayyad period were most likely made in single volumes, which can be determined from the large fragments that have survived. Also during this time, the format of the codex went from being vertical to horizontal in the 8th century. It is believed this change to horizontal formats and thick/heavy-looking scripts may have been done to show the superiority of the Quran and to distinguish the Islamic tradition from the Jewish and Christian ones, who used vertical formats for their scriptures.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt;

During this time, there was a diversity of styles in which the Quran was written. One characteristic seen in most of these manuscripts is the elongated shafts of the free-standing alif and the right-sided tail (foot) of the isolated alif. Also, these manuscripts do not have headings of chapters (suras). Instead, a blank space is left at the end of one sura and at the beginning of another.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt;

===Abbasid Period (132/750–640/1258)===

====Early Abbasid Style====
Unlike the manuscripts from the Umayyad Dynasty, many of the early Abbasid manuscripts were copied in a number of volumes. This is evident from the large scripts used and the smaller number of lines per page.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Early Quranic manuscripts provide evidence for the history of the Quranic text and their formal features tell us something about the way art and its deeper meaning were perceived in the classical age of Islam. Both its script and layout turned out to be constructed according to elaborate geometrical and proportional rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Geometry of early Qur'anic Manuscripts|author=Alan George|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|volume=9|issue=1|year=2007|pages=78–110|jstor=25728237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characteristic of these scripts was their writing style. The letters in most of these manuscripts are heavy-looking, relatively short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a straight shaft with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened to the rest of the structure with leather thongs.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt;

====New Abbasid Style====
The New Abbasid Style (NS) began at the end of the 9th century C.E. and was used for copying the Quran until the 12th centuries, and maybe even as late as the 13th century. Unlike manuscripts copied in Early Abbasid scripts, NS manuscripts had vertical formats.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384–389"/&gt;

During this time, [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] (died 786) devised a tashkil system to replace that of Abu al-Aswad. His system has been universally used since the early 11th century, and includes six diacritical marks: fatha (a), damma (u), kasra (i), sukun (vowel-less), shadda (double consonant), madda (vowel prolongation; applied to the alif).&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 130–131"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=130–131|chapter=Calligraphy and the Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another central figure during this time was [[Ibn Mujāhid|Abu Bakr b. Mujāhid]] (died 324/936). His goal was to restrict the number of reliable readings and accept only those based on a fairly uniform consonantal text. He chose seven well-known Quran teachers of the 2nd/8th century and declared that their readings all had divine authority, which the others lacked. He based this on the popular ḥadith in which Muhammad says the Quran was revealed to him in "[[Qira'at|seven aḥruf]]". During this time there was strong Quranic traditions in Kufa, Baṣra, Medina, Damascus, and Mecca. Due to this, Ibn Mujāhid selected one reading each for Medina, Mecca, Baṣra, and Damascus—those of Nafiʿ (died 169/785), Ibn Kathir (died 120/737), Abu ʿAmr (died 154/770), and IbnʿAmir (died 118/736), respectively—and three for Kūfa, those of ʿAsim (died 127/744), Ḥamza (died 156/772), and al-Kisaʾi (died 189/804). His attempt to limit the number of canonical readings to seven was not acceptable to all, and there was strong support for alternative readings in most of the five cities. In the present day the most common reading that is in general use is that of 'Aasim al-Kufi through Hafs.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

The 11th-century eastern Quranic manuscript contains the 20th juz' (section) of a Quran that originally consisted of 30 parts. The arrangement into 30 parts corresponds to the number of days in the month of Ramadan, during which the Muslim is obliged to fast and to read through the whole of the Quran. Other sections or fragments of this magnificent manuscript lie scattered in various collections all over the world. A Turkish note ascribes the Quran to the hand of the Caliph Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, and thus demonstrates the high significance of this manuscript. The text is written in Eastern Kufic, a monumental script that was developed in Iran in the late 10th century. The writing and the illumination of the manuscript bear witness to the great artistic skills of the calligrapher and the illustrator. The manuscript is at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8937/|title=11th Century Qur'an in Eastern Kufic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of seven complete or nearly complete semi-Kufic Qurans from before the end of the eleventh century, four contain a verse count. Although admittedly a small sample, it does suggest that the use of a verse count was a prevalent and quite deeply rooted practice in semi-Kufic Qurans between ca. 950 and ca. 1100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yasser Tabbaa|title=The transformation of Arabic writing|journal=Ars Orientalis|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|volume=21|year=1991|pages=119–148|jstor=4629416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla]] (died 940), an accomplished calligrapher from Baghdad, was also a prominent figure at this time. He became vizir to three Abbasid caliphs and is credited with developing the first script to obey strict proportional rules. Ibn Muqla's system was used in the development and standardization of the Quranic script, and his [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] work became the standard way of writing the Quran.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 130–131"/&gt; However it was later perfected by Ibn al-Bawwab (d. 1022), the master calligrapher who continued Muqla's tradition. Muqla's system became one of the most popular styles for transcribing Arabic manuscripts in general, being favored for its legibility. The eleventh century Quran is one of the earliest dated manuscripts in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/iraqiquran.html|title=11th Century Qur'an|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "new style" is defined by breaks and angular forms and by extreme contrasts between the thick and thin strokes. The script was initially used in administrative and legal documents, but then it replaced earlier Quranic scripts. It is possible that it was easier to read than the early 'Abbasid scripts, which differ greatly from current writing. Economic factors may also have played a part because while the "new style" was being introduced, paper was also beginning to spread throughout the Muslim world, and the decrease in the price of books triggered by the introduction of this new material seems to have led to an increase in its demand. The "new style" was the last script to spread throughout the Muslim world before the introduction of printing. It remained in use until the 13th century, at which point it was restricted to titles only.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|177}}

==Completeness==

===Islamic sources===
Records from Islamic sources suggest that before Caliph Uthman's standardization, after which variants were allegedly burned, the Quran may have contained either 116 chapters (Ubayy Ibn Ka'ab's codex) or 111 chapters (Ibn Ma'sud's codex).&lt;ref&gt;As-Suyuti, "Al-Itqan", pp.&amp;nbsp;152-153; Arthur Jeffery, ''Materials for the History of the Text of the Qu'ran: The Old Codices''. Leiden: E.J.&amp;nbsp;Brill, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic View: Sunni and Shia===
Muslims believe that Quran, as it is presented today, is complete and untouched, supported by their faith in Quranic verses such as "We [i.e. Allah] have, without doubt, sent down the Reminder [i.e. the Quran]; and We will assuredly guard it [from corruption]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|15|9|t=p|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the varying accounts and hadiths on the collection and canonization of the Quran, some scholars debate whether the Uthmanic text contains the entire body of material that was revealed to Muhammad, or if there is material missing from the text. For example, some Sunni literature contains reports that suggest that some of the revelations had already been lost before the collection of the Quran initiated by Abu Bakr.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In one report, 'Umar was once looking for the text of a specific verse of the Quran on stoning as a punishment for adultery, which he remembered. Later, he discovered that the only person who had any record of that verse had been killed in the battle of Yamama and as a result the verse was lost. Some of the Companions recalled that same verse, one person being 'A'isha, Muhammad's youngest wife. She is believed to have said that a sheet on which two verses, including the one on stoning, were under her bedding and that after Muhammad died, a domestic animal got into the room and ate the sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modarressi|first=Hossein|title=Early Debates on the Integrity of the Qur'an: A Brief Survey|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1993|volume=77|publisher=Maisonneuve and Larose}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts on hadith literature have rejected this hadith, as all [[Matn|routes of transmission]] either contain narrators charged with dishonesty in disclosing sources or simply conflict with the majority version of the report, which all have authentic routes of transmission but omit the part about the piece of paper being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Shu'aib al-Arna`ut, ''Tahqiq Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal'', vol. 6, pg. 269, hadith #26,359. Beirut: Mu`assasah al-Risalah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani]], [[Takmilat Fath al-Mulhim]], vol. 1, pg. 69. [[Beirut]]: Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain Shia scholars state that Ali's predecessors willfully excluded all references to the right of Ali to be the next caliph after Muhammad died. Some Shias questioned the integrity of the Uthmanic codex, stating that two surahs, ''"al-Nurayn"'' (The Two Lights) and ''"al-Walayah"'' (the Guardianship), which dealt with the virtues of Muhammad's family, were removed.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|89–90}}

Al-Khoei addresses this issue and argues for the authenticity and completeness of the Quran on the basis that it was compiled during the lifetime of Muhammad. His argument is based on hadiths and on critically analyzing the situation during and after the life of Muhammad. He states that the collection of the Quran by Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman occurred significantly after the caliphate was decided, and so if Ali's rule had been mentioned, there would have been no need for the Muslims to gather to appoint someone.  The fact that none of the Companions mentioned this supposed alteration, either at the beginning of the caliphate or after Ali became caliph, is regarded as proof that this alteration did not occur.&lt;ref name="Al-Khu'i 1998 150"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=150-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khoei also argues that by the time 'Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread to such an extent that it was impossible for anyone to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered.&lt;ref name="Al-Khu'i 1998 150"/&gt; Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to convince all those who had memorized the Quran to go along with his alterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any such alteration also would have been mentioned by Uthman's political opponents and assassins, according to al-Khoei, yet none accused him of this. Finally, he argues that if Uthman had altered the Quran, Ali would have restored it to its original state upon the death of Uthman, especially if verses of his rule had been removed. Instead Ali is seen promoting the Quran during his reign, which is evidence that there was no alteration.&lt;ref name="Al-Khu'i 1998 150"/&gt;

===Manuscripts===
In the 20th century, the [[Sana'a manuscript]] was discovered. It has been [[radiocarbon]] dated to the range 578-669 CE with 95% confidence. The manuscript is a [[palimpsest]] with quranic verses in both upper and lower texts.  The upper text has exactly the same verses and the same order of suras and verses as the standard Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Behnam Sadeghi &amp; Mohsen Goudarzi, "Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran", ''Der Islam'', '''87''' (2012), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the suras in the lower text of the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Behnam Sadeghi &amp; Mohsen Goudarzi, "Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran", ''Der Islam'', '''87''' (2012), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the lower text exhibits extensive variations from the counterpart text in the standard Quran; such that the lower text represents the only surviving early quranic manuscript that does not conform to the 'Uthmanic tradition. The majority of these variations add words and phrases, so as to emphasize or clarify the standard quranic reading. Some scholars have proposed parallels for these variations in reports of variants in 'companion codices' that were kept by individual companions to the Prophet outside of the mainstream tradition of 'Uthman; but these correspondences are much the minority. [[François Déroche]] proposes, on palaeographic grounds, a date for the lower text in the second half of the first century AH (hence 672 - 722 CE) and summarises the character of the Sana'a Palimpsest, "The scriptio inferior of the Codex Ṣanʿāʾ I has been transcribed in a milieu which adhered to a text of the Qurʾan different from the ʿUthmanic tradition as well as from the Qurʾanic codices of Ibn Masʿūd and Ubayy".

'''''Hoodlum''''' is a 1997 American [[crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] that gives a fictionalized account of the gang war between the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian]]/[[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish mafia]] alliance and the Black gangsters of [[Harlem]] that took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The film concentrated on [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]), [[Dutch Schultz]] ([[Tim Roth]]), and [[Lucky Luciano]] ([[Andy García]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0119311|title=Hoodlum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=March 2015}}

After being paroled from [[Sing Sing]], Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) returns to [[Harlem]] to resume his old life. He is welcomed back by his cousin, Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride) as well as Stephanie "Madame Queen" St. Clair ([[Cicely Tyson]]), the monarch reigning over the [[Numbers game|numbers racket]] in Harlem. The psychopathic Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] associate who reports to mob boss Charles "Lucky" Luciano (Andy Garcia) runs the numbers rackets in downtown New York. His gang has been crowding into Harlem, terrorizing residents to only play the numbers with his operation.

While hanging on the stoop one afternoon with Illinois and his girlfriend Mary, Bumpy meets one of Mary's friends, Francine (Vanessa Williams). She and Illinois talk trash to each other, with her disapproving of the 'numbers' rackets Illinois is involved in and him defending it as the only way to make ends meet in the Depression. Bumpy introduces himself to her and is obviously interested. They meet again in a nightclub and dance together. Bumpy walks Francine home and they debate the effect of gambling in Harlem on its citizens. At her door, she says that he could do anything he wanted. He responds that he has written some poetry and then recites a poem to her, about her beautiful eyes.

Dutch Schultz asks to partner with the Queen, who declines the offer, as she disapproves of the violent tactics Schultz uses to terrorize her customers. Later a hit is ordered by Dutch on the Queen; however Whispers ([[Paul Benjamin]]) and Bumpy repel the attackers. Using his friendship with corrupt Captain Foley ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), of the New York City Police Department, Schultz arranges for the Queen to be arrested, and the Queen asks Johnson to take charge of the business during her incarceration. The Queen instructs Johnson to avoid bloodshed, but Schultz's men grow increasingly violent.

Bumpy and Dutch start a devastating war with each other. In one of Dutch's attempts on Bumpy's life, Dutch employs two big hit men. They break into Bumpy's home, killing two of his bodyguards and making their way up to the bedroom, where Bumpy and Francine are. They attack Bumpy and Francine in the bathroom. One of them is killed and the scene culminates in Francine having to shoot the other just as he is about to kill Bumpy. They hold each other on the floor of the bathroom, covered in blood. More and more people are killed, including the sixteen-year-old Tyrone, who begged Bumpy to let him become a numbers runner for him.

One afternoon, Bumpy and Francine are having a banana split in his favorite ice cream parlor. Bumpy notices in the nick of time that the split has almonds on it, which he never orders. Francine is already to dig in when Bumpy stops her. Suddenly, the tension mounts, Bumpy's men rush all the regular citizens out of the parlor and pull down the shades. After questioning the terrified owner, Bumpy finds out that it was the new boy, Jimmie, who made the split, which has been poisoned. Bumpy invites him over to the table where he asks him to eat the split. The kid makes all kinds of excuses and is also terrified. After more threatening, he confesses it was one of Bumpy's closest men, Vallie, who set Bumpy up. Bumpy sends Francine out of the parlor and forces the kid to eat the poisoned ice cream. Bumpy, Illinois, Whispers and two other of his men take Vallie to a private pool hall and question Vallie about the set-up. Vallie weeps, confessing it was all for the money and begs for his life. Bumpy notices a nice ring on Vallie's finger and asks him if he bought it with the money, which Vallie vehemently denies. Eventually, everyone walks out except Whispers, who cuts Vallie's throat with a straight razor.

Bumpy and his gang show up at the Cotton Club in downtown New York. This is in Dutch's territory and does not allow black people in except as entertainers. Dutch is holding court. The place goes silent as Bumpy tells Dutch that he knows all about his operation and if Dutch doesn't shut it down, Bumpy will do it for him. Dutch mentions Vallie and Bumpy replies that Vallie won't be able to comment anymore but left a souvenir for Dutch. He puts a handkerchief on the table that contains a bloody finger, with a fancy ring on it. It nearly comes to a shoot-out, with cooler heads holding Dutch. Bumpy and his gang leave. When Dutch continues terrorizing uptown Harlem, Bumpy engages an explosives expert to rig a bomb. He and Illinois manage to infiltrate one of Dutch's liquor warehouses as delivery boys and just manage to get away before the whole building explodes.

In the meantime, Dutch and his men have broken into Mary's house (Illinois' girlfriend). Dutch hits and threatens her, asking her where Illinois is. One of his right hand men, Bub (Clarence Williams III) says she doesn't know anything and he doesn't have to do this. Dutch tells him to toughen up. After blowing up the warehouse, Illinois makes his way back to Mary's to find her dead.

Bumpy arrives home where Francine tells him that she is leaving him. He is enraged and starts throwing the fancy dresses and jewels that he bought at her. She yells that she didn't want any of them and that she doesn't know him anymore, that he is no longer the good man with whom she had fallen in love.

Devastated by Mary's death, Illinois gets drunk and tells Bumpy that he's changed, that he is as bad as Dutch now. They have it out; Illinois says he's finished with Bumpy and staggers out. As he's walking down the street, Captain Foley and Bub Hewlett ([[Clarence Williams III]]) see him, kidnap him and chain him up in a machinery room. Foley beats him and wants to torture him for information. Hewlett says Illinois isn't going to talk and wants him let go. He leaves but Foley kills him using a corkscrew. Eager to end the war between each faction, Luciano decides to try and make the Schultz and Johnson come to an agreement, although neither wants to compromise.

Later that evening, word comes to the Johnson house that Illinois has been found murdered. Johnson and his gang go to the warehouse where Illinois was killed and find him hanging by a chain on the outside wall, one of the 'numbers' tickets in his mouth and a suitcase with "No More Secrets" written across it attached to him. A local witness tells them that he saw a man with Captain's bars with Illinois shortly before his murder. Bumpy immediately knows who it is and gets his revenge on Foley by cutting his throat after finding him in a room with a prostitute. As Bumpy is leaving, he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him.
 
Bumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch. Bumpy later contacts Luciano and tells him that he wants to compromise. Luciano agrees to the terms and they devise a plan to kill Dutch. Cecil, Luciano's driver, appears to betray Luciano and Bumpy by telling Dutch what they are planning. Cecil, however, is being paid by Bumpy to do so. Believing he now has the upper hand, Dutch plans the murder of Luciano and Bumpy but fails to do so. Luciano and Bumpy's plan is revealed when Lulu ([[Ed O'Ross]]) (Dutch's right-hand man) follows Dutch into the restroom and shoots him three times. Dutch walks out of the restroom and down the stairs, sits down at a table and drops dead. Lulu walks outside, gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead, an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk.
 
The last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid, with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business, Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going to go get some sleep. The two shake hands and part company. Bumpy then walks across the street and enters the church to briefly pay his final respects to Illinois. The gospel choir sings "Amazing Grace" while he walks down the aisle, exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen. When he arrives at the coffin, he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes, then turns and walks out. He takes off his hat and turns his face up to the pouring rain, letting it run down his face.

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that "the film is being marketed as a violent action picture, and in a sense, it is" and that director [[Bill Duke]] having made "a historical drama as much as a thriller, and his characters reflect a time when Harlem seemed poised on the brink of better things, and the despair of the postwar years was not easily seen on its prosperous streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Roger Ebert | date = August 27, 1997 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970827/REVIEWS/708270302 | title = Hoodlum :: rogerebert.com | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''''Hotel Lobby''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by American [[Realist visual arts|realist]] painter [[Edward Hopper]]; it is held in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], United States.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Hotel Lobby | work=Collections | publisher =[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] | url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/hotel-lobby-hopper-edward | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting depicts two women and a man in the lobby of a hotel. On the right is a woman with blond hair and a blue dress, sitting with her legs crossed and reading a book. To the left sits an older woman with a red dress, a coat and a hat. A man stands next to her, facing forward, with a suit on and an overcoat draped over his right arm. On the left wall, above the woman, is a framed landscape painting. A clerk behind the reception desk is barely visible in the shadows.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

==Context==

''Hotel Lobby'' is a signature piece in Hopper's work, displaying his classic themes of [[wiktionary:alienation|alienation]] and [[wiktionary:brevity|brevity]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; The Hoppers traveled frequently, staying in many motels and hotels throughout his career. This is one of two works in his catalog that depicts a hotel, the other being ''Hotel Window'' (1955). The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s.&lt;ref name="Warkel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Warkel |first=Harriet G. |coauthors= |title=Paper to Paint: Edward Hopper's ''Hotel Lobby'' |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |year=2009 |month= |isbn=978-0-936260-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel guests have been described as being "both traveling and suspended in time,"&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the [[film noir]] movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by [[Edgar Degas]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 2.JPG| thumb| Light detail]] --&gt;
The painting utilizes harsh light and rigid lines to create a "carefully constructed" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and [[theatrical]] [[wikt:vantage point|vantage point]] of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of [[Broadway theatre]] which he often watched from the balcony.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

===Sketches===

Before he created the ''Hotel Lobby'' Hopper drew ten studies of the work, which are in the collection of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], as a gift for his wife, Josephine.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtistPanel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyerowitz |first1=Joel |last2=Segal |first2=George |last3=Bailey |first3=William |last4=Levin |first4=Gail |year=1981 |title=Artists' Panel |journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=151–153 |publisher=[[College Art Association]] |doi= |jstor=776464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Indianapolis Museum of Art |journal=[[Indianapolis Monthly]] |volume= |issue=September |pages=170 |publisher=[[Emmis Communications]] |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the ten studies are described as:

*Study one was believed to have been executed while Hopper in a hotel lobby observed two seated figures separated by a lamp and table. That wall features a curtained opening, a registration desk and a painting on the wall with the stairwell and railing on the left.
*Study two lacks the table and lamp and includes a second painting, which is separated from the other by a wall sconce, and one figure.
*Study three depicts the stairwell being moved into the background. A figure believed to be male stands in the open doorway to the left of the stairs while a woman sits to the left of the doorway with an empty chair, a painting on the wall and a tiled floor.
*Study four is more refined and has greater detail. The stairs are now removed with three people on the left: two seated figures next to a standing man. The rear doorway has a curtain, columns are on the reception desk, the ceiling appears to be beamed, a second painting is on the wall and a stripe is added to the floor.
*Study five is double sided. One side appears to be an abandoned diagram of a room. The reverse side shows the room with a more detailed revolving door and a return to a single, framed painting on the wall. The reception desk columns are more detailed, and the stripe on the floor is darkened.
*Study six is missing the seated figure from the left with only three remaining and in more detail. The figures and the elevator are in their final locations.
*Study seven shows the fourth figure reappearing by the couple. The ceiling, desk, revolving door, curtained doorway and elevator all have greater detail. The couple also appears to be having a conversation.
*Study eight was created to further detail the older woman's clothing and hands, showing her with a gold [[glove]].
*Study nine is a partial sketch of the younger woman who is reading, which shares the page with sketch eight, in greater detail. Until this sketch the other seated figure was a man.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 3.JPG| thumb| Blonde woman detail]] --&gt;
These studies show the older couple communicating, only to cease their conversation in the final painting and reading man is replaced with a blonde young woman reading in the final painting.&lt;ref name="Saetre"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fame is no cure for fear, Hopper exhibit shows |author=Julie Cope Saetre |url=http://assets3.indy.com/posts/10478 |newspaper=Indy.com |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724055209/http://assets3.indy.com/posts/10478 |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modeling for both women in the painting was done by his wife Josephine. After their marriage in 1920 she insisted on being the model for all of his female figures.&lt;ref name="Elovich"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elovich |first1=Richard |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=London. Edward Hopper |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=123 |issue=935 |pages=111 |publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Inc. |doi= |jstor=880286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat the older woman wears is based on a [[fur coat]] owned by Hopper's wife, a coat she often wore to openings and a rare find in the Hopper's frugal household. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 1.JPG| thumb|left| Woman in red detail]] --&gt;
The red dress that the older woman wears (that Jo, in her journal, describes as "coral") signifies anger and extroversion, while the blue dress worn by the younger woman shows youth and distance. Throughout Hopper's sketches the clerk does not appear until the final painting. Under X-ray it can be seen that Hopper did little to change the canvas once he began work. Most alterations were made in the position of the young woman's head and in outlines of some areas in dark blue paint. A partial underdrawing was found but little detail remains.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper Detail 4.JPG| thumb| |Hopper detail]] --&gt;
Hopper was known to model for himself for figures, as in ''Nighthawks'', leading some to believe he may have modeled for the male figure in ''Hotel Lobby''.

One of the few paintings by Hopper to lack windows, ''Hotel Lobby'' utilizes light from the revolving door and an unseen area from between the ceiling beams.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Reception==

In 1945 Hopper was awarded the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]] and a $500 [[honorarium]] for ''Hotel Lobby''.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levin |first=Gail |coauthors= |title=Edward Hopper: An intimate biography |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1998 |month= |isbn=0-520-21475-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levin |first1=Gail |last2=Hopper |first2=Edward |year=1996 |title=Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks", Surrealism, and the War |journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=195 |publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |doi= |jstor=4104321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was chosen by a jury composed of [[Juliana Force]], then director of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]], and artists [[Raphael Soyer]] and [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]].&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1"/&gt; In regards to the painting, Chicago critic [[Clarence Joseph Bulliet|C.J. Bulliet]] stated that "Mr. Hopper is getting a little lazy about the excellent formula he has hit. ''Hotel Lobby'' is typical Hopper, but Hopper that has lost something of its kick."&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; The artwork has been compared to Hopper's earlier work ''Summer Interior'' (1909), a work that helped to create Hopper's signature style; an intimate setting, simple lines and geometry, flat color usage and moody light. A shadowy figure and a sensual woman each make another visit in ''Hotel Lobby'' as seen in ''Summer Interior''.&lt;ref name="Warkel"/&gt;

==Ownership and exhibition history==
The painting was in the collection of Henry Hope from [[Bloomington, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt;

From June until December 2006 the Whitney Museum, which has the largest holding of Hopper's works in the world, displayed ''Hotel Lobby'' alongside their own works and key loans such as ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) and ''New York Movie'' (1939).&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Edward Hopper | work=Exhibitions | publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art | url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/EdwardHopper | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hoppers Come and Go In a Whitney Show |author=Carol Vogel |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronnen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiroche sale opens tomorrow |author=Meir Ronnen |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=7 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hotel Lobby'' is currently on display in the Indianapolis Museum of Art's [[American scene painting|American Scene]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="HotelLobby"/&gt; In 2008 the IMA exhibited the work alongside the ten studies on loan from the Whitney in ''Edward Hopper: Paper to Paint'', which ran until January 2009.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisMonth1"/&gt;

===Publications===

In 1996 ''Hotel Lobby'' was used as the paperback cover for the book ''Hotel Paradise'' by [[Martha Grimes]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimes |first=Martha |coauthors= |title=Hotel Paradise |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1996 |month= |isbn=978-0-345-39425-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting also appears in ''City Limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience'' by [[Keith Hayward]].&lt;ref name="Hayward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Keith |coauthors= |title=City limits: Crime, consumer culture and the urban experience |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2004 |month= |isbn=1-904385-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indonesian ceremonial bronze axes''' were [[Bronze Age]] objects that were produced in the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] between the 1st and 2nd century AD. Archaeological sites in [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Sulawesi]], the eastern islands, and around [[Lake Sentani]] in [[Papua (province)|Papua]] have been uncovered, showing the bronze axes at the center of a bronze production or at burial sites. They are a testimony of the extensive trade network in the islands of the archipelago in the first millennium AD, thought to be connected to the [[Dong Son culture]].  

==Archaeology== 
[[File:MET 29G A29AR4.jpg|thumb|left|Blade-shaped bronze axe contains delicate pattern and are too weak to be used as weapon or agricultural tools, which indicates their ceremonial use.]]
The first record of metalwork in the Indonesian archipelago was around 500 BC. Most of the earliest bronze objects were probably used for ceremonies e.g. highly-stylized axes and [[kettledrum]]s. Findings of bronze objects from this period are numerous in Indonesia. Even people in the eastern side of Indonesia, that had not shown any signs of contact with Hinduism coming from the Indian subcontinent, had developed sophisticated metal-working techniques. Bronze must have been imported into these islands, because many small-sized islands e.g. [[Bali]] or [[Rote Island|Rote]], did not mine copper nor tin, the raw materials for bronze-making, and yet bronze artifacts were found to be produced extensively in these islands.{{sfn|Miksic|2001|p=33}} 

Ceremonial bronze axes continued to be developed during the pre-Classic era from the 1st to 2nd century AD. During this period, bronze-casting industries flourished, especially in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. These industries were probably instrumental in the manufacture of various kinds of bronze objects in Indonesia, including the ceremonial bronze axes. Various types of bronze axes were discovered across Indonesia e.g. numerous swallow-tail socketed bronze axes found in Java, the large axe with anthropomorphic carving e.g. those found in [[Rote Island]] and [[Makassar]], and the curved bronze blade found in many sizes including miniatures.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}} These archaeological findings of bronze objects production center and various sites indicating their use in a ceremony indicate a thriving inter-island trade in the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] in the first millennium AD.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}} 

==Form==
There are various forms of ceremonial bronze axes found in Indonesia. The similarities between these bronze axes are their artistic delicate patterns and their delicate fragile design which indicate their ceremonial use. A bronze ceremonial axe discovered in Landu on North [[Rote Island|Rote]] in 1875, contains anthropomorphic designs decorated with geometric patterns e.g. concentric circles, fish-bone pattern, and spirals, is very similar with the early art of the southwest Pacific; but with additional geometric motifs also found in bronze objects coming from mainland Asia, e.g. striated pattern.{{sfn|Heekeren|2013|p=11}} This is very similar with those discovered in Sulawesi, such as the Makassar Axe which was kept in the [[National Museum of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}}

Large Indonesian ceremonial bronze axes, such as the Makassar Axe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/bejana/hgH33CdbUsjlkg|title=BEJANA - Unknown - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (measuring {{convert|70.5|cm|inch}} in length and {{convert|30|cm|inch}} in width) and the similar [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37743|title=Ceremonial Object in the Shape of an Ax {{!}} Indonesia (Sulawesi) {{!}} Bronze and Iron Age {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{convert|105.1|cm|inch}} x {{convert|67.3|cm|inch}}) - both classified as [[Raden Panji Soejono|Soejono]] Type IIB,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bintarti|first=D.

This type of enormous bronze axes was produced using [[lost-wax casting]] in two parts which was then combined in the middle. The final object contains a hollow. This well-decorated bronze axe was without a doubt ceremonial in use, but the exact nature of the use is unknown. Being hollow (because the two parts were combined into one), it may have been used as a water vessel, or hanged as percussive instrument, or simply acted as heirloom objects as a symbol of status in important ceremonies.{{sfn|Heekeren|2013|p=10}}

Swallow-tail socketed bronze axes were found in Java. An exceptionally large axe discovered in [[Bogor]] have its swallowtail part adorned on one of its surface by a roughly drawn mask with bud-shaped eyes.

Other types of Indonesian ceremonial bronze axe is the curved blade which have been discovered everywhere in the archipelago from [[West Java]] (e.g. at [[Bandung]]) to [[Sulawesi]]. The blade-shaped bronze axe were produced in full size and as miniatures. Although looks like a weapon, its elegant blade is not strong enough for any practical use in both warfare or agriculture.{{sfn|I Wayan Ardika|2001|p=41}}

Illustration of these axes carried by plumed warriors appears on various bronze objects across the archipelago and northern Vietnam, the origin of the [[Dong Son drum]].

{{nihongo|'''''Kokka'''''|國華}} (''lit.'' 'Flower of the Nation') is a [[periodical]] of [[Oriental art]], first issued in October 1889. ''Kokka'' was established by [[Okakura Tenshin]], journalist {{nihongo|Takahashi Kenzō|[[:ja:高橋健三|高橋健三]]}}, and a patron of the arts who sought to challenge the primacy of [[Western art]] in [[Meiji period|Meiji]] [[Japan]]. Kokka is published in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], with contents and some summaries in [[English language|English]]. In the early twentieth century an English-language edition was also published.

'''Korean animation''', '''Korean anime''', '''manga animasyonu''', or '''''aeni''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|i|}}; {{lang-ko|애니}}) has become an industry that produces characters for other countries' companies, exports its creations globally and generates billions of dollars in profits. 

==History==
[[File:Animation character Lava.jpg|thumb|Larva in the [[Lotte World II Hotel]]]]

{{main|History of Korean animation}}

The Korean animation industry was in a period of crisis throughout the 2000s. Depression at the reality of being an industry that the West merely gave factory-type drawing to began to sink in. This followed the 1990s, a period of explosive growth for the industry when Korean studios made most of their profits from OEM, mostly from the United States.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In many ways, 2011 was a bright transitional year for Korean animation, with home-produced animated feature films finally finding box office success in South Korea, instead of facing the usual financial failure. As far as overseas export market is concerned, the likes of [[Rough Draft Korea]] (RDK) kept on landing new contracts, which have seen Rough Draft perform the manual work on over 45 popular Western cartoon titles over 16 years.&lt;ref name=korazy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.korazy.com.au/main/page_articles_article_2.html |title=Korazy Art Exhibit |publisher=Korazy.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426054727/http://www.korazy.com.au/main/page_articles_article_2.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean animation has boomed in popularity in Eastern Asia with the success of the series ''[[Pororo the Little Penguin]]'' and ''[[Origami Warriors#Adaptation|Origami Warriors]]'' in 2011, leaving fans wanting to discover more Korean animations. This success is due in part to perfecting the Korean animation technique, and financial returns being reinvested into new animated products.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Some Korean animators still blame the booming Korean game industry for draining the animation industry's talent pool,{{ref|manhwa1}} but the box office success of the Korean animated film ''[[Leafie]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/finecut-sells-animated-leafie-us-265085 |title=Finecut Sells Animated 'Leafie' to U.S., U.K., Australia |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011 in South Korea is inspiring a new generation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Animation industry==
Animation contracts for Korean animation studios range from collaboration/minor contribution contracts, to most of the work. The South Korean animation industry can be considered dynamic as there are more than a hundred animation studios. While it is mostly firms in South Korea that contract with Western studios, some of the work is reported to be subcontracted to [[North Korea]] as well.{{ref|sunny-lee}}

==Market==
In 2010, according to the [[Korea Creative Content Agency]], the Korean market share of domestic characters was about 28% and the remaining 72% was for foreign characters, such as those from Japan and USA.

=== Korean characters as international business ===
Before the emergence of Korean domestic [[character (arts)|character]]s, characters that enjoyed popularity were mostly from the United States and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyeyoung Chu, hyunju Lee, Hyehyun Cho, Mirae Hwang|first=|date=Winter 2014|title=Periodic Features of Korean Character Designs|url=http://aodr.org/xml/01492/01492.pdf|journal=3.1 Period of Published Cartoon Characters (1980s~1990s)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the industry matured and grew in size, domestic characters received preference not just domestically but also internationally.

'''''Las Damas Romanas''''' (literally, "The Roman [[Lady|Dame]]s"), also known as '''''The Roman Maidens''''', '''''The Roman Women''''',&lt;ref name=BR&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/luna-y-novicio-juan-ema-03 Las Damas Romanas (The Roman Women)], from "Luna Y Novicio, Juan", bookrags.com&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''The Roman Ladies''''',&lt;ref name=Kulay/&gt;&lt;ref name=FP/&gt; is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Juan Luna]], one of the most important Filipino painters of the Spanish period in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=Art/&gt; It was painted by Luna when he was a student of the school of painting in the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] ([[Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando]]) in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] in 1877.  Alejo Valera, a [[Spaniard|Spanish]] painting teacher, took Luna as an apprentice and brought him to Rome where Luna created ''Las Damas Romanas'' in 1882.&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;  Luna spent six years in Rome from 1878 to 1884.&lt;ref name=Ocampo&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth (columnist).  [http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20081123-173846 Lost Luna found in Paris to be sold], Philippine Daily Inquirer, November 23, 2008, inquirer.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview==

''Las Damas Romanas'' is one of the early works of Luna as a painter that resurfaced in the past quarter of a century after being thought lost or missing.&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atrium&gt;[http://www.atrium-media.com/rogueclassicism/Posts/00008851.html Lost Luna work found], rogueclassicism, atrium-media.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Before its reappearance in Paris many years before 2008&lt;!--did it reappear in 2008, or "many years before"?--&gt;, it had been documented only as a title and as a listed work of Luna in the 1957 biography of Luna written by Carlos E. Da Silva.  The painting had also been documented through a black and white photograph from the files of Alfonso T. Ongpin, a historian and pre-war art dealer.  In 1980, the image from Ongpin was reprinted by Santiago Pilar&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt; in the book "Juan Luna: The Filipino As Painter".&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt;

==Description==
 
The concept for the 100 cm x 170 cm size&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt; painting was based by Luna on [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Roman history|history]].  It depicted a domestic scene in ancient [[Roman citizenship|Roman]] life, portraying two [[Women in Ancient Rome|women]] lying on the steps of a house.  The hand of one [[List of Roman women|woman]] was holding the [[rein]]s of two pet dogs&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt; or hunting dogs,&lt;ref name=Art/&gt; in order to prevent them from scaring away some [[dove]]s.&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;  The doves symbolized divinity&lt;ref name=Art/&gt;  The background of the painting presented a shelf of artifacts.  To the left of the shelf was a [[shrine]] with a [[pediment]] shaped like a triangle.  In front of the pediment was a [[Oil burner|burner]] with a smoking [[incense]].&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;
 
There are three major elements of ''Las Damas Romanas'', namely the women, the dogs, and the doves.  Roman life involved having dogs because they were employed by the ancient Romans for hunting activities, guardians of the home and their property, and as pets.  In Luna's painting, the leashed pet dogs were acting as companions of women.  Doves, on the other hand, were animals that connote [[eroticism]].&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;  In relation to one of the women, there was a suggestion that the woman on the right with dark hair could be Maria de la Paz Pardo de Tavera&lt;!--explain who this is--&gt;.  The notion was discarded because Luna was unmarried when he painted ''Las Damas Romanas''.&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt;

Luna finished ''Las Damas Romanas'' after winning a silver medal for ''[[The Death of Cleopatra]]'' painting in 1881 and before obtaining a gold medal for the masterpiece ''[[Spoliarium]]'' in 1884 (both were presented during the Madrid Exposition during the years mentioned).&lt;ref name=Christies&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth R. (Chairman, National Historical Institute of the Philippines) [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5159790 Las Damas Romanas (Roman Maidens) by Juan Luna (The Philippines 1857-1899)], Christie's, Department Information, Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art, christies.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, Luna was awarded a Diploma of Honor at the Munich Art Exposition&lt;ref name=Art/&gt; (also known as the Munich Salon) for painting ''Las Damas Romanas''.&lt;ref name=Kulay&gt;[http://www.kulay-diwa.com/juan_luna Luna's Damas Romanas (Roman Ladies)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623070507/http://www.kulay-diwa.com/juan_luna |date=2010-06-23 }}, from "Juan Novicio Luna (1857-1899)", kulay-diwa.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FP&gt;[http://filipinopaintings.com/personalities.php?bio=52 Luna's Damas Romanas (Roman Ladies)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711001536/http://filipinopaintings.com/personalities.php?bio=52 |date=2011-07-11 }}, from "Juan Novicio Luna", filipinopaintings.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The masterpiece was a classic work painted in the highest conventions of the academic style, and it was a representative of the "abundant richness of life, with humankind", represented by women in the painting, being "in harmony with Nature".&lt;ref name=Art/&gt;

==Valuation==
Long thought lost or missing, the painting emerged in an estate sale outside Paris, France, before&lt;!--just before?  long before?--&gt; 2008.  During this art auction, the painting was originally priced between 10,000 and 20,000 [[euro]]s ([[Philippine peso|₱]]623,000 and ₱1.3 million), a range that rose to greater than 200,000 euros (₱12.4 million) when the painting was bought by a French art dealer.  The painting was auctioned once again on November 30, 2008, at [[Christie's]] in [[Hong Kong]] with an estimated value ranging from [[US dollar|$]]1 million to $1.2 million,&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt; the equivalent of [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]8,000,000 to HK$10,000,000.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=26674&amp;int_modo=2 ''(...) "Leading the selection of Modern works this season is Las Damas Romanas (Roman Maidens) by Juan Luna (...) estimate: HK$8,000,000-10,000,000 / US$1,025,600-1,282,000" (...)''], Colonial Classics and Modern Masterpieces, Christie's Hong Kong Announces Fall 2008 Sale of Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art, artdaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; The work sold for far less than the estimate, however, achieving $609,193, or HK$4,700,000, including buyer's premium.

'''Lawang Sewu''' ("Thousand Doors") is a landmark in [[Semarang]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia, built as the headquarters of the [[Dutch East Indies Railway Company]]. The colonial era building is famous as a haunted house, though the Semarang city government has attempted to rebrand it.

==Etymology==
The name Lawang Sewu is from [[Javanese language|Javanese]]; it means "Thousand Doors".{{sfn|Ariwibowo 2011, First Lady Inaugurates}} The name comes from its design, with numerous doors and arcs.{{sfn|Semarang City Government, Lawang Sewu}} The building has about 600 large windows.{{sfn|Rohmah 2013, Lawang Sewu}}

==Layout==
[[File:Blueprints for Lawang Sewu.jpg|thumb|left|Blueprints for Building B]]

The complex consists of several buildings, two main ones named A and B and two smaller ones named C and D, on Pemuda Street.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}}{{sfn|Semarang City Government, Lawang Sewu}} The l-shaped A building faces the Tugu Muda roundabout.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}}{{sfn|Semarang City Government, Lawang Sewu}} There are two identical towers on A building, which were originally used to store water, each with a capacity of {{convert|7000|l|USgal}}.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} The building features large [[stained-glass windows]] and a grand staircase in the center.{{sfn|Gower 2009, Lawang Sewu: Ahaunted}} There was also once an underground tunnel connecting A building to several other sites in the city, including the governor's mansion and the harbour.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}}

The B building is located behind A building.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} It is three stories in height, with the first two floors consisting of offices and the third holding a ballroom.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} The building, with high, large windows, also has a basement floor that is kept partially flooded to serve to cool the building through evaporation.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}}

In front of A building stands a monument to five employees killed during the [[Indonesian War of Independence]].{{sfn|Tio|2011|p=62}}

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het hoofdkantoor van de Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij (NIS) in Semarang TMnr 10032316.jpg|thumb|left|"A Building" in the early 1900s]]
[[File:Teak Table and Chairs in hall of Lawang Sewu, Semarang.jpg|thumb|left|A side hall of the building]]

Lawang Sewu was designed by [[Cosman Citroen]], from the firm of [[J.F. Klinkhamer]] and B.J. Quendag.{{sfn|Semarang City Government, Lawang Sewu}} It was designed in [[New Indies Style]], an academically-accepted term for [[Rationalism (architecture)|Dutch Rationalism]] in the Indies.&lt;ref name=Heritage6-120&gt;{{cite book |series=Indonesian Heritage |title= Architecture |volume=6 |page=120 |editor= Gunawan Tjahjono |year=1998 |publisher=Archipelago Press |location=Singapore | isbn = 981-3018-30-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar with Dutch Rationalism, the style is the result of the attempt to develop new solutions to integrate traditional precedents (classicism) with new technological possibilities. It can be described as a transitional style between Traditionalists and the Modernists, and was strongly influenced by the design of [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]].&lt;ref name="indische"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1990 |title=Het Indische bouwen: architectuur en stedebouw in Indonesie : Dutch and Indisch architecture 1800-1950 |chapter=Rationalisme, Traditionalisme, Americanisme |url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wUa4nQEACAAJ&amp;dq=het+indische+bouwen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JNkYVdHMCcS2uASovIDQDg&amp;redir_esc=y |location=Helmond |publisher=Gemeentemuseum Helmond |pages=20–23 |isbn= |access-date= |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1904 with A building, which was completed in 1907.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} The rest of the complex was finished in 1919.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} It was initially used by the [[Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij]], the first railway company in the [[Dutch East Indies]].{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}}

After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese invaded Indonesia]] in 1942, the Japanese army took over Lawang Sewu.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} The basement of B building was turned into a prison, with several executions taking place there.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} When Semarang was retaken by the Dutch in the battle of Semarang in October 1945, the Dutch forces used the tunnel leading into A building to sneak into the city.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} A battle ensued, with numerous Indonesian fighters dying.{{sfn|Semarang City Government, Lawang Sewu}} Five employees working there were also killed.{{sfn|Tio|2011|p=62}}

After the war, the [[Tentara Nasional Indonesia|Indonesian army]] took over the complex.{{sfn|Tio|2011|p=62}} It was later returned to the [[PT Kereta Api|national railway company]].{{sfn|Tio|2011|p=62}} In 1992 it was declared a [[Cultural Property of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Rohmah 2013, Lawang Sewu}}

By 2009 the Lawang Sewu complex was in a state of considerable dilapidation.{{sfn|Gower 2009, Lawang Sewu: Ahaunted}} Simon Marcus Gower, writing in ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', noted it as being "dark and evidently sick. Its white walls are faded throughout; blackened by pollution and neglect. Rendered walls are cracked and any wall paper has long since fallen away to reveal the red bricks beneath. Mould and weeds grow over much of the building and mice and rats are the chief residents."{{sfn|Gower 2009, Lawang Sewu: Ahaunted}}

The building soon underwent renovations to ensure that it would be profitable as a tourist attraction.{{sfn|Ariwibowo 2011, First Lady Inaugurates}}{{sfn|Okezone.com 2011, Banyak Warga Kecewa}} Governor of Central Java [[Bibit Waluyo]] mobilized several dozen soldiers to assist with the renovations; the soldiers focused on external repairs.{{sfn|Ariwibowo 2011, First Lady Inaugurates}} Local residents were disappointed in the renovations, opining that it had lost its authenticity.{{sfn|Okezone.com 2011, Banyak Warga Kecewa}}

On 5 July 2011 the newly renovated complex was inaugurated by First Lady [[Ani Yudhoyono]].{{sfn|Ariwibowo 2011, First Lady Inaugurates}} However, at the time only B building was available for tours.{{sfn|Prihadi 2011, Lawang Sewu Kini}} It is hoped to be a main attraction in the Central Javan government's tourism program in 2013.{{sfn|Ariwibowo 2011, First Lady Inaugurates}}

Future plans include transforming Building B into office space, a food court, and even a gym.{{sfn|Vann 2013, Haunted House}} In late 2013 the Semarang city government announced plans to eliminate the building's "spooky image" in order to attract more visitors. This was to encompass a reimagining of the site as a place for social and cultural activities, supported by renovations of the building. At the time, Lawang Sewu attracted an average of 1,000 visitors daily.{{sfn|Rohmah 2013, Lawang Sewu}}

==Urban legend==

[[File:Underground Access of Lawang Sewu, Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|An access to the underground of Lawang Sewu building in Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia]]

Lawang Sewu is said to be haunted, with many tourists visiting to see the ghosts.{{sfn|Gower 2009, Lawang Sewu: Ahaunted}} Among the ghosts reported to inhabit the establishment are a [[:wikt:Dutchwoman|Dutchwoman]] who committed suicide inside and "headless ghouls".{{sfn|Gower 2009, Lawang Sewu: Ahaunted}}

In 2007, a horror film entitled ''[[Lawang Sewu: Dendam Kuntilanak]]'' (''Lawang Sewu: Kuntilanak's Vengeance'') was released based on the legend.{{sfn|KapanLagi.com 2007, 'Lawang Sewu', Film}} It told the story of a group of high school students from [[Jakarta]] who were trapped in Lawang Sewu after several had to urinate and featured ghosts of a Dutchwoman, a man with a ball and chain wrapped around his leg, and a [[kuntilanak]].{{sfn|KapanLagi.com 2007, 'Lawang Sewu', Film}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">'''Macauley's Theatre''' was the premier theatre in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] during the late 19th and early 20th century. It opened on October 18, 1873 on the north side of Walnut Street between Third and Fourth Streets, and was founded by Bernard "Barney" Macauley, a prominent Louisville actor since the 1850s. The theater was designed by architect John B. McElfatrick. It opened with the comedy ''[[Extremes (play)|Extremes]]''. Debts forced him to sell the playhouse to his brother John in 1879. 

The theatre was a success under John Macauley, featuring the top actors of the day, such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Lillie Langtry]], [[Edwin Booth]], [[George M. Cohan]] and showman [[Buffalo Bill]]. Louisvillian [[Mary Anderson (stage actress)|Mary Anderson]] made her debut at the theatre in 1875.

With changing times, Macauleys began to occasionally show motion pictures in the 1910s. It continued to serve as Louisville's premier live theatre however, until it was razed in 1925. The final performance was of ''[[The Naughty Wife]]'' on August 29, 1925. Theatre in Louisville lived on at the 1,400-seat [[Brown Theatre]], which opened in 1925 and rechristened as The Macauley Theatre from 1971 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentuckycenter.org/brown-theatre/brown-theatre-history|title=Brown Theatre History|website=www.kentuckycenter.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macauley's lobby was decorated with pictures of the famous actors and actresses who had performed there, many with personal inscriptions and dedications. When the theatre closed, these were donated to the [[University of Louisville]], which still includes them in their archives.

[[File:Madras Music Academy.jpg|thumb|The Music Academy, Madras in 1943.]]
'''Madras Music Academy''' is one of the earliest established [[Music academy|music academies]] in [[South India]]. Before the concept of infrastructure was introduced to India in the early 1920s, it was a gathering for elite musicians simply called (and is still more commonly referred to as) '''Music Academy''' ({{Indic|lang=ta|indic=சங்கீத வித்வத் சபை|trans=sangeetha vidhwadh sabai}}) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicacademymadras.in/&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in encouraging and promoting primarily the [[Carnatic Music]] Indian art form. It played a vital role in the revival of the [[Indian classical dance]] form of [[Bharatnatyam]] in the 1930s when it faced near extinction due to a negative connotation caused by conservative societal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=At home in the world: bharata natyam on the global stage|chapter=Revival Era Dancers at Music Academy|author=Janet O'Shea |publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year= 2007|isbn=0-8195-6837-6 |page=1975 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CfA4uDwCKwC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Kalanidhi+narayanan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BQOUTYrjKY3KrAeCqf3kCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kalanidhi%20narayanan&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also run a music school called the Teachers college of Carnatic Music which has many eminent musicians on its faculty. Eminent and Iconic musicians such as [[Tiger Varadachariar]], [[Appa Iyer]], [[Valadi Krishnaiyer]] and [[Mudicondan Venkatarama Iyer]] adorned the chair of Principal of the prestigious Teacher's College.  


==History==
In 1927,[[Indian National Congress]]  held the All India Music Conference in Madras. At the end of the conference it was decided that an organisation be formed that helped the cause of music. The prime reason for this conference was [[E. Krishna Iyer]] who had played a vital role in reviving the south Indian dance art form - [[Bharatanatyam]].[[Indian National Congress]]

Lovers of music and other well wishers wanted to stimulate interest in Carnatic music in the South and develop a rich culture. The academy had sound planning from the start with an expert committee consisting of some of the leading musicians and scholars to advise the academy on all technical matters.

The Academy was formally inaugurated on 18 August 1928 by [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], in the Y.M.I.A. Auditorium before a large and distinguished gathering.

Since then the academy has endeavoured to provide various avenues to further the advancement of the science and art of Indian music.

Annual music conferences are held every December to collect all information regarding music, maintain the library and publish a journal. They also help to bring to public notice aspiring musicians and scholars by conducting competitions and other presentations.

For a decade, E.Krishna Iyer worked as the [[Secretary]] of the Madras Music Academy. The first Music Festival was held in December, 1927 which is before the inauguration of the Music Academy. Since then, it had become a part of the Madras Music Academy's Activities to conduct several expositions and concerts on Carnatic Music every December. This later came to be popularly known as the ''Margazhi Season'' or is even referred to as the ''[[Music Season]]'' amongst Carnatic enthusiasts. This soon became the norm for all [[sabhā|sabha]]s in Madras to conduct several [[concert]]s each day during the season. There were several sabhas before the formation of the Music Academy like the [[Parthasarathy Swami Sabha]] in [[Triplicane]] which was formed as early as 1900. However it was the Madras Music Academy that set the trend of conducting the music festival during December.

Dr. [[U. Rama Rao]] was the founder President of the Academy and [[Basheer Ahmed Sayeed]], the founder Vice-President. There have been six others in that post. The present President is Sri N. Murali. Before the present building (T.T.Krishnamachari Auditorium) was constructed the annual conferences, programmes where held in various locations around the city.

==The building==
During the first few years, the Academy conducted its activities provisionally in George Town and later moved to [[Mylapore]]. In 1955, [[Pandit]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] laid the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] stone for the music academy building that exists today on TTK Road in Mylapore. On 20 December 1962, [[Maharaja]] [[Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur]], the then [[Governor]] of Madras.

There are two buildings for the Music Academy:

# The [[T.T. Krishnamachari]] Hall
# The Kasturi Srinivasan Hall

The '''T.T. Krishnamachari Hall''' is the first building that was built in 1955. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 1600.

The '''Kasturi Srinivasan Hall''' was built in 1982.

[[File:Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional logotype.png|thumb|National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico) logo]]

The '''National Symphony Orchestra''' (''Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional'', OSN) is the most important [[classical music]] and [[symphonic]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Torres-Chibras, Armando Ramon. 2002. "José Pablo Moncayo, Mexican Composer and Conductor: A Survey of His Life with a Historical Perspective of His Time." [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]] diss., [[University of Missouri]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. [[Ann Arbor]], MI: [[University Microfilms International]]. {{ISBN|0-493-66937-X}}, page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; With its origins traced back as 1881, it is the second-oldest symphony orchestra in the [[Americas|American]] continent along with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. The orchestra does not have a permanent venue but performs regularly in the Grand Hall of the Palace of Fine Arts ([[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]) in [[Mexico City]].

Not to be confused with the [[Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado de México]] (OSEM) or Symphony Orchestra of the State of Mexico, founded in 1971, the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, as a branch of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]], was created by presidential decree of Miguel Alemán on 18 July 1947, under the name of National Conservatory Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name="Carlos Chávez 1950"&gt;Carlos Chávez, “La Sinfónica Nacional,” Nuestra Música 18 (Año 5, 1950): 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before that, however, there was a predecessor orchestra known as the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (September 2, 1928 – March 8, 1949), a nonprofit organization founded and conducted by Mexican composer, conductor, teacher, journalist and visionary arts leader [[Carlos Chávez]]. On 1 August 1947, Chávez appointed Blas Galindo as the new director of the National Conservatory, official seat of the new orchestra. Chávez reports that the National Symphony Orchestra gave its first official performance on 30 October 1947 at the Palace of Fine Arts, under the baton of Eduardo Hernández Moncada, its first music and artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Sandi, Dos Años y Medio del INBA: Vol. II Departamento de música (Mexico City: Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes de la Secretaría de Educación Pública, 1950), 29–31. Carlos Chávez, as General Director of the INBA, was the person directly responsible for this report. He wrote the study about the OSN that appears in the first volume of this report (that dealt with the administrative structure of the INBA). Sandi, as head of the music department, signed the second volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another decree on April 25, 1949, changed the name of the ensemble to National Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional or OSN); first, to emphasize its professional character—it had the best musicians in the country—and to avoid confusing it with a student ensemble, despite Chávez's having from the very beginning considered the orchestra a national symphony, linked in some aspects to the most important music education institution, the National Conservatory; and second, Chávez wanted to highlight that “a National Symphony, by definition, is a State institution,” and the government had recognized the need to support an institution of public interest.&lt;ref name="Carlos Chávez 1950"/&gt;

==History of the Orchestra==
The social context that Mexico was living during the beginnings of the 20th century made the task of creating an orchestra difficult, so there were several attempts to form a national symphony orchestra.

===First period===
The [[orchestra]] has its roots back in 1881, when Alfredo Bablot, director of the [[Music]] [[College or university school of music|Conservatory]] (founded July 1, 1866) initiated the Conservatory Orchestra. When Bablot died, he was replaced by Carlos J. Menéses. In 1902 the orchestra had little support from the [[government]] of [[Porfirio Díaz]], but it suspended its activities in 1913, two years after Díaz's fall, because of the general instability in the country during the [[Mexican Revolution]].

===Second and third period===
After Gen. [[Venustiano Carranza]], took over the national government's seat back to Mexico City in 1915, the orchestra took the name of National Symphony, and depended from the Bellas Artes bureau, and its director during this period was Jesús Acuña, followed by composer [[Manuel M. Ponce]] but he declined and the orchestra suspended the concert seasons. Later, composer [[Julián Carrillo]], who was a very important figure in [[music history]] worldwide, was appointed as the Music Conservatory director, and took up the project for an orchestra again, and depended from the Conservatory, but because of lack of financial support from the government, the orchestra again finished its activities in 1924.

===Mexican Symphony Orchestra===
In 1928, the Mexican Symphony Orchestra was created, but the name changed shortly to Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (''Orquesta Sinfónica de México'') . This orchestra is more related to the current orchestra. Carlos Chávez was appointed as its first conductor, but it lacked of any financial support, besides that the orchestra wasn't being well administrated by the city's musician syndicate of that time. While Chávez conducted the orchestra, it meaning a flourishing period for the orchestral music in the country.

A private patronage was established and the orchestra could give its first concert. The date was September 2, 1928, and the place, the Iris Theatre. With 103 musicians on stage, the programme included [[Debussy]]´s ''[[Images pour orchestre|Ibéria]]'' [[Suite (music)|Suite]], Tello's ''[[Sonata]] [[Tragica]]'', [[Tchaikovsky]]´s ''[[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in [[B-flat minor]]'' with Vilma Erenyi as [[Solo (music)|soloist]], and [[Strauss]]´ ''[[Don Juan]]''. Although the orchestra received financial support from the government, this was considered as a private one, not official, like it is constituted today. This is the most important point to consider the nature of this musical organization at the present time.

Mexican composer [[Silvestre Revueltas]], who was second in charge as assistant conductor, left the orchestra in 1935 to be the principal conductor of a newly created and short-lived National Symphony Orchestra that depended from the National Music Conservatory, but it closed in 1937 when Revueltas resigned.

===Creation of the INBA and establishment of the current orchestra===
On November 23, 1946, president [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]] proposed the creation of the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature (''Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura''), known by the acronym [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|INBA]], and was formally opened on 1 January 1947, as a branch of the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]], (SEP) (Secretariat of Public Education). The first head of the INBA was Carlos Chávez, who created a new orchestra for the Conservatory (thus because the conservatory depended on the INBA administration). On January 19, 1949, Chávez resigned his job as conductor of the  Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, to spend more of his time composing and directing the INBA, but the orchestra didn't disappear, because Chávez succeeded in making the government recognize a national ensemble (working on this issue, since he was appointed as head of the INBA), so the actual organization known as National Symphony Orchestra of México was established, and Eduardo Hernández Moncada was designated its first conductor in 1947, José Pablo Moncayo replaced him in 1949.

===The orchestra from its creation to the present day===
Moncayo was succeeded in 1954 by Luis Herrera de la Fuente, who led the orchestra until 1972. During this period the orchestra had very important tours nationwide and worldwide, especially in Europe. In 1973 Chávez returned to conduct the orchestra but resigned in the first month due to internal conflicts with the orchestra members. This resulted in the formation of a new artistic administration by some of the musicians and representatives from the INBA called co-government. Under this arrangement there was no principal conductor; instead, the orchestra had host conductors for its seasons and a Mexican assistant director for off-season affairs.

After several years of this arrangement, the orchestra accepted to have a conductor again in 1979, appointing Sergio Cárdenas, who served until 1984. After him served Jose Guadalupe Flores from 1985 to 1986, followed by Francisco Savín from 1986 to 1988, and from 1989 to 1990 Luis Herrera de la Fuente returned. Participation in national festivals, music workshops, conferences, band concerts and chamber music concerts were offered by the orchestra during these years.

In May 1990, Enrique Arturo Diemecke was appointed as new conductor. He revived the tradition of touring promoted by Herrera de la Fuente during his first term, traveling to festivals in Portugal and Spain in 1992 and touring within Mexico and United States in 1999 and 2002. During his direction, the orchestra encouraged soundtrack concerts that consisted of playing music from films like the Mexican "Redes", music by [[Aaron Copland]] or ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' from [[Leonard Bernstein]] and several others. Didactic concerts for kids, concerts with worldwide renowned soloists like Jorge Federico Osorio, [[Frederica von Stade]] and [[violin]] [[virtuoso]] [[Itzhak Perlman]] were held by the orchestra in these years, and in 2002 the orchestra was nominated for [[Latin Grammy]] award for Best Classical Album. In 2003 the orchestra celebrated its 75th Anniversary with a concert in Mexico's [[National Auditorium]] performing the [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]´s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] (Choral), Op. 125 with an almost sold out locations. In November 2006, after 16 years of continuous works, Diemecke left the orchestra.

The orchestra's current musical director, Carlos Miguel Prieto, named at the end of 2007, has launched the orchestra on a new era, aiming to place it on a par with the world's leading ensembles. In early 2008 he led it on its first European tour in years, culminating with an acclaimed{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} concert at Amsterdam's renowned Concertgebouw Hall. Also in 2008 the orchestra celebrated its 80th Anniversary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25031">A '''novelization''' (or '''novelisation''') is a [[derivative work|derivative]] [[novel]] that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a [[film]], [[TV series]], [[comic book]] or [[video game]]. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of [[home video]], but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.

==History and purpose==
[[File:The Thunder Master Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Novelization of chapter 8 of the film series ''[[Les Vampires]]'' (1915–16).]]
Novelizations of films began to be produced in the 1910s and 1920s for silent films such as ''[[Les Vampires]]'' (1915–16) and ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' (1927). One of the first talking movies to be novelized was ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933). Film novelizations were especially profitable during the 1970s before [[home video]] became available,&lt;ref name="The Chicago Reader"&gt;{{cite news|title=You've seen the movie—now write the book|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/11/18/youve-seen-the-movienow-write-the-book|work=The Chicago Reader|first=J. R.|last=Jones|date=November 18, 2011|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they were then the only way to re-experience popular movies other than television airing or a rerelease in theaters. The novelizations of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) and ''[[Star Trek:The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) sold millions of copies.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair 27 August 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suskind|first1=Alex|title=Yes, People Still Read Movie Novelizations ... And Write Them, Too|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/08/movie-novelizations-still-exist|accessdate=28 August 2014|work=Vanity Fair|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the advent of home video, film novelizations remain popular, with the adaptation of ''[[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]'' (2014) being included on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for mass-market paperbacks. This has been attributed to these novels' appeal to fans: About 50% of novelizations are sold to people who have watched the film and want to explore its characters further, or to reconnect to the enthusiasm they experienced when watching the film.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair 27 August 2014" /&gt; A film is therefore also a sort of commercial for its novelization.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=To Some, a Movie Is Just an Outline for a Book|first=Peter|last=Kobel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/01/movies/film-to-some-a-movie-is-just-an-outline-for-a-book.html|work=The New York Times|date = April 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, film novelizations help generate publicity for upcoming films, serving as a link in the film's marketing chain.&lt;ref name="David Morrell"&gt;{{cite web|title=David Morrell on Rambo|url=http://davidmorrell.net/rambo-pages/david-morrell-on-rambo/|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization. This makes these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film franchises. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has been credited with these works gaining a "patina of respectability" after they had previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.&lt;ref name="NYT 4 January 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=Popular TV Series and Movies Maintain Relevance as Novels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/popular-tv-series-and-movies-maintain-relevance-as-novels.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Film===
The writer of a novelization is supposed to multiply the 20,000–25,000 words of a [[screenplay]] into at least 60,000 words.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; Writers usually achieve that by adding description or [[introspection]].&lt;ref name="David Morrell"/&gt; Ambitious writers are moreover driven to work on transitions and characters just to accomplish "a more prose-worthy format". Sometimes the "novelizer"  moreover invents new scenes in order to give the plot "added dimension", provided they are allowed to do that.&lt;ref name="The Tie-In Life"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tie-In Life by Raymond Benson|url=http://suvudu.com/2011/02/the-tie-in-life-by-raymond-benson.html|accessdate = February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might take an insider to tell whether a novelization diverges instead unintentionally from the finally released film because it is based on an earlier version which possibly included meanwhile deleted scenes.&lt;ref name="The Chicago Reader"/&gt; Thus the novelization occasionally already presents material which will later on appear in a [[director's cut]].&lt;ref name="The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction"&gt;{{cite web |title=Snakes on a Plane|url=http://www.sfsite.com/09a/sp231.htm|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers select different approaches to enrich a screenplay. Dewey Gram's ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]],'' for example, included historical background information. [[Shaun Hutson]] refused to write a novelization of ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' because he found the source material too "poor".&lt;ref name="Shaun Hutson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Film to Book Adaptations|url=http://www.thisishorror.co.uk/columns/the-gorefather/film-to-book-adaptations|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still Christa Faust accepted and filled the pages by inventing detailed biographies for some of the early killed passengers. She was then praised for having presented "full three-dimensional characters".&lt;ref name="The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction"/&gt;

If a film is based on a novel, the original novel is generally reissued with a cover based on the film's poster.&lt;ref name="The John Carter Files"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: The Novelization of Disney's John Carter|date=February 12, 2012|first=Rick|last=Barry|url=http://thejohncarterfiles.com/2012/02/review-the-novelization-of-disneys-john-carter/}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a film company which holds the rights for a film wishes to have a novelization published, the company is supposed to approach in the first place an author who is in possession of "Separated Rights". A writer has these rights if he contributed the source material (or added a great deal of creative input to it) and if he was moreover properly credited.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatrical Separated Rights|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=119|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211014110/http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=119|archive-date=February 11, 2013|website=Writers Guild of America, West|accessdate =April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelizations also exist where the film itself is based on an original novel: novelist and screenwriter [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] wrote a novelization of the James Bond film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]].'' Although the [[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|1962 Ian Fleming novel]] was still available in bookstores, its story had nothing to do with the 1977 film. To avoid confusion, Wood's novelization was titled ''[[James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.{{sfn|Britton|2005|p=149}} This novel is also an example of a screenwriter novelizing his own screenplay. ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'' was published under the name of [[George Lucas]] but his script had been novelized by the prolific [[tie-in]] writer [[Alan Dean Foster]].&lt;ref name="Alan Dean Foster Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Alan Dean Foster, Author of Terminator Salvation: The Official Movie Novelization|first=Jenna|last=Busch|date=May 25, 2011|quote= George wrote the script, I wrote the novelization, George vetted the result, and Del Rey published it|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenna-busch/interview-with-alan-dean_b_254723.html|accessdate = April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquiring editors looking for a novelizer have different issues. For starters rewrites of scripts are not uncommon. The script for the 1966 film ''[[Modesty Blaise (1966 film)|Modesty Blaise]]'' for example was rewritten by five different authors.&lt;ref name="Modesty Blaise Books"&gt;{{cite web|title=Movies and TV|website=The Modesty Blaise Book Covers|quote=Peter O'Donnell's script was rewritten by five different writers, until only one line of the original remained|url=http://www.modestyblaisebooks.com/media_moviestv.html|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516115539/http://www.modestyblaisebooks.com/media_moviestv.html|archive-date=May 16, 2012|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer or [[script doctor]] responsible for the so-called "final" version is not necessarily the artist who has contributed the original idea or most of the scenes. The patchwork character of a film script might even exacerbate because the [[film director]], a principal actor or a consulting [[script doctor]] does rewrites during the shooting. An acquiring editor who intends to hire one of the credited screenwriters has to reckon that the early writers are no longer familiar with the current draft or work already on another film script. Not every screenwriter is available, willing to work for less money than what can be earned with film scripts and able to deliver the required amount of prose on time. Even if so, there is still the matter of novelizations having a questionable reputation.&lt;ref name="Mel Gilden"&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Novelizations the Scum of Literature?|url=http://www.melgilden.com/Sampletext/EssaNovl.html|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201092239/http://www.melgilden.com/Sampletext/EssaNovl.html|archive-date=December 1, 2008|first=Mel|last=Gilden|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers concedes that by saying their craft went "largely unrecognized".&lt;ref name="IAMTW"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Tie-In Writer?|url=http://www.iamtw.org/|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some novels blur the line between a novelization and an original novel that is the basis of a [[film adaptation]]. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] provided the ideas for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Based on his own [[short stories]] and his cooperation with Kubrick during the preparation and making of this [[film adaptation]] he wrote the [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|film novelization of the same name]] which is appreciated by fans because the film provides little [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], and the novelization fills in some blanks. [[David Morrell]] wrote the novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'' about [[John Rambo]], which led to the [[First Blood (film)|film adaptation of the same name]]. Although Rambo dies at the end of his original story, Morrell had a [[paragraph]] in his [[contract]] stipulating he remained "the only person who could write books about Rambo". This paid off for him when the [[film producer]]s changed the ending and decided for a [[sequel]]. David Morrell accepted to carry out the novelization and negotiated unprecedented liberties which resulted in an likewise unprecedented success when his book entered [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and stayed there for six weeks.&lt;ref name="David Morrell"/&gt;

[[Simon Templar]] or [[James Bond]] are examples of [[media franchise]]s that have been popular for more than one generation. When the [[feature film]] ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'' was released in [[1997 in cinema|1997]] the creator of this [[character (arts)|character]] ([[Leslie Charteris]]) had already been dead for four years. Hence [[The Saint (novel)|its novelization]] had to be written by another author. [[Ian Fleming]] on the other hand had official successors who wrote contemporary "Post-Fleming" [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|James Bond novels]]. During his tenure [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] was consequently chosen to write the novelization of ''[[Licence to Kill]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=License to Kill|url=http://www.john-gardner.com/node/119|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[1989 in cinema|1989]] and also the novelization of ''[[GoldenEye]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldeneye|url=http://www.john-gardner.com/node/124|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[1995 in cinema|1995]]. John Gardner found his successor in [[Raymond Benson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gardner, Benson &amp; Bond|url=http://www.john-gardner.com/features|date = January 26, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote besides several original Bond novels three novelizations including ''[[The World Is Not Enough (novel)|The World Is Not Enough]]''.

===Comics===
While comic books such as the series ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' have often provided adaptations of novels, novelizations of comic are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="Deepwoods"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Son of the Phantom (1944–1946)|url=http://www.deepwoods.org/son.html|first1=Bob|last1=Griffin|first2=John|last2=Griffin|website=The Deep Woods|date = December 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Video games are novelized in the same manner as films. While gamers might enjoy playing a certain action scene for hours, the buyers of a novelization might be bored soon if they merely read about such a scene. Consequently, the writer will have to cut down on the action.&lt;ref name="The Tie-In Life"/&gt;

==Authors==
Novelization writers are often also accomplished original fiction writers, as well as fans of the works they adapt, which helps motivate them to undertake a commission that is generally compensated with a relatively low flat fee. [[Alan Dean Foster]], for example, said that, as a fan, "I got to make my own director's cut. I got to fix the science mistakes, I got to enlarge on the characters, if there was a scene I particularly liked, I got to do more of it, and I had an unlimited budget. So it was fun".&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair 27 August 2014" /&gt;

Writing skill is particularly needed for challenging situations common to writing novelizations of popular media, such as lack of access to information about the film, last-minute script changes and very quick turnaround times. [[Max Allan Collins]], for example, had to write the novelization of ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' in nine days.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair 27 August 2014" /&gt;

Although novelizations tend to have a low prestige, and are often viewed as "hackwork",&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair 27 August 2014" /&gt; several critically acclaimed literary authors have written novelizations, including [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]],{{sfn|Pringle|1998|p=119}} [[William Kotzwinkle]]{{sfn|Hamilton|Jones|2009|p=198}} and [[Richard Elman]].{{sfn|Shatzky|Taub|1997|p=79}} Best-selling author [[Ken Follett]] early in his career also wrote a novelization.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=172}} While increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing still has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.&lt;ref name="NYT 4 January 2015" /&gt;

The [[International Association of Media Tie-In Writers]] is an American association that aims to recognize the writers of adapted and [[Movie tie-in (book)|tie-in fiction]]. It hands out annual awards, the "Scribes", in categories including "best adapted novel".&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair 27 August 2014" /&gt;

=== TV series===
Episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' were adapted into short stories by the noted science fiction writer [[James Blish]]. Each volume of the stories included a number of the short story adaptations. [[Alan Dean Foster]] would later adapt the follow-up [[Star Trek The Animated Series|animated series]] into the ''Star Trek Log'' series.

Mel Gilden wrote novelizations of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', merging three episodes into one book. As he explained, this approach required him to look for a joint [[story arc]].&lt;ref name="Mel Gilden"/&gt;

===Comics ===
In the early 1970s [[Lee Falk]] was asked by the [[Avon (publishers)|Avon publishing house]] to deliver [[Phantom novels]] based on the [[The Phantom|eponymous comic strip]]. Falk worked on the novelizations on his own and with collaboration. A dispute over he would be credited led to the cessation of the series.&lt;ref name="Lee Falk: Father of The Phantom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Falk: Father of The Phantom|url=http://www.deepwoods.org/lee_falk2.html|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter O'Donnell]], who scripted the [[Modesty Blaise]] comic strip, later authored novels featuring the character not directly based on the stories presented in the strips.

===Video games===
[[Matt Forbeck]] became a [[writer of novels]] based on video games after he had been "writing tabletop roleplaying game books for over a decade".&lt;ref name="Escapist Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Write a Tie-In Novel|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/days-of-high-adventure/7886-Days-of-High-Adventure-How-to-Write-a-Tie-In-Novel.2|first=Matt|last=Forbeck |date=July 22, 2010|work=The Escapist}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked also as a designer of video games.

[[S. D. Perry]] wrote a series of novels based on the [[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil video games]] and added tie-ins to the novelizations, covering all the mainline titles in the series up until ''[[Resident Evil Zero]]''.

[[Eric Nylund]] introduced a new concept for a novelization when he delivered a trilogy, consisting of a [[prequel]] titled ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', an actual novelization titled ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'' and a [[sequel]] titled ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]''.

[[Project Itoh]], the Japanese author who novelized ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', had plans to adapt ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]]'' as well, but was unable to fulfill this due to his death in 2010. Satoshi Hase (author of ''Beatless'') was commissioned to novelize ''Snake Eater'' in Itoh's place, while an anonymous author working under the pen name Hitori Nojima (later revealed to be Kadokawa Shoten writer Kenji Yano)&lt;ref name=yanojima&gt;{{cite twitter|user=KojiPro2015_EN|number=742582815582130176|date=June 13, 2016|author=Kojima Productions|title=Just so you know; the "Hitori Nojima" from whose name is at the end of the trailer is actually our friend Kenji Yano}}&lt;/ref&gt; novelized ''Peace Walker'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'', in addition to new novelizations (unrelated to the earlier [[Raymond Benson]] versions) of the original ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''.

==Orphaned novelizations==

In some cases an otherwise standard novel may be based on an unfilmed screenplay. [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1961 [[James Bond]] novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' was based on a script he had co-written; in this case his collaborators subsequently sued for plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming|url=http://www.universalexports.net/00Sony.shtml|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter O'Donnell's novel [[Modesty Blaise (novel)|''Modesty Blaise'']] was a novelization of a refused film script. In this case the creator of the main character had written the script alone. But later on other authors had changed O'Donnell's original script over and over, until merely one single sentence remained from the original.&lt;ref name="Modesty Blaise Books"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modesty Blaise Trivia|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83807/Modesty-Blaise/trivia.html|website=TCM|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modesty Blaise Trivia|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060708/trivia|website=IMDB|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was released a year before the film and unlike the film it had sequels.

[[Frederick Forsyth]]'s 1979 novel ''[[The Devil's Alternative]]'' was based on an unfilmed script he had written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nathan|first=Paul S.|title=Rights and Permissions|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]]|volume=207|issue=Part&amp;nbsp;2|year=1975|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally a novelization is issued even though the film is never made. [[Gordon Williams (writer)|Gordon Williams]] wrote the script and novelization for producer [[Harry Saltzman]]'s abandoned film ''The Micronauts''.&lt;ref name="Starlog (September 1977)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=anonymous|title=Bits &amp; Pieces|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=8|date=September 1977|pages=16, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale known as "'''The Poison Dress'''", or "'''Embalmed Alive'''"&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt; features a [[dress]] that has in some way been [[poison]]ed. This is a recurring theme throughout legends and folk tales of various cultures, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Mughal India]], and the [[United States]]. Although lacking evidence suggesting that some American [[urban legend]]s are directly linked to the classical tales, they share several common [[motif (narrative)|motifs]].&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book |title=Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend |first=Gillian |last=Bennett |isbn=1-57806-789-8 |year=2005 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek mythology==
{{main|Medea|Shirt of Nessus}}

The poison dress motif is similar to the [[Shirt of Flame]]. In [[Greek mythology]], when [[Jason]] left the sorceress [[Medea]] to marry Glauce, King [[Creon]]'s daughter, Medea took her revenge by sending Glauce a poison dress and a golden [[coronet]], also dipped in poison. This resulted in the death of the princess and, subsequently, the king, when he tried to save her.

The Shirt of Nessus is smeared with the poisoned blood of the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]], which was given to [[Hercules]] by Hercules' wife, [[Deianira]]. Deianira had been tricked by Nessus and made to believe that the blood would ensure Hercules's [[faithfulness]]. According to [[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''[[Women of Trachis|The Women of Trachis]]'', Hercules began to perspire when he put on the shirt, which soon clung to his flesh, corroding it. He eventually threw himself onto a pyre on [[Mount Oeta]] in extreme agony and burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women of Trachis | url = http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/soph_trach.shtml | author = Sophocles | authorlink = Sophocles | others=Robert M. Torrance (trans.) | year = 1966 | accessdate = 2008-10-21 | publisher = Temple University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian folklore==
[[File:Aurangazeb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Aurangzeb]] (reign 1658-1707), considered by his subjects a [[fakir]] or wizard,&lt;ref name=Khilats/&gt; was credited with using poison khilats to eliminate some of his perceived enemies.]]

Numerous tales of poison [[khilat]]s (robes of honour) have been recorded in historical, folkloric, and medical texts of British Indianists.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khilats&gt;{{cite news | first= Adrienne | last= Mayor | authorlink= Adrienne Mayor |author2=Michelle Maskiell | year= 2001 | title= Killer Khilats, Part 2: Imperial Collecting of Poison Dress Legends in India | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_112/ai_79548470/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 | accessdate = 2008-10-21 | work=Folklore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts of clothing were common in major life-cycle rituals in pre-industrial India, and these stories revolve around fears of betrayal, inspired by ancient custom of giving khilats to friends and enemies as demonstrations of a social relationship or a political alliance.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; 

In 1870, [[Norman Chevers]], M.D., a Surgeon-Major to the Bengal Medical Service, authored ''Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India'', describing unusual crimes involving poisons native to India. The book included three cases of poison khilat death, attributing the cause of one of the deaths to lethal [[vesicant]]s impregnating the fabric of the robe and entering the victim's [[sweat pore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chevers | first =  Norman | title = A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India | location = London | publisher = Thacker | year = 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American urban legends==
The theme of the poison dress appears in several American [[urban legend]]s, which were recorded in folklore collections and journal articles in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=Brunvand&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Urban Legends | first = Jan Harold | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | pages = 322 | isbn = 0-393-32358-7 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Folklorist]] [[Stith Thompson]] noted the classical prototype in these stories, "[[Shirt of Nessus]]", and assigned Motif D1402.5, "Magic shirt burns wearer up". [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] provides the summary of one of the stories:
{{cquote|Girl wears new formal gown to dance. Several times during the evening she feels faint, has escort take her outside for fresh air. Finally she becomes really ill, dies in the restroom. Investigation reveals that the dress has been the cause of her death. It had been used as the funeral dress for a young girl; it had been removed from the corpse before burial and returned to the store. The [[formaldehyde]] which the dress has absorbed from the corpse enters the pores of the dancing girl.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt;}}

Folklorist Ernest Baughman speculated that the story might have been used as adverse publicity to discredit a well-known store, since several variants of the story specifically mention the name of the store at which the dress was supposedly purchased.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt; The legend continued to be told long after its initial popularity, with "embalming fluid" sometimes replacing the formaldehyde mentioned in the earlier version.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt;  This urban legend was dramatized in the episode "[['Til Death Do We Part (CSI: NY episode)|'Til Death Do We Part]]," from the crime-scene drama, ''[[CSI: NY]]''.

Also contributing to the poison-dress theme is the prevalence of [[Smallpox blankets|smallpox-contaminated blankets]], which were given to [[Native Americans in the United States|native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/541734 |first=Adrienne |last=Mayor |authorlink=Adrienne Mayor |year=1995 |title=The Nessus Shirt in the New World: Smallpox Blankets in History and Legend |jstor=541734 |journal=Journal of American Folklore |volume=108 |issue=427 |pages=54–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Well documented examples include the [[Siege of Fort Pitt#Biological warfare involving smallpox|tainted blankets gifted to Indians at Fort Pitt]] in 1763.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

'''''The Prophet Isaiah''''' is one of the seven [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s painted by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] master [[Michelangelo]] (c. 1542–1545) on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is in [[Vatican Palace]], in the [[Vatican City]]. Elements of this [[fresco]] have inspired various artists, including [[Caravaggio]] and [[Norman Rockwell]] in his famous [[Rosie the Riveter]] illustration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/journey/rosie-transcript.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular [[fresco]] figure is painted fourth on the right from the side of the [[High Altar]]. Michelangelo's imagining bursts with movement, as [[Isaiah]]'s cloak swirls around him. The colors in the portrayal – especially after the restoration – strike us as cool and luminous. The figure holds a distinctive blue book to his side, perhaps a depiction of the biblical [[Book of Isaiah]].

This painting has been held in particularly high regard by critics. Vasari said of it: "Anyone who studies this figure, copied so faithfully from nature, the true mother of the art of painting, will find a beautifully composed work capable of teaching in full measure all the precepts to be followed by a good painter".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari 1568.&lt;/ref&gt; If compared to [[Raphael]]'s [[The Prophet Isaiah (Raphael)|imagining of the same figure]], Michelangelo's portrayal seems far more fluid and less muscular, as well as brighter in color.

'''''The Prophet Jonah''''' is one of the seven [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s painted by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] master [[Michelangelo]] (c. 1542–1545) on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is in [[Vatican Palace]], in the [[Vatican City]].

This particular [[fresco]] is painted above the [[High Altar]], as the person of [[Jonah]] is of prophetic significance in [[Christianity]]. Behind the figure of Jonah, Michelangelo has painted a large fish, a reference to the fact that in the Book of Jonah, Jonah is swallowed by one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17880">'''Richmond Artists Association (RAA)''' (1955-2005) was a twentieth-century incorporated organization of artists active in Virginia well into the 21st century. Organizational plans began in 1955, and RAA was founded and started building up its membership during 1955-1965, securing its first certificate of incorporation in 1956. Artist/lawyer Westwood Winfree was the first president. RAA was allied with the Richmond Federated Arts Council, Arts Council of Richmond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Council of Richmond|url=http://www.richmondarts.org/|website=www.richmondarts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists Equity Association, and the [[Southern Arts Federation|Southern Arts Association]]. The group brought to Richmond the show ''Three Modern Painters: Hartley, Feininger, Beckmann'', featuring the art of [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Lyonel Feininger]], and [[Max Beckmann]] in January 6–27, 1957 and ''[[Max Ernst]] Works on Paper'' in 1968. The RAA remained active until 2005 when some of the membership merged with another art organization to form the Richmond Metropolitan Artists Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association|url=http://www.metrorichmondart.com/|website=www.metrorichmondart.com|accessdate=27 May 2016|quote=Looking for ways to display their artworks and introduce Richmond to contemporary fine art, a group of full time art instructors and other professional artists from Richmond Professional Institute (now Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts) started the area's very first art organization. . . . The Richmond Artists Association has been a leader in encouraging and showcasing all types of art throughout the community. In the fall of 2005, members of the Richmond Artists Association and the Metropolitan Artists Association met and decided to join together to form the Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers and Members of RAA==
[[Theresa Pollak]], a teacher and founder of the art departments at both the [[University of Richmond]] and [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (also known as RPI, an extension of the [[College of William and Mary]] which became the [[Virginia Commonwealth University|Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts]]) was Vice President of the Richmond Artists' Association from 1958-1959. In 1978, she became a lifetime Honorary Member and frequent exhibitor in the group's juried shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://gallery.library.vcu.edu/exhibits/show/remembering-theresa-pollak/about-theresa-pollak/later-years&lt;/ref&gt; Other presidents of RAA after Westwood Winfree were Barbara Kennedy (1963-1964), Thomas Gay, Jr. (1964-1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas B.

==Exhibitions==

In 1963 the Petersburg Area Art League featured Richmond Artists' Association  member Helen S. Hull in one of their exhibitions, and she presented a critique session for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portrait Artist to Give Critique|publisher=The Progress-Index|date=September 24, 1963|location=Petersburg, Virginia|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAA members were frequent exhibitors in the juried and curated shows of  the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Women's Caucus for Art]], and local galleries such as Schindler Gallery, Scott-McKennis Gallery, [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace]], 1708, Uptown, Shockoe Bottom Arts Center, and [[Art6]].

In 1992 Baylor Nichols presented a show at [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace Gallery]] on Broad Street in Richmond, a gallery founded in [[Shockoe Slip]] by members also affiliated with RAA. The Richmond Artists' Association was one of the sponsors of the national book art show ''Art ex Libris'' shown at [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia|Artspace]], and several member artists contributed art to the exhibition.

A favorite public exhibition site for RAA was the Gellman Room gallery space at the [[Richmond Public Library (United States)|Richmond Public Library]], presenting juried member shows and receptions there from 1977-1983. It was usual to invite a well-known artist, often artists-in-residence or visiting artists from the [[University of Richmond]] or [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] to act as juror and to give in the library's auditorium a follow-up lecture/critique about their choices. Exhibitions by RAA members began in 2004 in a hall leading to the chambers of U.S. District [[D. Dortch Warriner|Judge D. Dortch Warriner]] at the [[United States Courthouse]] in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The arts go to court|publisher=Richmond News-Leader|date=September 16, 1982|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also early annual public exhibitions of members' art at the [[Carillon, Richmond, Virginia|Carillon in Richmond, Virginia]], [[Thalhimers]], and [[Miller &amp; Rhoads]]. The ''35th Anniversary Show'' of RAA was held in 1992 in the gallery of Richmond's [[Crestar Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yevich|first1=Courtney C.|title=Special Collection 09(SC-09): Records of the Richmond Artists' Association, 1955-2005|website=Finding Aids to Personal Papers and Special Collections in the VMFA Artchives|publisher=VMFA Archives|accessdate=27 May 2016|format=4 cubic feet|quote=The material highlights RAA's growth and achievements over five decades, including exhibitions at the [[Richmond International Airport]]. Several files highlight the RAA's relationship with other arts organizations, especially the Federated Arts Council of Richmond.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and sponsorships==

In 1955-1960 RAA presented a ''Festival of the Arts Summer Show''.

From February 1 to March 1, 1964 RAA sponsored the exhibition of [[Hans Hoffmann]] and his students held at the [[Carillon, Richmond, Virginia|Carillon]] in Richmond's [[Byrd Park]] and [[Maymont]] area. Entitled ''Hans Hofmann and his students 1963-1964'', this was a nationally circulating exhibition of 58 works of art by 51 artists organized by William Seitz for the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

In 1976 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its founding, RAA published an edition of original postcards by its members, a copy of which is archived in James Branch Cabell Library special collections at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Exhibit, card project start year with innovation|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 12, 1986|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=J-4|quote=The Richmond Artists Association Post Card Project is an entirely different, though equally unique, venture. . . . Most [cards] are very true to the individual artist's work, and anyone who has followed the Richmond Artists Association through the years will surely recognize many of the artists even without looking at the list of names.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1993, RAA sponsored a trip for members to see the [[Barnes collection|Barnes Collection]] and to visit the [[National Gallery]] in Washington, DC.

==Late history, dissolution, and merger of the RAA==

Upon the dissolution of the Richmond Artists Association, a group of former members in 2005 merged with the Metropolitan Artists Association (which had evolved and grown from the West End Art Alliance) to become the Metropolitan Richmond Artists Association (MRAA).

'''Shane Warne: The Musical''' is a musical comedy by [[Eddie Perfect]] based on the life of Australian [[cricket]]er [[Shane Warne]]. [[The Daily Telegraph]] described the musical as "a warts-and-all account of the spin bowler's controversy-laden career and roller-coaster personal life set to soul, rock, opera, gospel music – and even a bit of Bollywood."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malkin|first=Bonnie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/3699759/Shane-Warne-backs-Musical-based-on-his-life.html|title=Shane Warne backs musical based on his life|date=10 December 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The musical consists of two acts: the first act covering Warne's aborted [[Australian rules football]] career, his marriage and his rise to success as a Test cricketer while the controversial issues that Warne was involved in; such as his drug offence, infidelity and the [[John the bookmaker controversy]] feature in the second act. The musical finishes with a chorus "Everyone's a little bit like Shane".&lt;ref name="IndependentReview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/warnes-life-flashes-before-his-eyes--to-music-1060773.html|title=Warne's life flashes before his eyes – to music|last=Boztas|first=Senay|date=10 December 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical contains a series of songs about various incidents in Warne's life both on and off the cricket field, including:
*"The Tale Of Warne";
*"Run";
*"Get Offa The Couch";
*"How do you spell success? [[Australian Institute of Sport|AIS]]";
*"We're Going There";
*"Piss It All Away";
*"Hollywood";
*"[[Ball of the Century|The Ball]]";
*"Payin' Attention Now";
*"Dancing with the Stars";
*"We Never Cross The Line";
*"The Away Game";
*"Is The Sun The Moon?";
*"I'm Coming Home";
*"Shine Like Shane";
*"What About That, Shane?";
*"The Ashes";
*"Bunny in the headlights" (about [[Daryll Cullinan]]); and
*"What an SMS I’m in".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5544840.ece|title=Singing with Shane Warne|last=Gruber|first=Fiona|date=19 January 2009|work=[[The Times Literary Supplement]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
After five years of solo cabaret shows, Perfect had wanted to write a full-scale musical.  Seeking a subject, Perfect reflected that: "with every headline I read about Warnie, came the realisation that here was a simple yet complicated, positive yet flawed, honest but naive, charming, philandering, freakishly talented and endlessly divisive man. And that, I thought, is a great character."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/comedy/features/4015/shane-warne-the-musical-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] presented a work-in-progress showing on 17 June 2007 at the Dunstan Playhouse, [[Adelaide Festival Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/71254&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2008 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] included a further showing at the [[Hi Fi Bar and Ballroom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/85842&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The full Australian production, directed by [[Neil Armfield]] with choreography by [[Gideon Obarzanek]] and with Perfect in the title role, opened at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]] on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/as-musical-fodder-king-of-spin-faces-the-first-test/2008/10/18/1223750404904.html|title=As musical fodder, king of spin faces the first test|last=Bailey|first=John|date=19 October 2008|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It toured to the [[Regal Theatre]] in Perth from 18 March 2009 and the [[Enmore Theatre]] in Sydney from 15 May 2009.

A 2013 revision included a new beginning and ending, new scenes and a revised structure, four new songs and new characters including Liz Hurley.  It played short seasons in June for the Adelaide Cabaret Festival at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Adelaide|Her Majesty’s Theatre]], then at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]] in Melbourne.  This production, directed by Simon Phillips, had a cast that included Perfect, [[Lisa McCune]], [[Shane Jacobson]] and [[Christie Whelan|Christie Whelan-Browne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/musicals/warne-out-not-even-a-halfchance-20130613-2o6g0.html|title=Warne out? Not even a half-chance|last=Mathieson|first=Craig|date=14 June 2013|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cast album was recorded during the season at Hamer Hall and released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://castalbums.org/recordings/Shane-Warne-The-Musical-2013-Concert-Cast/28211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While initially suspicious of the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/shane-warne-the-musical-1048567.html|title=Shane Warne: The Musical|last=Marks|first=Kathy|date=3 December 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warne later gave his approval after watching the show, saying "I think Eddie and his team have written the musical in a respectful and sympathetic way, and that they have captured my fun, larrikin side."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

The musical has been able to draw an audience that would not normally attend musicals with Perfect saying "You see young blokes making their way to their seats carrying armfuls of beers for their mates, just like they do at the cricket. It's like Reformation theatre when people were buying oranges to throw at the actors – why shouldn’t they have fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=289963|title=Warne musical draws the blokes|date=2 February 2009|work=[[Daily Dispatch]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the musical have been mainly positive.
*''[[Herald Sun]]'': "[The musical] is a wild, funny, outrageous, and by the end, surprisingly moving account of the champion spin bowler's life so far. [...] Among the fun, there's genuine respect for [Warne's] enormous talent but it doesn't gloss over his personal failings."&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24753094-2902,00.html |title=Wicked wicket ways of Shane Warne: The Musical |last=Vickery |first=Colin |date=5 December 2008 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=6 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207162927/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24753094-2902,00.html |archivedate=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Independent]]'' "The mid-field marriage of a likeable star, fake bowling, plenty of sporting puns, and a moderate raunch factor had the crowds chuckling and clapping along. [...] [The musical makes] his life an appealingly debauched song and dance, playing with musical styles from nicely-harmonized gospel to gangsta rap."&lt;ref name="IndependentReview" /&gt;
*''Australian Stage'': "The story is thin, the songs are wordy and the sound wasn’t great, so many of the lyrics were lost. [...] Without wanting to cut down a tall poppy, there are certainly holes in the script and score. But who cares!? The performances by the ensemble cast are brilliant, the packed audience loved it, the upfront ''this-is-what-I-am-and-who-gives-a-shit-what-you-think-about-me'' attitude (reflecting Shane's own character) is refreshing, the show will bring in thousands of audience-goers who love sport and Shane, but rarely go to the theatre (which is fantastic), so what more can a new Australian musical do?"&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/melbourne/shane-warne-the-musical-2131.html|title=Shane Warne: The Musical|last=Kooperman|first=Paul|date=13 December 2008|work=Australian Stage Online|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gideon Haigh]], ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Perfect's vision is an almost unimprovable mingling of satire and homage, cheek and deference, music and comedy."&lt;ref name="HaighGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/dec/12/shane-warne-the-musical|title=Warne takes centre stage again as spinner proves Perfect vehicle for satire|last=Haigh|first=Gideon|date=12 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3041">In the [[visual arts]], '''shape''' is a flat, enclosed area of an artwork created through lines, textures, colours or an area enclosed by other shapes such as triangles, circles, and squares.&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;[http://www.niu.edu/art/foundations/site/Vocabulary.htm  NIU School of Art Vocabulary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624191040/http://www.niu.edu/art/foundations/site/Vocabulary.htm |date=2004-06-24 }} URL accessed December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a '''form''' can refer to a three-dimensional composition or object within a three-dimensional composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stewart | page = 381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, it is an enclosed space, the boundaries of which are defined by other elements of art. Shapes are limited to two dimensions: length and width.

== Form ==
A form is an artist's way of using elements of art, principles of design, and media. Element of art that is three-dimensional and encloses space. Like a shape, a form has length and width, but it also has depth. Forms are either geometric or free-form.

==Categories==

===Geometric and organic===
''Geometric shapes'' are precise edged and mathematically consistent curves,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} they are pure forms and so consist of circles, squares, spirals, triangles, while ''geometric forms'' are simple volumes, such as cubes, cylinders and pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stewart | pages = 378–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generally dominate architecture, technology, industry and crystalline structures.

In contrast, ''organic shapes'' are free-form, unpredictable and flowing in appearance. These shapes, as well as ''organic forms'', visually suggest the natural world of animals, plants, sky, sea, etc... The addition of organic shapes to a composition dominated by geometric structures can add unpredictable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stewart | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bell Shaped Flowers.jpg|thumb|Bell-shaped flowers]]

===Positive and negative===
A positive shape is a shape, that has details inside it, such as an outline of a human, with body features. Contrarily, a negative shape is a shape without any details; it's just an outline.

'''Squaring the square''' is the problem of [[tessellation|tiling]] an integral square using only other integral squares. (An '''integral square''' is a [[square (geometry)|square]] whose sides have [[integer]] length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with [[squaring the circle]]. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set.  The most studied restriction is that the squaring be '''perfect''', meaning that the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is '''squaring the plane''', which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.

== Perfect squared squares ==

[[File:Smith diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|Smith diagram of a rectangle]]

A "perfect" squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.

It is first recorded as being studied by  [[R. Leonard Brooks|R. L. Brooks]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C. A. B. Smith]], [[Arthur Harold Stone|A. H. Stone]] and [[W. T. Tutte]] at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938.
They transformed the square tiling into an equivalent [[electrical circuit]] — they called it "Smith diagram" — by considering the squares as [[resistor]]s that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and [[circuit decomposition]] techniques to that circuit.  The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.

The first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by [[Roland Sprague]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-games5 |title=5. Towards a theory for combinatorial games |website=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Gardner]] published an extensive article written by [[W. T. Tutte]] about the early history of squaring the square in his [[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|mathematical games column]] in November 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squaring.net/history_theory/brooks_smith_stone_tutte_II.html|title=Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte, II|author=|date=|website=www.squaring.net|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Squaring the square.svg|right|thumb|Lowest-order perfect squared square]]

== Simple squared squares ==

A "simple" squared square is one where no subset of the squares forms a rectangle or square, otherwise it is "compound".

In 1978, A. J. W. Duijvestijn discovered a simple perfect squared square of side 112 with the smallest number of squares using a computer search. His tiling uses 21 squares, and has been proved to be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectSquareDissection.html|title=Perfect Square Dissection|first=Weisstein, Eric|last=W.|date=|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This squared square forms the logo of the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]].

Duijvestijn also found 2 simple perfect squared squares of sides 110 but each comprising 22 squares. T.H. Willcocks found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these 3 are the smallest perfect squared squares in terms of side length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squared Squares; Perfect Simples, Perfect Compounds and Imperfect Simples|url=http://squaring.net/sq/ss/ss.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perfect compound squared square with the fewest squares was discovered by T.H. Willcocks in 1946 and has 24 squares; however, it was not until 1982 that Duijvestijn, [[Pasquale Joseph Federico]] and P. Leeuw mathematically proved it to be the lowest-order example.&lt;ref&gt;"Compound Perfect Squares", By A. J. W. Duijvestijn, P. J. Federico, and P. Leeuw,  Published in [http://www.maa.org/pubs/monthly.html American Mathematical Monthly] Volume 89 (1982) pp 15-32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mrs. Perkins's quilt ==

When the constraint of all the squares being different sizes is relaxed, a squared square such that the side lengths of the smaller squares do not have a common divisor larger than 1 is called a "Mrs. Perkins's quilt".  In other words, the [[greatest common divisor]] of all the smaller side lengths should be 1.

The '''Mrs. Perkins's quilt problem''' is to find a Mrs. Perkins's quilt with the fewest pieces for a given {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} square.

A '''cute number''' means a positive integer&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|n}} such that some square admits a dissection into {{mvar|n}} squares of no more than two different sizes, without other restrictions.  It can be shown that aside from 2,3, and 5, every positive integer is cute.&lt;ref name="JBPJ"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry, JB|author2=Taylor, PJ|title=Challenge! 1999 - 2006 Book 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGwGvV4yZVMC&amp;pg=PA84|publisher=Australian Mathematics Trust|isbn=978-1-876420-23-9|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Squaring the plane ==

[[File:squaring_the_plane.svg|thumb|200px|Tiling the plane with different integral squares using the Fibonacci series
&lt;div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em"&gt;1. Tiling with squares with Fibonacci-number sides is almost perfect except for 2 squares of side 1.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em"&gt;2. Duijvestijn found a 110-square tiled with 22 different integer squares.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em"&gt;3. Scaling the Fibonacci tiling by 110 times and replacing one of the 110-squares with Duijvestijn's perfects the tiling.&lt;/div&gt;]]
In 1975, [[Solomon Golomb]] raised the question whether the whole plane can be tiled by squares, one of each integer edge-length, which he called the '''heterogeneous tiling conjecture'''. This problem was later publicized by Martin Gardner in his [[Scientific American]] column and appeared in several books, but it defied solution for over 30 years.

In ''Tilings and Patterns'', published in 1987, [[Branko Grünbaum]] and G. C. Shephard stated that in all perfect integral tilings of the plane known at that time, the sizes of the squares [[exponential growth|grew exponentially]]. For example, the plane can be tiled with different integral squares, but not for every integer, by recursively taking any perfect squared square and enlarging it so that the formerly smallest tile now has the size of the original squared square, then replacing this tile with a copy of the original squared square.

In 2008 James Henle and Frederick Henle proved that this, in fact, can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = Frederick V. | last2 = Henle | first2 = James M. | year = 2008 | title = Squaring the plane | journal = American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 3–12 | jstor=27642387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their proof is constructive and proceeds by "puffing up" an L-shaped region formed by two side-by-side and horizontally flush squares of different sizes to a perfect tiling of a larger rectangular region, then adjoining the square of the smallest size not yet used to get another, larger L-shaped region. The squares added during the puffing up procedure have sizes that have not yet appeared in the construction and the procedure is set up so that the resulting rectangular regions are expanding in all four directions, which leads to a tiling of the whole plane.

== Cubing the cube ==

'''Cubing the cube''' is the analogue in three dimensions of squaring the square: that is, given a [[cube]] ''C'', the problem of dividing it into finitely many smaller cubes, no two congruent.

Unlike the case of squaring the square, a hard yet solvable problem, there is no perfect cubed cube and, more generally, no dissection of a [[Cuboid#Rectangular cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] ''C'' into a finite number of unequal cubes.

Suppose that there is such a dissection. Make a face of ''C'' its horizontal base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle ''R'' by the cubes which rest on it. Each corner square of ''R'' has a smaller adjacent edge square, and ''R'''s smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge. Therefore, the smallest square ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R'' is surrounded by ''larger'', and therefore ''higher'', cubes on all four sides. Hence the upper face of the cube on ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the smallest square in this dissection. The sequence of squares ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number. This contradicts our original supposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooks |first1=R. L.|last2=Smith|first2=C. A. B. |last3=Stone |first3=A. H. |last4=Tutte |first4=W. T. |year=1940 |title=The dissection of rectangles into squares |journal=[[Duke Mathematical Journal|Duke Math.

&lt;/ref&gt;

If a 4-dimensional [[hypercube]] could be perfectly hypercubed then its 'faces' would be perfect cubed cubes; this is impossible. Similarly, there is no solution for all cubes of higher dimensions.

'''Systems-oriented design''' ('''S.O.D.''') uses [[system thinking]] in order to capture the [[complexity]] of [[system]]s addressed in [[Design|design practice]]. The main mission of S.O.D. is to build the [[designer]]s' own interpretation and implementation of systems thinking. S.O.D. aims at enabling systems thinking to fully benefit from [[design thinking]] and practice, and design thinking and practice to fully benefit from systems thinking. S.O.D. addresses design for human activity systems, and can be applied to any kind of design problem ranging from [[product design]] and [[interaction design]], through [[architecture]] to [[Decision making|decision making processes]] and policy design.

== Background ==
Design is getting more and more complex for a number of reasons, for example due to [[globalization]], need for [[sustainability]], and the introduction of new [[technology]] and increased use of [[automation]]. Many of the challenges designers meet today can be considered [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Rittel"&gt;Rittel, Horst, and Melvin Webber, 1973. "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning."
Policy Sciences 4: 155-169. {{cite web |url=http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100404/http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of a wicked problem include among others that there are no definitive formulation of the problem and that the solutions are never true-or-false, but rather better or worse.&lt;ref name="Rittel" /&gt; A traditional problem solving approach is not sufficient in addressing for such design problems. S.O.D. is an approach that addresses the challenges the designer faces when working with [[complex system]]s and wicked problems, providing tools and techniques which makes it easier for the designer to grasp the complexity of the problem at hand. With a systems-oriented approach towards design, the designer acknowledges that the starting point for the design process is constantly moving, and that "every implemented solution is consequential. It leaves "traces" that cannot be undone." (see Rittel and Webber's 5th property of wicked problems&lt;ref name="Rittel" /&gt;).

Designers are well suited to work with complexity and wicked problems for a number of reasons:
* They are trained and experienced in creative thinking and idea generation;
* They know how to synthesize solutions from complex and fuzzy material;
* Designers have an ability to visualize, which is an enormous advantage for understanding and communicating complexity.

S.O.D. emphasizes these abilities as central and seeks to further train the designer in systems thinking and systems practice as a skill and an art.

== Origins ==
Systems-oriented design builds on systems theory and systems thinking in order to develop practices for addressing complexity in design. Particularly influential is soft systems methodology (SSM), acknowledging conflicting worldviews and people's purposeful actions,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Checkland and John Polter, 2006. ''Learning For Action: A Short Definitive Account of Soft Systems Methodology, and its use Practitioners, Teachers and Students.'' Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a systems view on creativity. However, S.O.D. is inspired by critical systems thinking and approaches systems theories in an eclectic way transforming the thoughts of the different theories to fit the design process. The design disciplines build on their own traditions and have a certain way of working with problems, often referred to as ''[[design thinking]]''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The definition of design thinking is not completely agreed upon and the term is used somewhat differently by different people. There is currently considerable academic and business interest in developing further understanding of what design thinking is.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. Peter (1987). Design Thinking. Cambridge: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-68067-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brown, 2009. ''Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation''. HarperBusiness. {{ISBN|0-06-176608-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Cross, 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Berg Publishers {{ISBN|1-84788-636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''the design way''.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Nelson and Erik Stolterman, 2002. ''The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World : Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence''. Educational Technology Pubns {{ISBN|0-87778-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking is a creative process based around the "building up" of ideas. This style of thinking is one of the advantages of the designer and is the reason why simply employing one of the existing systems approach into design, like for example [[systems engineering]], is not found sufficient by the advocates of S.O.D.

Compared with other systems approaches, S.O.D. is less concerned with hierarchies and borders of systems, [[Scientific modelling|modelling]] and [[feedback loops]], and more focused on the whole fields of relations and patterns of interactions. S.O.D. seeks richness rather than simplification of the complex systems.

== Systems thinking in the design process ==
Important in the systems-oriented [[design process]] is to carry out activities in order to grasp the [[complexity]] of the [[system]] designed for, and to accommodate for a [[Creativity|creative process]] taking place. In order to gain the necessary understanding of the complex system, a comprehensive data capture and analysis phase is needed. [[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]]s play a vital role in the design process, both as a means to analyze and understand the information gathered, and in order to communicate. The obtained insight into the complex system is used to come up with solutions for the design problem.

Methods and techniques from other [[academic discipline|disciplines]] are used in order to understand the complexity of the system, including for example [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], [[risk analysis]], and [[Scenario|scenario thinking]]. Methods and concepts unique to S.O.D. include for example the Rich Design Space,&lt;ref&gt;Birger Sevaldson, 2008. ''Rich Design Research Space''. Form Akademisk. http://www.formakademisk.org/index.php/formakademisk/article/view/17&lt;/ref&gt; GIGA-mapping,&lt;ref&gt;Birger Sevaldson, 2011. ''GIGA-Mapping: Visualisation for complexity and systems thinking in design''. Paper presented at NORDES 2011, 30 May 2011. http://ocs.sfu.ca/nordes/index.php/nordes/2011/paper/view/409&lt;/ref&gt; and Incubation Techniques.

The Rich Design Space includes the physical space of the design studio with sketches, ideas, mood boards, plans etc. and the virtual digital design space of the design software, media like video and sound recording, traditional design techniques and even the social space created in the project. By paying attention to the richness of the design space, the design space can become a very efficient tool to maintain an overview of the complexity of the project all the way.

GIGA-mapping is the central tool for registering, analyzing and managing complexity in S.O.D.. It is used for systematizing and interrelating the information and knowledge obtained.

[[Incubation (psychology)|Incubation]] is one of the 4 proposed stages of [[creativity]]: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, J. (1945). ''The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field''. Princeton
University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation Techniques are techniques used by the designer in order to acquire the background knowledge needed for an incubation process to take place.

S.O.D. has proved valuable for designers to quickly acquire knowledge of a new domains, and to reveal unexpected parts of a system where a new design can be beneficial.

== Further development and applications ==
The concept of systems-oriented design was initially proposed by professor [[Birger Ragnvald Sevaldson|Birger Sevaldson]] at [[Oslo School of Architecture and Design|the Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO)]] in the context of the [[OCEAN Design Research Association|OCEAN design research network]]. The S.O.D. approach is currently under development through teaching and research projects, as well as through the work of design practitioners. AHO provides Master courses in Systems Oriented Design each term as part of their [[Industrial Design]] program. In these courses, design students are trained in using the tools and techniques of S.O.D. in projects with outside partners. Research projects in systems-oriented design are carried out at the Centre for Design Research&lt;ref&gt;Research related to the topic ''Systems'' carried out at AHO Centre for Design Research: http://www.designresearch.no/themes/systems&lt;/ref&gt; at AHO in order to develop the concept, methods and tools further. In 2016 the project Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://systemicapproachtoarchitecturalperformance.wordpress.com|title=Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance|author=|date=|website=Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was announced as an institutional cooperation between the Faculty of Art and Architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fua.tul.cz/en/|title=FUA - FAKULTA UMĚNÍ A ARCHITEKTURY|author=|date=|website=www.fua.tul.cz|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Technical University of Liberec]] and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. Its mission is to link the methodology of systems-oriented design with performance-oriented architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.performanceorienteddesign.net|title=Welcome to the Frontpage|author=|date=|website=www.performanceorienteddesign.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the case study Marie Davidova's project Wood as a Primary Medium to Architectural Performance.
The Oslo-based design consultancy Halogen (www.halogen.no) has used SOD extensively with a varied range of customers. They have suggested a typology of Gigamaps and contributed with other methodological developments.
Gigamapping and other SOD methods are used by a growing range of businesses and educational institutions.

The '''Tara Brooch''' is a [[Celtic brooch]] of the [[pseudo-penannular]] type, made in 650 to 750 AD. It was found in Ireland in 1850, but despite its name not at [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] but likely near [[Bettystown]]. The name by which it became known was attached to the brooch by the jeweller who purchased it, as a marketing ploy for the copies they made. The brooch was exhibited internationally and was one of the artifacts that fuelled the [[Celtic Revival]] in the mid-19th century. It is now on display in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin.

The National Museum of Ireland describes it as follows: "...[T]he Tara Brooch can be considered to represent the pinnacle of early medieval Irish metalworkers’ achievement. Each individual element of decoration is executed perfectly and the range of technique represented on such a small object is astounding."&lt;ref name="NMI"/&gt;

==Description==
The brooch has a diameter of 8.7 cm and the pin has a length of 32 cm. It is made of cast and [[silver-gilt|gilt silver]], decorated on both front and rear. On the front are fine gold filigree panels depicting animal and abstract motifs, separated by studs of glass, enamel and amber. The back is flatter than the front, and the decoration is cast. The motifs consist of scrolls and triple spirals. Attached to the brooch by a swivel attachment is a silver chain made from plaited wire. The swivel consists of animal heads framing two small cast glass human heads.&lt;ref name="NMI"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.ie/Archaeology/Exhibitions/Current-Exhibitions/The-Treasury/Gallery-1-Iron-Age-to-12th-Century/Tara-Brooch-(1)|title=Tara Brooch|publisher=National Museum of Ireland| date=|first= |last= |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catalogue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=Julia|last2=Hunter(eds.)|first2=Fraser|title=Celts - art and identity|publisher=British Museum|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7141-2836-8|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187}}

==Discovery==
Although the brooch is named after the [[Hill of Tara]], traditionally seen as the seat of the [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]], the Tara Brooch has no connection to either the Hill of Tara or the High Kings of Ireland. The brooch was supposedly found in August 1850 on the beach at Bettystown, near [[Laytown]], [[County Meath]], some 50&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Dublin and about 25 kilometers from Tara. The finder, a peasant woman (or her two sons), claimed to have found it in a box buried in the sand, though it is likely that it was found inland and she claimed it was found at the beach to avoid a legal claim by the landowner. It was sold to a dealer and then to the Dublin jeweler, G. &amp; S. Waterhouse, who were already producing [[Celtic Revival]] jewellery and who renamed it the "Tara Brooch" to increase its public appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of the brooch's origins and discovery vary – see [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/tara.html Exhibition image and description]
, also Lynch, Michelle, [http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-01-25/goods_travel.php "Delicate Irish Treasure"] in ''NOW'' magazine, 25–31 January 2007, V. 26 N. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catalogue"/&gt;{{rp|244}}

The brooch was made in many pieces, with much of the decoration on small "trays" or panels which were then fixed into place. When it was found only one panel of decoration was missing, but several more have since disappeared, apparently before it entered the collection of the [[Royal Irish Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=82803&amp;partid=1 British Museum] replica brooch.&lt;/ref&gt; who later transferred their collection of antiquities to the new National Museum.

==Reception in the 19th century==
Celtic Revival jewellery had become very fashionable in the 1840s. Waterhouse used the Tara Brooch as the centre of displays of his replicas and imitations of Celtic brooches in his Dublin shop, also exhibiting it at [[The Great Exhibition]] in London in 1851 and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]], as well as the Dublin exhibition visited by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1853. Victoria liked these Celtic brooches and purchased a facsimile of the Tara Brooch at the Great Exhibition. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] had already bought two similar pieces for her when the two of them visited Dublin in 1849. Waterhouse had invented the brooch's name, choosing to link it to the site associated with the [[High King]]s of Ireland, "fully aware that this would feed the Irish middle-class fantasy of being descended from them".&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 444; British Museum: Waterhouse replica of the Tara Brooch, see note above.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the brooch was sold to the royal Irish Academy. By the 1870s, "Tara brooch" had become a generic term for Celtic Revival brooches, some of which were by then being made by Indian workshops for export to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catalogue"/&gt;{{rp|244–5}}

[[File:La Chasse au loup et au renard - Rubens.jpg|thumb|340px]]
'''''The Wolf and Fox Hunt''''' is a c.1616 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] now held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]. It shows mounted and walking hunters chasing two wolves and three foxes. It marks the beginning of an intensive creative phase in which Rubens focuses on the theme of hunting.

''The Wolf and Fox Hunt'' is the first painting by Rubens when he created a market for a new form of art. This is one of the many paintings of very large hunting scenes painted on a canvas. The painting was originally trimmed from the top and the left side as it was too big and it would not fit in any of the houses of the princes. The wolves in the painting are his own creation and work but overall the painting was completed with assistance. 

This painting was considered to be a modern replacement for tapestries.

A '''Thongdrel''' (alt. '''throngdrel''') is a large [[appliqué]] religious image normally only unveiled during  ''[[tsechu]]s'', the main religious festivals in [[Bhutan]].  They are the largest form of  ''[[thangka]]'' paintings in the tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].  Thongdrels typically depict a seated [[Guru Rinpoche]] surrounded by holy beings in a composition that, unlike most smaller thangkas, is in a "landscape" format, somewhat wider than it is tall.

Thongdrels are composed of several layers, mostly of silk.  These begin with a backing, then the image itself, made up of appliqué pieces sewn to a background.  Finally there is a yellow drape that covers and protects it when not on display.  Thongdrels are stored rolled up.  Thongdrels are displayed once a year as the highlight of the tsechu festival of a district or ''[[dzongkhag]]'' (although not every district has a thongdrel).  Typically they are displayed on the last day of the tsechu. The painting is not allowed to be struck by the direct rays of the sun, thus it may be unfurled at around 3:00 in the morning and rolled back up by 7:30 AM.  

Usually the architecture of the [[dzong]] provides a wall with access above, down which they may be unrolled, but sometimes metal hanging frames may be used. Major Tibetan centres have structures built into the defensive walls or other buildings specifically designed to give a large space for the display of festival thangkas. 

The mere viewing of the unfurled thongdrel is said to cleanse the viewer of sin.  They may also be exhibited at other important occasions such as royal coronations, when the thongdrel from a number of monasteries may be transported to appear.

A '''turnaround''' or '''turnaround deal''' is an arrangement in the [[film industry]] whereby the production costs of a project which one [[film studio|studio]] has developed are declared a loss on the company's tax return, thereby preventing the studio from exploiting the property any further. The rights can then be sold to another studio in exchange for the cost of development plus interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Murky Side of Movie Rights |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-23 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/business/media/24steal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Cieply defined the term in ''The New York Times'' as "arrangements under which producers can move a project from one studio to another under certain conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Studio War Involving ‘Watchmen’ Heats Up |author=Michael Cieply |date=2008-08-29 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/movies/30watc.html |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*The turnaround of ''[[The Boondock Saints]]'' is documented in ''[[Overnight]]'', a 2003 documentary which mainly focuses on the perspective of how director [[Troy Duffy]] "fell" in Hollywood.
*The 1993 film ''My Life's in Turnaround'', starring [[Martha Plimpton]] and [[Phoebe Cates]], tells the story of two friends who attempt to sell the story of their lives to a variety of studios.
*The 2012 film ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' uses several references to the film that was faked for the [[Canadian Caper|1980 CIA Iranian hostage extraction operation]] also titled ''Argo'' as being "in turnaround".&lt;ref&gt;David Edelstein interviewed by Terri Gross on review of Argo: (2012-10-12) https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=162785168&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests began in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat and later [[knelt]] during the anthem, before his team's [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] games of [[2016 NFL season|2016]].&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl|title=A timeline of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and the NFL players who joined him|last1=Sandritter|first1=Mark|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the following seasons, members of various NFL and other sports teams have engaged in similar silent protests. On September 24, 2017, the NFL protests became more widespread when over 200 players sat or knelt in response to President [[Donald Trump]]'s calling for owners to "fire" the protesting players.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/24/donald-trump-nfl-player-protests-national-anthem-week-3-response/697609001/|title=NFL player protests sweep league after President Donald Trump's hostile remarks|work=USA Today|access-date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning behind protesting the U.S. national anthem and kneeling ==
{{further|U.S. national anthem protests}}
It is a tradition in the United States to play "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", the [[national anthem]], before sporting events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the [[United States Code]], those present should stand at attention with right hand over heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|36|301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Title 36 United States Code: § 301.

The people of the United States is divided on the intended meaning of the anthem.

Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate [[Eric Reid (American football)|Eric Reid]] say they choose to kneel during the anthem to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. "After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from [[Nate Boyer]], a retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem as a peaceful protest," said Reid. "We chose to kneel because it's a [[respect]]ful gesture.

My father served 25 years. When he dies, he's going to be wrapped in an American flag. But my dad is also out of the Army, and he drives trucks all over the country, and he's a black man everywhere he goes, and sometimes he has racial incidents still today. That doesn't protect him, just because he served our country. And I think that's important."&lt;ref&gt;

In September 2017, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], speaking at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, said NFL owners should fire players who kneel during the national anthem, and encouraged fans to walk out. Trump tried to use his position at the administration to advise NFL owners to say "Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired.

In May 2018 on an in interview President Donald Trump went as far to say "You have to stand proudly for the national anthem, or you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there.

Trump applauded the new policy that NFL players must either stand for the anthem or stay back in the locker room, but felt that this policy was not strict enough. &lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt; Trump even wanted players to not be able to express political views even when off the field. &lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt;

He explained his decision to switch was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while still protesting during the anthem.

On October 16, 2017 Colin Kaepernick filed a grievance for collusion against NFL owners.

In Week 8 at Seattle, the majority of the Texans players knelt during the anthem after Houston owner [[Bob McNair]] had commented about having the "inmates running the prison" during a league owner meeting regarding the ongoing protest. McNair had apologized, stating that he was not referring to the players, but rather to the "relationship between the league office and team owners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barshop|first=Sarah|title=Texans' Duane Brown on kneeling for anthem: Team felt sense of unity playing for each other|date=October 29, 2017|website=ESPN.com|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21215907/majority-houston-texans-players-kneeled-linked-arms-national-anthem|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030025608/http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21215907/majority-houston-texans-players-kneeled-linked-arms-national-anthem|archivedate=October 30, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Seth|last1=Wickersham|first2=Don|last2=Van Natta Jr.|title=Gaffes, TV ratings concerns dominated as NFL, players forged anthem peace|date=October 27, 2017|website=ESPN.com|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/21170410/gaffes-tv-ratings-concerns-dominated-nfl-players-forged-anthem-peace-league-meetings|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050500/http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/21170410/gaffes-tv-ratings-concerns-dominated-nfl-players-forged-anthem-peace-league-meetings|archivedate=October 29, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a Texans player had knelt during the anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Aaron|title=Texans' Duane Brown says Bob McNair meeting 'didn't go too well'|date=October 29, 2017|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Majority-of-Texans-kneel-for-national-anthem-12315599.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030132035/http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Majority-of-Texans-kneel-for-national-anthem-12315599.php|archivedate=October 30, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 preseason===
On May 23, 2018, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and all NFL team owners except for two owners that abstained from voting in a show of hand voting process, approved a new policy requiring all players to stand during the national anthem or be given the option to stay in the locker room during the national anthem. The vote took place without consulting the NFLPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Healy|first=John|title=NFL admits there was no official vote on national anthem policy, instead informal show of hands|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/nfl-admits-no-official-vote-national-anthem-policy-article-1.4009450|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=May 25, 2018|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any players from all NFL teams who protest the anthem while on the field will become subject to discipline from the league.

In disagreement with the policy, several players on the Super Bowl champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]] indicated they would decline an invitation from Trump to visit the [[White House]] on June 5, leading the President to rescind the offer the day before the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump calls off Eagles' White House visit over national anthem dispute|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/donald-trump-calls-off-eagles-white-house-visit-players-decline-invitation-232323202.html|publisher=Oath Inc.

On July 19, the NFL and the players association issued a joint statement that "no rules relating to the anthem will be issued for the next several weeks." This came after the [[Associated Press]] had reported earlier in the day that Miami team rules stated that improper anthem conduct could result in a player suspension of up to four games, more than some players receive for violating the [[NFL domestic violence policy|league's domestic violence policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Orr|first=Connor|title=The Five Hours That Forced the NFL to Reconsider Its Anthem Policy|date=July 20, 2018|website=SI.com|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/07/19/miami-dolphins-national-anthem-policy-rule-nfl-training-camp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721123241/https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/07/19/miami-dolphins-national-anthem-policy-rule-nfl-training-camp|archivedate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Trump tweeted that players should be suspended for one game the first time kneeling, and for the entire season without pay after a second offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Jenna|title=Donald Trump Suggests Players Kneeling for Anthem Should Be Suspended for Entire Season|date=July 20, 2018|website=SI.com|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/07/20/donald-trump-national-anthem-policy-players-kneel-no-pay-suspended|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721105831/https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/07/20/donald-trump-national-anthem-policy-players-kneel-no-pay-suspended|archivedate=July 21, 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle Reign FC]] and [[United States women's national soccer team|U.S. women's national soccer team]] player [[Megan Rapinoe]] knelt during the national anthem in a game on September 5, 2016, explaining that her decision was a "nod to Kaepernick and everything that he's standing for right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/sport/megan-rapinoe-colin-kaepernick-anthem-kneel/index.html|title=Megan Rapinoe takes knee in solidarity with Kaepernick|last=McKirdy|first=Euan|date=September 5, 2016|publisher=CNN|access-date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent match at the [[Washington Spirit]], Spirit owner Bill Lynch – anticipating Rapinoe's protest – moved the national anthem's performance without warning or notice to occur before the players' appearances on the pitch.

As a member of the U.S. women's national soccer team, Rapinoe also knelt before an international [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] against [[Thailand women's national football team|Thailand]] on September 16, despite public statements of disagreement with her protest methods issued before the match by the [[U.S. Soccer Federation]] and her coach [[Jill Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/09/15/megan-rapinoe-uswnt-thailand-national-anthem-kneels|title=USWNT's Megan Rapinoe kneels for national anthem before Thailand match|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=September 19, 2016|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Soccer proceeded to pass a policy that now requires all of its players to stand "respectfully" during the national anthem making it the first American sports league or governing body to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2017/3/6/14825652/united-states-soccer-national-anthem-policy-megan-rapinoe-protest-ban|title=U.S. Soccer banned Megan Rapinoe's national anthem protest without caring to understand it|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) have released a statement in September 2017 regarding any potential protests "The march of players, officials and children into our stadiums and singing of the anthem has been a pre-match tradition since our first game in 1996. The National Anthem provides our clubs and fans an important and time-honored opportunity to salute our country and stand up for its principles -- whether in the United States or in Canada."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20848575/rules-national-anthem-differ-sports-leagues&lt;/ref&gt; MLS to date, has yet to encounter national anthem protests.

The protest had supporters outside the U.S. as well: In an October 2017 match against [[Schalke 04]], players and staff of German football club [[Hertha BSC]] took the knee in solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2017/10/14/hertha-berlin-kneel-german-national-anthem-protest|title=Hertha Berlin players take knee during German anthem|last=Rapaport|first=Daniel|date=October 14, 2017|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herta BSC has a few American players on their roster.

On September 7, 2016, three volleyball players from [[West Virginia University Institute of Technology|West Virginia Tech]] knelt during the national anthem.&lt;ref name="kalea"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunderson|first1=Kalea|title=West Virginia Tech volleyball players kneel during national anthem|url=http://wchstv.com/news/local/west-virginia-tech-volleyball-players-kneel-during-national-anthem|date=September 7, 2016|publisher=ABC|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;

On October 1, at [[East Carolina University]], about 19 members of the band knelt, while about another two held the American flag during the national anthem at the beginning of the football game against the [[University of Central Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witn.com/content/news/395523401.html |title=ECU chancellor, Gov.

In September 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] stated that Kaepernick was "exercising his constitutional right" to protest. He went on: "I don't doubt his sincerity.

[[Trent Dilfer]] criticized Kaepernick. "The big thing that hit me through all this was this is a backup quarterback whose job is to be quiet, and sit in the shadows and get the starter ready to play Week 1," Dilfer said on ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]''.

''Not to be confused with maritime artist [[William John Huggins]] (1781-1845).''

'''William Huggins''' (May 1820 – 25 February 1884)&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Huggins, William (1820-1884)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[English people|English]] artist, from [[Liverpool]], who specialised in drawing animals.&lt;ref name=burlington&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burlington.co.uk/artist-biography/william-huggins.html|title=William Huggins|work=Burlington Paintings|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huggins was a member of the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=burlington/&gt; He enjoyed visiting [[Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie]], an animal circus, and the Liverpool [[Zoological Gardens]].&lt;ref name=leicestergalleries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestergalleries.com/index.pl?isa=Metadot::SystemApp::ArtistSearch;op=detail;artist=121;show_bio=1;printable=1|title=WILLIAM  HUGGINS Artist Biography|work=Peter Nahum|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huggins has been compared to fellow Liverpool artist [[George Stubbs]]&lt;ref name=leicestergalleries/&gt; and is known for keeping his house full of pets.&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1368904|title=William Huggins (1820-1884)|work=[[Christie's]]|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simfineart/&gt;

==Life==
William Huggins was born in Liverpool. His parents were called Samuel and Elizabeth. He received his first instruction in drawing at the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Mechanics' Institution]]. He won a prize for "Adam's Vision of the Death of Abel" and successfully entered work to be shown at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]] whilst fifteen years old.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He drew from life using the classes at the Academy of Arts or by sketching the animals in Liverpool's zoo.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He travelled further afield to see exotic animals at the unusual [[George Wombwell|Wombwell’s Travelling Menagerie]].&lt;ref name=simfineart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simfineart.com/paint/huggins.htm|title=Sim Fine Art, William Huggins (1820-1884)|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His animal work was admired and compared to [[George Stubbs|Stubbs]]. Huggins was magnanimous in acknowledging Stubbs' influence and this contrasts with a later comparison that was made with [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Landseer]] where Huggins felt insulted. Huggins pictures of exotic animals were much admired but they are noted for lack of background as Huggins never saw them in their own habitat.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
[[File:HugglesCatst.jpg|thumb|left|Lion and Lioness; a pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redfoxfineart.com/inventory_artist_detail.php?id=4000&amp;artist_id=7026 W. Huggins] (Red Fox Fine Art)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1845 Huggins changed his themes away from animals and chickens. His paintings were based on literary themes from Milton, Shelley and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser's]] "[[The Faerie Queene]]" and [[Thomas Moore|Moore's]] "Enchantress and Nourmahal"&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
[[File:Cattle watering 1871.jpg|thumb|right|Cattle watering (1871)]]
Huggins first exhibited "Androcles and the lion" at the [[Royal Academy]] and made successful entries from 1846 until he was in his seventies. In addition he showed his paintings at most of the major cities in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was influenced in his use of glazes by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who also had exhibitions there.&lt;ref name=leicestergalleries/&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=875122|title=Current and Forthcoming Exhibitions|work=|page=641|volume=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a full member of the Liverpool Academy in 1850 (resigning in 1856), but never became an [[Royal Academy|RA (Royal Academician)]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1861 Huggins moved to [[Chester]] where he lived with his brother, Samuel, until 1865. Huggins work at this time moved from animals to buildings (his brother, [[Samuel Huggins|Samuel]] was a notable architectural writer). He painted [[Chester Cathedral]] which his brother was to go on to defend when it was to be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Nicholson, ‘Huggins, Samuel (1811–1885)’, rev. Valerie Scott, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14050, accessed 2 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving his brother, he painted the "Stones of Chester, or Ruins of St. John's" (1874) and the "Salmon Trap on the Dee". He moved to [[Betws-y-Coed]] in 1876 so that he could paint landscapes. One painting that resulted was, "The Fairy Glen" which was exhibited in Liverpool in 1877.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Huggins eventually moved from Wales and settled in and died in the [[Cheshire]] village of [[Christleton]] on 25 February 1884,&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Albert Nicholson, ‘Huggins, William (1820–1884)’, rev. Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 ;online edn, Jan 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14052, accessed 2 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; just a year before his brother, [[Samuel Huggins|Samuel]].  The brothers were buried in [[St James' Church, Christleton]], and the headstone of their grave is a Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1187247|desc= Headstone of William Huggins, Churchyard of St.James|access-date= 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huggins' horses, cattle, and poultry pictures were his best and most characteristic work, good in drawing, and remarkable for brilliance of colour.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; "Tried Friends", purchased by the Liverpool corporation, illustrates his use of transparent glazes over a white ground. Huggins' preferred medium was painting on white millboard from pencil outlines.&lt;ref name=victorianweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/huggins/paintings/2.html|title=Barn Door Fowl (Rhode Island Reds) by William Huggins|author=Sally Burgess and Peter Nahum|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huggins portrait include one of the master of the [[Holcombe Hunt]], his brother Samuel and himself. He included his wife in "Aerial combat, the fight between the Eagle and the Serpent" which he painted in his literary phase and which illustrated [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley's]] "Revolt of Islam."

Huggins has nearly 60 paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Art UK bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to art-historian and gallery owner [[Rupert Maas]], "Huggins was an eccentric individual. He preferred the company of animals, especially chickens, than of his fellow men. He hated travelling through tunnels, and so would get off the train before Liverpool and walk the rest of the way home.  His epitaph, which he composed himself, read: 'A just and compassionate man who would neither tread on a worm, nor cringe to an Emperor'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/huggins/index.html |title=William Huggins |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=12 August 2001 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Züschen tomb''' ({{lang-de|Steinkammergrab von Züschen}}, sometimes also ''Lohne-Züschen'') is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near [[Fritzlar]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. Classified as a [[gallery grave]] or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (''hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in [[Central Europe]]. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]]. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric [[rock art]] elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Züschen and from tomb I at [[Warburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

== Discovery and excavation ==
The tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of [[sandstone]] blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a [[basalt]] outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the [[Chatti]], a local [[Iron Age]] tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the [[antiquarian]] Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]], still in 1894, by [[Johannes Boehlau]], former director of the State Museum at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Story of discovery from Boehlau &amp; von Gilsa 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of [[Marburg]].&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"&gt;Kappel 1990, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomb architecture ==
The rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 3; Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

A terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5&amp;nbsp;m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called ''Seelenloch'' (German for "soul hole"), of 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some [[ritual]], perhaps an [[Sacrifice|offering]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"/&gt; Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in [[France]], is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial [[tumulus]]. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human remains ==
The earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an [[Urnfield]] period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grave offerings ==
Most finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related [[Lohra (megalithic tomb)|Lohra tomb]] and collared bottles connected with the northern [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture]]. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called ''Giant Urn'' belongs to the later burial.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373; Kappel 1990, 6; W. Schwelnuß 1979: ''Wartberg-Gruppe und hessische Megalithik; ein Beitrag zum späten Neolithikum des Hessischen Berglandes'', Materialien zur Vor- und Frühgeschichte von Hessen, Bd. 4, Wiesbaden: Landesamt für Denkmalpflege, p. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock carvings ==
[[File:Züschen tomb2.JPG|thumb|300px|Carvings inside the tomb.]]
One of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373-5, Kappel 1990, 6-7; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-9&lt;/ref&gt; Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent ([[Bronze Age|Bronze]] or [[Iron Age]]) carvings at [[Valcamonica]] near [[Capo di Ponte]], [[Northern Italy]] and at [[Mont Bégo]] in the [[France|French]] part of the [[Ligurian Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;I. 1978: ''Steinkammergräber und Menhire in Nordhessen.'', ed. Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Kassel; 6-8, 11-23, also: E. Anati, 1983: Züschen (Kassel) e Anderlingen (Hannover), Germania: Rilievamento e studio dei monumenti megalitici; ''Bolletino del Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici'' 20; 132-135..&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols are normally assumed to reflect [[Neolithic]] [[ideology|ideological]] or [[religion|religious]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
A reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (''Hessisches Landesmuseum'') in [[Kassel]].

==Relationships with other sites==
Like any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150&amp;nbsp;m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent [[basalt]] dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4&amp;nbsp;km to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 375-7&lt;/ref&gt;
