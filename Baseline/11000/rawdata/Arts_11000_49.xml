'''''A Mathematician's Apology''''' is a 1940 essay by British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].  It concerns the [[Mathematical beauty|aesthetics of mathematics]]  with some personal content, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working [[mathematician]].

==Summary==
[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|left|In ''A Mathematician's Apology'', [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for mathematical beauty.]]
In the book's title, Hardy uses the word "[[Apologetics|apology]]" in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]''), not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness.

Hardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.
By devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, [[C. P. Snow]] describes the Apology as
"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again".
In Hardy's words, "Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done."

Secondly, at the start of the [[World War II]], Hardy, a committed [[pacifist]], wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an [[atheist]], and makes his justification not to [[God]] but to his fellow man.

One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world ([[pure mathematics]]) and, in particular, his own special field of [[number theory]].  Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless.  He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very "uselessness" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm.  On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the [[applied mathematics]] as either being "trivial", "ugly", or  "dull", and contrasts it with "real mathematics", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics.

Hardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] that "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the "queen of mathematics" because of that. What [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a "young man's game", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

==Critiques==
[[File:MathematiciansApology.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Cambridge University Press]])]]

Hardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the [[academia|academic]] culture of the universities of [[Cambridge]] and [[Oxford]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Some of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years." Since then number theory was used to crack German enigma codes and much later, figure prominently in [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wayback.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/jborwein/apaper.pdf|title=Experimental mathematician Jonathan Borwein's comments on the Apology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hardy's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use (proofs of [[Euclid's theorem|the infinitude of primes]] and of [[Square root of 2|the irrationality of the square root of two]]) still hold up.

The applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics, though; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did.

He considers that [[Rolle's theorem]] for example, though it is of some importance for [[calculus]], cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by [[Évariste Galois]] and other pure mathematicians.

==Life==

===Early years===
Abd ar-Rahman was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], the grandson of [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]], seventh independent [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] emir of [[al-Andalus]]. His parents were Abdullah's son Muhammad and Muzna (or Muzayna), a Christian concubine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/abd-al-rahman-iii/ Abd al-Rahman, III Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother was also a Christian, the royal infanta [[Onneca Fortúnez]], daughter of the captive king [[Fortún Garcés of Pamplona]]. Abd ar-Rahman was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen [[Toda of Pamplona]]. He is described as having "white skin, blue eyes and attractive face; good looking, although somewhat sturdy and stout. His legs were short, to the point that the stirrups of his saddle were mounted just one palm under it. When mounted, he looked tall, but on his feet he was quite short. He dyed his beard black.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Idhari]], ''Kitab al-Bayan''&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad was assassinated by his brother Al-Mutarrif, who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour Muhammad had gained in the eyes of their father Abdallah. Al-Mutarrif had accused Muhammad of plotting with the rebel [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], and Muhammad had been imprisoned. According to some sources, the emir himself was behind Muhammad's fall, as well as Al-Mutarrif's death in 895. Abd ar-Rahman spent his youth in his mother's harem. Al-Mutarrif's sister, known as ''al-Sayyida'' ("the Lady"), was entrusted with his education. She made sure that Abd ar-Rahman's education was conducted with some rigor.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hazm]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accession to throne===
Emir Abdallah died at the age of 72. Despite the fact that four of his sons (Aban, Abd al Rahman, Muhammad and Ahmad) were alive at the time of his death, all of them were passed over for succession. Abdallah instead chose as his successor his grandson, Abd al-Rahman III (the son of his first son). This came as no surprise, since Abdallah had already demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways, namely by allowing him to live in his own tower (something he did not allow for any of his sons), and allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions. Most importantly Abdallah gave Abd al-Rahman his ring, the symbol of power, when Abdallah fell ill prior to his death. Abd al-Rahman succeeded Abdallah the day after his death, 16 October 912.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Historiographers of the time, such as ''[[Al-Bayan al-Mughrib]]'' and the ''Crónica anónima de Abd al-Rahman III'', state that his succession was "without incident".  At the time, Abd al-Rahman was about 21 or 22 years old. He inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution, his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of Córdoba.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; To the north, the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was continuing its program of ''[[Reconquista]]'' in the [[Douro]] valley. To the south in [[Ifriqiya]], the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] had created an independent caliphate that threatened to attract the allegiance of the Muslim population, who had suffered under the harsh rule of Abdullah. On the internal front the discontented [[Muladi]] families (Muslims of Iberian origin) represented a constant danger for the Córdoban emir. The most powerful of the latter was Umar ibn Hafsun, who, from his impregnable fortress of [[Umar ibn Hafsun]], controlled much of eastern Al-Andalus.

From the very early stages of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman showed a firm resolve to quash the rebels of al-Andalus, consolidate centralized power, and reestablish internal order within the emirate. Within 10 days of taking the throne, he exhibited the head of a rebel leader in Cordoba.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; From this point on he led annual expeditions against the northern and southern tribes to maintain control over them. To accomplish his aims he introduced into the court the ''[[saqaliba]]h'', slaves of East European origin. The ''saqalibah'' represented a third ethnic group that could neutralize the endless strife between his subjects of Muslim [[Arabs|Arab]] heritage, and those of Muslim [[Berbers|Berber]] heritage.

[[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], a Jewish courtier of the king's court who served as financier to the king, wrote of the king's revenues on this wise:
{{quote|The revenue of the king [Abd ar-Rahman] amounts annually to 100,000 florins, this arising only from the income derived from the numerous merchants who come hither from various countries and isles. All their commerce and affairs must be subjected to my guidance, praised be the Almighty, who bestows his mercy upon me! The kings of the world no sooner perceive of the greatness of my monarch, than they hasten to convey to him presents in abundance. It is myself who am appointed to receive such presents, and at the same time to return rewards awarded to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahberet Menahem'' (ed. Herschell Filipowski), London &amp; Edinburgh 1854 (reprinted: Jerusalem 1987), in: ''Biography of the Author (the Celebrated Rabbi Menahem ben Saruk)'', p. 7; cf. Elkan Nathan Adler, ''Jewish Travellers'', Routledge:London 1931, pp. 22–36 [''vide'' Cambridge University Library, Taylor-Schecter Collection (T-S Misc.35.38)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early rule===
During the first 20 years of his rule, Abd ar-Rahman avoided military action against the northern Christian kingdoms, Asturias and the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. The Muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted. Those powerful families were supported by Iberians who were openly or secretly Christians and had acted with the rebels. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab aristocracy.&lt;ref name=wikisource&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abd-ar-Rahman|display=Abd-ar-Rahman s.v Abd-ar-Rahman III|volume=1|pages=31-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abd ar-Rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included Christians.

He first had to suppress the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. On 1 January 913 an army, led by the eunuch Badr, conquered the fortress of [[Écija]], at some {{convert|50|km}} from the capital. All the city's fortifications were destroyed, aside from the citadel, which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops. In the following spring, after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations, Abd ar-Rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm. His troops were able to recover the ''coras'' (provinces) of [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]] and [[Province of Granada|Granada]], while a cavalry detachment was sent to free [[Málaga]] from ibn Hafsun's siege. He also obtained the capitulation of [[Fiñana]] (in the modern [[province of Almería]]), after setting fire to its suburbs. Subsequently, he moved against the castle of [[Juviles]] in the [[Alpujarras]]. After devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource, he encircled it. Finding it difficult to bombard with catapults, he ordered the construction of a platform where his [[siege engine]]s could be mounted to greater effect, and cut the water supply. The Muladi defenders surrendered after a few days: their lives, apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded, were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir. The campaign continued in a similar vein, lasting for a total of ninety days. Abd ar-Rahman forced the defeated Muladi to send hostages and treasures to Córdoba, in order to secure their continued submission.

In the first year of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman took advantage of the rivalries between the [[Banu Hayyay]] lords of [[Seville]] and [[Carmona, Spain|Carmona]] to force them to submit. He initially sent a special corps (''hasam'') under Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hudayr, governor of Écija, to Seville, to obtain their submission. This attempt failed, but gained him the support of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hayyay, lord of Carmona, and a cousin of the Sevillan lord, Ahmad ibn Maslama. When the latter was surrounded by Umayyad troops, he sued for help to Ibn Hafsun, but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to Bobastro. He next went after the forts in the provinces of Elvira, [[Province of Granada|Granada]], and [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaen]], all of which were either directly or indirectly controlled by Hafsun.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Seville finally capitulated on 20 December 913. Ibn al-Mundir al-Qurays, a member of the royal family, was named governor of the city, while the Lord of Carmona obtained the title of [[vizier]]. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day, for Abd ar-Rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of Carmona. Muhammad was sent to prison, where he later met his death.

The region of [[Valencia]] submitted peacefully in 915.

Abd ar-Rahman's next objective was to quash the longstanding rebellion of Umar ibn Hafsun.

His troops left Córdoba on 7 May 914 and, after a few days, encamped before the walls of Balda (identified with today's [[Cuevas de San Marcos]]). His cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside, while the rest of the troopes moved to Turrus, a castle located in the present municipality of [[Algarinejo]], which was surrounded within five days, while its environs were also devastated.

The Umayyad army then moved to the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun, while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir, which was abandoned by the defenders, allowing Abd ar-Rahman's troops to secure a large booty. Then it was the turn of the castles of Olías and Reina. The latter fell after a violent fight, leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of Málaga, which he captured after one day. Abd ar-Rahman then turned and followed the coast by Montemayor, near [[Benahavís]], Suhayl ([[Fuengirola]]) and another castle called ''Turrus ''or ''Turrus Jusayn'' (identified by [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] as [[Ojén]]). He finally arrived at [[Algeciras]] on 1 June 914. He ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun from the [[Maghreb]]. Many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir. The rebellious castles near Algeciras surrendered as soon as the Cordoban army manifested itself.

Abd ar-Rahman launched three different campaigns against Ibn Hafsun (who died in 917) and his sons. Among them, Jafar ibn Hafsun held the stronghold of Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman ordered ravaged the city's countryside. Jafar, after two years of siege, escaped the city to ask for help in the northern Christian kingdoms. In the meantime Abd ar-Rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population, after promising them immunity, although 4,000 rebel men escaped in a night sally. The city surrendered on 2 August 932, after a siege of two years.

In 921 the Banu Muhallab of [[Guadix]] submitted, followed by those of [[Jerez de la Frontera]] and [[Cádiz]], as well as the trading republic of [[Pechina]] (922). In 927, Abd ar-Rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel [[Banu Qasi]], but was forced to break it off by the intervention of [[Jimeno Garcés of Pamplona]].

The last of Ibn Hafsun to fall was Hafs, who commanded his powerful fortress of Umar ibn Hafsun. Surrounded by Abd ar-Rahman's vizier Said ibn al-Mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city, he resisted the siege for six months,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; until he surrendered in 928 and had his life spared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Schreiber|title=Gli Arabi in Spagna|page=142|publisher=Garzanti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Levente and Algarve rebels===
The continued expeditions against the Hafsunids did not distract Abd ad-Rahman III from the situation of other regions in al-Andalus, which recognized him only nominally, if not being in open revolt. Most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a weak position, such as the governor of [[Évora]], who could not prevent the attack of the king of Galicia (future king of León), [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]], who captured the city in the summer of 913, taking back a sizable booty and 4,000 prisoners and massacring many Muslims.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In much of the eastern and western province, Abd ar-Rahman's authority was completely unrecognized. The lord of Badajoz, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, grandson of Abd ar-Rahman ibn Marwan al-Yilliqi, not only fortified his city against a possible attack from Ordoño, but also acted in complete independence from Córdoba. To avoid the fall of Évora into the hands of the Berber groups of the region, he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and lowered the walls, though a year later he decided to reconstruct it, giving its control to his ally Masud ibn Sa' dun al-Surunbaqi. The Algarve was dominated completely by a muladí coalition led by Sa'id ibn Mal, who had expelled the Arabs from [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], and the lords of [[Faro, Portugal|Ocsónoba]], Yahya ibn Bakr, and of [[Taifa of Niebla|Niebla]], Ibn Ufayr. [[Alcácer do Sal]] and [[Lisbon]] were under control of the [[Banu Dānis]].

The absence of royal authority enabled Ordoño II to easily campaign in this area, his main objective being the city of [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], in the summer of 915. Abd ar-Rahman III did not send an army and only several local Berber ''jefes'' offered some resistance which was ineffective.

In the next year, despite having defeated only some of the rebels,  Abd ar-Rahman III considered himself powerful enough to declare himself [[Caliph of Córdoba]] (16 January 929), effectively breaking his allegiance to, and ties with, the [[Fatimid]] and [[Abbasid]] caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/abd-ar-rahman-iii.htm Abd-ar-Rahman III] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217165547/http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/abd-ar-rahman-iii.htm |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The caliphate was thought only to belong to the Emperor who ruled over the sacred cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and his ancestors had until then been content with the title of emir. But the force of this tradition had weakened over time; and the title increased Abd ar-Rahman's prestige with his subjects, both in Iberia and Africa.&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; He based his claim to the caliphate on his Umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids.

Abd ar-Rahman's move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the Muslims in al-Andalus, as well as the protector of his Christian and Jewish subjects. The symbols of his new caliphate power were a scepter (''jayzuran'') and the throne (''sarir''). In the mint he had founded in November 928, Abd ar-Rahman started to mint gold dinars&lt;ref&gt;No gold Islamic coins had been found in Spain preceding Abd ar-Rahman III's reign. See Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and silver dirhams, replacing the "al-Andalus" title with his name.

In his new role of caliph, he achieved the surrender of [[Ibn Marwan]] of Badajoz in 930 as well as the surrender of the Banu Dānis of Alcácer do Sal. On the southern front, to counter the increasing Fatimid power in North Africa, abd ar-Rahmad ordered the construction of a fleet based in [[Almeria]]. The caliph helped the [[Maghrawa]] Berbers conquer [[Melilla]] (927), [[Ceuta]] (931)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and [[Tangiers]] (951), which accepted his suzerainty. However, he was unable to defeat [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]] of the [[Fatamid]]s.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 951 he signed a peace with the new king of León, [[Ordoño III of León|Ordoño III]], in order to have a free hand against the Fatimids whose ships were harassing the caliphate ones in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahman's force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieged the Fatimid port of Tunis, which bought its safety through paying a huge sum.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end he was able to create a protectorate covering the northern and central Maghreb, supporting the [[Idrisid]] dynasty; the caliphate influence in the area disappeared after a Fatimid offensive in 958, after which abd ar-Rahman kept only the strongholds of Ceuta and Tangiers.

===War with the Christian kingdoms of the north===
Even before al-Andalus was firmly under his rule, he had restarted the war against King [[Ordoño II of León]], who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the Umayyad territory. In 917 the then emir had sent a large army under his general Ahmad ibn Abi Abda against León, but this force was destroyed at the [[Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz (917)|Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz]] in September of that year.

Recognizing he had underestimated the power of Ordoño II, in 920 Abd ar-Rahman mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign. He captured the forts of [[Osma]] and [[San Esteban de Gormaz]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; After defeating King [[Sancho Garcés I of Navarre]] and the king of [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] at [[Battle of Valdejunquera|Valdejunquera]] on 26 July,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; he penetrated into Navarre, overcoming Aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south. Abd ar-Rahman reached the Basque city of [[Pamplona]], which was sacked and its cathedral church demolished.

In 924 Abd ar-Rahman felt obliged to avenge the massacre of Viguera castle perpetrated by King Sancho Ordóñez of Navarre one year earlier. he launched counter offensive against Sancho in which Abd ar-Rahman devastated a large area of Basque territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qVYT4Kraym0C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=Abd-ar-Rahman++III+zaragoza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aNLLVJW5O82qaaaZgbAB&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Abd-ar-Rahman%20%20III%20zaragoza&amp;f=false Al Maqqari, Nafh at-Tih, I, page 363]&lt;/ref&gt;

The succession crisis which struck León after Ordoño II's death in the same year caused hostilities to cease until [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]] obtained the throne in 932; a first attempt by him to assist the besieged rebels in Toledo was repelled in 932, despite the Christian king capturing [[Madrid]] and scoring a victory at [[Osma]].

In 934, after reasserting supremacy over Pamplona and [[Álava]], Abd ar-Rahmad forced Ramiro to retreat to [[Burgos]], and forced the Navarrese queen [[Toda of Navarre|Toda]], his aunt, to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son [[García Sánchez I of Pamplona|García Sánchez I]]. In 937 Abd ar-Rahmad conquered some thirty castles in León. Next he turned to Muhammad ibn Hashim at-Tugib, governor of [[Zaragoza]], who had allied with Ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city.

Despite early defeats, Ramiro and García were able to crush the caliphate army in 939 at the [[Battle of Simancas]], and almost kill Abd ar-Rahman,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; due, most likely, to treason by Arab elements in the caliph's army. After this defeat, Abd ar-Rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns. His cause was helped, however, by [[Fernán González of Castile]], one of the Christian leaders at Simancas, who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against Ramiro. The victory of Simancas enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of Ramiro's successor, [[Ordoño III of León]], in 956. However they did not press this advantage as civil war broke out in the Christian territories.

[[File:Dirham abd al rahman iii 17493.jpg|thumb|Dirham of Abd ar-Rahman III, minted in Medina Azahara in 959/960 AD]] 
In 950 Abd ar-Rahman received in Córdoba an embassy from count [[Borrell II of Barcelona]], by which the northern county recognized caliphate supremacy in exchange for peace and mutual support. In 958, [[Sancho I of León|Sancho]], the exiled king of [[Kingdom of León|Leon]], [[García Sánchez I|Garcia Sanchez]], King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and [[Toda of Navarre|Queen Toda]] all paid homage to Abd ar-Rahman in [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Cordoba]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Until 961, the caliphate played an active role in the dynastic strife characterizing the Christian kingdom during the period. Ordoño III's half-brother and successor, [[Sancho I of León|Sancho the Fat]], had been deposed by his cousin [[Ordoño IV of León|Ordoño IV]]. Together with his grandmother Toda of Navarre, Sancho sought an alliance with Córdoba. In exchange for some castles, Abd ar-Rahman helped them to take back [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] (959) and [[Oviedo]] (960) and to overthrow Ordoño IV.

===Later years===
Abd ar-Rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the [[harem]].&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; He is known to have openly kept a male as well as a female harem.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Medieval Iberia'', ed. Michael Gerli (New York: Routledge, 2003), 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt; This likely influenced the polemical story of his falling in love with a 13-year-old boy (later enshrined as a Christian martyr and canonised as [[Pelagius of Cordova|Saint Pelagius of Córdoba]]) who refused the Caliph's advances. The love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale, however, in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to Islam. Either way, enraged, he had the boy tortured and dismembered, thus contributing to the Christian perception of Muslim brutality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrews and Mehmet Kalpaklı, ''The Age of Beloveds'', Duke University Press, 2005; p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology'', Chicago, 1997; pp.10–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd ar-Rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside Córdoba. He died in October 961 and was succeeded by his son [[al-Hakam II]].

==Legacy==
Abd ar-Rahman was a great [[humanist]] and patron of arts, especially architecture. A third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government, a third was hoarded, and a third was spent on buildings.&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; After declaring the caliphate, he had a massive palace complex, known as the [[Medina Azahara]], built some five kilometers north of Córdoba.  The Medina Azahara was modeled after the old Umayyad palace in [[Damascus]] and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors. It was said that Cordoba contained 3000 mosques and 100,000 shops and homes during his reign.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Under his reign, Córdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He expanded the city's library, which would be further enriched by his successors.

{{quote|text=I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they amount to Fourteen: - O man! place not thy confidence in this present world!}}

He also reinforced the Iberian fleet, which became the most powerful in [[Mediterranean Europe]]. Iberian raiders moved up to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Asturias, and North Africa. The colonizers of [[Fraxinetum]] came from al-Andalus as well.

Due to his consolidation of power, Muslim Iberia became a power for a few centuries. It also brought prosperity, and with this he created mints where pure gold and silver coins were created. He renovated and added to the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

He was very wary of losing control and kept tight reins in his family. In 949, he executed one of his sons for conspiring against him. He was tolerant of non-Muslims, Jews and Christians who were treated fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reviewing Imperial Conflicts|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Baptista|first2=Cristina|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=|location=|pages=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; European nations sent emissaries such as from [[Otto I]] of Germany, and the [[Byzantine]] emperor.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Ancestry==
Abd ar-Rahman III's mother Muzna was a Christian captive, possibly from the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] region. His paternal grandmother [[Onneca Fortúnez]] was a Christian princess from the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Kingdom of Pamplona]]. In his immediate ancestry, Abd ar-Rahman III was [[Arab people|Arab]] and Hispano–[[Basque people|Basque]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;

'''''Ajax''''' is a 1936–37 painting by the American artist [[John Steuart Curry]]. It depicts a well-fed [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] bull with two [[cowbird]]s on his back. The painting is on view at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref name="americanart"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/ajax-71405|title=Ajax|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The painting was made with the intention to reassure Americans after the [[Dust Bowl]] years.&lt;ref name="americanart" /&gt; According to Curry's friend [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], it was really a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD3q5vidUoQC&amp;pg=PA105|title=John Steuart Curry: Inventing the Middle West|publisher=Hudson Hills|p=105|isbn=9781555951399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Curry featured Ajax the bull in several of his works, such as the mural ''Kansas Pastoral''. The subject also became a target for mockery among those who opposed [[Regionalism (art)|regionalist]] painting and considered it superficial. The satirist Marshall Glasier mocked both ''Ajax'' and Curry's position at the [[University of Wisconsin]] with his 1948 painting ''John Steuart Curry and the University of Wisconsin Bull-Breeding Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raOVO4lne8UC&amp;pg=PA12|title=Got Cow?: Cattle in American Art 1820-2000|publisher=[[Hudson River Museum]]|p=12–13|isbn=9780943651323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Allegory''''' is a  painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Filippino Lippi]], executed around 1498. It is now housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of  [[Florence]]. 

The work had been variously assigned, from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to an unknown 15th century painter.

==Description==
The scene is set on a hill, with Florence in the background. It features a man, whose legs are tied by a serpent, who closes to an aged one, dressing in red and sitting near a tree. The latter is holding several lightnings. Next to the walking man is a small [[stoat]], a symbol of purity.

The same character,  with the serpent getting out from his jacket and looking at him, has fallen in the foreground. An inscription gets out from his mouth, saying ''NULLA DETERIOR PESTIS QUAM FAMILIARIS INIMICUS'' ("Nothing is more dangerous than a family's enemy") and going towards the old man.

The subject has been variously interpreted: as the story of [[Laocoön]], an allegory of two enemy brothers, or, more likely, of the civil wars that followed the fall of [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in Florence. The last version is supported by the fact that, in Renaissance art, the presence of a well defined city (Florence in this case) had always a meaning. The man dressing in red would be God or Jupiter; in the latter case, the man nearing him would be nearing paganism, the serpent being a symbol of the Devil making him stumble later.

'''Arthur Garner''' (born 8 February 1851) was a theatrical entrepreneur, active in Australia.&lt;ref name=Mennell&gt;{{cite Australasia|Garner, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Princess Theatre, Melbourne, Australia.jpg|thumb|The Princess's Theatre, Melbourne. Built in 1886 by Garner, Williamson &amp; Musgrove]]
Garner was born in [[Bath, Somerset]], England, where his father, Dr. Jonathan Garner (M.D. of Edinburgh) practised his profession, his mother being a Miss Cobden. Arthur Garner was articled to [[Charles J. Phipps]], the architect, whose connection was largely theatrical, he having erected no less than forty English theatres; from which circumstance may perhaps be traced the young pupil's gravitation to the stage, where he became a ''protégé'' of Mr. George Gordon, the scenic artist. From the paint-room Garner soon found his way to the footlights, and for some time appeared in various provincial companies.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

==Early years==
In 1873 Garner arrived in [[Melbourne]], returning to London in 1876. In 1879 Garner began his career as an Australian entrepreneur by taking out "The London Comedy Company" (1879), of which Fred Marshall was the bright particular comic star and Mr. George Gordon the hardly less indispensable scenic artist.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Garner opened Garner's Theatre (previously [[White's Rooms]]) in [[Adelaide]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/?id=407326 |title=Arthur Garner |publisher=AusStage |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1881 Garner joined [[J. C. Williamson]], the eminent Australian-American actor, and [[George Musgrove]] in establishing the leading firm of Australasian managers, generally known as the "Trio," which has controlled a greater number of theatres and entered into engagements, dramatic and operatic, on a larger scale than has ever been attempted in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Their operations practically commenced at the [[Theatre Royal, Melbourne]], on July 1, 1882, with the production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Patience (opera)|''Patience'']]. Many eminent London ''artistes'' were introduced to the colonies under their regime; but the most substantial undertaking of Williamson, Garner &amp; Musgrove was the building of the new [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess's Theatre, Melbourne]], in 1886, regarded as one of the finest theatres in the world.

==Married Life==
Garner was twice married: first, to the noted English actress Blanche Stammers, who died in Melbourne in 1883; and, secondly, to Letitia Hill Martin, sister of [[Patchett Martin]], herself an accomplished ''littérateur'', and formerly a contributor to the Australian press.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

They retired to England, living at 36 Kempshott-road, [[Streatham Common]], Surrey. He died sometime before 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120696931 |title=Frederick de Belleville |newspaper=[[Sunday Times]] |issue=1335 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=20 August 1911 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |page=20 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bakwa''''' is an online magazine of literary and cultural criticism based in [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]], that covers international cultural issues and has a penchant for fiction and creative non-fiction by Cameroonian writers. Notable contributors include: [[Imbolo Mbue]], [[Ntone Edjabe]], [[Anna Jäger]], [[Kangsen Feka Wakai]], [[Jeremy Klemin]], [[Serubiri Moses]], [[Minna Salami]], [[Jack Little (editor)|Jack Little]], [[Emmanuel Iduma]], [[Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire]] and [[Johnnie MacViban]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bakwa official website|title=About|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://bakwamagazine.com/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire]]|title=Made in Africa III: The rise of African literary digital platforms|work=[[This Is Africa]]|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://thisisafrica.me/lifestyle/made-in-africa-iii-the-rise-of-african-literary-digital-platforms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bakwa'' has been described as "an eclectic, intelligent take on the dynamic cultural scenes often missed by mainstream, western media".&lt;ref&gt;Dele Maiji Fatunla, [http://whatsonafrica.org/three-african-and-african-diasporan-literary-magazines-that-everyone-should-know/ "Three African and African Diasporan Literary Magazines the Everyone Should Know"], What's On Africa, Royal African Society, 30 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded during the last quarter of 2011 (but operational as from 2012) by [[Dzekashu MacViban]], ''Bakwa'' rose out of the need to fill the lacuna created by the absence of literary and cultural magazines in Cameroon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Guardian Africa Network]]|title=Introducing the Guardian Africa network's new partners|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=2 July 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/introducing-guardian-africa-network-new-partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the defunct ''Pala Pala'' magazine, and it highlights a new dynamic Africa, often ignored by Western traditional media.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Over the years, ''Bakwa'' has been able to establish alliances with important publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' (Guardian Africa Network),  ''[[Chimurenga magazine]]'', ''[[Kwani?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lindsay|title=Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi Wins the Kwani?

== Notable projects==
For its third issue, in 2012, ''Bakwa'' collaborated with The Ofi Press, an online literary magazine based in Mexico and edited by [[Jack Little (editor)|Jack Little]]. The Ofi Press published a special West African edition, with content in English and Spanish, which focused on West Africa, while ''Bakwa'', in turn, published a special Mexican issue, focusing on Mexican art, culture and society, with most of the content in English and some Spanish translations. The project was lauded by several journals and outlets, especially the online website Heritage 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Heritage 1960]]|title=The Ofi Press: Inside "THE WEST AFRICA EDITION" (Issue #24)|date=2013|accessdate=5 July 2015|url=http://heritage1960.tumblr.com/post/38962666585/the-ofi-press-inside-the-west-africa-edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''Bakwa'' was part of #100DaysofAfricanReads, a social media project curated by [[Angela Wachuka]], Executive Director of ''[[Kwani?]]'', which entailed "a series of portraits on books, writers and readers, over a 100 day period ... highlighting the work of an African author in print and online".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bookshy|title=African Reads: 100 Days of Appreciation|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=6 July 2015|url=http://bookshybooks.blogspot.com/2015/02/african-reads-100-days-of-appreciation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of an excerpt from [[Awes Osman]]’s novel, ''[[Skinless Goat in Somalia]]'', Bakwa’s contribution to the project was made up of excerpts and stories from female Cameroonian writers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In the same year, in response to ''[[The Simpsons]]''’ episode "[[The Princess Guide]]", ''Bakwa'' did a two-part series on The Simpsons, wherein, bloggers, writers, cultural thinkers and academics were asked to comment on "The Princess Guide" episode. Most of the reactions highlighted poor research, one-dimensional characters, the challenge of portraying believable Nigerians, and the episode’s relatable character, [[Princess Kemi]]. This project on ''The Simpsons'' was later chosen by [[Dead Homer Society]], for the "weekend reading" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charlie Sweatpants|title=A Little Weekend Reading|work=Dead Homer Society|date=11 April 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://deadhomersociety.com/2015/04/11/a-little-weekend-reading/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, thanks to a partnership with [[Goethe-Institut Kamerun]] and [[Phoneme Media]], Bakwa launched a one-off short story competition open to Cameroonians under 39 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Bakwa Magazine]]|title=Bakwa Magazine Short Story Competition |date=4 May 2016|accessdate=15 August 2016|url=https://bakwamagazine.com/2016/05/04/bakwa-magazine-short-story-competition}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a Literary Exchange Programme in 2017, between Cameroonain and Nigerian writers, in partnership with [[Saraba Magazine]] and the Goethe-Institut in Cameroon and Nigeria.

'''Baroque architecture''' is the building style of the [[Baroque]] era, begun in late 16th-century Italy, that took the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] vocabulary of [[Renaissance architecture]] and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the [[Catholic Church]]. It was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and dramatic intensity.  Common features of Baroque architecture included gigantism of proportions; a large open central space where everyone could see the altar;  twisting columns, theatrical effects, including light coming from a cupola above;  dramatic interior effects created with bronze and gilding; clusters of sculpted angels and other figures high overhead;  and an extensive use of [[trompe-l'oeil]], also called "quadratura,"  with painted architectural details and figures on the walls and ceiling, to increase the dramatic and theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the Renaissance drew on the wealth and power of the Italian courts and was a blend of secular and religious forces, the Baroque was, initially at least, directly linked to the Counter-Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to reform itself in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) is usually given as the beginning of the Counter-Reformation.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque architecture and its embellishments were on the one hand more accessible to the emotions and on the other hand, a visible statement of the wealth and power of the Catholic Church. The new style manifested itself in particular in the context of the new religious orders, like the [[Theatines]] and the [[Jesuits]] who aimed to improve popular piety.

[[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]], such as the example of [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] (1726-1743), developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the High Roman Baroque can be assigned to the papal reigns of [[Urban VIII]], [[Innocent X]] and [[Alexander VII]], spanning from 1623 to 1667. The three principal architects of this period were the sculptor [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Francesco Borromini]] and the painter [[Pietro da Cortona]] and each evolved his own distinctively individual architectural expression.

Dissemination of Baroque architecture to the south of Italy resulted in regional variations such as [[Sicilian Baroque]] architecture or that of [[Naples]] and [[Lecce]]. To the north, the Theatine architect [[Camillo-Guarino Guarini]], [[Bernardo Vittone]] and Sicilian born [[Filippo Juvarra]] contributed Baroque buildings to the city of [[Turin]] and the [[Piedmont]] region.

A synthesis of Bernini, Borromini and Cortona’s architecture can be seen in the late Baroque architecture of northern Europe which paved the way for the more decorative [[Rococo]] style.

By the middle of the 17th century, the Baroque style had found its secular expression in the form of grand palaces, first in France—with the [[Château de Maisons]] (1642) near Paris by [[François Mansart]]—and then throughout Europe.

During the 17th century, Baroque architecture spread through Europe and Latin America, where it was particularly promoted by the Jesuits.

== Precursors and features of Baroque architecture ==
[[Michelangelo]]'s late Roman buildings, particularly [[St. Peter's Basilica]], may be considered precursors to Baroque architecture. His pupil [[Giacomo della Porta]] continued this work in Rome, particularly in the façade of the Jesuit church [[Il Gesù]], which leads directly to the most important church façade of the early Baroque, [[Santa Susanna]] (1603), by [[Carlo Maderno]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Maderno’s facade, see Wittkower R., ''Art &amp; Architecture in Italy 1600–1750'', 1985 edn, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive features of Baroque architecture can include:
* 	in churches, broader naves and sometimes given oval forms
*	fragmentary or deliberately incomplete architectural elements
*	dramatic use of light; either strong light-and-shade contrasts (''[[chiaroscuro]]'' effects) as at the church of [[Weltenburg Abbey]], or uniform lighting by means of several windows (e.g. church of [[Weingarten Abbey]])
*	opulent use of colour and ornaments (''putti'' or figures made of wood (often gilded), plaster or stucco, marble or faux finishing)
*	large-scale ceiling frescoes
*	an external façade often characterized by a dramatic central projection
*	the interior is a shell for painting, sculpture and stucco (especially in the late Baroque)
*	illusory effects like [[trompe l'oeil]] (an art technique involving extremely realistic imagery in order to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects appear in three dimensions.) and the blending of [[painting]] and [[architecture]]
*	pear-shaped domes in the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Czech Baroque architecture|Czech]], [[Baroque in Poland|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]
*	Ornate detail is key in identifying Baroque architecture ex, [[Palace of Versailles]]

=== Baroque and colonialism ===
[[File:Church of Immaculate Conception, Panjim 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|During the Portuguese colonization of [[Goa]], India brought about many churches with baroque architecture ([[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]]).]]

Though the tendency has been to see Baroque architecture as a European phenomenon, it coincided with, and is integrally enmeshed with, the rise of European [[colonialism]]. Colonialism required the development of centralized and powerful governments with Spain and France, the first to move in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;Though there is a vast literature on the subject, a succinct overview can be found in: Francis Ching, [[Mark Jarzombek]], Vikram Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'', Wiley Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonialism brought in huge amounts of wealth, not only in the silver that was extracted from the mines in Bolivia, Mexico and elsewhere, but also in the resultant trade in commodities, such as sugar and tobacco. The need to control trade routes, monopolies, and slavery, which lay primarily in the hands of the French during the 17th century, created an almost endless cycle of wars between the colonial powers: the [[French religious wars]], the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618 and 1648), [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco–Spanish War]] (1653), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), and so on. The initial mismanagement of colonial wealth by the Spaniards bankrupted them in the 16th century (1557 and 1560), recovering only slowly in the following century. This explains why the Baroque style, though enthusiastically developed throughout the [[Spanish Empire]], was to a large extent, in Spain, an architecture of surfaces and façades, unlike in France and Austria where we see the construction of numerous huge palaces and monasteries. In contrast to Spain, the French, under [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (1619–1683), the minister of finance, had begun to industrialize their economy, and thus, were able to become, initially at least, the benefactors of the flow of wealth. While this was good for the building industries and the arts, the new wealth created an inflation, the likes of which had never been experienced before. Rome was known just as much for its new sumptuous churches as for its vagabonds.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pater. ''Renaissance Rome''.  (University of California Press, 1976) pp.70–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rome and Southern Italy ===
{{See also|Sicilian Baroque}} A number of ecclesiastical buildings of the Baroque period in Rome had plans based on the Italian paradigm of the basilica with a crossed dome and nave, but the treatment of the architecture was very different from what had been carried out previously. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in the Gesù, was the church of Santa Susanna, designed by Carlo Maderno. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, but it still maintains rigor.

The same concerns with plasticity, massing, dramatic effects and shadow and light is evident in the architectural work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by his design of [[Santi Luca e Martina]] (construction began in 1635) with what was probably the first curved Baroque church façade in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony. ''Borromini'', 1979, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are even more evident in his reworking of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656–68). The façade with its [[chiaroscuro]] half-domed portico and concave side wings, closely resembles a theatrical stage set and the church façade projects forward so that it substantially fills the tiny trapezoidal piazza. Other Roman ensembles of the Baroque and Late Baroque period are likewise suffused with theatricality and, as urban theatres, provide points of focus within their locality in the surrounding cityscape.

Probably the most well known example of such an approach is [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The piazza, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is formed principally by two colonnades of free standing columns centred on an Egyptian [[obelisk]]. Bernini's own favourite design was his oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] decorated with polychome marbles and an ornate gold dome. His secular architecture included the [[Palazzo Barberini]] based on plans by Maderno and the [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]] by [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's rival, the architect [[Francesco Borromini]], produced designs that deviated dramatically from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance. His building plans were based on complex geometric figures, his architectural forms were unusual and inventive and he employed multi-layered symbolism in his architectural designs. Borromini's architectural spaces seem to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of Michelangelo. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a complicated plan arrangement that is partly oval and partly a cross and so has complex convex-concave wall rhythms. A later work, the church of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same playful inventiveness and antipathy to the flat surface, epitomized by an unusual "corkscrew" lantern above the dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in Rome. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]. Fontana's academic approach, though lacking the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects he trained, who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to Paris. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome—[[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727)—had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Basilica di Superga]] near [[Turin]] by [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]

The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober and classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

=== Northern Italy ===
In the north of Italy, the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects&amp;mdash;[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]], and [[Bernardo Vittone]]&amp;mdash;to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[solid geometry|stereometry]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details, and the airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roof-line and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. The rustic ambiance encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini, none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

[[File:Wignacourt Arch 2016-05-08.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Wignacourt Arch]], one of the earliest Baroque structures in Malta]]

The Baroque style was introduced in Malta in the early 17th century, possibly by the Bolognese architect and engineer [[Bontadino de Bontadini]], who was responsible for the construction of the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]] between 1612 and 1615. The earliest Baroque structures in Malta were the decorative elements within the aqueduct, such as the [[Wignacourt Arch]] and [[Wignacourt Aqueduct#Fountains|several fountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonello|first1=Giovanni|authorlink1=Giovanni Bonello|title=Histories of Malta – Convictions and Conjectures|date=2003|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=9789993210276|pages=44–61|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Histories_of_Malta.html?id=SB4jAQAAIAAJ|chapter=Bontadino de Bontadini – The Murder of the First Baroque Architect in Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hauptaltar der St. John’s Co-Cathedral.JPG|thumb|left|The High Baroque altar of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]]]]

Baroque architecture became popular after [[Francesco Bounamici]] designed the [[Church of the Jesuits]] in [[Valletta]] in 1635. In the subsequent decades, many churches, public buildings, city gates, palaces and other structures were constructed or rebuilt in this style. New churches were built in the Baroque style, while older ones were rebuilt or redecorated.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baroque Architecture|url=http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|website=Culture Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630172716/http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|archivedate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the interior of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]], which was completely redesigned by [[Mattia Preti]] in the 1660s, and the [[Our Lady of Victories Church, Valletta|Church of Our Lady of Victories]], which had its façade rebuilt in 1752.

The architect [[Lorenzo Gafà]] designed many Baroque churches between the 1660s and the 1700s, including the [[Saint Lawrence's Church, Vittoriosa|Church of St. Lawrence]] in [[Birgu]] (1681–97), [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[Mdina]] (1696–1705) and the [[Cathedral of the Assumption, Gozo|Cathedral of the Assumption]] in [[Victoria, Gozo]] (1697–1711).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. II G-Z|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=851–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auberge de Castille.jpeg|thumb|[[Auberge de Castille]]]]

The most monumental Baroque building in Malta is [[Auberge de Castille]], which was rebuilt in 1741–45 by [[Andrea Belli]].&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt; Other examples of secular Baroque architecture in Malta include [[Hostel de Verdelin]] ({{circa}} 1650s), parts of [[Fort Manoel]] (1723–33), the [[Mdina Gate]] (1724) and the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] (1757–60).

The Baroque style remained popular in Malta until the late 18th and early 19th century, when the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style was introduced. However, traditional Maltese architecture continued to have significant Baroque influences.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt;

[[File:La Granja Palacio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso|Royal Palace of La Granja]]]]
As Italian Baroque influences penetrated across the [[Pyrenees]], they gradually superseded in popularity the restrained classicizing approach of [[Juan de Herrera]], which had been in vogue since the late 16th century. As early as 1667, the façades of [[Granada Cathedral]] (by [[Alonso Cano]]) and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén Cathedral]] (by [[Eufrasio López de Rojas]]) suggest the artists' fluency in interpreting traditional motifs of Spanish cathedral architecture in the Baroque aesthetic idiom.
[[File:Santiago GDFL catedral 050318 43.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The most impressive display of Churrigueresque spatial decoration may be found in the west façade of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]).]]
In contrast to the art of Northern Europe, the Spanish art of the period appealed to the emotions rather than seeking to please the intellect. The [[Churriguera]] family, which specialized in designing altars and retables, revolted against the sobriety of the Herreresque classicism and promoted an intricate, exaggerated, almost capricious style of surface decoration known as the [[Churrigueresque]]. Within half a century, they transformed [[Salamanca]] into an exemplary Churrigueresque city. Among the highlights of the style, the interiors of the [[Granada Charterhouse]] offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tomé achieved striking [[chiaroscuro]] effects in his ''Transparente'' for the [[Toledo Cathedral]].
[[File:Universidad de Valladolid. Fachada.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|[[Facade of the University of Valladolid]] (1716-1718).]]
The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]'s blend of [[Solomonic column]]s and [[composite order]], known as the "supreme order". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation toward a neoclassical balance and sobriety.

Two of the most eye-catching creations of Spanish Baroque are the energetic façades of the [[University of Valladolid]] (Diego Tomé, 1716-1718) and [[Hospicio de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] (Pedro de Ribera, 1722), whose curvilinear extravagance seems to herald [[Antonio Gaudí]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. In this case as in many others, the design involves a play of tectonic and decorative elements with little relation to structure and function. The focus of the florid ornamentation is an elaborately sculptured surround to a main doorway. If we remove the intricate maze of broken pediments, undulating cornices, stucco shells, inverted tapers, and garlands from the rather plain wall it is set against, the building's form would not be affected in the slightest.

{{main article|New Spanish Baroque|Andean Baroque|Churrigueresque}}
[[File:Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]], [[Mexico City]], started in 1573]]
The combination of the Native American and Moorish decorative influences with an extremely expressive interpretation of the Churrigueresque idiom may account for the full-bodied and varied character of the Baroque in the American colonies of Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin-towered façades of many American cathedrals of the 17th century had medieval roots and the full-fledged Baroque did not appear until 1664, when a Jesuit shrine on Plaza des Armas in [[Cusco]] was built. Even then, the new style hardly affected the structure of churches.

To the north, the richest province of 18th-century [[New Spain]]&amp;mdash;Mexico&amp;mdash;produced some fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic architecture known as Mexican Churrigueresque. This ultra-Baroque approach culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the [[Sagrario Metropolitano]] in [[Mexico City]]. Other fine examples of the style may be found in remote silver-mining towns. For instance, the Sanctuary at [[Ocotlán, Tlaxcala|Ocotlán]] (begun in 1745) is a top-notch Baroque cathedral surfaced in bright red tiles, which contrast delightfully with a plethora of compressed ornament lavishly applied to the main entrance and the slender flanking towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.emory.edu/culpeper/BAKEWELL/images/ocotlan-ch.jpg Exterior] and [http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/bevans/Art454L-58-Tlaxcala/F00006.JPG Interior]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St. Augustine Church - Paoay, Ilocos Norte.jpg|thumb|[[Paoay Church]] in the Philippines is a fine example of [[Earthquake Baroque]].]]
The true capital of Mexican Baroque is [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], where a ready supply of hand-painted ceramics ([[talavera (pottery)|talavera]]) and vernacular gray stone led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form with a pronounced Indian flavour. There are about sixty churches whose façades and domes display glazed tiles of many colours, often arranged in Arabic designs. The interiors are densely saturated with elaborate gold leaf ornamentation. In the 18th century, local artisans developed a distinctive brand of white stucco decoration, named "alfenique" after a Pueblan candy made from egg whites and sugar.

The Peruvian Baroque was particularly lavish, as evidenced by the [[Monastery of San Francisco, Lima|monastery of San Francisco]] at [[Lima]] (1673). While the rural Baroque of the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba]] in [[Córdoba, Argentina]], followed the model of Il Gesu, provincial "mestizo" (crossbred) styles emerged in [[Arequipa]], [[Potosí]], and [[La Paz]]. In the 18th century, architects of the region turned for inspiration to the [[Mudéjar]] art of medieval Spain. The late Baroque type of Peruvian façade first appears in the Church of Our Lady of La Merced in Lima. Similarly, the Church of La Compañia in [[Quito]] suggests a carved altarpiece with its richly sculpted façade and a surfeit of spiral [[salomónica]].

Earthquake Baroque is a style of Baroque architecture found in the [[Philippines]], which suffered destructive [[earthquake]]s during the 17th century and 18th century, where large public buildings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]], were rebuilt in a [[Baroque]] style. Similar events led to the [[Pombaline Downtown|Pombaline]] architecture in [[Lisbon]] following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and [[Sicilian Baroque]] in [[Sicily]] following the [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693 earthquake]].

Nothwithstanding a prodigality of sensually rich surface decoration associated with Baroque architecture of the Iberian Peninsula, the royal courts of [[Madrid]] and [[Lisbon]] generally favoured a more sober architectural vocabulary distilled from 17th-century Italy. The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|royal palaces of Madrid]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and [[Convent of Mafra|Mafra]] were designed by architects under strong influence of Bernini and Juvarra. In the realm of church architecture, Guarini's design for Santa Maria della Divina Providenza in Lisbon was a pace-setter for structural audacity in the region (even though it was never built).

In Portugal, the first fully Baroque church was the [[Church of Santa Engrácia]], in Lisbon, designed by royal architect [[João Antunes]], which has a Greek cross floorplan and curved facades. Antunes also designed churches in which the inner space is rectangular but with curved corners (like the Menino de Deus Church in Lisbon), a scheme that is found in several 18th-century churches in Portugal and Brazil. The court of John V, on the other hand, favoured Roman baroque models, as attested by the work of royal architect [[Ludovice]], a German who designed the [[Convent of Mafra|Royal Palace of Mafra]], built after 1715.

By the mid-18th century, northern Portuguese architects had absorbed the concepts of Italian Baroque to revel in the plasticity of local granite in such projects as the surging 75-metre-high [[Torre dos Clérigos]] in [[Porto]]. The foremost centre of the national Baroque tradition was [[Braga]], whose buildings encompass virtually every important feature of Portuguese architecture and design. The Baroque shrines and palaces of Braga are noted for polychrome ornamental patterns, undulating roof-lines, and irregularly shaped window surrounds.

Brazilian architects also explored plasticity in form and decoration, though they rarely surpassed their continental peers in ostentation. The churches of Mariana and the Rosario at Ouro Preto are based on Borromini's vision of interlocking elliptical spaces. At São Pedro dos Clérigos, Recife), a conventional stucco-and-stone façade is enlivened by "a high scrolled gable squeezed tightly between the towers".

Even after the Baroque conventions passed out of fashion in Europe, the style was long practised in Brazil by [[Aleijadinho]], a brilliant and prolific architect in whose designs hints of Rococo could be discerned. His church of Bom Jesus de Matozinhos at Congonhas is distinguished by a picturesque silhouette and dark ornamental detail on a light stuccoed façade. Although Aleijadinho was originally commissioned to design São Francisco de Assis at São João del Rei, his designs were rejected, and were displaced to the [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|church of São Francisco]] in Ouro Preto instead.

[[File:Gyoribencestemplom.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Széchenyi Square of [[Győr]], [[Hungary]]]]
In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the first great Baroque building was the Jesuit Church of [[Trnava]] (today in [[Slovakia]]) built by Pietro Spozzo in 1629–37, modelling the [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome. [[Jesuits]] were the main propagators of the new style with their churches in [[Győr]] (1634–1641), [[Košice]] (1671–1684), [[Eger]] (1731–1733) and [[Székesfehérvár]] (1745–1751). The reconstruction of the territories devastated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] was carried out in Baroque style in the 18th century. Intact Baroque townscapes can be found in [[Győr]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Eger]], [[Veszprém]], [[Esztergom]] and the [[Castle District, Buda|Castle District]] of [[Buda]]. The most important Baroque palaces in Hungary were the [[Buda Castle|Royal Palace]] in Buda, [[Grassalkovich Palace]] in [[Gödöllő]], and [[Eszterháza|Esterházy Palace]] in [[Fertőd]]. Smaller Baroque edifices of the Hungarian aristocracy are scattered all over the country. Hungarian Baroque shows the double influence of Austrian and Italian artistic tendencies as many German and Italian architects worked in the country. The main characteristics of the local version of the style were modesty, lack of excessive decoration, and some "rural" flavour, especially in the works of the local masters. Important architects of the Hungarian Baroque were Andreas Mayerhoffer, Ignác Oraschek and Márton Wittwer. Franz Anton Pilgram also worked in the Kingdom of Hungary, for example on the great [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of [[Jászó|Jasov]] (today in [[Slovakia]]). In the last decades of the 18th century Neo-Classical tendencies became dominant. The two most important architects of that period were Melchior Hefele and [[Jakab Fellner]].

By the time Hungarian varieties of Baroque architecture appeared with several types of forms, shapes and decorations. Those that have become famous and nice, have been copied. That's why the Hungarian baroque edifices make groups based on similarities. The major kinds of buildings are the following: Eszterháza-type, Széchenyi-type, Gödöllő-type, religious (ecclesiastical) baroque, houses, and others (castles, peasant houses).

[[File:Château de Maisons-Laffitte 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Château de Maisons]] near Paris by [[François Mansart]] (1642)]]

The centre of Baroque secular architecture was France, where the open three-wing layout of the palace was established as the canonical solution as early as the 16th century. But it was the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] that determined the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take. For the first time, the [[corps de logis]] was emphasized as the representative main part of the building, while the side wings were treated as hierarchically inferior and appropriately scaled down. The medieval tower has been completely replaced by the central projection in the shape of a monumental three-storey gateway.

De Brosse's melding of traditional French elements (e.g. lofty [[mansard roof]]s and a complex roof-line) with extensive Italianate quotations (e.g. ubiquitous rustication, derived from [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]]) came to characterize the [[Louis XIII style]]. Probably the most accomplished formulator of the new manner was [[François Mansart]], a tireless perfectionist credited with introducing the full Baroque to France. In his design for [[Château de Maisons]] (1642), Mansart succeeded in reconciling academic and Baroque approaches, while demonstrating respect for the gothic-inherited idiosyncrasies of the French tradition.

[[File:Versailles Chapel - July 2006 edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Versailles's chapel as seen from the ''tribune royale'', an outstanding example of French Baroque&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Château of Maisons demonstrates the ongoing transition from the post-medieval [[chateau]]x of the 16th century to the villa-like country houses of the 18th. The structure is strictly symmetrical, with an order applied to each storey, mostly in [[pilaster]] form. The frontispiece, crowned with a separate aggrandized roof, is infused with remarkable plasticity and the ensemble reads like a three-dimensional whole. Mansart's structures are stripped of overblown decorative effects, so typical of contemporary Rome. Italian Baroque influence is muted and relegated to the field of decorative ornamentation.

The next step in the development of European residential architecture involved the integration of the gardens in the composition of the palace, as is exemplified by [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]), where the architect [[Louis Le Vau]], the designer [[Charles Le Brun]] and the gardener [[André Le Nôtre]] complemented one another. From the main cornice to a low plinth, the miniature palace is clothed in the so-called "colossal order", which makes the structure look more impressive. The creative collaboration of Le Vau and Le Nôtre marked the arrival of the "Magnificent Manner" which allowed to extend Baroque architecture outside the palace walls and transform the surrounding landscape into an immaculate mosaic of expansive vistas.

[[File:Les Invalides in Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Les Invalides]] in Paris by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] (1676)]]

The same three artists scaled this concept to monumental proportions in the royal hunting lodge and later main [[Palace of Versailles|residence at Versailles]]. On a far grander scale, the palace is an exaggerated and somewhat repetitive version of Vaux-le-Vicomte. It was both the most grandiose and the most imitated residential building of the 17th century. [[Mannheim]], [[Nordkirchen]] and [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] were among many foreign residences for which Versailles provided a model.

The final expansion of Versailles was superintended by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], whose key design is the [[Dome des Invalides]], generally regarded as the most important French church of the century. Hardouin-Mansart profited from his uncle's instruction and plans to instill the edifice with an imperial grandeur unprecedented in the countries north of Italy. The majestic hemispherical dome balances the vigorous vertical thrust of the orders, which do not accurately convey the structure of the interior. The younger architect not only revived the harmony and balance associated with the work of the elder Mansart but also set the tone for Late Baroque French architecture, with its grand ponderousness and increasing concessions to [[academicism]].

The reign of [[Louis XV]] saw a reaction against the official [[Louis XIV Style]] in the shape of a more delicate and intimate manner, known as [[Rococo]]. The style was pioneered by [[Nicolas Pineau]], who collaborated with Hardouin-Mansart on the interiors of the royal [[Château de Marly]]. Further elaborated by [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Le Pautre]] and [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonier]], the "''genre pittoresque''" culminated in the interiors of the [[Château de Chantilly|Petit Château at Chantilly]] (c. 1722) and [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris (c. 1732), where a fashionable emphasis on the curvilinear went beyond all reasonable measure, while sculpture, paintings, furniture, and porcelain tended to overshadow architectural divisions of the interior.

[[File:Leuven Sint-Michielskerk.jpg|thumb|Church of St. Michel in [[Leuven]], Belgium by [[Willem Hesius]] (1650)]]

Baroque architecture in the south, [[Flanders and Belgium]] developed rather differently from in the Protestant . After the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], the Southern Netherlands remained in Catholic hands, ruled by the Spanish [[Habsburg]] Kings. Important architectural projects were set up in the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In them, florid decorative detailing was more tightly knit to the structure, thus precluding concerns of superfluity. A remarkable convergence of Spanish, French, and Dutch Baroque aesthetics may be seen in the [[Abbey of Averbode]] (1667). Another characteristic example is the Church of St. Michel at [[Leuven|Louvain]], with its exuberant two-storey façade, clusters of half-columns, and the complex aggregation of French-inspired sculptural detailing.

Six decades later, a [[Flanders|Flemish]] architect, Jaime Borty Milia, was the first to introduce [[Rococo]] to Spain ([[Cathedral of Murcia]], west façade, 1733). The greatest practitioner of the Spanish Rococo style was a native master, [[Ventura Rodríguez]], responsible for the dazzling interior of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]] in [[Zaragoza]] (1750).

Some Flemish architects such as [[Wenceslas Cobergher]] were trained in Italy and their works were inspired by architects such as [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]]. Cobergher's most major project was the Basilica of Our Lady of [[Scherpenheuvel-Zichem|Scherpenheuvel]] which he designed as the center of a new town in the form of a [[heptagon]].

The influence of the painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on architecture was very important. With his book "I [[Palazzi di Genova]]" he introduced novel Italian models for the conception of profane buildings and decoration in the Southern Netherlands. The courtyard and portico of his own house in Antwerp ([[Rubenshuis]]) are good examples of his architectural activity. He also took part in the decoration of the Antwerp Jesuit Church (now [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]]) where he introduced a lavish Baroque decoration, integrating sculpture and painting in the architectural program.

[[File:Koninklijk Paleis Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam City Hall]] by [[Jacob van Campen]] (1646)]]
There is little Baroque about Dutch architecture of the 17th century. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. Like contemporary developments in England, Dutch [[Palladianism]] is marked by sobriety and restraint. Two leading architects, [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]], used such eclectic elements as giant-order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples in a coherent combination that anticipated Wren's Classicism.

The most ambitious constructions of the period included the [[town hall|seats of self-government]] in [[Amsterdam]] (1646) and [[Maastricht]] (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the [[House of Orange]] are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, [[Huis ten Bosch]] and [[Mauritshuis]], are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes and mannerisms. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the Stadholder's summer residence of [[Het Loo]].

The [[Dutch Republic]] was one of the [[great powers]] of 17th-century Europe and its influence on European architecture was by no means negligible. Dutch architects were employed on important projects in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, disseminating their ideas in those countries. The Dutch colonial architecture, once flourishing in the [[Hudson River]] Valley and associated primarily with red-brick gabled houses, may still be seen in [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]].

Baroque aesthetics, whose influence was so potent in mid-17th-century France, made little impact in England during [[the Protectorate]] and the first [[English Restoration|Restoration years]]. For a decade between the death of [[Inigo Jones]] in 1652 and [[Christopher Wren]]'s visit to Paris in 1665 there was no English architect of the accepted premier class. Unsurprisingly, general interest in European architectural developments was slight.

It was Wren who presided over the genesis of the English Baroque manner, which differed from the continental models by a clarity of design and a subtle taste for classicism. Following the [[Great Fire of London]], Wren rebuilt fifty-three churches, where Baroque aesthetics are apparent primarily in dynamic structure and multiple changing views. His most ambitious work was [[St Paul's Cathedral]], which bears comparison with the most effulgent domed churches of Italy and France. In this majestically proportioned edifice, the [[Palladian]] tradition of Inigo Jones is fused with contemporary continental sensibilities in masterly equilibrium. Less influential were straightforward attempts to engraft the Berniniesque vision onto British church architecture (e.g. by [[Thomas Archer]] in [[St. John's, Smith Square]], 1728).
[[File:England1 144.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]]]]

Although Wren was also active in secular architecture, the first truly Baroque [[English country houses|country house]] in England was built to a design by [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], starting in 1687. The culmination of Baroque architectural forms comes with Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. Each was capable of a fully developed architectural statement, yet they preferred to work in tandem, most notably at [[Castle Howard]] (1699) and [[Blenheim Palace]] (1705).

Although these two palaces may appear somewhat ponderous or turgid to Italian eyes, their heavy embellishment and overpowering mass captivated the British public, albeit for a short while. Castle Howard is a flamboyant assembly of restless masses dominated by a cylindrical domed tower which would not be out of place in [[Dresden]] or [[Munich]]. Blenheim is a more solid construction, where the massed stone of the arched gates and the huge solid portico becomes the main ornament. Vanbrugh's final work was [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] (1718), a comparatively modest mansion yet unique in the structural audacity of its style. It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724, the style had lost currency in Britain.

[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] in [[Berlin]]]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Baroque period began somewhat later. Although the [[Augsburg]] architect [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) and some theoretists, including [[Joseph Furttenbach the Elder]] already practiced the Baroque style, they remained without successors due to the ravages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. From about 1650 on, construction work resumed, and secular and ecclesiastical architecture were of equal importance. During an initial phase, master-masons from southern Switzerland and northern Italy, the so-called ''magistri Grigioni'' and the Lombard master-masons, particularly the [[Carlone]] family from Val d'Intelvi, dominated the field. However, Austria came soon to develop its own characteristic Baroque style during the last third of the 17th century. [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]] was impressed by [[Bernini]]. He forged a new ''Imperial'' style by compiling architectural motifs from the entire history, most prominently seen in his [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna. [[Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt]] also had an Italian training. He developed a highly decorative style, particularly in façade architecture, which exerted strong influences on southern Germany.

[[File:Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpg|thumb|right|250|[[Karlskirche]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
Frequently, the Southern German Baroque is distinguished from the Northern German Baroque, which is more properly the distinction between the Catholic and the Protestant Baroque. In the Catholic South, the Jesuit church of [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]] was the first to bring Italian style across the Alps. However, its influence on the further development of church architecture was rather limited. A much more practical and more adaptable model of church architecture was provided by the Jesuit church in [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]]): the wall-pillar church, a [[barrel-vault]]ed nave accompanied by large open chapels separated by wall-pillars. As opposed to St. Michael's in Munich, the chapels almost reach the height of the nave in the wall-pillar church, and their vault (usually transverse barrel-vaults) springs from the same level as the main vault of the nave. The chapels provide ample lighting; seen from the entrance of the church, the wall-pillars form a theatrical setting for the side altars. The wall-pillar church was further developed by the [[Vorarlberg]] school, as well as the master-masons of [[Bavaria]]. This new church also integrated well with the [[hall church]] model of the German late Gothic age. The wall-pillar church continued to be used throughout the 18th century (e.g. even in the early neo-classical church of [[Rot an der Rot Abbey]]), and early wall-pillar churches could easily be refurbished by re-decoration without any structural changes, such as the church at Dillingen.

[[File:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Interior of [[Vierzehnheiligen]] church in [[Bavaria]]]]
However, the Catholic South also received influences from other sources, such as the so-called ''radical Baroque'' of [[Bohemia]]. The radical Baroque of [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]], both residing at [[Prague]], was inspired by examples from northern Italy, particularly by the works of [[Guarino Guarini]]. It is characterized by the curvature of walls and intersection of oval spaces. While some Bohemian influence is visible in Bavaria's most prominent architect of the period, [[Johann Michael Fischer]] (the curved balconies of some of his earlier wall-pillar churches), the works of [[Balthasar Neumann]], in particular the [[Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen]], are generally considered to be the final synthesis of Bohemian and German traditions.

In the [[Slovene Lands]], especially in [[Carniola]], Baroque arrived in the first half of the 17th century mostly through Italian influences. [[Ljubljana]] emerged as an important regional center of Baroque architecture in the early 18th century, mostly with the work of northern Italian artists such as [[Andrea Pozzo]], [[Francesco Robba]], [[Carlo Martinuzzi]] and [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]]. Their work in the today's [[Slovenia]]'s capital incoporated many northern, especially Bohemian and Austrian elements, yet Slovenian baroque maintains a recognizably Italian touch to it.
[[Lower Styria]] was more influenced by various Austrian schools, especially [[Joseph Hueber]] and his pupils who built a number of manors in what is now eastern Slovenia.

[[File:Praha 2005-09-15 St Nicholas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[St. Nicholas Church (Prague)|Church of St Nicholas]], [[Lesser Town]], the most famous Baroque church in [[Prague]]]]
Protestant sacred architecture was of lesser importance during the Baroque, and produced only a few works of prime importance, particularly the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Dresden]]. Architectural theory was more lively in the north than in the south of Germany, with [[Leonhard Christoph Sturm]]'s edition of [[Nikolaus Goldmann]], but Sturm's theoretical considerations (e.g. on Protestant church architecture) never really made it to practical application. In the south, theory essentially reduced to the use of buildings and elements from illustrated books and engravings as a prototype.

Palace architecture was equally important both in the Catholic South and the Protestant North. After an initial phase when Italian architects and influences dominated ([[Vienna]], [[Rastatt]]), French influence prevailed from the second decade of the 18th century onwards. The French model is characterized by the horseshoe-like layout enclosing a cour d'honneur (courtyard) on the town side (chateau entre cour et jardin), whereas the Italian (and also Austrian) scheme presents a block-like villa. The principal achievements of German Palace architecture, often worked out in close collaboration of several architects, provide a synthesis of Austro-Italian and French models. The most outstanding palace which blends Austro-Italian and French influences into a completely new type of building is the [[Würzburg Residence]]. While its general layout is the horseshoe-like French plan, it encloses interior courtyards. Its façades combine Lucas von Hildebrandt's love of decoration with French-style classical orders in two superimposed stories; its interior features the famous Austrian "imperial staircase", but also a French-type [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms on the garden side, inspired by the "apartement semi-double" layout of French castles.

[[Ukrainian Baroque]] is an architectural style that emerged in Ukraine during the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] era, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ukrainian Baroque is distinct from the Western European Baroque in having more moderate ornamentation and simpler forms, and as such was considered more constructivist. One of the unique features of the Ukrainian baroque, were [[Onion dome|bud and pear-shaped domes]], that were later borrowed by the similar [[Naryshkin baroque]].&lt;ref&gt;Власов В.Г.

The best examples of [[Baroque painting]] are the church paintings in the [[Church of the Trinity (Pechersk Lavra)|Holy Trinity Church]] of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Rapid development in engraving techniques occurred during the Ukrainian Baroque period. Advances utilized a complex system of [[symbol]]ism, allegories, heraldic signs, and sumptuous ornamentation.

In Russia, Baroque architecture passed through three stages—the early [[Naryshkin Baroque|Moscow Baroque]], with elegant white decorations on red-brick walls of rather traditional churches, the mature [[Petrine Baroque]], mostly imported from the Low Countries, and the late [[Rastrelli|Rastrelliesque Baroque]], which was, in the words of William Brumfield, "extravagant in design and execution, yet ordered by the rhythmic insistence of massed columns and Baroque statuary."

The first baroque churches were built in the estates of the [[Naryshkin]] family of Moscow [[boyar]]s. It was the family of [[Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina|Natalia Naryshkina]], [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s mother. Most notable in this category of small suburban churches were the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession in Fili]] (1693–96), the Holy Tritity church in Troitse-Lykovo (1690–1695) and the Saviour in Ubory (1694–97). They were built in red [[brick]] with profuse detailed decoration in white stone. The [[Bell tower|belfry]] was not any more placed beside the church as was common in the 17th century, but on the [[facade]] itself, usually surmounting the octagonal central church and producing daring vertical compositions. As the style gradually spread around [[Russia]], many monasteries were remodeled after the latest fashion. The most delightful of these were the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in Moscow, as well as [[Krutitsy]] [[metochion]] and Solotcha Cloister near [[Riazan]]. Civic architecture also sought to conform to the baroque aesthetics, e.g., the [[Sukharev Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and there is also a neo-form of this style like the [[State Historical Museum|Principal Medicine Store]] on [[Red Square]]. The most important architects associated with the Naryshkin Baroque were [[Yakov Bukhvostov]] and [[Peter Potapov]].

[[Petrine Baroque]] is a name applied by art historians to a style of Baroque architecture and decoration favoured by [[Peter the Great]] and employed to design buildings in the newly founded Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], under this monarch and his immediate successors. Unlike contemporaneous [[Naryshkin Baroque]], favoured in [[Moscow]], the Petrine Baroque represented a drastic rupture with Byzantine traditions that had dominated [[Russian architecture]] for almost a millennium. Its chief practitioners—[[Domenico Trezzini]], [[Andreas Schlüter]], and [[Mikhail Zemtsov]]—drew inspiration from a rather modest Dutch, Danish, and Swedish architecture of the time. Extant examples of the style in St Petersburg are the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], the [[Twelve Colleges]], the [[Kunstkamera]], [[Kikin Hall]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].The Petrine Baroque structures outside St Petersburg are scarce; they include the [[Menshikov Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Kadriorg Palace]] in [[Tallinn]].

[[File:Copenhagen amalienborg seen from opera house.jpg|thumb|[[Amalienborg Palace]], a Baroque quarter in the center of [[Copenhagen]]]]

During the golden age of the [[Swedish Empire]], the architecture of Nordic countries was dominated by the Swedish court architect [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]] and his son [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger]]. Their aesthetic was readily adopted across the Baltic, in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].

Born in Germany, Tessin the Elder endowed Sweden with a truly national style, a well-balanced mixture of contemporary French and medieval Hanseatic elements. His designs for the royal manor of [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] seasoned French prototypes with Italian elements, while retaining some peculiarly Nordic features, such as the [[hip roof|hipped roof]] (''säteritak'').

Tessin the Younger shared his father's enthusiasm for discrete palace façades. His design for the [[Stockholm Palace]] draws so heavily on Bernini's unexecuted plans for the [[Louvre]] that one could well imagine it standing in Naples, Vienna, or Saint Petersburg. Another example of the so-called International Baroque, based on Roman models with little concern for national specifics, is the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The same approach is manifested is Tessin's polychrome domeless [[:File:Kalmarer Dom aussen.jpg|Kalmar Cathedral]], a skillful pastiche of early Italian Baroque, clothed in a giant order of paired Ionic pilasters.

It was not until the mid-18th century that Danish and Russian architecture were emancipated from Swedish influence. A milestone of this late period is [[Nicolai Eigtved]]'s design for a new district of [[Copenhagen]] centred on the [[Amalienborg Palace]]. The palace is composed of four rectangular mansions, originally owned by four of Denmark's greatest noble families, arranged across the angles of an octagonal square. The restrained façades of the mansions hark back to French antecedents, while their interiors contain some of the finest Rococo decoration in Northern Europe. Amalienborg Palace has served as the residence of the [[Danish royal family]] since the late 18th century.

[[Istanbul]], once the capital of the Ottoman Empire, hosts many different varieties of Baroque architecture.
As reforms and innovations to modernize the country came out in 18th and 19th century, various architecture styles were used in Turkey, one of them was the Baroque Style. As [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish architecture]] (which is also a combination of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]) combined with Baroque, a new style called Ottoman Baroque appeared.
Baroque architecture is mostly seen in mosques and palaces built in this centuries. The [[Ortaköy Mosque]], is one of the best examples of the Ottoman Baroque architecture.

The [[Tanzimat]] Era caused more architectural development. The architectural change continued with [[Sultan Mahmud II]], one of the most reformist sultans in Turkish History. One of his sons, [[Sultan Abdülmecid]] and his family left the [[Topkapı Palace]] and moved to the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which is the first European-style palace in the country.

Baroque architecture in Istanbul was mostly used in palaces near the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Golden Horn]]. [[Beyoğlu]] was one of the places that Baroque and other European style architecture buildings were largely used. The famous streets called [[Istiklal Avenue]], [[Nişantaşı]], [[Bankalar Caddesi]] consist of these architecture style apartments.
The Ottoman flavour gives it its unique atmosphere, which also distinguishes it from the later "colonial" Baroque styles, largely used in the Middle East, especially [[Lebanon]].
Later and more mature Baroque forms in Istanbul can be found in the gates of the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which also has a very "eastern" flavour, combining Baroque, Romantic, and Oriental architecture.

'''''Breakfast time''''' or '''''Frukostdags''''' is an oil &lt;!-- on canvas --&gt; painting completed in 1887 by the Swedish artist [[Hanna Hirsch-Pauli|Hanna Pauli]] (1864–1940). It measures {{convert|91|by|87|cm}}{{r|Art project}} and currently belongs to the [[Nationalmuseum]] which bought it in 1910. The image shows a dining table standing in a garden. ''Breakfast time'' is one of the museum's most popular images, mentioned as one of the real pearls of the 1800s.{{r|Citat}}{{r|Sekelskitesparlor}}{{r|Arstiderna}}{{TOC LIMIT|2}}

==Painting==
The painting ''Breakfast time'' played a major role in Hanna Pauli's breakthrough in the Nordic art scene during the late 1880s. She had recently studied in [[Paris]] at the [[Académie Colarossi]] and entered the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1887 with the portrait of her Finnish fellow artist and sculptress Venny Soldan, which is held by the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]].{{r|Konstmuseum}}

An open-air painting, ''Breakfast time'' depicts a tranquil scene with a table set for breakfast on a sunny morning. Placed at the bottom right of the picture is a [[table (furniture)|table]] covered with a white tablecloth alongside a bench and two chairs. It is positioned under a tree with its branches stretching over the table. A maid is approaching the table carrying a [[tray]] in her hands.  The light is reflected from the shiny objects on the table and from the white [[tablecloth]]. The artist has been partly inspired by the impressionists way of suggesting volumes and depth by using coloured lights and shadows, causing the table, the [[table setting]] and the [[leaf|foliage]] to dissolve in shimmering light reflexes. The painting was popular among contemporary Swedish artists of the time.{{r|Frukostdags}}

==Style==
Hanna Pauli had an education of the wealthy middle class that adopted many of the features of noble life in 18th century, such as learning to draw and paint with watercolour. However, she decided to pursue this further and became a professional artist. Many Swedish artists of the time studied at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf art school]] and in Paris, and Pauli was also tutored there. She was mainly influenced by the work of [[Carl Larsson]], [[Peder Severin Krøyer]], [[Laurits Andersen Ring]] and French artists like  [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]]. The painting was not as popular among the broad public of the time as it was among her Nordic artist colleagues. The use of light, the vibrant brushwork applied in  intervals, separately from each other without any blending or mixture, and the light spots fields composed by broad brushwork among other things, angered many contemporary Swedish critics. They saw Hanna Pauli's techniques as too radical and a critic derisively pointed out that perhaps the thick paint on the tablecloth was there because the artist was using it to clean and dry her brushes on it.{{r|Frukostdags}}{{sfnp|Gynning|1999|p=45|ps=none}}{{r|Ingelman}}

The painting of ''Breakfast time'' was completed by Hanna Pauli by the summer of 1887; later that year, in the autumn, she became engaged to her future husband, [[Georg Pauli]], who was also an artist. When the painting was completed she was still unmarried, and the  signature is her maiden name. ''Breakfast time'' was exhibited at the World Exhibition [[in Paris]] in 1889 and [[The Chicago World's Fair]] in 1893.{{r|Frukostdags}}{{sfnp|Gynning|1994|pp=746–749|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Brummer|1997|pp=30–68|ps=none}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13919">The '''Bruce High Quality Foundation''' is an  arts collective in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], the [[United States]], which was "created to foster an alternative to everything."&lt;ref name="MGL"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/arts/design/16wart.html?pagewanted=all|title=Museum and Gallery Listings|date=2008-05-16|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is made up of five to eight rotating and anonymous members, most or all of whom are [[Cooper Union]] graduates.&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; The group has attracted attention with the subversive, humorous and erudite style of their work and operates an unaccredited art school, the Bruce High Quality Foundation University.&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt;

==History and work==
The collective was formed in 2004.&lt;ref name="BGO"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/fashion/06night.html|title=A Night Out With Members of the Bruce High Quality Foundation. And the Beat Goes On |last=Chaplin|first=Julia|date=2009-12-04|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members remain anonymous, in protest against the "star-making machinery of the art market", but it is known that they are a group of mostly men and some women, and that some of them met and became friends while studying art at [[Cooper Union]].&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt; The group is named after a fictional artist, "Bruce High Quality", who supposedly perished in the [[9/11]] attack.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/rinebold/bruce-high-quality-foundation8-20-09.asp|title=Money Talks|last=Rinebold|first=Mary|date=2009-08-20|work=artnet Magazine|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Whitney Museum]] collaborated with Minetta Brook, [[Robert Smithson]]'s estate, and [[James Cohan Gallery]] to sponsor the construction of Robert Smithson's "Floating Island", a floating island of parkland tugged around [[New York Harbor]], inspired by a 1970 drawing by Robert Smithson, entitled "Floating Island to Travel Around Manhattan Island".&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; The island, complete with living trees, was pulled by a [[tugboat]]. The Bruce High Quality Foundation responded to the event with their own performance, titled "The Gate: Not the Idea of the Thing but the Thing Itself",&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; in which members of the collective pursued the Smithson island in a small [[skiff]] carrying a model of one of the orange gates by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] that had been displayed in [[Central Park]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/artopia/2005/09/smithsons_floating_island.html|title=Smithson's Floating Island|last=Perreault|first=John|date=2005-09-21|work=Artopia: John Perreault's art diary|publisher=Arts Journal|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Public Sculpture Tackle", an ongoing work begun in 2007 and documented on video, features one of the members of the collective, wearing "quasi-football gear", climbing, hurling himself against or hanging from various public sculptures in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; In the fall of 2007, when [[Ugo Rondinone]] displayed a rainbow-coloured sign saying "Hell Yes" on the [[New Museum]], the Bruce High Quality Foundation suspended a similar sign saying "Heaven Forbid" from the building opposite.&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt;

The collective's first show in a commercial New York gallery was "The Retrospective" in 2008, employing "an implicitly satiric, reactive style".&lt;ref name="MGL" /&gt; The collective has produced a film, ''Isle of the Dead'', which was shown in 2009 at the "Plot/09 – This World &amp; Nearer Ones" exhibition organized by [[Creative Time]] on [[Governors Island]].&lt;ref name="IAI" /&gt; A send-up of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', the film chronicles the death and [[zombie]]-led revival of the art world.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAI"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/arts/design/26plot.html?pagewanted=all|title=Art Review – "Plot/09": Island as Inspiration and Canvas |last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=2009-06-25|work=New York Times|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's December 2009 show in Miami was curated by [[Vito Schnabel]], son of the artist [[Julian Schnabel]], and attended by New York's rich and famous, guests including the shipping heir [[Stavros Niarchos#Marriages|Stavros Niarchos III]], newsprint billionaire [[Peter Brant]], actor [[Stephen Dorff]] and [[John McEnroe]].&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt; The Bruce High Quality Foundation was among the artists represented at the 2010 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news.php?id=29906|title=Artists Listed For 2010 Whitney Biennial|date=2009-12-14|work=[[DesignTAXI]] |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Bruce High Quality Foundation was the subject of a retrospective at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] and exhibited work in Switzerland, Germany. London, Dubai, and Washington.
In November 2013 the group opened "Meditations", a single show in two New York galleries.  The works duplicated antiquities from the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in a Play-Doh-like modeling clay.  Later in the month, a silkscreen by the foundation, "Hooverville," depicting the New York skyline with hobos, sold for $425,000 at [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/nov-2013-contemporary-evening-n09037/lot.2.html|title=Sotheby's, 13 November 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Bruce High Quality staged "As We Lay Dying," an immersive multimedia installation including sculpture and performance at [[The Watermill Center]] on Long Island, New York.&lt;ref name="bruce1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museemagazine.com/culture/2016/8/1/the-23rd-annual-watermill-center-benefit-and-auction|title=The 23rd Annual Watermill Center Benefit and Auction|author=|date=|website=museemagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bruce2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2016/05/31/summertime-bruce-watermill-centers-summer-benefit-will-feature-bruce-high-quality-foundation/|title=Summertime Bruce: Watermill Center’s Summer Benefit Will Feature Bruce High Quality Foundation|first=M.

==The Bruce High Quality Foundation University==
In July 2009, four members of the group gave a lecture-performance at the Harris Lieberman Gallery in New York, entitled "How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Bull".&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name=MT /&gt; The title mimicked that of [[Joseph Beuys]]' 1965 performance, "How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare", with the dead [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] in the title representing economic recession.&lt;ref name=MT /&gt; Although accompanied by humorous and irreverent slides, the lecture had a serious intent, examining the current relationship between contemporary art, the art market and art schools, and ended with the question: "How can we imagine a sustainable alternative to professionalized art education?"&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt;&lt;ref name=MT /&gt;

In the fall of 2009, the group presented its own answer, by founding an unaccredited art school, the Bruce High Quality Foundation University, where "students are teachers are administrators are staff."&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/arts/design/13roberta.html|title=Artists Without Mortarboards|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=2009-09-09|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYAB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2009/0FC5|title=Events: The Bruce High Quality Foundation "University"|date=December 2009|work=NY Art Beat|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is located in downtown Manhattan, in premises made available by an unnamed benefactor.&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; Presented with partial support by public arts organization [[Creative Time]], it has offered students free classes for "an education in metaphor manipulation", the main focus of the curriculum being on art history and studio critiques.&lt;ref name="NYAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VV /&gt; Lecture topics have included "Occult Shenanigans in 20th/21st-Century Art", "What’s a Metaphor?", "The B.H.Q.F.U.

In the spring of 2013, the school re-opened in the [[Lower East Side]], Manhattan with new curricula such as "Math Wipe" by Dmitry Samochine, "Generative Design—Model Assembly" by Sanam Salek, and a class about Japanese art in Japanese language by Nozomi Kato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/03/a-quality-education-the-bruce-high-quality-foundation-university-is-in-session/|title=A Quality Education: The Bruce High Quality Foundation University is in Session|last=Duray|first=Dan|work=GalleristNY|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Bruce High Quality Foundation has been widely covered in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In September 2009, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] wrote that the group "has been best known for a sharp, well-aimed and unusually entertaining form of institutional critique."&lt;ref name=AWM /&gt; Julia Chaplin, also writing in the ''New York Times'', said in December 2009 that the group was known for its "subversive performance art, humorous videos and conceptual sculptures all infused with Ph.D. quantities of art history references" and had "become the darlings of the art world".&lt;ref name="BGO" /&gt;  In December 2013, [[Jesse McKinley]] further explained, "Devoted to the idea that an artwork should stand on its own — without the artist’s identity or biography affecting its worth — the group’s no-name ethos has, perhaps intentionally, proven to be a potent and lucrative creative tool for members and a seductive draw for collectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/arts/design/bruce-high-quality-skewers-and-seduces-the-art-world.html|title=Fake Artifact by an Unknown? Sold!|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|work=The New York Times, December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce High Quality Foundation was ranked 99 in [[ArtReview]]'s guide to the 100 most powerful figures in contemporary art: Power 100, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artreview100.com/people/749/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811181926/http://www.artreview100.com/people/749/ |archive-date=2011-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reviews of the group's work have been positive. ''[[New York Magazine]]'' derided the group's anonymous conceit as "pretentious drapery", while judging the show “Meditations” to be “kind of interestingly pretentious".&lt;ref&gt;''New York Magazine''. "The Approval Matrix", November 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Perspective==
The Bruce High Quality Foundation is part of a long history of artists using fictional identities in contemporary art, although the use of [[pseudonyms]] in the literary world has a much richer and more established tradition.

[[Rrose Sélavy]] was just one of the pseudonyms used by the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] as early as 1921.  In the late 1990s, the artist [[Walid Raad]] began constructing elaborate fictions chronicling the contemporary history of his native Lebanon, signing his work [http://www.theatlasgroup.org/ The Atlas Group] and presenting it as a body of collective scholarship.  In 2003, [[Jeff Wassmann]] launched [[Wassmann Foundation|The Wassmann Foundation]], Washington, D.C., representing the fictitious estate of the early [[Leipzig]] modernist and sewerage engineer [[Johann Dieter Wassmann]] (1841-1898).  Mr Wassmann is, in fact, a contemporary artist living in [[Melbourne, Australia]].  [[Banksy]] is the pseudonym of a [[Bristol]]-born graffiti artist and political activist working since the late 1980s.  For over twenty years Banksy has successfully hidden his identity from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/arts/design/banksy-makes-new-york-his-gallery-for-a-month.html|title=Mystery Man, Painting the Town|last=Smith|first=Roberta|work=New York Times, October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these artists scrutinize the ever-increasing presence of artist, curator and art institution alike, as brands.  In establishing artist and institution as conceits, the projects are free to explore these roles as pure brand, largely existent for critical assessment.

The Bruce High Quality Foundation University closed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School's Out Forever: Bruce High Quality Foundation University Closes, Ending an Experiment in Free Art Education|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-school-bruce-high-quality-foundation-university-1078370|website=artnet News|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chicago Society of Etchers''' was founded in January 1910, the first organization of etchers in the country. There were 20 members to start and by 1930 there were 150 members. Membership extended outside of the United States, including artists from England, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, India, China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/libraries/pubs/1930/AIC1930AmEtch20thAn_comb.pdf | title=An Exhibition of Etchings | publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago | year=1930 |page=4 | accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1909, to popularize the medium of etching, [[Bertha Jaques]] and other etchers in Chicago formed the Needle Club, an informal collective of etchers passionate about reintroducing the American public to the art of etching.&lt;ref&gt;Joby Patterson, ''Bertha E. Jaques and the Chicago Society of Etchers,'' Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 it became the Chicago Society of Etchers. The organization was primarily responsible for showing members’ etchings at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. It attracted international members and was successful at popularizing etching in 20th-century America.&lt;ref&gt;Joby Patterson, ''Bertha E. Jaques and the Chicago Society of Etchers,'' Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002 p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Society members pooled funds for annual prizes for new prints, to be gifted to the Art Institute, and tithed ten percent of their dues to the museum for new print acquisitions. The group disbanded in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Engelbrecht, Theresa Moir.

[[Ukraine]] has had an influence on the history of [[film|the cinema]]. Prominent Ukrainian [[film director|directors]] include [[Alexander Dovzhenko|Oleksandr Dovzhenko]], [[Dziga Vertov]] and [[Sergei Parajanov|Serhiy Paradzhanov]]. Dovzhenko is often cited as one of the most important early [[USSR|Soviet]] filmmakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ivan Katchanovski |author2=Zenon E. Kohut |author3=Bohdan Y. Nebesio |author4=Myroslav Yurkevich |title="Film" entry in Historical Dictionary of Ukraine|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810878471|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-h6r57lDC4QC&amp;dq=Ukraine+film}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]] and founding [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]]. In 1927 Dziga Vertov moved from Moscow to Ukraine. At the film studio [[All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration (VUFKU)|VUFKU]] he made several avant-garde documentaries, among them «The Eleventh Year», «[[Man with a Movie Camera]]» and first Ukrainian documentary sound film «Enthusiasm (Symphony of the Donbass)». Paradzhanov was an [[Armenia]]n film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] cinema; he invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema,&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite web|title=Capturing the Marvelous: Ukrainian poetic cinema|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/ukrainian-poetic-cinema|publisher=Film Society of Lincoln Center|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of [[socialist realism]].

Other important directors include [[Kira Muratova]], [[Larisa Shepitko|Larysa Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk|Serhiy Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko|Yuriy Illienko]], [[Leonid Osyka]], Vyacheslav Krishtofovich, [[Roman Balayan]],  [[Sergiy Masloboyschikov]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] and [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including [[Vera Kholodnaya|Vira Kholodna]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Sergei Makovetsky]], [[Mike Mazurki]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]] and [[Mila Kunis]]. Immigrants from Ukraine were the parents of [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Vera Farmiga|Vira Farmiga]] and [[Taissa Farmiga]], grandparents - [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Edward Dmytryk]], [[Lenny Kravitz]] and [[Zoë Kravitz]], illusionist [[David Copperfield]], animator [[Bill Tytla]].

Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of Russian and European influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shevchuk|first1=Yuri|title=Linguistic Strategies of Imperial Appropriation: Why Ukraine is absent from world film history. Ch. 22 of Contemporary Ukraine on the Cultural Map of Europe, ed. Larissa M. L. Zaleska Onyshkevych &amp; Maria G. Rewakowicz|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317473787|pages=359–374|url=https://books.google.com/?id=51TfBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Ukraine+film}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions, while Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (and formerly Soviet) films. Successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], and [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]].

The [[Ukrainian State Film Agency]] owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory and archive, and takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]]. Another festival, [[Molodist]] in [[Kiev]], is the only [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; the competition program has sections for student films, first short film, and first full feature films from all over the world. It is held annually in October.

[[File:A Time for Experimentation (38896311835).jpg|thumb|A photograph color graded into orange and teal]]
'''Color grading''' is the process of improving the appearance of an image for presentation in different environments on different devices. Various attributes of an image such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point may be enhanced whether for motion pictures, videos, or still images. Color grading and color correction are often used synonymously as terms for this process and can include the generation of artistic color effects through creative blending and composting of different images.  Color grading is generally now performed in a digital process either in a controlled environment such as a [[color suite]], or in any location where a computer can be used in dim lighting.  

The earlier [[film processing|photo-chemical film process]], now referred to as '''color timing''', was performed at a [[photographic laboratory]] by the use of filters and exposure changes while copying from one film to another.

== Color timing ==
Color timing is used in reproducing film elements.  "Color grading" was originally a lab term for the process of changing color appearance in film reproduction when going to the [[answer print]] or release print in the film reproduction chain. By the late 2010s, this film grading technique had become known as ''color timing'' and still involved changing the duration of exposure through different filters during the film development process.  Color timing is specified in [[printer point]]s which represent presets in a lab contact printer where 7-12 printer points represent one stop of light. The number of points per stop varied based upon negative or print stock and different presets at Film Labs.  

In a film production, the creative team would meet with the “Lab Timer” who would watch a running film and make notes dependent upon the team's directions.  After the session, the Timer would return to the Lab, and put the film negative on a device (the Hazeltine) which had preview filters with a controlled backlight, and pick exact settings of each printer point for each scene.  These settings were then punched onto a paper tape and fed to the high-speed printer where the negative was exposed through a backlight to a print stock.  Filter settings were changed on the fly to match the printer lights that were on the paper tape.    For complex work such as visual effects shots, "[[step wedge|wedge]]s” running through combinations of filters were sometimes processed to aid the choice of the correct grading.

This process is used wherever Film materials are being reproduced.

== Telecine ==
{{Main|Telecine}}
With the advent of television, broadcasters quickly realised the limitations of [[live television]] broadcasts and they turned to broadcasting feature films from release prints directly from a [[telecine]]. This was before 1956 when [[Ampex]] introduced the first [[Quadruplex videotape]] recorder (VTR) VRX-1000. Live television shows could also be recorded to film and aired at different times in different time zones by filming a video monitor. The heart of this system was the ''[[kinescope]]'', a device for recording a television broadcast to film.&lt;ref name="filmintovideo"&gt;Kallenberger, Richard H., Cvjetnicanin, George D. (1994). ''Film into Video: A Guide to Merging the Technologies''. Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-80215-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early telecine hardware was the "[[film chain]]" for broadcasting from film and utilized a film projector connected to a video camera. As explained by [[Jay Holben]] in ''American Cinematographer Magazine'', "The telecine didn't truly become a viable [[post-production]] tool until it was given the ability to perform colour correction on a video signal."&lt;ref name="filmtotape"&gt;Holben, Jay (May 1999). "From Film to Tape" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'', pp. 108–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How telecine coloring works ===
In a [[Cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) system, an electron beam is projected at a phosphor-coated envelope, producing a spot of light the size of a single pixel. This beam is then scanned across a film frame from left to right, capturing the "vertical" frame information. Horizontal scanning of the frame is then accomplished as the film moves past the CRT's beam. Once this photon beam passes through the film frame, it encounters a series of [[dichroic mirror]]s which separate the image into its primary red, green and blue components. From there, each individual beam is reflected onto a [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]] (PMT) where the photons are converted into an electronic signal to be recorded to tape.

In a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) [[Telecine#CCD|telecine]], a white light is shone through the exposed film image onto a [[prism]], which separates the image into the three primary colors, red, green and blue. Each beam of colored light is then projected at a different CCD, one for each color. The CCD converts the light into an electronic signal, and the telecine electronics modulate these into a video signal that can then be color graded.

Early color correction on Rank Cintel MkIII CRT [[telecine]] systems was accomplished by varying the primary gain voltages on each of the three photomultiplier tubes to vary the output of red, green and blue. Further advancements converted much of the color-processing equipment from analog to digital and then, with the next-generation telecine, the Ursa, the coloring process was completely digital in the 4:2:2 [[color space]]. The Ursa Gold brought about color grading in the full 4:4:4 color space.&lt;ref name="filmtotape"&gt;Holben, Jay (May 1999). "From Film to Tape" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'', pp. 108–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Color correction control systems started with the Rank Cintel TOPSY (Telecine Operations Programming SYstem) in 1978.&lt;ref name="filmintovideo" /&gt; In 1984 [[Da Vinci Systems]] introduced their first color corrector, a computer-controlled interface that would manipulate the color voltages on the Rank Cintel MkIII systems. Since then, technology has improved to give extraordinary power to the digital colorist. Today there are many companies making color correction control interfaces including [[Da Vinci Systems]], [[Pandora International]], [[Pandora International#Pogle color corrector|Pogle]] and [[Telecine#Controllers|more]].

Some telecines are still in operation in 2018.

== Color Correction ==
Some of the main artistic functions of color correction (digital color grading):&lt;ref name="filmintovideo" /&gt;

*Reproduce accurately what was shot
*Compensate for variations in the material (i.e., film errors, white balance, varying lighting conditions)
*Compensate for the intended viewing environment (dark, dim, bright surrounds)
*Optimize base appearance for inclusion of special visual effects
*Establish a desired artistic 'look'
*Enhance and/or alter the mood of a scene — the visual equivalent to the musical accompaniment of a film; compare also [[film tinting]]

Note that some of these functions must be prioritized over others; for example, color grading may be done to ensure that the recorded colors match those of the original scene, whereas other times, the goal may instead be to establish a very artificial stylized look.

Traditionally, color grading was done towards practical goals. For example, in the film [[Marianne (2011 film)|Marianne]], grading was used so that night scenes could be filmed more cheaply in daylight.  Secondary color correction was originally used to establish color continuity, however the trend today is increasingly moving towards creative goals, such as improving the aesthetics of an image, establishing stylized looks, and setting the mood of a scene through color.  Due to this trend, some colorists suggest the phrase "color enhancement" over "color correction".

==== Primary and secondary color grading ====
Primary color grading affects the whole image by providing control over the [[Sensitometry|color density curve]]s of red, green, blue color channels, across the entire frame. Secondary correction can isolate a range of hue, saturation and brightness values to bring about alterations in hue, saturation and luminance only in that range, allowing the grading of [[secondary color]]s, while having a minimal or usually no effect on the remainder of the color spectrum.&lt;ref name="filmintovideo" /&gt; Using [[Digital data|digital]] grading, objects and color ranges within a scene can be isolated with precision and adjusted. Color tints can be manipulated and visual treatments pushed to extremes not physically possible with laboratory processing.  With these advancements, the color correction process has become increasingly similar to well-established digital painting techniques, ushering forth a new era of [[digital cinematography]].

==== Masks, mattes, power windows ====
The evolution of digital color grading tools has advanced to the point where the colorist can use geometric shapes (such as mattes or masks in photo software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]) to isolate color adjustments to specific areas of an image. These tools can highlight a wall in the background and color only that wall, leaving the rest of the frame alone, or color everything but that wall. Subsequent color correctors (typically software-based) have the ability to use spline-based shapes for even greater control over isolating color adjustments. Color keying is also used for isolating areas to adjust.

Inside and outside of area-based isolations, digital filtration can be applied to soften, sharpen or mimic the effects of traditional glass photographic filters in nearly infinite degrees.

==== Motion tracking ====
When trying to isolate a color adjustment on a moving subject, the colorist traditionally would have needed to manually move a mask to follow the subject.  In its most simple form, motion tracking software automates this time-consuming process using algorithms to evaluate the motion of a group of pixels.  These techniques are generally derived from [[match moving]] techniques used in special effects and compositing work.

== Digital intermediate ==
{{Main|Digital intermediate}}
The evolution of the [[telecine]] device into [[Motion picture film scanner|film scanning]] allowed the digital information scanned from a film negative to be of sufficient resolution to transfer back to film.  In the early 90’s, Kodak developed the Cineon Film System to capture, manipulate, and record back to film and they called this the “Digital Intermediate”.  This term stuck.  The first Digital Intermediate of any form was the Cinesite restoration of “Snow White and The Seven Dwarves” in 1993.   [Previously in 1990 for "Rescuers Down Under", the Disney CAPS system had been used to scan artwork, color and composite it, and then record it to film,  but this was also intermixed with a traditional lab development process over a length of time]

In the late 1990s, the films ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' advanced the technology to the point that the creation of a [[digital intermediate]] was practical, which greatly expanded the capabilities of the digital telecine colorist in a traditionally film-oriented world. After 2010, almost all feature films go through the DI process, while manipulation through photochemical processing is rare or used on archival films.

In Hollywood, ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' was the first film to be wholly digitally graded. The negative was scanned with a [[Spirit DataCine]] at [[Digital cinema|2K]] resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef color corrector on a [[Virtual telecine#2k virtual DataCine products|Virtual DataCine]]. The process took several weeks, and the resulting [[digital master]] was output to film again with a Kodak laser [[Film-out|recorder]] to create a master [[internegative]].

Modern motion picture processing typically uses both digital cameras and digital projectors and calibrated devices are essential to predict whether the appropriate colors are appearing.

=== Hardware-based versus software-based systems ===
[[File:Colour grading with Scratch (18000309972).jpg|thumb|Color grading with Scratch]]
In early use, hardware-based systems (da Vinci 2K, [[Pandora International]] MegaDEF, etc.) have historically offered better performance but a smaller feature set than software-based systems. Their real time performance was optimised to particular resolution and bit depths, as opposed to software platforms using standard computer industry hardware that often trade speed for resolution independence, e.g. [[Color (software)|Apple's Color]] (previously Silicon Color Final Touch), [[ASSIMILATE SCRATCH]], [[Adobe SpeedGrade]] and [[SGO Mistika]].  While hardware-based systems always offer real-time performance, some software-based systems need to pre-render as the complexity of the color grading increases.  On the other hand, software-based systems tend to have more features such as spline-based windows/masks and advanced motion tracking.

The line between hardware and software no longer exists as many software-based color correctors (e.g. [[Pablo]] , [[Mistika]], [[SCRATCH]], [[Autodesk Lustre]], [[Nucoda Film Master]] and [[Filmlight Baselight]]) use multi processor workstations and a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] (graphics processing unit) as a means of [[hardware acceleration]].  As well, some newer software-based systems use a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs on the one computer system to improve performance at the very high resolutions required for feature film grading. e.g. Blackmagic Designs' DaVinci Resolve. Some color grading software like Synthetic Aperture's Color Finesse runs solely as software and will even run on low-end computer systems.  High-speed RAID arrays are an essential part of the process for all systems.

=== Hardware ===
{{Redirect|Pogle}}
Hardware systems are no longer common because of the excellent price/performance of software systems.   The control panels are placed in a [[color suite]] for the colorist to operate the telecine remotely.

*Many{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} telecines were controlled by a [[Da Vinci Systems]] color corrector 2k or 2k Plus. 
*Other hardware systems are controlled by Pandora Int.'s Pogle, often with either a MegaDEF, Pixi, or Revolution color grading system.
*For some real-time systems used in ‘linear’ editing, color grading systems required an edit controller. The edit controller controls the telecine and a [[VTR]](s) or other recording/playback devices to ensure frame accurate film frame [[Non-linear editing system|editing]]. There are a number of systems which can be used for edit control. Some color grading products such as Pandora Int.'s Pogle have a built-in edit controller. Otherwise, a separate device such as [[Da Vinci Systems]]' TLC edit controller would be used.
*Older systems are: Renaissance, Classic analog, [[Da Vinci Systems]]'s: The Whiz (1982) and 888; The Corporate Communications's System 60XL (1982–1989) and Copernicus-Sunburst; Bosch [[Fernseh]]'s FRP-60 (1983–1989); Dubner (1978–1985?), [[Cintel]]'s TOPSY (1978), Amigo (1983), and ARCAS (1992) systems. All of these older systems work only with [[standard-definition]] [[480i|525]] and [[576i|625]] video signals, and are considered near obsolete today.

=== Software ===

In Gilbert's model, cracks begin to form at a set of points randomly spread throughout the plane according to a [[Poisson distribution]]. Then, each crack spreads in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, with the slope of the line chosen uniformly at random. The cracks continue spreading at uniform speed until they reach another crack, at which point they stop, forming a T-junction. The result is a [[tessellation]] of the plane by irregular [[convex polygon]]s.

A variant of the model that has also been studied restricts the orientations of the cracks to be axis-parallel, resulting in a random tessellation of the plane by [[rectangle]]s.&lt;ref name="mm96"&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|Gray|Anderson|Devine|Kwasnik|1976}} write that, in comparison to alternative models in which cracks may cross each other or in which cracks are formed one at a time rather than simultaneously, "most mudcrack patterns in nature topologically resemble" the Gilbert model.

'''Gus Green Van Sant Jr.'''&lt;ref name="filmr"/&gt; (born July 24, 1952) is an American film director, screenwriter, painter, photographer, musician, and author who has earned acclaim as both an [[independent film|independent]] and [[mainstream media|mainstream]] filmmaker. His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent [[auteur]]s of the [[New Queer Cinema]] movement.

Van Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with ''[[Mala Noche]]'' (1985). His second feature ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] and [[New York Film Critics Circle]] and the award for Best Director from the [[National Society of Film Critics]]. His following film, ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991), was similarly praised, as was the [[black comedy]] ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995), the drama ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997), and the biographical film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and both films received [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nominations.

In 2003, Van Sant's film about the [[Columbine High School massacre]], ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'', won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. Van Sant also received the festival's [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]] that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen]]—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year.&lt;ref name="cannes-2003.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4071982/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Elephant |accessdate=2009-11-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000) and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' (2007), some of his efforts, such as the [[art film|art house production]] ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005) and the environmental drama ''[[Promised Land (2012 film)|Promised Land]]'' (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]'s ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'' (1994), his [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 remake]] of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', and ''[[The Sea of Trees]]'' (2015), were critical and commercial failures.

In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled [[Pink (Van Sant Novel)|''Pink'']].&lt;ref&gt;Gus Van Sant, ''Pink'', Faber &amp; Faber, 1998, {{ISBN|0-385-49353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of his photography, called ''108 Portraits'',&lt;ref&gt;Gus Van Sant, ''108 Portraits'', Twin Palms Pub., 1993, {{ISBN|0-944092-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been published, and he has released two musical albums. He is openly gay and currently lives in [[Los Feliz, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaylife.about.com/cs/gaythemedmovies/a/gusvansant.htm|title = Interview with Openly Gay Filmmaker Gus Van Sant|website = [[About.com]]|date = November 11, 2015|last = Brandao|first = Rodrigo|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160813164931/http://gaylife.about.com/cs/gaythemedmovies/a/gusvansant.htm|archivedate = August 13, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Van Sant was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of Betty (née Seay) and Gus Green Van Sant Sr; Gus's father was a clothing manufacturer and traveling salesman,&lt;ref name="filmr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant Biography (1952?-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Gus-Van-Sant.html|work=film reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=August 15, 2012|author=film reference|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rapidly worked his way into middle class prosperity, holding executive marketing positions that included being president of the [[White Stag (clothing)|White Stag Manufacturing Company]]'s Apparel Operation.&lt;ref name=changes-white-stag&gt;{{cite news|title=Changes in Management Disclosed by White Stag|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=December 5, 1969|location=Portland, Oregon|at=Section 1, p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his father's job, the family moved continually during Van Sant's childhood.

His paternal family is of partial Dutch origin; the name "Van Sant" is derived from the Dutch name "Van Zandt". The earliest Van Zandt arrived in the [[New Netherland]] area in the early 17th century, around what is now New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/gus-green-van-sant-jr/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Sant is an alumnus of [[Darien High School]] in [[Darien, Connecticut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darien High School|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/15519|work=Public School Review|publisher=Public School Review|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2003–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Catlin Gabel School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant- Biography|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/gus-van-sant/biography.html|work=Yahoo! Movies|publisher=Yahoo!, Inc|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One constant in the director's early years was his interest in visual arts (namely, painting and [[Super-8]] filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant's artistic leanings took him to the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 1970, where his introduction to various avant-garde directors inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marx|first1=Rebecca Flint|title=Gus van Sant Biography|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1982–1989: Early career===
After spending time in Europe, Van Sant went to Los Angeles in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography | work=The New York Times | title=Gus van Sant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured a job as a production assistant to filmmaker [[Ken Shapiro]], with whom he developed a few ideas, none of which came to fruition. In 1981, Van Sant made ''Alice in Hollywood'', a film about a naïve young actress who goes to Hollywood and abandons her ideals. It was never released. During this period, Van Sant began to spend time observing the denizens of the more down-and-out sections of [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. He became fascinated by the existence of this marginalized section of L.A.'s population, especially in context with the more ordinary, prosperous world that surrounded them. Van Sant would repeatedly focus his work on those existing on society's fringes, making his feature film [[directorial debut]] ''[[Mala Noche]]''.

It was made two years after Van Sant went to New York to work in an advertising agency. He saved $20,000 during his tenure there, enabling him to finance the majority of his tale of doomed love between a gay liquor store clerk and a Mexican immigrant. The film, which was taken from Portland street writer [[Walt Curtis]]' semi-autobiographical novella, featured some of the director's hallmarks, notably an unfulfilled romanticism, a dry sense of the absurd, and the refusal to treat homosexuality as something deserving of judgment. Unlike many gay filmmakers, Van Sant—who had long been openly gay—declined to use same-sex relationships as fodder for overtly political statements, although such relationships would frequently appear in his films.

Shot in black-and-white, the film earned Van Sant almost overnight acclaim on the festival circuit, with the ''Los Angeles Times'' naming it the year's best [[independent film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gus-van-sant-411096 |title=Gus Van Sant : Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's success attracted Hollywood interest, and Van Sant was briefly courted by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]; the courtship ended after Van Sant pitched a series of project ideas (including what would later become ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' and ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'') that the studio declined to take interest in.

Van Sant moved back to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he set up house and began giving life to the ideas rejected by Universal. He directed ''Drugstore Cowboy'' about four drug addicts robbing pharmacies to support their habit. The film met with great critical success and revived the career of [[Matt Dillon]].

===1990–1995: Indie and arthouse success===
''Drugstore Cowboy'''s exploration of the lives of those living on society's outer fringes, as well as its [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] setting, were mirrored in Van Sant's next effort, the similarly acclaimed ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991). Only with the success of ''Cowboy'' was Van Sant now given license to make ''Idaho'' (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now [[New Line Cinema]] had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the ''Idaho'' script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured [[River Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an [[Independent Spirit Award]] for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the [[Venice Film Festival]] among others. In addition, it helped Reeves—previously best known for his work in the ''[[Bill and Ted]]'' movies—to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him.

Van Sant's next film, a 1993 [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]' ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of $8.5&amp;nbsp;million and a large, eclectic cast including [[Uma Thurman]], [[John Hurt]], Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]] (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster.

Van Sant's 1995 film ''[[To Die For]]'' helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of [[Joyce Maynard]]'s novel, the [[black comedy]] starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars [[Matt Dillon]] as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, [[Joaquin Phoenix]], as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for [[Larry Clark]]'s ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]''; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's ''Drugstore Cowboy''.

===1997–2003: Mainstream breakout===
In 1997, Van Sant gained mainstream recognition and critical acclaim thanks to ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', which starred and was written by [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]]. The film—about a troubled, blue-collar mathematical genius—was a huge critical and commercial success. It was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s, including Best Director for Van Sant. It also won two, including Best Screenplay for Damon and Affleck, and Best Supporting Actor Oscar for [[Robin Williams]], who, in his acceptance speech, referred to Van Sant as "the mellowest man in Hollywood." Van Sant, Damon and Affleck parodied themselves and the film's success in [[Kevin Smith]]'s'' [[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.

The success of ''Good Will Hunting'' afforded Van Sant the opportunity to [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. As opposed to reinterpreting the 1960 film, Van Sant opted to recreate the film shot-for-shot, in color, with a cast of young Hollywood A-listers. His decision was met with equal parts curiosity, skepticism, and derision from industry insiders and outsiders alike, and the finished result met with a similar reception. It starred [[Anne Heche]], [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Julianne Moore]], and met with a negative critical reception and did poorly at the box office.

In 2000, Van Sant directed ''[[Finding Forrester]]'', about a high-school student ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) from [[the Bronx]] unlikely becoming a friend of a crusty, reclusive author ([[Sean Connery]]). Critical response was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/finding_forrester/|title=Finding Forrester|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to directing, he devoted considerable energy to releasing two albums and publishing a novel, ''[[Pink (novel)|Pink]]'', which was a thinly veiled exploration of his grief over River Phoenix's death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===2003–present: Return to arthouse cinema===
[[File:Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot - Press Conference.jpg|thumb|Gus Van Sant and Joaquin Phoenix at the press conference of ''[[Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot]]''. Berlinale 2018.|left]]
Van Sant traveled to the deserts of [[Argentina]], [[Utah]], and [[Death Valley]] for the production of 2002's ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', a loosely devised, largely improvised feature in which stars Matt Damon and [[Casey Affleck]]—both playing characters named Gerry—wander through the desert, discussing ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', video games, and nothing in particular. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

It took ''Gerry'' over a year to make it to theaters, in which time Van Sant began production on his next film, ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]''. Approached by [[HBO]] and producer [[Diane Keaton]] to craft a fictional film based on the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], the director chose to shoot in his hometown of Portland, employing dozens of untrained, teen actors. As well as melding improvisational long takes like those in ''Gerry'' with [[Harris Savides]]' fluid camerawork, the film was also influenced by Alan Clarke's 1989 film of the same name (see ''[[Elephant (1989 film)|Elephant]]''). The finished film provoked strong reactions from audiences at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]. At the [[Cannes]] festival, the jury awarded ''Elephant'' with their top prize, the [[Palme d'Or]], and Van Sant with his first Best Director statue from the festival.&lt;ref name="cannes-2003.com" /&gt; The success of ''Elephant'' led Van Sant to show the U.S. premiere of ''Elephant'' as a fundraiser for [[Outside In (organization)|Outside In]], an organization working to help youth living on the streets of [[Portland, Oregon]].

{{Anchor|Death Trilogy}}In 2005, Van Sant released ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'', the final component of what he refers to as his "Death Trilogy," (the other parts being ''Gerry'' and ''Elephant''). It is a fictionalized account of what happened to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] in the days leading up to his death. In 2006, Van Sant began work on ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' based on the book by [[Blake Nelson]], about a skateboarding teenager who accidentally causes someone's death. The film was released in Europe in February 2008. He also directed the "Le Marais" segment of the omnibus film ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]''.

Released in 2008, Van Sant's ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' is a biopic of [[openly gay]] San Francisco politician [[Harvey Milk]], who was assassinated in 1978 and is played by [[Sean Penn]] in the movie. The film received eight [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning two for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for Penn and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for writer [[Dustin Lance Black]].

Following ''Promised Land'', Van Sant directed a film titled ''[[Sea of Trees (film)|Sea of Trees]]'', which starred [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Ken Watanabe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">The so-called "'''Jena Symphony'''" is a [[symphony]] that was at one time attributed to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].  The symphony was discovered by [[Fritz Stein]] in 1909 in the archives of a concert society in [[Jena]], from which it derived its name. Stein believed it to be the work of Beethoven and it was so published by [[Breitkopf und Härtel]] in 1911.  It is now known that the piece was the work of [[Friedrich Witt]] (born the same year as Beethoven).

==History==

Stein thought it was quite likely an early work by Beethoven and pointed out some stylistic similarities in the preface to the score. From each of the four movements he singled out a few passages he considered especially Beethoven-like. Stein's belief in Beethoven's authorship was strengthened by the fact that Beethoven's letters show that prior to writing his own [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 1]] he tried to write a C major symphony with [[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 97 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 97]] as a model,&lt;ref&gt;N. Marston, "Symphonies" in ''The Beethoven Compendium'', ed. Barry Cooper. Ann Arbor: Borders Group (1995): 214&lt;/ref&gt; and it is easy to find parallels between the Jena Symphony and Haydn's No. 97.

When [[H. C. Robbins Landon]] found another copy of the work at the archives of [[Göttweig Abbey]] with Witt's name on it, he convinced most other scholars that the work was in fact by Witt. Ralph Leavis, for example, condemned the work as "a piece of plagiarism, put together almost with scissors and paste from reminiscences of Haydn."&lt;ref&gt;Leavis, Ralph. "Witt, Friedrich" in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Stanley Sadie, ed. Volume 20. London: Macmillan Publishers Limited (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In four movements, the symphony is scored for [[flute]], 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[French horn|horns]] in C, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, [[timpani]] and [[String section|strings]].

The first movement begins with an [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] introduction of 20 measures. A [[sonata form]] movement follows with a mostly triadic first subject group

[[Image:JenaSymSatz1Quote1.png|400px]]

and a more dance-like second subject group.

[[Image:JenaSymSatz1Quote2.png|500px]]

The exposition has a repeat (not always followed in performance). The development of just 30 measures ends with a crescendo leading directly to the recapitulation.

The second movement in [[F major]] has a central section in [[F minor]].

[[Image:JenaSymSatz2Quote.png|500px]]

The timpano in C is used in this movement (the timpani were set to C and G for the first movement and are not changed in the course of work).

The third movement is a Minuet with Trio.

[[Image:JenaSymSatz3Quote.png|500px]]

The fourth movement begins piano.

[[Image:JenaSymSatz4Quote.png|500px]]

The handling of the winds in this movement led some scholars to believe (before Robbins Landon's discovery) that perhaps this movement was in fact written by Beethoven while the rest was written by an unknown composer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">A '''juried competition''' is a [[competition]] in which participants' work is judged by a person or panel of persons convened specifically to judge the participants' efforts, either by the competition's stated [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] or by a subjective set of criteria dependent upon the nature of the competition or the judges themselves. For example, in a juried competition where participants compete against each other for a monetary prize, for inclusion in a show or publication, or for representation by a gallery, the work presented is judged by one or more persons, often experts, for such prize, inclusion, or representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juried "''juried''", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[Pastel Society of America]]'s description of its [http://pastelsocietyofamerica.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=31 Annual Exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the description of the [http://www.poetrycenter.org/node/30 Juried Reading] competition by The Poetry Center of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Image:AaronCopland.JPG|right|thumb|[[Aaron Copland]], [[Guggenheim Fellow]], 1925]]
The phrase 'juried competition' is usually used to describe creative contests: artistic and literary competitions rather than sports tournaments or academic and scholarship competitions, although such competitions have similarities. Generally, juried competitions are contests that individuals actively enter to compete for prizes, rather than events in which the competitors are passively nominated by others, such as the [[Academy Awards]] or the [[Turner Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;See the Turner Prize's [http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain/turner-prize/what-it-is What is the Turner Prize?] page describing its process.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] is an example of an award which straddles the line between a scholarship contest and a juried art competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Copland]] is an example of a 1925 [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim fellow]] who won for musical composition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase 'juried competition' is also applied to non-fine-arts contests which yet encompass distinctively creative endeavors: a [[cook-off]] is one such contest. Juried competitions also include contests in film and television, as well as [[new media]].&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;For an example of a [[new media]] competition, see: Jennifer Lee, The New York Times, November 4, 2008, ''[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/hfo-disposable-film-fest/ Art Films From Cellphones and Web Cams]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Britain's Got Talent]] and [[American Idol]] are both juried competitions, as is the [[Disposable Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

==History==
In very early juried competitions in [[Greece]], under [[Aeschylus]] and his successors, theatrical contests "advanced to a high degree of importance" and were "placed under the superintendence of" (juried by) "the magistracy".&lt;ref&gt;Buckham, Philip Wentworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IjAZAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Theatre%20of%20the%20Greeks&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Theatre of the Greeks], 1827, Chapter 3, Section 1, ''Dramatic Contests'',, p. 99 and note 3. &lt;blockquote&gt;"... a regular contest had been established before the time when Phrynichus is first mentioned ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek god [[Agôn]] personifies solemn contests.&lt;ref&gt;See Theoi Greek Mythology, [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Agon.html Agon.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]] in 1441, a public poetry competition called the [[Certame Coronario]] was held in [[Florence]] with the intention of proving that the spoken Italian language was not inferior to Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/103632/Certame-Coronario Certame Coronario], Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved September 19, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, but before the advent of the [[Internet]], national and international juried competitions were (and still are) advertised in [[Trade journal|trade publications]], with jurists selected from among the artistic or literary elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Art in America]], for example, lists a ''Call for Artists + Competitions'' section in the back of each magazine issue, (see &lt;u&gt;Art in America&lt;/u&gt;, Art Services section, ''Annual Guide 2006'', No. 7, August 2006, p.378), as does [[ARTnews]] (see &lt;u&gt;ARTnews&lt;/u&gt; Classifieds, Volume 105 Number 7, Summer 2006, p. 205.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Wide Photography Gala Awards website describes its jurors' credentials: [http://www.thegalaawards.com/jury.html Jurors.]&lt;/ref&gt; Before digitized images became widely available, competitions of visual works accepted primarily photographic [[Photographic slide|slides]] from competitors to represent the work entered because of the cost-prohibitive nature of sending and receiving whole artworks. After judging, only the selected works were sent on for public viewing if the competition included such a venue for the selected works. Written works such as poetry and prose, being less bulky, were entered in competitions via post and received in their original format.

Since the advent of  the Internet, many competitions for visual works began accepting entries in digital form as well as slide form, while literary competitions began to accept works submitted online as well as by post. The growth of the Internet also saw service firms appear offering organizational tools for juried competitions allowing for such conveniences as online storage and access of digital images.&lt;ref&gt;The 2010 [[Smithsonian]] Craft Show, for example, makes use of such a service firm for handling submitted work for the competition as detailed in the [http://www.smithsoniancraftshow.org/CFE2010/SCSApplicationInformationAndForm2010.pdf show application information process.]&lt;/ref&gt; Juried competitions also benefit from the immediacy of the Internet in that competitions listings are aggregated by some sites&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.the-art-list.com/ the-art-list.com]&lt;/ref&gt; making such listings more widely accessible than when they were enumerated primarily in trade publications. Some juried competitions in art and literature exist entirely online, or both online and in print.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.abstractexposure.com/ Abstract EXPOsure], [http://www.art-interview.com/ The Art Interview - 18th International Online Artist Competition], [[New Scientist]]'s [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17779-new-scientist-flash-fiction-competition-2009.html Flash fiction competition], and the [http://www.unaoc.org/pluralplus/ PLURAL+ Video Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurgan stelae''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: {{lang|mn|хүн чулуу}}; [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|каменные бабы}}; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: {{lang|uk|Баби кам'яні}} "stone [[:wikt:баба|babas]]"; {{lang-ky|балбал}} {{IPA-ky|bɑlbɑl|}})  or '''Balbals''' ({{lang|uk|балбал}} ''balbal'', most probably from a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''{{lang|tr|balbal}}'' meaning "ancestor" or "grandfather"&lt;ref&gt;O. D. Forostyuk, Луганщина релігійна, Lugansk, Світлиця, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Mongolic word "barimal" which means "handmade statue") are [[anthropomorphic]] stone [[stela]]e, images cut from stone, installed atop, within or around [[kurgan]]s (i.e. [[tumuli]]), in kurgan cemeteries, or in a double line extending from a kurgan. The stelae are also described as "obelisks" or "[[statue menhir|statue]] [[menhir]]s".

Spanning more than three millennia, they are clearly the product of various cultures. The earliest are associated with the [[Pit Grave culture]] of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] (and therefore with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] according to the mainstream [[Kurgan hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, ''[[The Horse, The Wheel and Language|The Horse, The Wheel and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Iron Age]] specimens are identified with the [[Scythians]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] examples with [[Turkic peoples]].

Such stelae are found in large numbers in [[Southern Federal District|Southern Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Prussia]], southern [[Siberia]], [[Central Asia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Mongolia]].

==Purpose==

Anthropomorphic stelae were probably memorials to the honoured dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasily Radlov|W.Radloff]]: "stone obelisk in honour of deceased." [[Leonid Kyzlasov]]: "a vertically anchored stone near a memorial structure, symbolizing a killed enemy" (Kyzlasov, 1966, 207, 208) (cited after Shipova E.N., 'Dictionary of Turkisms In Russian', p. 55).&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in the context of burials and funeral sanctuaries from the [[Eneolithic]] through to the [[Middle Ages]]. Ivanovovsky reported that Tarbagatai Torgouts ([[Kalmyks]]) revered kurgan obelisks in their country as images of their ancestors, and that when a bowl was held by the statue, it was to deposit a part of the ashes after the [[cremation]] of the deceased, and another part was laid under the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanovovsky, ''Congres internationale d'Archeologie prehistorique'', (Moscow, 1892), vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

When used architecturally, stelae could act as a system of stone fences, frequently surrounded by a moat, with [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] hearths, sometimes tiled on the inside.

==History and distribution==
[[File:Anthropomorphic stele no 25, Sion, Petit-Chasseur necropolis 13.jpg|thumb|225px|Stele #25 from the [[Petit Chasseur]] in [[Sion, Switzerland]], dating from 2700&amp;ndash;2150&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The earliest anthropomorphic stelae date to the [[4th millennium BC]], and are associated with the early [[Bronze Age]] [[Yamna culture|Yamna]] Horizon, in particular with the [[Kemi Oba culture]] of the Crimea and adjacent steppe region.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory and D. Q. Adams, "Kemi Oba Culture", ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), pp. 327–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in Ukraine number around three hundred, most of them very crude stone slabs with a simple schematic protruding head and a few features such as eyes or breasts carved into the stone. Some twenty specimens, known as [[statue menhir]]s, are more complex, featuring ornaments, weapons, human or animal figures.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory and D. Q. Adams, "Kemi Oba Culture", ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), pp. 544–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple, early type of anthropomorphic stelae are also found in the Alpine region of Italy, southern France and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harrison and Volker Heyd, The Transformation of Europe in the Third Millennium BC: the example of ‘Le Petit-Chasseur I + III’ (Sion, Valais, Switzerland), ''Praehistorische Zeitschrift'', vol. 82, no. 2 (2007), pp. 129–214; John Robb, People of stone: stelae, personhood and society in prehistoric Europe, ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', vol. 16, no. 3 (September 2009), pp. 162–183.[http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/35317769/Robb_JAMT_figurine_article.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1482257275&amp;Signature=oTS%2BIUeRw1W6CvZaEmLbrdm7sVM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPersons_of_stone_stelae_personhood_and_s.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples have also been found in [[Bulgaria]] at Plachidol, Ezerovo,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Anthony, ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'' (2007), fig.13.11. (misprint "Yezevoro")&lt;/ref&gt; and Durankulak.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Manzura, The Proto-Bronze Ace cemetery at Durakukak: a look from the east, in Lolita Nikolova, John Fritz and Jude Higgins (eds.), ''Prehistoric Archaeology and Anthropological Theory and Education''. RPRP 6-7 (2005), p. 5155.[http://www.iianthropology.org/files/IgorDurankulak.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The example illustrated above was found at Hamangia-Baia, Romania.

The distribution of later stelae is limited in the west by the Odessa district, Podolsk province, Galicia, Kalisz province, Prussia; in the south by [[Kacha River]], Crimea; in the south-east by [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]] in the Stavropol province and Kuban region; in the north by [[Minsk Voblast|Minsk province]] and Oboyan district of the [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk province]] (in some opinions even the Ryazan province), Ahtyr district in the [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkov province]], [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh province]], Balash and Atkar districts in the [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov province]] to the banks of [[Samara River]] in Buzuluk districts in the [[Samara Oblast|Samara province]], in the east they are spread in the [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] ([[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]]) steppe to the banks of the [[Irtysh River]] and to Turkestan (near [[Issyk Kul]], Tokmak district), then in upper courses of rivers [[Tom River|Tom]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], in Sagai steppe in Mongolia (according to Potanin and Yadrintseva).

The [[Cimmerian]]s of the early 1st millennium BC left a small number (about ten are known) of distinctive stone stelae. Another four or five "[[deer stone]]s" dating to the same time are known from the northern Caucasus.

From the 7th century BC, [[Scythian]] tribes began to dominate the Pontic steppe. They were in turn displaced by the [[Sarmatian]]s from the 2nd century BC, except in [[Crimea]], where they persisted for a few centuries longer. These peoples left carefully crafted stone stelae, with all features cut in [[relief|deep relief]].

Early [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] stelae are again more primitive. There are some thirty sites of the middle [[Dniestr]] region where such anthropomorphic figures were found. The most famous of these is the [[Zbruch Idol]] (c. 10th century), a post measuring about 3&amp;nbsp;meters, with four faces under a single pointed hat (c.f. [[Svetovid]]). [[Boris Rybakov]] argued for identification of the faces with the gods [[Perun]], [[Makosh]], [[Lado (deity)|Lado]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]].

==Anthropomorphic stelae of the Near East==

Bronze Age anthropomorphic funerary stelae have been found in Saudi Arabia. There are similarities to the Kurgan type in the handling of the slab-like body with incised detail, though the treatment of the head is rather more realistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/exposition/detail_exposition.jsp;jsessionid=NTGv5RRCf05W3fWwZ4XCbpWJ7yP6RpBxTrv6CdBGphqTL8G56nx0!-17078697?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;CURRENT_LLV_EXPO%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;pageId=2&amp;bmLocale=en Roads of Arabia – Archaeology and History of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615190022/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/exposition/detail_exposition.jsp;jsessionid=NTGv5RRCf05W3fWwZ4XCbpWJ7yP6RpBxTrv6CdBGphqTL8G56nx0!-17078697?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;CURRENT_LLV_EXPO%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;pageId=2&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }};[http://www.arabian-archaeology.com/arch4bronze.htm Arabian Archaeology: Bronze Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropomorphic stelae so far found in Anatolia appear to post-date those of the [[Kemi Oba culture]] on the steppe and are presumed to derive from steppe types. A fragment of one was found in the earliest layer of deposition at [[Troy]], known as Troy I.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Anthony,'' The Horse, The Wheel and Language'' (2007), p. 339 and fig. 13.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen stone stelae, of a type similar to those of the Eurasian steppes, were found in 1998 in their original location at the centre of [[Hakkâri]], a city in the south eastern corner of Turkey, and are now on display in the Van Museum. The stelae were carved on upright flagstone-like slabs measuring between 0.7&amp;nbsp;m to 3.10&amp;nbsp;m in height. The stones contain only one cut surface, upon which human figures have been chiseled. The theme of each stele reveals the fore view of an upper human body. Eleven of the stelae depict naked warriors with daggers, spears, and axes-masculine symbols of war. They always hold a drinking vessel made of skin in both hands. Two stelae contain female figures without arms. The earliest of these stelae are in the style of bas relief while the latest ones are in a linear style. They date from the 15th to the 11th century BC and may represent the rulers of the kingdom of [[Hubushkia]], perhaps derived from a Eurasian steppe culture that had infiltrated into the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0007/abstracts/stela.html Veli Sevin, Mystery Stelae, ''Archaeology'', Volume 53, Number 4, (July/August 2000)]; [[Antonio Sagona]], ''The Heritage of Eastern Turkey: from earliest settlements to Islam'' (2006), pp. 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==

European traveler [[William of Rubruck]] mentioned them for the first time in the 13th century, seeing them on kurgans in the Cuman ([[Kipchak people|Kipchak]]) country, he reported that Cumans installed these statues on tombs of their deceased. These statues are also mentioned in the 17th-century "Large Drawing Book", as markers for borders and roads, or orientation points. In the 18th century information about some kurgan stelae was collected by Pallas, Falk, Guldenshtedt, Zuev, Lepekhin, and in the first half of the 19th century by Klaprot, Duboa-de-Montpere and Spassky (''Siberian obelisks''). Count [[Aleksey Uvarov]], in the 1869 ‘‘Works of the 1st Archeological Congress in Moscow'' (vol. 2), assembled all available at that time data about kurgan obelisks, and illustrated them with drawings of 44 statues.

Later in the 19th century, data about these statues was gathered by A.I. Kelsiev, and in Siberia, [[Turkestan]] and Mongolia by Potanin, Pettsold, Poyarkov, [[Vasily Radlov]], Ivanov, Adrianov and Yadrintsev, in Prussia by Lissauer and Gartman.

==Numbers==
The [[State Historical Museum|Historical museum in Moscow]] has 30 specimens (in the halls and in the courtyard); others are in [[Kharkov]], [[Odessa]], [[Novocherkassk]], etc. These are only a small part of examples dispersed in various regions of Eastern Europe, of which multitudes were already destroyed and used as construction material for buildings, fences, etc.

In the 1850s Piskarev, summing all information about kurgan obelisks available in literature, counted 649 items, mostly in [[Dnipro|Ekaterinoslav]] [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|province]] (428), in [[Taganrog]] (54), in [[Crimea]] province (44), in [[Kharkov]] (43), in the [[Don Cossacks]] land (37), in [[Yenisei]] province, Siberia (12), in [[Poltava]] (5), in [[Stavropol]] (5), etc.; but many statues remained unknown to him.

==Appearance==
[[File:Scythian stelae 01.jpg|thumb|Collection of drawings of Scythian stelae of the 6th to 5th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;redrawn from [[Boris Rybakov|B. A. Rybakov]],  Язычество древней Руси ("Paganism of Ancient Rus", 1987, fig. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Baba 15.jpg|thumb|right|Kurgan stele (baba) near [[Luhansk]]]]
Scythian balbals, later [[Cumans|Kuman]], commonly depict a warrior holding a [[drinking horn]] in their upraised right hand.&lt;ref&gt;40 out of a total of 137 anthropomorphic stelae described by Ol'chovskij and Evdokimov (1994:67,69 table 14) include the depiction of a drinking horn.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many also show a sword or dagger suspended on the warrior's belt.

Writing about Altai kurgans, [[Lev Gumilev|L.N. Gumilev]] states: "To the east from the tombs are standing chains of balbals, crudely sculpted stones implanted in the ground. Number of balbals at the tombs I investigated varies from 0 to 51, but most often there are 3–4 balbals per tomb". Similar numbers are also given by L. R. Kyzlasov.&lt;ref name = "Kyzlasov"&gt;Kyzlasov L.R. Tuva... p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; They are memorials to the feats of the deceased, every balbal represents an enemy killed by him. Many tombs have no balbals. Apparently, there are buried ashes of women and children.

Balbals have two clearly distinct forms: conic and flat, with shaved top. Considering the evidence of [[Orkhon inscriptions]] that every balbal represented a certain person, such distinction cannot be by chance. Likely here is marked an important ethnographic attribute, a headdress. The steppe-dwellers up until present wear a conic 'malahai', and the Altaians wear flat round hats. The same forms of headdresses are recorded for the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Gumilev L.N. Statuettes...)." "We can note that fight against steppe was more successful, as from 486 balbals we investigated, 329 were conical, and 157 flat." "Sudden raids on the steppe pastures were more successfully than endless struggle with moutaineers, who knew each tree in the forest and each rock in the gorges. Maybe this is a reason why the flat-headed balbals, as a rule, are more massive than conical" [[Lev Gumilev|Gumilev L.N.]], ''"Ancient Türks"'', Moscow, 1993, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;
Another observation of [[Lev Gumilev]]: "From the Tsaidam salt lakes to the Kül-tegin monument leads a three-kilometer chain of balbals. To our time survived 169 balbals, apparently there were more. Some balbals are given a crude likeness with men, indicated are hands, a hint of a belt. Along the moat toward the east runs a second chain of balbals, which gave I. Lisi a cause to suggest that they circled the fence wall of the monument. However, it is likely that it is another chain belonging to another deceased buried earlier".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Gumilev|Gumilev L.N.]], ''"Ancient Türks"'', Moscow, 1993, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Some kurgan [[obelisks]] are found still standing on kurgans, others were found buried in the slopes. Not always can be stated if they were contemporary with the kurgans on which they stand, existed earlier, or were carved later and lifted onto the kurgan. Kurgan obelisks are of [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[granite]], etc. Their height is from 3.5&amp;nbsp;m to 0.7&amp;nbsp;m, but more often 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;m. Some of them are simple stone columns, with a rough image of a human face, on others the head (with the narrowed neck) is clearly depicted; in most cases not only the head is depicted, but also body, arms, and frequently both legs, and [[Headgear|headdress]], and dress. On more crude statues is impossible to dissern sex, but mostly it is expressed clearly: men are with [[moustaches]] (sometimes with beard, one bearded kurgan obelisk is in the courtyard of the Historical Museum in [[Moscow]]), in a costume with metal [[breastplate]]s and [[Belt (clothing)|belts]], sometimes with a [[sword]], etc.; women are with bared breasts, wearing peculiar headdresses, with [[girdle]]s or [[necklace]]s on the neck, etc.

Other obelisks show figures completely naked and usually only their head is covered, and legs are shod. Kurgan statues are sitting (frequently females), and standing (mostly males); in both cases the legs are not depicted. If the legs are depicted, they are either barefoot, or more often shoed, in high or low [[boots]] ('bashmaks'), sometimes with distinguishable [[trousers]] with ornaments. Many female kurgan obelisks (and some male) are naked above the belt, but below a belt and dress are visible, sometimes two dresses, one longer underneath, and another on the top, as a semi-'[[kaftan]]' or a short furcoat, with appliques and inserts (the ornaments of inserts consist of geometrical lines, double spirals, etc., or even [[cuirass]]). Others have stripes on the shoulders, many have two stripes (seldom three, or one wide across), plates (apparently, metal) on the breast attached to a belt or, more often, to two belts. On the belt sometimes is possible to distinguish a [[buckle]] in the middle or thongs hanging from it with sometimes attached bag, a round metal pocket [[mirror]], [[knife]], [[comb]], sometimes also is shown (male statues) a [[dagger]] or a straight sword, a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], a ‘kolchan’ ([[quiver]]), a hook, an [[axe]]. On the neck the men wear a metal band, women wear a necklace of beads or scales, sometimes even 2 or 3 are visible, some have a wide tape or a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] dropping from the [[necklace]], ending with a 4-corner cloth. On the hands, wrists and shoulders (especially for nude figures) are [[bracelet]]s (rings) and cuffs, in the ears, for women and men, are [[earrings]], on the head (forehead) sometimes is an ornamental bandage or a [[diadem]]. The female [[braid]]s can not always be distinguished from [[ribbon]]s or [[bandage]]s, they also are depicted for men. In some cases the male hat undoubtedly represents a small [[helmet]] (‘misyurka’), sometimes with crossing metal strips. The female [[headdress]] is more diverse, like a hat with curved brims, ‘bashlyk’, Kyrgyz (Kazakh) hat, etc.

The type of the [[face]] is not always depicted clearly. The vast majority of women join hands on the navel or at the bottom of the stomach, and hold a vessel, frequently cylindrical, like a cup or a glass. Sometimes it is so blurred that it can be taken for a folded [[scarf]]. One male figurine holds a [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]] in the left hand, and a sword in the right; and another has hands simply joined together, without a bowl, one female figurine holds a ring, some hold a [[rhyton]] (drinking horn).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5260">'''''Little Cherry''''' ({{zh|c=小樱桃|p=Xiǎo Yīng Táo}}) is a Chinese media franchise created by Yangshang Jun. Owned by the [[Zhengzhou]]-based Xiao Ying Tao Comics Company, it is primarily comedy [[manhua]] featuring a girl whose name is also Little Cherry. The "Xiao Ying Tao" name in the media works and the company is sometimes abbreviated '''XOYTO'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Animation “Xoyto” Goes Overseas|url=http://www.cmmintelligence.com/media-news/2008-11-18/chinese-animation-%E2%80%9Cxoyto%E2%80%9D-goes-overseas|accessdate=2016-02-07|work=Chinese Media Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Little Cherry character was created in the late 1990s while Yangshang Jun worked for the magazine ''Comics Monthly'' (漫画月刊). The comics originally appeared in the ''[[Southern Weekly]]'' newspaper and other media, and gained popularity in few months. Yangshang exited her job for a freelance one on September 1999. On August 2000, the Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House published the first Little Cherry comic book volumes which initially sold out. In the next month, Yangshang registered the Zhengzhou Little Cherry Cartoon Art Co. At one point there was a circulation of 17 million comic book copies. Derivative works and products included beverages, [[Flash animation]], and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Wei|title=樱桃女孩的品牌长征|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/leadership/brandmanage/20071212/12004281807.shtml|accessdate=2017-10-11|work=Sina Finance|date=2007-12-12|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Han|first1=Xiaodou|title=“樱桃女孩”杨尚君:爱就住在我心里|url=http://www.xzbu.com/6/view-2223786.htm|accessdate=2017-10-11|work=Xzbu.com|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fan|first1=Junqiang|title=杨尚君:杨家“樱桃”初长成|url=http://www.xzbu.com/7/view-8403605.htm|accessdate=2017-10-11|work=Xzbu.com|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a 26 episode animated television series adaptation debuted on [[China Central Television|CCTV]]. The second season premiered on July 2010, in which at that time the third season was reportedly in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xiang|first1=Chen|title=《小樱桃2》央视首播，图书出版权落入湘少社囊中|url=http://www.gmw.cn/01ds/2010-07/28/content_1206349.htm|accessdate=2016-02-07|work=Guangming Daily (China)|date=2010-07-28|language=Chinese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924094403/http://www.gmw.cn/01ds/2010-07/28/content_1206349.htm|archivedate=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the ''Little Cherry Rescue Angels'' comic received the Golden Dragon Award for best children's comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=《小樱桃·拯救天使》获中国漫画最高奖|url=http://news.163.com/12/1008/01/8D8PMCJ700014AED.html|accessdate=2016-02-07|publisher=NetEase|date=2012-10-08|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism controversy==
Media sources including [[Sina Corp|Sina]] Games and Taiwan-based ''[[Liberty Times]]'' have included comparisons between the ''Little Cherry'' animated series and the Japanese manga and anime series ''[[Chibi Maruko-chan]]'', such as their similar titles, in articles about alleged plagiarism in Chinese animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Sheng|title=「櫻桃小丸子」成了「小櫻桃和小丸子」，國產動畫山寨風能不能停|url=https://kknews.cc/comic/z6nao3.html|accessdate=2016-09-19|work=kknews.cc|date=2016-06-30|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=有作品就補貼 中國姑息山寨動畫|url=http://ent.ltn.com.tw/news/breakingnews/1377577|accessdate=2016-09-19|work=Liberty Times Net|date=2015-07-13|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=山寨国产动画盘点 秒速五帧的抄袭速度|url=http://games.sina.com.cn/wjzx/bgqw/2015-04-24/doc-icczmvup0258833.shtml|accessdate=2016-09-19|work=Sina Games|date=2015-04-24|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Señor de la Capilla, Tequixquiac (2).jpg|thumb|250px|Señor de la Capilla]]

The '''Lord of the Chapel''', (in Spanish as ''Señor de la Capilla'' and [[Otomi language|Otomi]] as ''Zidada Nikjä''), is a statue of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] from [[Santiago Apóstol Parish (Tequixquiac)|Saint James Apostle parish]] in [[Santiago Tequixquiac]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM15mexico/municipios/15096a.html] Tequixquiac, INADEP.&lt;/ref&gt; The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by illness and epidemics with Indigenous people. It became the [[patron saint]] of Santiago Tequixquiac, and is one of the most well-known images in Mexico State. It was probably created in Actopan ex-monastery by native artists around 1570, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The author is unknown and belongs to the Spanish colonial period.

The Christ image dates from the first half of the seventeenth century and measures 1.73 meters high. There is a strong relationship with Cryptojudaism because in this town its first Iberian inhabitants were Sephardic converts to Christianity arrived with [[Hernán Cortés]]; in the face of the image are very obvious a Rabbinical signs, one of them are [[payot]]s or cailers in the hair.

[[File:Señor de la Capilla por las calles de Tequixquiac.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Procession by [[Santiago Tequixquiac]]]]
During the Spanish colonial period, several Christs, carved with cane paste, were sculpted; it was an indigenous sculptural tradition that prevailed in New Spain when constructing lighter religious images; These Christs were in various parishes of the region, one in El Arenal, Actopan (Lord of the Wonders), anothers in the village of Visitación (Lord of Tlapala), in Amecameca (Lord of the Sacromonte) and other in Chalma (Lord of Chalma). This image was inside a chapel in Saint Francis parish, in the town of Apaxco that later the image was moved to the people from Tequixquiac until our days.

== Description ==
The image has a cross made of walnut and details of ivory called tablets that were brought from the Philippines.

'''''Love's Messenger''''' is an 1885 [[watercolor]] by [[Marie Spartali Stillman]] in which a dove has just carried a [[love letter]] to a woman standing in front of an open window. She wears a red rose, and has just put down her [[embroidery]] of a blind-folded [[Cupid]].&lt;ref name="DAM Treasures"&gt;{{cite book

The painting, paper mounted on wood, was purchased in 1901 by [[Samuel Bancroft]] and is now in the [[Delaware Art Museum]].

==The painting==
''Love's Messenger'' reflects the influence of both early [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painting and [[Italian Renaissance painting]]. The symbols portrayed in the painting, including the dove, rose, ivy, and the blind-folded Cupid "suggest constancy, fidelity, and loveliness in full bloom," but also suggest "beauty on the cusp of decay, sensuality, and the pain Cupid's arrows may inflict."  The presence of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is shown by the rose and the dove, so that the "scene may offer a contrast between the beauty, love, and abundance of Venus and the sensuality and unpredictability of her son Cupid."&lt;ref name = Dreams/&gt;

The artist modestly described the painting in 1906:
{{blockquote|I wish I could tell you something interesting about my pictures at Mr. Bancroft's [,] they are merely studies of heads done for the pleasure of painting.  The effect of a fair head in a certain bull's eye window of a friend's studio where I was working one winter suggested Love's messenger - that is all... [''Love's Messenger''] is merely a study from a model.  My daughter Effie who was then at school [was] not able to sit for me to complete it from her.  I painted a landscape from the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]] Rome as the background when I made several changes in the picture while in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Waking Dreams, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critic [[Jan Marsh]] suggests that the studio with the bull's eye windows may have been in [[Edward Burne-Jones]]'s house "The Grange" in [[Fulham]].&lt;ref name = Dreams/&gt;

== Provenance and exhibitions==
The artist exhibited the painting at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London in 1885. This gallery is considered to have been a crucial outlet for Stillman's works and ''Love's Messenger'' is considered one of the most important works she displayed there in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Grosv"&gt;{{cite book

Samuel Bancroft, Jr. purchased the painting in 1901 for £100, after seeing it at the house of the artist's daughter Effie (Euphrosyne) Stillman.&lt;ref name = Dreams/&gt;  It was then exhibited in [[Philadelphia]] (1901), before being donated to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] (then known as the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts) in 1935.

The '''''Monument to the laboratory mouse'''''  is a sculpture in the city of [[Novosibirsk]] in Siberia, [[Russia]]. It is located in a park in front of the [[Institute of Cytology and Genetics]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and was completed on July 1, 2013, coinciding with the 120th anniversary of the founding of the city.

According to Nikolai Kolchanov, the director of the institute, the monument commemorates the sacrifice of the mice in genetic research used to understand biological and physiological mechanisms for developing new drugs and curing of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/01/17/a-monument-to-laboratory-rats.html|title= A monument to laboratory rats and mice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The monument, which sits on a [[granite]] pedestal, is of a laboratory [[mouse]] wearing pince-nez on the tip of its nose. The mouse holds knitting needles in its paws and is shown knitting a double helix of [[DNA]]. The bronze figure is itself only 70 cm (27½”) high, but the total height of the monument including the pedestal is 2.5 meters (98"). As a point of interest, the DNA spiral emerging from the knitting needles winds to the left, thus showing that it is the still poorly understood [[Z-DNA]] - this symbolic of scientific research that is still to be done.{{cn|date=August 2018}} In contrast, the basic form, [[B- DNA]], the form as it is depicted in school lessons, winds to the right. Schoolchildren visiting the monument are often asked what is unusual about the DNA spiral that the mouse is knitting.

==The background to the statue==
The foundation stone of the monument was laid on June 1, 2012 in honor of the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics. The design for the mouse was the creation of the [[Novosibirsk]] artist Andrey Kharkevich, who made more than ten sketches before settling on a final design. It was from among the different versions of the classic and stylized image animals that a mouse knitting the DNA helix was selected.

Andrei Kharkevich described the statue as: "Here, the images of a laboratory mouse and a scientist are combined because they are connected to each other and serve one cause. The mouse is shown at the exact time of scientific discovery. If you peer into its eyes, you can see that this mouse has already invented something. But the whole symphony of scientific discovery, joy, "Eureka!" has not yet sounded."

Sculptor Alexei Agrikolyansky, who made the statue, confessed that it had not been easy to capture that moment as the mouse was obviously not human and yet he had to produce a character and emotions for the mouse that were believable and, while maintaining the anatomical proportions, create something that neither looked like a cartoon character nor a real mouse.

The sculpture was cast from bronze in [[Tomsk]] by Maxim Petrov.

'''Motif''' is a word used by folklorists who analyze, interpret, and describe the traditional elements found in the lore of particular [[folkloristics|folk groups]] and compare the folklore of various regions and cultures of the world based on these motif patterns. Ultimately, folklorists identify motifs in folklore to interpret where, how, and why these motifs are used, so they can understand the values, customs, and ways of life of unique cultures.

In cultural anthropology and [[folkloristics]], the meaning of ''motif'' encompasses the meanings of ''motif'' used in the areas of [[Motif (music)|music]], [[Motif (narrative)|literary criticism]], [[Motif (visual arts)|visual arts]], and [[Motif (textile arts)|textile arts]] because folklorists study motifs (i.e., recurring elements) in each of these areas, motifs that create recognizable patterns in [[folkloristics|folklore]] and folk-art traditions.

==Thompson’s ''Motif-Index''==

Folklorists also use ''motif'' to refer to the recognizable and consistently repeated [[Motif (narrative)|story elements]] (e.g., common characters, objects, actions, and events) that are used in the traditional plot structures, or [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|tale types]], of many stories and folktales. These motifs, which Dr. Margaret Read Macdonald calls “each small part of a tale,”&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"&gt;Read MacDonald, Margaret. 1982. The Storyteller’s Sourcebook: A Subject, Title, and Motif Index for Folklore Collections for Children (First Edition). Detroit: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; were indexed in 1932 by [[Stith Thompson]] and published as the ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature''.&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"/&gt;

Thompson built upon the research of [[Antti Aarne]] (and the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|tale type index]] he created) when he compiled, classified, and numbered the traditional motifs of the mostly European folktale types in Aarne’s index and then cross referenced those motifs with Aarne’s tale types (Dundes).&lt;ref name="Dundes"&gt;Dundes, Alan. 1997. “The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique.” ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'' 34(3): 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist Alan Dundes explains that Stith Thompson’s “six-volume ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature'' and the Aarne-Thompson tale type index constitute two of the most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis”.&lt;ref name="Dundes"/&gt;

==Comparing motifs with tale types==

In the book ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_folktale.html?id=WKN44RtM_loC The Folktale]'', folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] explains how motifs and tale types are interrelated as he describes the role of one type of character found in many folk narratives, the helper:

:The '''chain of circumstances''' by which this helper joins the hero '''and certain details of his later experience''' are so uniform and well articulated as to '''form an easily recognizable motif, or rather cluster of motifs.''' This fact has caused some confusion to scholars who have not sufficiently distinguished between such a motif and the entire tale of which it forms only an important part. (emphasis added, 1977, 50)&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Stith. 1977. ''The Folktale''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The same is true for any character or other motif. In fact, Thompson also explains that a single motif may be found in numerous folktales “from all parts of the earth” (383).&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

Thompson’s explanations show that the sequential order of motifs is also an important factor for folklorists to consider as they interpret individual motifs found in various folktale types used internationally.

==Accessing Thompson's ''Motif-Index''==

Many of the source texts in Thompson's ''Motif-Index'' are no longer currently in print. Dr. Margaret Read McDonald's ''Storytellers Sourcebook''&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"/&gt;  refers readers to stories in current books that also use motifs of folk literature. For example, Disney’s ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' contains many of the same traditional motifs that Read MacDonald points out in her preface to ''The Storyteller’s Sourcebook'' (e.g., Glass slipper, Cruel Stepmother, and Three-fold flight from ball) (x).&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"/&gt;

==Other motif indices==
Many folklorists have produced extensive motif and tale-type indices for culture areas not covered by Thompson, or covered only to a limited extent. For surveys, see

==Special usage==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), folkloristic use of ''motif'' is not summed up in the definition for literary criticism (“Motif,” def. 3a), but deserves its own separate sense of this definition (“Motif,” def. 3b).&lt;ref&gt;“Motif.” Def. 3a and 3b. 2008. ''Oxford English Dictionary Online Database''. 3rd ed. Oxford,  Oxford UP, 1989. Brigham Young University. Web. 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the compound word ''motif index'' is used in [[cultural anthropology]] to denote “an index of standard motifs, esp. those found in folk tales” (''OED'', “Motif Index,” def. C2).&lt;ref&gt;“Motif Index.” Def. C2. 2008. Oxford English Dictionary Online Database. 3rd ed. Oxford,  Oxford UP. Brigham Young University. Web. 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruba'is by Hafiz - Nasta'liq script.jpg|thumb|some verses in Persian [[nasta'liq]] script, probably always a single page meant for a ''muraqqa''; 16-17th century]]

A '''Muraqqa''' ({{lang-tr|Murakka}}, {{lang-ar|مورّقة}}, {{lang-fa|مُرَقّع}}) is an album in book form containing Islamic miniature paintings and specimens of [[Islamic calligraphy]], normally from several different sources, and perhaps other matter.  The album was popular among collectors in the Islamic world, and by the later 16th century became the predominant format for miniature painting in the Persian [[Safavid]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s, greatly affecting the direction taken by the painting traditions of the [[Persian miniature]], [[Ottoman miniature]] and [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;Froom. (2001), 1.; Rizvi, 800&lt;/ref&gt;  The album largely replaced the full-scale illustrated manuscript of classics of [[Persian poetry]], which had been the typical vehicle for the finest miniature painters up to that time.  The great cost and delay of commissioning a top-quality example of such a work essentially restricted them to the ruler and a handful of other great figures, who usually had to maintain a whole workshop of calligraphers, artists and other craftsmen, with a librarian to manage the whole process.  An album could be compiled over time, page by page, and often included miniatures and pages of calligraphy from older books that were broken up for this purpose, and allowed a wider circle of collectors access to the best painters and calligraphers, although they were also compiled by, or presented to, shahs and emperors.  The earliest ''muraqqa'' were of pages of calligraphy only; it was at the court in [[Herat]] of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince [[Baysunghur]] in the early 15th century that the form became important for miniature painting.  The word ''muraqqa'' means "that which has been patched together" in [[Farsi|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;Froom, 1-2; Thackston, vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The works in an album, typically of different original sizes, were trimmed or mounted on standard size pages, often with new border decoration being added. When the compilation was considered complete it was bound, often very luxuriously, with an [[Islamic book-cover]] that might be highly decorated with [[lacquer]]ed paint, gold stamping on leather, or other techniques.  Other ''muraqqa'' might be bound in a special [[concertina]]-like form.  Many were arranged with pages of calligraphy facing miniatures, the matching of verse to image allowing some scope for the creativity of the compiler.&lt;ref&gt;A regular theme of prefaces - see Roxburgh, 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums containing only calligraphy tended to be arranged chronologically to show the development of a style.  The bindings of many albums allowed items to be added and removed, or they were just removed from the centre of the page, and such changes were often made; some albums had marks which allow changes to be traced.&lt;ref&gt;Froom, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; The grandest albums had specially written prefaces which are the source of a high proportion of surviving contemporary writing on the arts of the book, and the biographies of painters and calligraphers; these tended to be written by calligraphers.  For calligraphers too the single page for an album became the "bread and butter" source of income,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, quote on 47&lt;/ref&gt; using mostly texts from poetry, whether extracts from a long classic or [[ghazal]] lyrics, but sometimes an extract from the [[Qur'an]], perhaps given the place of honour at the start of the album.  Album pages often have areas of [[Ottoman illumination|decorated illumination]] (as in the illustration) that share their motifs with other media, notably book-covers and carpet designs, the best of which were in fact probably mostly produced by the same type of artist at court, and sent to the weavers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 42-49, 45 on Qur'an, 83 on carpets.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the classic Islamic [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition had concentrated on rather crowded scenes with strong narrative content as illustrations in full texts of classic and lengthy works like the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', the single miniature intended from the start for a ''muraqqa'' soon developed as a simpler scene with fewer, larger, figures, often showing idealized beauties of either sex in a garden setting, or genre figures from nomadic life, usually with no real or fictional identities attached to them.  In Mughal India realistic portraiture, nearly always of rulers or courtiers, became a very common feature, and in Ottoman Turkey portraits of the Sultans, often very stylised, were a particular speciality.  Fully coloured scenes tended to give way to part-drawn and part-painted ones, or to figures with little or no background.  The album to some extent overlaps with the anthology, a collection of different pieces where the main emphasis is on the texts, but which can also include paintings and drawings inserted from different sources.

===Persia===
The dominant tradition of miniature painting in the late [[Middle Ages]] was that of [[Persia]], which had a number of centres, but all usually dependent on one key patron, whether the shah himself, or a figure either governing a part of the country from a centre such as [[Herat]], where Baysunghur was an important patron in the early 15th century, or the ruler of a further part of the [[Persianate]] world in a centre like [[Bukhara]].  As the [[Safavid dynasty]] centralized Persian rule in the 16th century the number of potential partrons of a full-size atelier declined, but the atelier of the shah expanded and produced a number of superb illustrated books, using a variety of very talented artists on each.  However, in the 1540s Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a keen patron, lost interest in commissioning books, and thereafter the Persian miniature painting tradition lacked a steady source of commissions for books in the old style.  After a gap of some years, Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] established an atelier at [[Mashad]], which produced the [[Freer Jami]] in the 1560s, and which Shah [[Ismail II of Persia|Ismail II]] took over after having its former patron killed in 1577.  But Ismail's reign was very brief, and thereafter consistent large-scale patronage was lacking.  It was in this period that the single miniature designed for inserting in an album came to be dominant; such works had long been produced, but now they became the main source of income for many artists, who probably often produced them speculatively with no commission, and then looked to sell them (little is known about the market for album miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 113-114; Riza; Brend, 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist who epitomises the Persian album miniature is [[Riza Abbasi]], active from the 1580s until his death in 1635, whose early single miniatures of groups are somewhat like those in narrative scenes, but lacking any actual narrative attached to them.  He soon turned to, and developed, subjects mostly of one or two figures, often portrait-like, although very few identities are given or were probably ever intended to be recognised. There are a large number of beautiful youths, to whose clothes great attention is paid.&lt;ref&gt;Riza&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[File:Sarayi Album 145ba.jpg|thumb|15th century portrait of [[Mehmet II]] (1432-1481), showing Italian influence]]
The best Ottoman painting was heavily concentrated in the capital, which from 1453 was [[Istanbul]], and the most important patron was always the Sultan.  The royal library remains very largely intact in Turkey, mostly at [[Topkapi Palace]], and was greatly enriched by Persian manuscripts, initially taken during the several Ottoman invasions of eastern Persia, and later, after a treaty in 1555, often received as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Many of these manuscripts were broken up to use the miniatures in albums.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;  Persian artists were imported from virtually the start of the Ottoman tradition, but especially in the 16th century; sixteen artists were brought back just from the brief Ottoman conquest of [[Tabriz]] in 1514, though by 1558 the palace records list only nine foreign artists of all kinds, against twenty-six Turks. But a distinctively Ottoman style can be seen from the start of the 16th century, with pictures showing simpler landscape backgrounds, more sea and ships, neatly tented army camps, distant cityscapes, more individual characterization of faces, but also a less refined technique.  There was strong European influence, mostly from [[Venice]], but this was restricted to portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 136-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish albums include mixtures of collected miniatures similar to those in Persia, and often including Persian pieces, with the addition of rather more greatly elaborated pen drawings of an essentially decorative nature, of a foliage motif, or a bird or animal treated largely as such.  Albums dedicated to the sultans, with portraits and laudatory pieces of text, are a distinctive Turkish type, and there were also albums of scenes of Turkish life, showing the relatively uniform costume of different ranks in society, methods of torture and execution, and other scenes of interest to the mostly Western foreigners they were produced for, matching similar [[Old master print|prints]] made in contemporary Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 151, 157-158&lt;/ref&gt;

One very distinctive type of miniature is found only in Ottoman albums, though they may have been brought from Persia as booty, and perhaps were not intended for albums originally.  These are eighty or so the mysterious and powerful images grouped under the name of [[Siyah Qalam]], meaning "Black Pen" (or drunk or evil pen), full of demons and scenes which suggest nomadic life in Central Asia, though it has also been suggested that they come from a single Persian court artist letting himself go.  They are perhaps from the early 15th century, reaching Turkey in the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 37; Walther &amp; Wolf, 254-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinctive type of Ottoman work is the [[découpage]] or cut paper miniature, where different colours of paper, cut with minute detail then pasted together, are used to create the image.  This technique was used for book-covers in Timurid Persia, which were then varnished over for protection, but in Turkey the images were treated as miniatures and went inside albums; the technique was also much used for page border decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/a/a_lion_attacking_a_deer.aspx ''A lion attacking a deer'', stencilled scene of découpage paper shapes] British Museum; Titley, 158, 229, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian subcontinent===
[[File:Five Recruits- Ummee Chund, Indur, Goolzaree, Bukhtawur and Juhaz - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Company style]] miniature of ''Five Recruits'' to a British Indian military unit, c. 1815]] 
The [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] was rather later in establishing a large court atelier, which did not begin until after the exile in Persia of the second emperor, [[Humayun]], who on his return was joined from about 1549 by Persian artists including [[Abd as-Samad]].  The Mughal style developed under the next emperor, [[Akbar]], who commissioned some very large illustrated books, but his artists produced single miniatures for albums as well.  In the case of the [[Jahangirnama]], the emperor [[Jahangir]] kept a diary and commissioned paintings separately, which were most likely held in the [[Kitabkhana]] (किताबखाना), until his official contribution to the court chronicle genre could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T_QNAQAAMAAJ|title=The Jahangirnama|last=Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery|first=Smithsonian Institution|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Foreword by Milo Cleveland Beach|year=1999|isbn=0195127188|editor-last=Shaner|editor-first=Lynne|location=New York|pages=vi–vii|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From fairly early the Mughal style made a strong feature of realistic portraiture, usually in profile, and perhaps influenced by Western prints, which were available at the Mughal court.  For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 23-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abid.

F2005.4 [http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/edan/object.php?q=fsg_F2005.4&amp;bcrumb=true]&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; from the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later.  Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.

Akbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were.  Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 66&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries Indian artists working in the hybrid Indo-European [[Company style]] produced albums of miniatures for Europeans living in India as part of the [[British Raj]] and its French and Portuguese equivalents.  Some Europeans collected or were given earlier Indian miniatures; the Large and Small Clive albums were presented to [[Lord Clive]], and are now in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O86414/painting-a-flower-study/ Small Clive album] [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others created albums of new work, tending to concentrate on animal portraits and the houses, horses and other possessions of this wealthy group.  In the 19th century images of Indians and their costumes, often categorized by regional and ethnic type, or occupation, became very popular.  Large-scale patrons included Colonel [[James Skinner (soldier)|James Skinner]] of Skinner's Horse fame, who had a [[Rajput]] mother, and for natural history paintings, [[Mary Impey]], wife of [[Elijah Impey]], who commissioned over three hundred, and the [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Marquess Wellesley]], brother of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|first Duke of Wellington]], who had over 2,500 miniatures.

==Use of albums==
[[File:Emperor Jahangir receiving his two sons, an album-painting in gouache on paper, c 1605-06.jpg|thumb|Manohar, Emperor [[Jahangir]] receiving his two sons, an album-painting in gouache on paper, c. 1605-6]]
Albums were often presented as gifts to mark a milestone in life.  Chroniclers record that when the Persian Prince [[Ibrahim Mirza]] was killed in 1577, on the orders of Shah [[Tahmasp I]], his wife, Tahmasp's sister, destroyed artworks including an album containing miniatures by [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Behzad]] among others, which her husband had compiled and given her for their wedding, washing the miniatures in water.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps she did not want anything to fall into the hands of her brother, who had ordered his death, and who did take over the prince's atelier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/museum/detail.asp?artifactid=1731 Aga Khan Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724231354/http://www.akdn.org/museum/detail.asp?artifactid=1731 |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albums were often presented to rulers on their accession, or in Turkey at New Year. They could also be given as diplomatic gifts between rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Tanidi, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A muraqqa was created for Sultan [[Murad III]] in 1572 when he ascended to the throne, which is unusual because the dedication is very detailed, including the date and place of creation, namely Istanbul, 980 AH/1572-73 AD.&lt;ref&gt;A. E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa’ for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication is to Murad III, also naming his compiler Mehmed Cenderecizade. The Murad III muraqqa was designed much more extravagantly than other Islamic muraqqa and with original nakkashane (Ottoman painting studio) border paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Emine F. Fetvaci, (2005). "Viziers to Eunuchs: Transitions in Ottoman Manuscript Patronage, 1566--1617." Unpublished PhD Dissertation, Harvard University. pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This muraqqa contained miniature paintings, ink drawings, and calligraphy, including [[ghazals]].  The Murad III muraqqa has twenty-four miniatures created in the cities of [[Bukhara]] to the east of Persia, [[Tabriz]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Qazvin]] in Persia, and [[Istanbul]] between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;A. E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa’ for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, p. 2, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a two-page introduction written in Persian, which is similar in structure to [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid]] album prefaces, and indicates that this muraqqa was compiled in Istanbul less than two years before Murad III became Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa’ for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, p. 4.; Sheila S. Blair. (2000). "Color and Gold: The Decorated Papers Used in Manuscripts in Later Islamic Times." Muqarnas. 17. pp. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another album in the Ottoman royal collection contains only Western images, mostly [[old master print|prints]] but including a drawing in pen of an ''Ornamental Scroll with [[Putti]] and Penises'', "for the merriment of adult guests at a dinner in [[Beyoğlu|Pera]]".  The collection was probably assembled for a [[Florence|Florentine]] in the late 15th century, probably a merchant living in Istanbul (where Pera was the quarter for Westerners).  The other 15 images are a mixed group of Florentine [[engraving]]s, mostly unique impressions (i.e. otherwise unknown), with some religious subjects and a coloured print of [[Mehmet II]], who apparently acquired the album.  It is of interest to art historians because only a small handful of early albums of Western prints survive anywhere, having been broken up by later collectors or dealers; they were probably common among collectors in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Parshall, 91-95; one might query the title, as the "putti" are rather rough-looking adults.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples from the Mughal Court ===

* ''The Salim album'', produced in the reign of [[Akbar the Great]], contains both Christian images and portraits of Hindu courtiers.
* ''The Minto Albums'', from the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], contains miniatures depicting royal courtiers, gardens, and images of wildlife, surrounded by elaborate floral borders.
* ''The Shah Jahan Album'', now dispersed, as it was split up by Demotte, a European dealer.

== In modern times  ==
[[Abdur Rahman Chughtai]] was a painter who was responsible for the revival of the muraqqa in [[Pakistan]] in 1928 after publishing his Muraqqa-I Chughtai. When he started painting in the 1910s his major influence was [[Hindu mythology]], but by the 1920s he was inspired by Islamic artwork including the muraqqa, [[ghazals]], and [[Ottoman miniature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Iftikhar Dadi, (2006). "Miniature Painting as Muslim Cosmopolitanism" ISIM Review: International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World. No. 18 pp. 53. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the emergent tools of [[digital humanities]], Sumathi Ramaswamy at [[Duke University]] has recreated the form of a Mughal muraqqa’ to track the itineraries of the [[terrestrial globe]] in early modern [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Sumathi Ramaswamy, ‘Going Global in Mughal India’ (http://sites.duke.edu/globalinmughalindia/)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''one-dimensional symmetry group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]] that describes [[symmetry|symmetries]] in one dimension (1D). 

A pattern in 1D can be represented as a function ''f''(''x'') for, say, the color at position ''x''.

The only nontrivial point group in 1D is a simple [[Point reflection|reflection]]. It can be represented by the simplest [[Coxeter group]], A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, [ ], or [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node}}.

Affine symmetry groups represent [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]. Isometries which leave the function unchanged are [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s ''x'' + ''a'' with ''a'' such that ''f''(''x'' + ''a'') = ''f''(''x'') and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s ''a'' − ''x'' with a such that ''f''(''a'' − ''x'') = ''f''(''x''). The reflections can be represented by the [[affine Coxeter group]] [&amp;infin;], or [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node|infin|node}} representing two reflections, and the translational symmetry as [&amp;infin;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Coxeter-Dynkin diagram {{CDD|node_h2|infin|node_h2}} as the composite of two reflections.

==Point group==
For a pattern without translational symmetry there are the following possibilities (1D [[point group]]s):
* the symmetry group is the trivial group (no symmetry)
* the symmetry group is one of the groups each consisting of the identity and reflection in a point (isomorphic to ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

===Translational symmetry===
Consider all patterns in 1D which have translational [[symmetry]], i.e., functions ''f''(''x'') such that for some ''a'' &gt; 0, ''f''(''x'' + ''a'') = ''f''(''x'') for all ''x''. For these patterns, the values of ''a'' for which this property holds form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

We first consider patterns for which the group is [[Discrete group|discrete]], i.e., for which the positive values in the group have a minimum. By rescaling we make this minimum value 1.

Such patterns fall in two categories, the two 1D [[space group]]s or [[line group]]s.

In the simpler case the only isometries of '''R''' which map the pattern to itself are translations; this applies, e.g., for the pattern 
 '''− −−−  − −−−  − −−−  − −−−'''

Each isometry can be characterized by an integer, namely plus or minus the translation distance. Therefore the [[symmetry group]] is '''Z'''.

In the other case, among the isometries of '''R''' which map the pattern to itself there are also reflections; this applies, e.g., for the pattern

 '''− −−− −  − −−− −  − −−− −'''

We choose the origin for ''x'' at one of the points of reflection. Now all reflections which map the pattern to itself are of the form ''a''−''x'' where the constant "''a''" is an integer (the increments of ''a'' are 1 again, because we can combine a reflection and a translation to get another reflection, and we can combine two reflections to get a translation). Therefore all isometries can be characterized by an integer and a code, say 0 or 1, for translation or reflection.

Thus:
* &lt;math&gt;(a,0):x \mapsto x + a&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,1):x\mapsto a - x&lt;/math&gt;
The latter is a reflection with respect to the point ''a''/2 (an integer or an integer plus 1/2).

Group operations ([[function composition]], the one on the right first) are, for integers ''a'' and ''b'':
* &lt;math&gt;(a,0) \circ (b,0)=(a + b,0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,0) \circ (b,1)=(a + b,1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,1) \circ (b,0)=(a - b,1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,1) \circ (b,1)=(a - b,0)&lt;/math&gt;
E.g., in the third case: translation by an amount ''b'' changes ''x'' into ''x'' + ''b'', reflection with respect to 0 gives−''x'' − ''b'', and a translation ''a'' gives ''a'' − ''b'' − ''x''.

This group is called the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of '''Z''',  Dih('''Z'''), and also D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[semidirect product]] of '''Z''' and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It has a [[normal subgroup]] of [[index of a subgroup|index]] 2 isomorphic to '''Z''': the translations. Also it contains an element ''f'' of order 2 such that, for all ''n'' in '''Z''',&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;: the reflection with respect to the reference point, (0,1).

The two groups are called [[Lattice (group)|lattice groups]]. The [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] is '''Z'''. As translation cell we can take the interval 0 ≤ ''x'' &lt; 1. In the first case the [[fundamental domain]] can be taken the same; topologically it is a circle (1-[[torus]]); in the second case we can take 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 0.5.

The actual [[discrete symmetry]] group of a translationally symmetric pattern can be:
* of group 1 type, for any positive value of the smallest translation distance
* of group 2 type, for any positive value of the smallest translation distance, and any positioning of the lattice of points of reflection (which is twice as dense as the translation lattice)

The set of translationally symmetric patterns can thus be classified by  actual symmetry group, while actual symmetry groups, in turn, can be classified as type 1 or type 2.

These space group types are the symmetry groups “up to conjugacy with respect to affine transformations”: the affine transformation changes the translation distance to the standard one (above: 1), and the position of one of the points of reflections, if applicable, to the origin. Thus the actual symmetry group contains elements of the form ''gag''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;= ''b'', which is a conjugate of ''a''.

===Non-discrete symmetry groups===
For a homogeneous “pattern” the symmetry group contains all translations, and reflection in all points. The symmetry group is isomorphic to Dih('''R''').

There are also less trivial patterns/functions with translational symmetry for arbitrarily small translations, e.g. the group of  translations by rational distances. Even apart from scaling and shifting, there are infinitely many cases, e.g. by considering rational numbers of which the denominators are powers of a given prime number.

The translations form a group of isometries. However, there is no pattern with this group as symmetry group.

==1D-symmetry of a function vs. 2D-symmetry of its graph==
Symmetries of a function (in the sense of this article) imply corresponding symmetries of its graph. However, 2-fold rotational symmetry of the graph does not imply any symmetry (in the sense of this article) of the function: function values (in a pattern representing colors, grey shades, etc.) are [[Level of measurement|nominal data]], i.e. grey is not between black and white, the three colors are simply all different.

Even with nominal colors there can be a special kind of symmetry, as in:
 −−−−−−− -- − −−−   − −  − 

(reflection gives the negative image). This is also not included in the classification.

==Group action==
[[Group action]]s of the symmetry group that can be considered in this connection are:
*on '''R'''
*on the set of real functions of a real variable (each representing a pattern)

This section illustrates group action concepts for these cases.

The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called 
* ''transitive'' if for any two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''g'' · ''x'' = ''y''; for neither of the two group actions this is the case for any discrete symmetry group
* ''faithful'' (or ''effective'') if for any two different ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that ''g'' · ''x'' ≠ ''h'' · ''x''; for both group actions this is the case for any discrete symmetry group (because, except for the identity, symmetry groups do not contain elements that “do nothing”)
* ''free'' if for any two different ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'' we have ''g'' · ''x'' ≠ ''h'' · ''x''; this is the case if there are no reflections
* ''regular'' (or ''simply transitive'') if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for any two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists precisely one ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''g'' · ''x'' = ''y''.

==Orbits and stabilizers==
Consider a group ''G'' acting on a set ''X''. The [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit]] of a point ''x'' in ''X'' is the set of elements of ''X'' to which ''x'' can be moved by the elements of ''G''. The orbit of ''x'' is denoted by ''Gx'':

:&lt;math&gt;Gx = \left\{ g\cdot x \mid g \in G \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Case that the group action is on '''R''':
*For the trivial group, all orbits contain only one element; for a group of translations, an orbit is e.g. {..,−9,1,11,21,..}, for a reflection e.g. {2,4}, and for the symmetry group with translations and reflections, e.g., {−8,−6,2,4,12,14,22,24,..} (translation distance is 10, points of reflection are ..,−7,−2,3,8,13,18,23,..). The points within an orbit are “equivalent”. If a symmetry group applies for a pattern, then within each orbit the color is the same.

Case that the group action is on patterns:
*The orbits are sets of patterns, containing translated and/or reflected versions, “equivalent patterns”. A translation of a pattern is only equivalent if the translation distance is one of those included in the symmetry group considered, and similarly for a mirror image.

The set of all orbits of ''X'' under the action of ''G'' is written as ''X''/''G''.

If ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', we write ''GY'' for the set {''g'' · ''y'' : ''y'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''Y'' and ''g''  &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''G''}. We call the subset ''Y'' ''invariant under G'' if ''GY'' = ''Y'' (which is equivalent to ''GY'' ⊆ ''Y''). In that case, ''G'' also operates on ''Y''. The subset ''Y'' is called ''fixed under G'' if ''g'' · ''y'' = ''y''for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''y'' in ''Y''. In the example of the orbit {−8,−6,2,4,12,14,22,24,..}, {−9,−8,−6,−5,1,2,4,5,11,12,14,15,21,22,24,25,..} is invariant under ''G'', but not fixed.

For every ''x'' in ''X'', we define the '''stabilizer subgroup''' of ''x'' (also called the '''isotropy group''' or '''little group''') as the set of all elements in ''G'' that fix ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;G_x = \{g \in G \mid g\cdot x = x\}.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''x'' is a reflection point, its stabilizer is the group of order two containing the identity and the reflection in''x''. In other cases the stabilizer is the trivial group.

For a fixed ''x'' in ''X'', consider the map from ''G'' to ''X'' given by ''g'' &lt;tt&gt;|-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ''g'' · ''x''. The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of this map is the orbit of ''x'' and the [[coimage]] is the set of all left [[coset]]s of ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. The standard quotient theorem of set theory then gives a natural [[bijection]] between ''G''/''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Gx''. Specifically, the bijection is given by ''hG&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;tt&gt;|-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ''h'' · ''x''. This result is known as the '''orbit-stabilizer theorem'''. If, in the example, we take ''x'' = 3, the orbit is {−7,3,13,23,..}, and the two groups are isomorphic with '''Z'''. 

If two elements ''x'' and ''y'' belong to the same orbit, then their stabilizer subgroups, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]]. More precisely: if ''y'' = ''g'' · ''x'', then ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''gG''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. In the example this applies e.g. for 3 and 23, both reflection points. Reflection about 23 corresponds to a translation of −20, reflection about 3, and translation of 20.

Card is a professor of English at [[Southern Virginia University]],&lt;ref name="SVU"&gt;[http://ldsmag.com/ldsmag/articles/050516whyteach.html "Why I Am Teaching at SVU... and Why SVU is Important"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021191842/http://ldsmag.com/ldsmag/articles/050516whyteach.html |date=2013-10-21 }} from LDSMag.com&lt;/ref&gt; has written two books on creative writing, hosts writing bootcamps and workshops, and serves as a judge in the [[Writers of the Future]] contest.&lt;ref name="WritersofFuture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writersofthefuture.com|title=Writers of the Future contest.|access-date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A great-great-grandson of [[Brigham Young]], Card is a practicing member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). In addition to producing a large body of fiction works, he has also offered political, religious, and social commentary in his columns and other writing.

He has written under a number of pseudonyms, including '''Frederick Bliss''', '''Brian Green''', '''P.Q. Gump''', '''Dinah Kirkham''', '''Scott Richards''', and '''Byron Walley'''.

==Early life==
Card is the son of Willard Richards Card and Peggy Jane (née Park), the third of six children and the older brother of composer and arranger [[Arlen Card]].&lt;ref name="About OSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hatrack.com/osc/about-more.shtml|title=Who Is Orson Scott Card?|publisher=Hatrack River Enterprises Inc|access-date=2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Willett&gt;{{Cite book| last = Willett| first = Edward| title = Orson Scott Card: Architect of Alternate Worlds| publisher = Enslow Publishers, Inc| year = 2006| location = New Jersey | isbn = 0-7660-2354-0 }}

Tyson|publisher = Scarecrow Press|date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card was born in [[Richland, Washington]], and grew up in [[Santa Clara, California]] as well as [[Mesa, Arizona]] and [[Orem, Utah]]. He served as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in [[Brazil]] and graduated from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and the [[University of Utah]]; he also spent a year in a Ph.D. program at the [[University of Notre Dame]].

For part of the 1970s Card worked as an associate editor of the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', an official magazine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1977/04/neighborliness-daines-style?lang=eng Ensign reference to Card as Associate Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; Influences on his fiction include [[Robert A.

Card lives in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]],&lt;ref name="About OSC"/&gt; a place that has played a significant role in ''[[Ender's Game]]'' and many of his other works.

==Fiction==
{{See also|List of works by Orson Scott Card}}
Card began his writing career primarily as a poet, studying with Clinton F. Larson at BYU. During his studies as a theater major, he began "doctoring" scripts, adapting fiction for readers theater production, and finally writing his own one-act and full-length plays, several of which were produced by faculty directors at BYU. He also explored fiction writing, beginning with stories that eventually evolved into ''[[The Worthing Saga]]''.

After returning to [[Provo, Utah]] from his [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Church of Jesus Christ mission]] in Brazil, Card started the Utah Valley Repertory Theatre Company, which for two summers produced plays at "the Castle", a [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] outdoor amphitheater behind the state psychiatric hospital in Provo; his company's were the first plays ever produced at the Castle. Meanwhile, he took part-time employment as a proofreader at [[BYU Press]], then made the jump to full-time employment as a copy editor. In 1976, in the midst of a paid role performing in the church's musical celebrating [[United States Bicentennial|America's Bicentennial]], he secured employment as an assistant editor at the ''Ensign'', and moved to [[Salt Lake City]]. It was while working at ''Ensign'' that Card published his first piece of fiction. His short story "[[Gert Fram]]" appeared in the July 1977 fine arts issue of that magazine under the pseudonym [[Pseudonyms used by Orson Scott Card#Byron Walley|Byron Walley]].

===Science fiction===
He wrote the short story "[[Ender's Game (short story)|Ender's Game]]" while working at the BYU press, and submitted it to several publications. The idea for the later novel of the same title came from the short story about a school where boys can fight in space. It was eventually purchased by [[Ben Bova]] at ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and published in the August 1977 issue. Meanwhile, he started writing half-hour audioplays on [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church history]], the [[New Testament]], and other subjects for [[Living Scriptures, Inc|Living Scriptures]] in Ogden, Utah; on the basis of that continuing contract, some freelance editing work, and a novel contract for ''[[Hot Sleep]]'' and ''[[A Planet Called Treason]]'', he left ''Ensign'' and began supporting his family as a freelancer.

He completed his [[master's degree]] in English at the University of Utah in 1981 and began a doctoral program at the University of Notre Dame, but the recession of the early 1980s caused the flow of new book contracts to temporarily dry up. He returned to full-time employment as the book editor for ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1983. In October of that year, a new contract for the Alvin Maker "trilogy" (now up to six books) allowed him to return to freelancing.

''[[Ender's Game]]'' and its sequel ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' were both awarded the [[Hugo Award]] and the [[Nebula Award]], making Card the only author ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}) to win both of science fiction's top prizes in consecutive years. Card continued the series with ''[[Xenocide]]'', ''[[Children of the Mind]]'', ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Hegemon]]'', ''[[Shadow Puppets]]'', "[[First Meetings in the Enderverse]]", ''[[Shadow of the Giant]]'', ''[[A War of Gifts: An Ender Story|A War of Gifts]]'', and ''[[Ender in Exile]]'', a book that takes place after ''Ender's Game'' and before ''Speaker for the Dead''. Card has also announced his plan to write ''[[Shadows Alive]]'', a book that connects the "Shadow" series and "Speaker" series together. ''[[Shadows in Flight]]'' serves as a bridge towards this final book. He also co-wrote the formic war novels: [[Earth Unaware]], [[Earth Afire]], [[Earth Awakens]] and [[The Swarm (Card and Johnston novel)|The Swarm]] as prequels to the Ender novels, with two more novels in the pipeline, which will result in two prequel formic war trilogies. These trilogies relay, among other things, the history of Mazer Rackham. [[Children of the Fleet]] is the first novel in a new sequel series, called ''Fleet School''. In 2008 Card announced that ''Ender's Game'' would be made into a movie, but that he did not have a director lined up ([[Wolfgang Petersen]] had previously been scheduled to direct the movie but subsequently moved on to other projects.) It was to be produced by Chartoff Productions, and Card was writing the screenplay himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endersgamemovie.blogspot.com/2008/04/enders-game-movie-searching-for-new.html|title=Ender's Game Movie Searching for New Director|access-date=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was made several years later, and released in 2013, with [[Asa Butterfield]] in the title role and [[Gavin Hood]] directing.

Other works include the alternative histories ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'', ''[[Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus]]'', [[Homecoming Saga|The Homecoming Saga]], and ''[[Hidden Empire]]'', a story about a near-future [[civil war]] in the United States, based on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] video game ''[[Shadow Complex]]''. He collaborated with ''Star Wars'' artist [[Doug Chiang]] on ''[[Robota]]'' and with [[Kathryn H. Kidd]] on ''[[Lovelock (novel)|Lovelock]]''.

In 2017, he co-created a TV series ''[[Extinct (2017 TV series)|Extinct]]''.

===Other genres===
He has since branched out into other areas of fiction with novels such as ''[[Lost Boys (novel)|Lost Boys]]'', ''[[Treasure Box]]'' and ''[[Enchantment (novel)|Enchantment]]''. Other works include the novelization of the [[James Cameron]] film ''[[The Abyss]]'', and the comic book ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' for Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel Universe series. Outside the world of published fiction, Card contributed dialog to at least three video games: ''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]'', ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'' and ''[[The Dig]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.filefront.com/gaming-todays-exclusive-interview-with-author-orson-scott-card/|title=Interview with Author Orson Scott Card|access-date=2007-06-18|publisher=Gaming Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Card published the novel ''[[Saints (novel)|Saints]]'', a historical fiction based loosely on one of his ancestors and her experiences coming into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints during the early portion of its movement. It continues through her eyes into subsequent events up until the granting of Statehood to Utah.

In 1988, Card wrote the script for an updated [[Hill Cumorah Pageant]].&lt;ref name=maxwelli&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Crawford|title=The Delights of Making Cumorah's Music |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/pdf.php?filename=OTk5Njc3NDEzLTEzLTEucGRm&amp;type=amJtcw== |website=Maxwell Institute |publisher=Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407090052/http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/pdf.php?filename=OTk5Njc3NDEzLTEzLTEucGRm&amp;type=amJtcw== |archivedate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Card published the first novel in [[The Women of Genesis series|''The Women of Genesis'' series]]. This series explores the lives of the principal women mentioned in the first book of the Bible and includes ''[[Sarah (Women of Genesis series)|Sarah]]'' (2000), ''[[Rebekah (Women of Genesis series)|Rebekah]]'' (2002), and ''[[Rachel and Leah (Women of Genesis series)|Rachel and Leah]]'' (2004).

In the fall of 2005, Card launched ''Orson Scott Card's [[InterGalactic Medicine Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscigms.com|title=Orson Scott Card's Intergalactic Medicine Show|access-date=2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the first two issues, but found that the demands of teaching, writing, and directing plays for his local church theater group made it impossible to respond to writers' submissions in a timely manner; former Card student and experienced freelance writer and editor [[Edmund R. Schubert]] took over as editor on June 1, 2006.

The dialog and screenplay (but not the story) for the Xbox video game ''[[Advent Rising]]'' was written by Card and Cameron Dayton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatrack.com/ubb/main/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=003303;p=1#000001 Card's comments on working on ''Advent Rising''] from his official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Card's novella ''[[Hamlet's Father]]'', a retelling of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', was published in the anthology ''The Ghost Quartet'' ([[Tor Books]]). The work re-interpreted all of the characters' personalities and motivations.

===Pseudonyms===
Over the years Orson Scott Card has used at least seven [[pseudonym]]s.

He used the names Frederick Bliss and P.Q. Gump when he was asked to write an overview of Mormon playwrights "Mormon Shakespeares: A Study of Contemporary Mormon Theatre" for Spring 1976 issue of ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'' magazine. According to Card he used these pseudonyms because the article included a brief reference to himself and his play "Stone Tables".&lt;ref name="OSC Answers Questions1"&gt;[http://www.hatrack.com/research/questions/q0081.shtml Pseudonyms] "Orson Scott Card's website The Hatrack".&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Byron Walley was used by Card on his first published piece of fiction "Gert Fram" which appeared in the July 1977 fine arts issue of ''Ensign'' magazine. According to Card he used this name because he had a non-fiction article, "Family Art", a poem, "Looking West", and a short play, "The Rag Mission", appearing in the same issue.&lt;ref name="OSC Answers Questions1"/&gt; Card also used the name Byron Walley in stories he published in ''[[The Friend (LDS magazine)|Friend]]'' magazine, ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'' magazine and in the anthology ''[[Dragons of Darkness]]''. Stories by Byron Walley include: "[[Gert Fram]]", ''Ensign'' magazine, July 1977; "[[Bicicleta (short story)|Bicicleta]]", ''Friend'' magazine, October 1977; "[[The Best Family Home Evening Ever]]", ''Friend'' magazine, January 1978; "[[Billy's Box]]", ''Friend'' magazine, February 1978; "[[I Think Mom and Dad Are Going Crazy, Jerry]]", ''New Era'' magazine, May 1979; and "[[Middle Woman]]", ''Dragons of Darkness'', Ace Books, 1982.

He used the name Brian Green in the July 1977 fine arts issue of ''Ensign'' magazine. He used this name for his short play "The Rag Mission" because he had three other pieces appearing in the same issue.&lt;ref name="OSC Answers Questions1"/&gt; The name Dinah Kirkham was used to write the short story "[[The Best Day (short story)|The Best Day]]", in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/orson-scott-card/ Card bio] from FantasticFiction.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The name '''[[wikt:nom de plume|Noam D. Pellume]]''' was used by Card for his short story "[[Damn Fine Novel]]" which appeared in the October 1989 issue of ''The Green Pages''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = | first1 =| title = The Locus Index to Science Fiction: 1984–1998| publisher = Locus Online| date = | year = | url = http://www.locusmag.com/index/s122.htm| access-date=28 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card wrote the novel ''Zanna's Gift'' (2004) under the pen name Scott Richards, saying, "I was trying to establish a separate identity in the marketplace, but for various reasons the marketing strategy didn't work as we'd hoped."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Card | first1 = Orson Scott| title = Uncle Orson Reviews Everything: Bean on Baseball and Parker's Trilogies| publisher = Hatrack River Enterprises Inc| date=2 November 2008| url = http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2008-11-02.shtml | access-date=28 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On writing==

===Teaching===

In 2005, Card accepted a permanent appointment as "distinguished professor" at [[Southern Virginia University]] in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]], a small [[liberal arts college]] run according to the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Card has cited his frustration with the dismal teaching methodology for [[creative writing]] in most universities as a reason for accepting this position, along with his desire to teach the techniques of effective fiction writing to writers whose values are more congruent with his own.&lt;ref name="SVU" /&gt; Card has worked closely with colleagues to develop ways to educate aspiring writers and has published two books on the subject. He was eager for the opportunity to apply these techniques in a university environment—his assorted workshops did not allow the follow-through he desired. After being deeply moved by stories of his students' parents in some of their essays, he decided to stop teaching regularly at the university to spend time with his youngest child who still lives at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2007-05-27.shtml|date=2007-05-27|title=Uncle Orson Reviews Everything: Politically Incorrect Literature, Audio Drama, "My American Culture"|publisher=Hatrack River Enterprises Inc|access-date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2015}} Card returned to teaching for the spring semester of 2009.

Card has taught multiple courses in English and creative writing including courses analyzing the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]], hymn and lyric writing, and [[LDS fiction]].

===Books on writing===
Card has written two books on the subject of creative writing – ''Characters and Viewpoint'', published in 1988, and ''How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy'', published in 1990. He was also a co-writer for ''How to Write a Million'' (though his contribution is actually a reprint of an earlier work).

Card also offered advice about writing in an interview in [[Leading Edge (fiction magazine)|''Leading Edge'']] #23 in 1991.

===Writers of the Future===
Card serves as a judge in [[Writers of the Future]],&lt;ref name="WritersofFuture" /&gt; a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] story contest for amateur writers. It originated in the early 1980s by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], a science fiction writer and the founder of [[the Church of Scientology]], and continues to be funded and organized by [[Author Services Inc.]], an entity that manages Hubbard's literary work.

===Children's books===

Card won the ALA Margaret Edwards Award in 2008 for his contribution in writing for teens, selected by a panel of [[YALSA|YA librarians]].&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; "What have I done that made some wonderfully deluded people think that I should get the [award] for lifetime achievement in writing young adult fiction?" he asked in his address, and asserted that "There is no such thing as children's literature." Furthermore:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/margaretaedwards/maeprevious/anniversary "Looking Back"]. YALSA. ALA. Retrieved 2013-10-13. Card won the 20th anniversary Edwards Award in 2008, when YALSA asked previous winners to reflect on the experience. Some live remarks by Card are published online with the compiled reflections but transcripts of acceptance speeches are available to members only.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not worked with YA editors; my work has never been marketed that way until [[Tor Books|Tor]] put a YA cover and a new ISBN on ''Ender's Game''—fifteen years after the book first came out, and long after it had become popular with young readers. ''Ender's Game'' was written with no concessions to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was definitely not aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that the rule of thumb for children's literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience. You want ten-year-old readers, you have a twelve-year-old hero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of the book, Ender is six. Who, exactly, is the target audience?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Poetry===

Card created a website, Strong Verse that publishes poetry from authors living and dead with the aim of showcasing works that present a clear message in clear language. The following motto appears on the website's header: "Good poetry is meant to be understood, not decoded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Orson Scott Card Network|title=About Strong Verse|url=http://www.strongverse.org/about.html|website=Strong Verse|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion==
Since 2001, Card's commentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Tim |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10401422/Enders-Game-will-the-film-be-derailed-by-the-authors-homophobia.html |title=Ender's Game: will the film be derailed by the author's homophobia? |publisher=Telegraph |date=2013-10-24 |access-date=2013-11-05 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the political columns "War Watch", "World Watch", or "Civilization Watch" (depending on Card's topic) and the column "Uncle Orson Reviews Everything", all published at the Greensboro ''[[Rhinoceros Times]]''. The last-named column features personal reviews of movies, books, and restaurants in the greater Greensboro area, in addition to a variety of other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/inside-the-list.html?_r=3 | title = TBR Inside the List: Uncle Orson | first = G |last = Cowles | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=27 January 2012| access-date = 14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column also later appears on his website, Hatrack River. Since 2008 Card has written a column for the ''[[Mormon Times]]''.

===Politics===
Card's vocal opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and other views on homosexuality led to a boycott of the film version of ''Ender's Game''&lt;ref name="cieply"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/business/media/authors-anti-gay-views-fuel-call-for-boycott-of-enders-game.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher = [[New York Times]]|title = Author's Views on Gay Marriage Fuel Call for Boycott|authorlink = Michael Cieply|first = Michael|last = Cieply|date =12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; a development which itself received criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/the-enders-game-boycott.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher = New York Times|title = The 'Ender's Game' Boycott|first = Juliet|last = Lapidos|date =20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to political developments, by the early 2010s Card believed the question of U.S. legalization of same-sex marriage moot.&lt;ref name="inside_movies"/&gt;

But on economic matters, I'm a committed communitarian. I regard the Soviet Union as simply state monopoly capitalism. It was run the way the United States would be if Microsoft owned everything. Real communism has never been tried! I would like to see government controls expanded, laws that allow capitalism to not reward the most rapacious, exploitative behavior.

In an August 2013 essay, presented as an "experiment" in fiction-writing called "The Game of Unlikely Events",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2013-05-09-1.html|publisher = [[Ornery.org|The Ornery American]]|title = Unlikely Events|date = May 9, 2013|author = Orson Scott Card|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card described an [[alternative future]] in which President [[Barack Obama]] ruled as a "[[Hitler]]- or [[Stalin]]-style dictator" with his own national police force of young unemployed men; Obama and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] would have amended the U.S. Constitution to allow presidents to remain in power for life, as in [[Nigeria]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Hitler's Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Ender's Game author Orson Scott Card compares Obama to Hitler|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/16/ender-s-game-orson-scott-card-essay-obama-hitler|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title='Ender's Game' author compares Obama to Hitler|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-enders-game-orson-card-obama-hitler-20130815,0,7348229.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card's essay drew extensive criticism, especially for allusions to Obama's race with its reference to "urban gangs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2013/08/orson-scott-cards-alternate-future/|publisher = [[Patheos.com|Patheos]]|title = Orson Scott Card's Alternate Future|date = August 16, 2013|author = Daniel Florien}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[The American Prospect]]|title = Morally Compromised Art, on the Big Screen: How do we judge a movie made from a book written by someone with repellent political views?|author = Paul Waldman|date = August 16, 2013|url = http://prospect.org/article/morally-compromised-art-big-screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.journalnow.com/news/state_region/controversial-author-orson-scott-card-named-to-unc-tv-board/article_3104bc04-199d-11e3-9679-0019bb30f31a.html|date = September 9, 2013|title = Controversial author Orson Scott Card named to UNC-TV board|agency = [[Associated Press]]|newspaper = [[Winston-Salem Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views about homosexuality====
Card has publicly declared his opposition to [[homosexuality]] and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYC-based group calls for boycott of sci-fi movie over author's gay rights views|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/09/nyc-based-group-calls-for-boycott-of-sci-fi-movie-over-authors-gay-rights-views/|publisher=CBS New York|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1990 essay he wrote that "[[Sodomy laws in the United States|laws against homosexual behavior]] should remain on the books, not to be indiscriminately enforced", but to "send a clear message that those who flagrantly violate society's regulation of sexual behavior cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable, equal citizens within that society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=A Changed Man: The Hypocrites of Homosexuality|journal=Sunstone Magazine|date=Feb 1990|pages=44–45|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/075-43-45.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same essay, Card clarified his position, writing:
{{Quote |text=
The goal of the polity is not to put homosexuals in jail. The goal is to discourage people from engaging in homosexual practices in the first place, and, when they nevertheless proceed in their homosexual behavior, to encourage them to do so discreetly, so as not shake the confidence of the community in polity's ability to provide rules for safe, dependable marriage and family relationships.
}}
In May 2013 Card further wrote that since the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had [[Lawrence v. Texas|ruled]] those laws unconstitutional in 2003, he has "no interest in criminalizing homosexual acts".&lt;ref name="Nauvoo"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hypocrites of Homosexuality | url=http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html| access-date = 15 Sep 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to public criticism of the 1990 essay, Card noted:
{{Quote |text=
Oddly enough, even as I am attacked by some as a homophobe, I am attacked by others as being too supportive of homosexuality, simply because I cannot see individual homosexuals, in or out of my books, as anything other than human beings with as complex a combination of good and evil in them as I find within myself. In my own view, I am walking a middle way, which condemns the sin but loves the sinner.&lt;ref name="Nauvoo" /&gt;
}}

In a 2008 opinion piece in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' he wrote that "no matter how close the bonds of affection and friendship might be within [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]], there is no act of court or Congress that can make these relationships the same as the coupling between a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=Orson Scott Card: State job is not to redefine marriage|journal=The Deseret News|date=24 July 2008|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700245157/State-job-is-not-to-redefine-marriage.html?pg=all|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he joined the board of directors of the [[National Organization for Marriage]], a group that campaigns against [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; but later resigned from the board in mid-2013.&lt;ref name="cieply"/&gt; Card has stated that there is no need to legalize gay marriage.&lt;ref name="ornery.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=Homosexual "Marriage" and Civilization|url=http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html|website=The Ornery American|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card has also expressed his opinion that [[paraphilia]] and homosexuality are linked. In 2004, he claimed that it is a "myth that homosexuals are '[[Biology and sexual orientation|born that way]]{{'"}}, noting that "if there is a genetic component to homosexuality, an entire range of environmental influences are also involved." He continued, saying that "the dark secret of homosexual society" was how often people "entered into that world through disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse".&lt;ref name="cieply"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ornery.org"/&gt;

In Card's 2008 novella ''Hamlet's Father'', which re-imagines the backstory of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'', Card was accused of directly trying to link the king's [[pedophilia]] with homosexuality. The novella prompted public outcry and its publishers were inundated with complaints.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/08/outcry-hamlet-novel-gay-paedophile Flood, Alison. "Outcry over Hamlet novel casting old king as gay pedophile: Publisher showered with complaints over Orson Scott Card's ''Hamlet's Father''" ''[[The Guardian]]'' 8 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatrack.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc_responds_halmets_father.html |title='&amp;#39;OSC Responds to False Statements about Hamlet's Father'&amp;#39; (Orson Scott Card) – September 2011 |publisher=Hatrack.com |date= |access-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade journal ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' criticized Card's work, stating that the main purpose of it was to attempt to link homosexuality to pedophilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishersweekly.com/9781596062696 |title=Review of Hamlet's Father |publisher=Publishersweekly.com |date=2011-02-28 |access-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card responded to the claim: "...[T]here is no link whatsoever between homosexuality and pedophilia in this book. Hamlet's father, in the book, is a pedophile, period. I don't show him being even slightly attracted to adults of either sex. It is the reviewer, not me, who has asserted this link, which I would not and did not make."&lt;ref name="hatrack.com"/&gt;

In 2013, Card was selected as a guest author for [[DC Comics]]'s new ''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' comic book series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/comics-and-graphic-novels/2013/02/12/dc-comics-responds-backlash-over-hiring|title=DC Comics Responds to Backlash Over Hiring Antigay Writer|author=Jase Peeples|date=February 12, 2013|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''|access-date=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but controversy over Card's views on homosexuality led illustrator [[Chris Sprouse]] to leave the project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Artist leaves Orson Scott Card's Superman comic |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/03/05/chris-sprouse-orson-scott-card-superman-comic/1964845/?t=dXNlcmlkPTE5MzIxMTM0LGVtYWlsaWQ9MjEzNTQ= |first=Brian |last=Truitt |work=[[USA Today]] |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DC Comics to put Card's story on hold indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/03/orson-scott-card-superman-comic/ |title=Orson Scott Card's Controversial Superman Story Put on Hold |work=[[Wired.com]] |first1=Graeme |last1=McMillan |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later an LGBT group, Geeks OUT!, proposed a boycott of the [[Ender's Game (film)|movie adaptation of ''Ender's Game'']] calling Card's view anti-gay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/09/enders-game-boycott-card-anti-gay-views |title=Activists call for Ender's Game boycott over author's anti-gay views|date=July 9, 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Ben |last=Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Orson Scott Card's antigay views prompt 'Ender's Game' boycott|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-orson-scott-card-antigay-enders-game-boycott-20130711,0,2444377.story|access-date=20 Jul 2013|date=11 Jul 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Carolyn|last=Kellogg}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing the movie studio [[Lionsgate]] to publicly distance itself from Card's opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheney|first=Alexandra|title=Studio comes out against 'Ender's Game' author on gay rights|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/07/12/lions-gate-comes-out-against-enders-game-author-on-gay-rights/|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, one week after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] issued rulings in two cases that were widely interpreted as favoring recognition of same-sex marriages, Card wrote in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that the gay marriage issue is moot due to the Supreme Court's decision on [[DOMA]].&lt;ref name="inside_movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/07/08/enders-game-orson-scott-card-statement/ |title='Ender's Game' author answers critics: Gay marriage issue is 'moot' &amp;#124; Inside Movies &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidemovies.ew.com |date=2013-07-08 |access-date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He further stated, "now it will be interesting to see whether the victorious proponents of gay marriage will show tolerance toward those who disagreed with them when the issue was still in dispute".&lt;ref name="inside_movies"/&gt;

===Religion===
Card's membership in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has been an important facet of his life from early on. He is a great-great-grandson of [[Brigham Young]], the second Latter-day Saint prophet, and all of Card's ancestors for at least three generations have been members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. His ancestors include several other figures notable in the Church, including the [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] colony founder [[Charles Ora Card]]. As such, his faith has been a source of inspiration and influence for both his writing and his personal views.&lt;ref name=Willett/&gt; Since 2008 Card has written a column of Latter-day Saint devotional and cultural commentary for the Sunday national edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' (formerly "the ''[[Mormon Times]]''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695242930/Mormon-Times-New-section-every-Thursday-to-bring-more-LDS-news-info.html?pg=all|publisher = [[Deseret News]]|title = The Gospel in Words: Mormon Times: New section every Thursday to bring more LDS news, info|first = Joseph A.|last = Cannon|authorlink = Joseph A.

==Personal life==
[[File:Scott Card.jpg|thumb|Card (right) signing autographs at [[New York Comic Con]] in 2008]]
Card and his wife, Kristine, have had five children, each named after one or more authors he and his wife admire. Their children's names are Michael Geoffrey ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]), Emily Janice ([[Emily Brontë]] and [[Emily Dickinson]]), Charles Benjamin ([[Charles Dickens]]), Zina Margaret ([[Margaret Mitchell]]) and Erin Louisa ([[Louisa May Alcott]]). Charles, who had [[cerebral palsy]], died shortly after his 17th birthday and their daughter Erin died the day she was born.&lt;ref name="About OSC" /&gt; Card and his wife live with their youngest child, Zina, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="About OSC" /&gt;

The life of their son, Charles, influenced some of Card's fiction, most notably the ''[[Homecoming Saga|Homecoming]]'' series, ''Lost Boys'' and ''Folk of the Fringe''. Their daughter, Emily, along with two other writers, adapted Card's short stories "[[Clap Hands and Sing]]", "[[Lifeloop]]" and "[[A Sepulchre of Songs]]" for the stage in ''[[Posing as People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/store/store.cgi?loc=us&amp;item=BOOKS_PosingAsPeople&amp;opt=|title=Posing as People|publisher=Hatrack River Enterprises Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he appeared in the short film ''The Delivery'', which starred his daughter, Emily. He plays an author reading an audiobook in this film, which won First Place in Fantasy at Dragon*Con Film Festival. He wrote an original story, "The Emperor of the Air", specifically for the short film by Gabrielle de Cuir and Stefan Rudnicki.

Card is an avid fan of the [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and makes an appearance in the documentary ''[[Done the Impossible]]'' about [[Browncoats|''Firefly'' fandom]]. He has also served on the boards of a number of organizations, including [[public television]] station [[UNC-TV]] (2013&amp;ndash;present)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 12, 2013 |url=http://www.news-record.com/blogs/north_state_politics/article_ee4a0514-196e-11e3-b6df-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Orson Scott Card named to UNC-TV board - News-Record.com: North State Politics |publisher=News-Record.com |date= |access-date=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Organization for Marriage]] (2009–2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/the-enders-game-boycott.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Juliet | last=Lapidos | title=The 'Ender's Game' Boycott | date=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card suffered a mild [[stroke]] on January 1, 2011, and was briefly hospitalized. He reported expecting to make a full recovery despite impairment of his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Locus Publications |url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2011/01/orson-scott-card-suffers-mild-stroke/ |title=Locus Online News » Orson Scott Card Suffers Mild Stroke |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2011-01-05 |access-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Card|first=Orson Scott|title=Orson Scott Card: Talents, gifts and intelligence|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705387125/Talents-gifts-and-intelligence.html?pg=all|newspaper=Deseret News|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

The ALA [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for "significant and lasting contributions to young adult literature". Card won the annual award in 2008, citing ''[[Ender's Game]]'' (1985), which inaugurated the science fiction Ender Saga, and ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'' (1999), the so-called parallel novel featuring another boy in the Battle School. According to the citation, the two boys' "experiences echo those of teens, beginning as children navigating in an adult world and growing into a state of greater awareness of themselves, their communities and the larger universe."&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;[http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/margaretaedwards/maeprevious/08edwards "2008 Margaret A.

[[File:PeterRabbit3.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Rabbit]] with his family, from ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' by [[Beatrix Potter]], 1902]]
A '''picture book''' combines visual and verbal narratives in a [[book]] format, most often aimed at young children. The images in picture books use a range of media such as oil paints, acrylics, watercolor,
and pencil, among others. Two of the earliest books with something like the format picture books still retain now were [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' from 1845 and [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' from 1902. Some of the best-known picture books are [[Robert McCloskey]]'s ''[[Make Way for Ducklings]]'', [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[The Cat In The Hat]]'', and [[Maurice Sendak]]'s ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]''. The [[Caldecott Medal]] (established 1938) and [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] (established 1955) are awarded annually for illustrations in children's literature. From the mid-1960s several children's literature awards include a category for picture books.

==Target audiences==

Picture books are most often aimed at young children, and while some may have very basic language especially designed to help children develop their reading skills, most are written with vocabulary a child can understand but not necessarily read. For this reason, picture books tend to have two functions in the lives of children: they are first read to young children by adults, and then children read them themselves once they begin learning to read.

Some picture books are published with content aimed at older children or even adults. ''Tibet: Through the Red Box'', by [[Peter Sis]], is one example of a picture book aimed at an adult audience.

==Subgenres==

There are several subgenres among picture books, including [[alphabet book]]s, [[concept book]]s, [[counting book]]s, [[early reader]]s, [[calendar book]]s, [[nursery rhyme]]s, and [[toy book]]s. [[Board book]]s - picture books published on a hard [[Paperboard|cardboard]] - are often intended for small children to use and play with; cardboard is used for the cover as well as the pages, and is more durable than paper. Another category is movable books, such as [[pop-up book]]s, which employ paper engineering to make parts of the page pop up or stand up when pages are opened. ''[[The Wheels on the Bus]]'', by [[Paul O. Zelinsky]], is one example of a bestseller pop-up picture book.

==Early illustrated books==
[[Image:orbispictus.JPG|thumb|right|A reprint of the 1658 illustrated ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'']]
''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' from 1658 by [[John Amos Comenius]] was the earliest illustrated book specifically for children. It is something of a children's [[encyclopedia]] and is illustrated by [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'' from 1744 by [[John Newbery]] was the earliest illustrated storybook marketed as pleasure reading in English.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 668&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, ''[[kibyoshi]]'' were picture books from the 18th century, and are seen as a precursor to [[manga]].&lt;ref name ="Kern 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kern |first=Adam |year=2006 |title=Manga from the Floating World: Comicbook Culture and the Kibyoshi of Edo Japan |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02266-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of 18th-century Japanese picture books include works such as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s ''Shiji no yukikai'' (1798).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Santō Kyōden's  picturebooks | url = http://heartland.geocities.jp/hamasakaba/44kyoden/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shiji no yukikai(Japanese National Diet Library) | url = http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/2534277/5?contentNo=5&amp;itemId=info%3Andljp%2Fpid%2F2534277&amp;__lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German children's books ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' (literally "Shaggy-Peter") from 1845 by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], and [[Max and Moritz]] from 1865 by [[Wilhelm Busch]], were among the earliest examples of modern picturebook design. Collections of [[Fairy tale]]s from early nineteenth century, like those by the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Brothers Grimm]] or [[Hans Christian Andersen]] were sparsely illustrated, but beginning in the middle of the century, collections were published with images by illustrators like [[Gustave Doré]], [[Fedor Flinzer]], [[George Cruikshank]],&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilhelm Pedersen]], [[Ivan Bilibin]] and [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]. [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|Andrew Lang's twelve Fairy Books]] published between 1889 and 1910 were illustrated by among others [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]] and [[Lancelot Speed]]. [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', illustrated by [[John Tenniel]] in 1866 was one of the first highly successful entertainment books for children.
[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', illustration by John Tenniel, 1866]]

[[Toy book]]s were introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, small paper bound books with art dominating the text. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in color.&lt;ref&gt;Whalley, p.&lt;/ref&gt; The best of these were illustrated by the triumvirate of English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]] whose association with colour printer and wood engraver Edmund Evans produced books of great quality.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 674&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th century a small number of American and British artists made their living illustrating children's books, like [[Rose O'Neill]], [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[Willy Pogany]], [[Edmund Dulac]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Howard Pyle]], or [[Charles Robinson (illustrator)|Charles Robinson]]. Generally, these illustrated books had eight to twelve pages of illustrated pictures or plates accompanying a classic children's storybook.
[[Image:Babes in the Wood - cover - illustrated by Randolph Caldecott - Project Gutenberg eText 19361.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cover of ''[[Babes in the Wood]]'', illustrated by [[Randolph Caldecott]]]]
[[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' was published in 1902 to immediate success. ''Peter Rabbit'' was Potter's first of many ''The Tale of...,'' including ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'', ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'', ''[[The Tale of Tom Kitten]]'', and ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'', to name but a few which were published in the years leading up to 1910. Swedish author [[Elsa Beskow]] wrote and illustrated some forty children's stories and picture books between 1897&amp;ndash;1952. [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|Andrew Lang's twelve Fairy Books]] published between 1889 and 1910 were illustrated by among others [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]] and [[Lancelot Speed]].
&lt;!-- [[Image:LittleBlackSamboCover.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Little Black Sambo]] illustration by [[Helen Bannerman]], 1899]] --&gt;

In the US, illustrated stories for children appeared in magazines like ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'', ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', and ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'', intended for mothers to read to their children. Some cheap periodicals appealing to the juvenile reader started to appear in the early twentieth century, often with uncredited illustrations. 

[[Helen Bannerman]]'s ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'' was published in 1899, and went through numerous printings and versions during the first decade of the twentieth century. It was part of a series of small-format books called [[Dumpy books|The Dumpy Books for Children]], published by British publisher Grant Richards between 1897 and 1904.

== Early to mid-20th century ==
[[File:Wizard title page.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Title page from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] from 1900]]
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' was published in 1900, and Baum created a number of other successful Oz-oriented books in the period from 1904 to 1920. Frank Baum wanted to create a modern-day fairy tale since he loved fairy tales as a child. In 1910, American illustrator and author [[Rose O'Neill]]'s first children’s book was published, ''The Kewpies and Dottie Darling''. More books in the [[Kewpie]] series followed: ''The Kewpies Their Book'' in 1912 and ''The Kewpie Primer'' 1916. In 1918, [[Johnny Gruelle]] wrote and illustrated ''[[Raggedy Ann]]'' and in 1920 followed up with ''Raggedy Andy Stories''. Other Gruelle books included ''Beloved Belinda'', ''Eddie Elephant'', and ''Friendly Fairies''.

In 1913, Cupples &amp; Leon published a series of 15 ''All About'' books, emulating the form and size of the [[Beatrix Potter]] books, ''All About Peter Rabbit'', ''All About The Three Bears'', ''All About [[Mother Goose]]'', and ''All About [[The Little Red Hen|Little Red Hen]]''. The latter, along with several others, was illustrated by [[Johnny Gruelle]]. [[Wanda Gág]]'s ''[[Millions of Cats]]'' was published in 1928 and became the first picture book to receive a [[Newbery Medal]] runner-up award. Wanda Gág followed with ''The Funny Thing'' in 1929, ''Snippy and Snappy'' in 1931, and then ''The ABC Bunny'' in 1933, which garnered her a second Newbery runner-up award.

In 1931, [[Jean de Brunhoff]]'s first [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]] book, ''The Story Of Babar'' was published in France, followed by ''The Travels of Babar'' then ''Babar The King''. In 1930, [[Marjorie Flack]] authored and illustrated ''Angus and the Ducks'', followed in 1931 by ''Angus And The Cats'', then in 1932, ''Angus Lost''. Flack authored another book in 1933, ''[[The Story about Ping]]'', illustrated by [[Kurt Wiese]]. The ''Elson Basic Reader'' was published in 1930 and introduced the public to ''[[Dick and Jane]]''. In 1930 ''[[The Little Engine That Could]]'' was published, illustrated by [[Lois Lenski]]. In 1954 it was illustrated anew by [[George and Doris Hauman]]. It spawned an entire line of books and related paraphernalia and coined the refrain "I think I can! I think I can!". In 1936, [[Munro Leaf]]'s ''[[The Story of Ferdinand]]'' was published, illustrated by [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]]. ''Ferdinand'' was the first picture book to crossover into [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. [[Walt Disney]] produced an animated feature film along with corresponding merchandising materials. In 1938 to [[Dorothy P. Lathrop|Dorothy Lathrop]] was awarded the first [[Caldecott Medal]] for her illustrations in ''[[Animals of the Bible]]'', written by Helen Dean Fish. [[Thomas Handforth]] won the second Caldecott Medal in 1939, for ''[[Mei Li]]'', which he also wrote. [[Ludwig Bemelmans]]' ''[[Madeline]]'' was published in 1939 and was selected as a Caldecott Medal runner-up, today known as a Caldecott Honor book.

In 1942, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] began publishing the [[Little Golden Books]], a series of inexpensive, well illustrated, high quality children's books. The eighth book in the series, ''[[The Poky Little Puppy]]'', is the top selling children's book of all time.&lt;ref name=PW-Roback&gt;Diane Roback, editor; compiled by Debbie Hochman Turvey. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html "All-Time Bestselling Children's Books: A listing of hardcovers that have sold 750,000 copies and paperbacks that have topped the one million copy mark over the years,"] ''Publishers Weekly'' (Dec 17, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the books were bestsellers,&lt;ref name=PW-Roback /&gt; including ''The Poky Little Puppy'', ''[[Tootle]]'', ''[[Scuffy the Tugboat]]'', ''[[The Little Red Hen]]''. Several of the illustrators for the Little Golden Books later became staples within the picture book industry. [[Corinne Malvern]], [[Tibor Gergely]], [[Gustaf Tenggren]], [[Feodor Rojankovsky]], [[Richard Scarry]], [[Eloise Wilkin]], and [[Garth Williams]]. In 1947 ''[[Goodnight Moon]]'' written by [[Margaret Wise Brown]] and illustrated by [[Clement Hurd]] was published. By 1955, such picture book classics as ''[[Make Way for Ducklings]]'', ''[[The Little House]]'', ''[[Curious George]]'', and ''[[Eloise (books)|Eloise]]'', had all been published. In 1955 the first book was published in the ''[[Miffy]]'' series by Dutch author and illustrator [[Dick Bruna]].

In 1937, [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Seuss Geisel), at the time a successful graphic artist and humorist, published his first book for children, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''. It was immediately successful, and Seuss followed up with ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'' in 1938, followed by ''[[The King's Stilts]]'' in 1939, and ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' in 1940, all published by [[Random House]]. From 1947 to 1956 Seuss had twelve children's picture books published. Dr. Seuss created ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' in reaction to a [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] article by [[John Hersey]] in lamenting the unrealistic children in [[School Primers|school primers]] books. Seuss rigidly limited himself to a small set of words from an elementary school vocabulary list, then crafted a story based upon two randomly selected words—cat and hat. Up until the mid-1950s, there was a degree of separation between illustrated educational books and illustrated picture books. That changed with ''The Cat in the Hat'' in 1957.

Because of the success of ''The Cat In The Hat'' an independent publishing company was formed, called [[Beginner Books]]. The second book in the series was nearly as popular, ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'', published in 1958. Other books in the series were ''[[Sam and the Firefly]]'' (1958), ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960), ''[[Are You My Mother?]]'' (1960), ''[[Go, Dog. Go!]]'' (1961), ''[[Hop on Pop]]'' (1963), and ''[[Fox in Socks]]'' (1965). Creators in the Beginner Book series were [[Stan and Jan Berenstain]], [[Philip D. Eastman|P. D. Eastman]], [[Roy McKie]], and [[Helen Palmer Geisel]] (Seuss' wife). The Beginner Books dominated the children's picture book market of the 1960s.

Between 1957 and 1960 [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] published a series of sixteen "I Can Read" books. ''[[Little Bear (book)|Little Bear]]'' was the first of the series. Written by [[Else Holmelund Minarik]] and illustrated by a then relatively unknown [[Maurice Sendak]], the two collaborated on three other "I Can Read" books over the next three years. From 1958 to 1960, [[Syd Hoff]] wrote and illustrated four "I Can Read" books: ''[[Danny and the Dinosaur]]'', ''Sammy The Seal'', ''Julius'', and ''Oliver''.

==Mid- to late 20th century==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Where The Wild Things Are (book) cover.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Where The Wild Things Are]]''  by [[Maurice Sendak]] (1963)]] --&gt;
In 1949 American writer and illustrator [[Richard Scarry]] began his career working on the [[Little Golden Books]] series. His ''[[Best Word Book Ever]]'' from 1963 has sold 4 million copies. In total Scarry wrote and illustrated more than 250 books and more than 100 million of his books have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E0D91030F930A35756C0A962958260 New York Times obituary of Richard Scarry]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, ''[[Where The Wild Things Are]]'' by American writer and illustrator [[Maurice Sendak]] was published. It has been adapted into other media several times, including an animated short in 1973, a [[Where the Wild Things Are (opera)|1980 opera]], and, in 2009, a live-action [[Where the Wild Things Are (film)|feature film adaptation]] directed by [[Spike Jonze]]. By 2008 it had sold over 19 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton, Matthew (February 4, 2008) [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6528120.html "Wild Things All Over"]. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; American illustrator and author [[Gyo Fujikawa]] created more than 50 books between 1963 and 1990. Her work has been translated into 17 languages and published in 22 countries.

Most of the [[Moomin]] books by Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]] were novels, but several Moomin picture books were also published between 1952 and 1980, like ''[[Who Will Comfort Toffle?]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Dangerous Journey]]'' (1977). The [[Barbapapa]] series of books by [[Annette Tison]] and [[Talus Taylor]] was published in France in the 1970s. They feature the shapeshifting pink blob Barbapapa and his numerous colorful children. The ''[[Mr. Men]]'' series of 40-some books by English author and illustrated [[Roger Hargreaves]] started in 1971. ''[[The Snowman]]'' by [[Raymond Briggs]] was published in Britain in 1978 and was entirely wordless. It was made into an [[Academy Awards|Oscar nominated]] [[animation|animated cartoon]] that has been shown every year since on [[British television]].

Japanese author and illustrator [[Mitsumasa Anno]] has published a number of picture books beginning in 1968 with ''Mysterious Pictures''. In his "Journey" books a tiny character travels through depictions of the culture of various countries. ''[[Everyone Poops]]'' was first published in [[Japan]] in 1977, written and illustrated by the prolific children's author [[Taro Gomi|Tarō Gomi]]. It has been translated into several languages. Australian author [[Margaret Wild]] has written more than 40 books since 1984 and won several awards. In 1987 the first book was published in the ''[[Where's Wally?]]'' (known as ''Where's Waldo?'' in the United States and Canada) series by the British illustrator [[Martin Handford]]. The books were translated into many languages and the franchise also spawned [[Where's Waldo? (TV series)|a TV series]], a comic strip and a series of video games. Since 1989 over 20 books have been created in the ''[[Elmer the Patchwork Elephant]]'' series by the British author [[David McKee]]. They have been translated in 40 languages and adapted into a children's TV series.

==Awards==
In 1938, the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) began presenting annually the [[Caldecott Medal]] to the most distinguished children's book illustration published in the year. The Caldecott Medal was established as a sister award to the ALA's [[Newbery Medal]], which was awarded to a children's books "for the most distinguished American children's book published the previous year" and presented annually beginning in 1922. During the mid-forties to early fifties, honorees included [[Marcia Brown]], [[Barbara Cooney]], [[Roger Duvoisin]], [[Berta and Elmer Hader]], [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]], [[Robert McCloskey]], [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Maurice Sendak]], [[Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire]], [[Leo Politi]], [[Tasha Tudor]], and [[Leonard Weisgard]].

The [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] was established in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1955 in honour of the children's illustrator, [[Kate Greenaway]]. The medal is given annually to an outstanding work of illustration in [[children's literature]]. It is awarded by [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP). Since 1965 the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]] (German Youth literature prize) includes a category for picture books. The IBBY [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] for Illustration has been awarded since 1966. The [[Boston Globe-Horn Book Award]], first presented in 1967, includes a category for picture books. In 2006, the ALA started awarding the [[Geisel Award]], named after [[Dr. Seuss]], to the most distinguished beginning reader book. The award is presented to both the author and illustrator, in "literary and artistic achievements to engage children in reading."

The [[Golden Pinwheel Young Illustrators Award]] was established in China in 2015. It received almost 1000 submitted works, from over 250 illustrators from around the world.

The '''portrayal of women scientists in film''' refers to the way that professional women in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)]] fields are written as film characters. The portrayal of women is a hotly contested talking point in the film community, with feminists saying that women are not accurately depicted in films. Judith Mayne, author and professor of women's studies at [[Ohio State University]], claims that the study of female characters in film began with movements from the 1960s and 1970s in the form of [[second-wave feminism]], the rise of [[independent film]]s, and the beginning of academic [[film studies]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Mayne, Judith. “Feminist Film Theory and Criticism.” ''Signs'', vol. 11, no. 1, 1985, pp. 81–100. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3174288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars offer several different stereotypes that academic women fall under in films. Eva Flicker, professor of sociology specializing in film at the [[University of Vienna]], is a leading scholar on the topic of academic women in film, specifically women in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soz.univie.ac.at/en/personnel/members-of-staff/test/eva-flicker-research-uni-wien/|title=Department of Sociology » Eva Flicker Research Uni Wien|website=www.soz.univie.ac.at|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flicker writes that the role of women scientists often reflect that "job stereotypes are combined with gender stereotypes."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hüppauf, Bernd-Rüdiger, and Peter Weingart, editors. ''Science Images and Popular Images of the Sciences''. vol. 8, Routledge, 2008, books.google.com/books?id=BE1j7Hs5egcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe that objectification is reserved solely for female characters in films. [[Noël Carroll|Nöel Carroll]], professor of philosophy at [[Cornell University]], writes that men are also strategically blocked for the audience's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Carroll does not disagree with the notion that women are objectified in film; rather, his stance says that women are not the only ones affected by the erotic gaze of viewers.

== History of Women Scientists in Film ==
'''Gorillas in the Mist (1988)'''

The film [[Gorillas in the Mist]] based on the book by [[Dian Fossey]] appears to show respect for the fact that a [[woman]] would rather work on her career than be a stereotypical housewife.  The story is about the scientist Fossey that leaves the United States to study gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. As she bonds with the gorillas, she worries about poachers and devotes her time to protecting the animals. Fossey is shown as an independent woman, breaking the common trope of women being the homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Film Theory|last=Thornham|first=Sue|publisher=New York University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780814782446|location=New York|pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jurassic Park (1993)'''

The 1993 film [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], based on the novel by [[Michael Crichton]] depicts a [[paleobotanist]], Dr. Ellie Sattler. She is portrayed with great physical ability, allowing her to survive multiple attacks from dinosaurs. She is shown to have extensive knowledge about dinosaurs and plant life throughout the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurassic Park|last=Crichton|first=Michael|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1990|isbn=0345370775|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravity (2013)'''''

The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]] and starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]], is often heralded as a breakthrough feminist film due to Bullock's starring role. Some who have critiqued the film have written that ''Gravity'' "proves that a woman can anchor an action-packed blockbuster that does ''not'' have to include violence, superheroes, weapons and/or huge death tolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/10/22/the-feminist-pull-of-gravity/|title=The Feminist Pull of "Gravity" - Ms. Magazine Blog|date=2013-10-22|work=Ms. Magazine Blog|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film's lead is a woman, she gets by with help from her male counterpart, played by Clooney. Bullock's character Ryan Stone is described as "the very model of the damsel in distress," as she can never get out of a situation on her own and must lean on Clooney's character to do the heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/gravity-my-most-overrated-film|title=Gravity: my most overrated film|last=Evans|first=Alan|date=2014-11-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Bullock's character is thought to be an act of defiant feminism, as she is the lead in a science fiction film, but below the surface viewers find that the film actually subscribes to traditional gender stereotypes and does not at all portray Bullock's character as a true independent woman.

== Ways of Analyzing Women in Film ==
In terms of intelligence, women are not often portrayed as equal to men. Eva Flicker writes that in science fiction films, men are overwhelmingly portrayed as scientists, making up 82% of all film scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Flicker, Eva. “Between Brains and Breasts—Women Scientists in Fiction Film: On the Marginalization and Sexualization of Scientific Competence.” ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 12, no. 3, 2003, pp. 307–318., doi:10.1177/0963662503123009.&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing 60 movies, Flicker has placed the women shown in science fiction films into six categories.

=== "The Old Maid" ===
This type of woman scientist is "only interested in her work"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and is often depicted having a nondescript appearance and style. As the film progresses, a man saves her and brings out her feminine side, after which she becomes more attractive. However, she loses credibility as an academic and suddenly makes more mistakes than when she did not focus as much on her appearance. Based on this type of story, Flicker concludes that "femininity and intelligence are mutually exclusive characteristics in a woman's film role."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example of this woman in a film can be seen in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|,]] in the character Dr. Constance Peterson.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Male Woman" ===
This type of woman works with men in an all male environment. Because of this, she has a "harsh voice" and occasionally "succumbs to an unhealthy lifestyle," such as partaking in smoking and drinking, to fit in with the boys.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Flicker claims that this type of woman is "lost somewhere in the middle" of masculinity and femininity, meaning she is not as sexual a character as other women are, but she is also not on the same level as the men she works with. This decreases her credibility both as a women and as one trying to fit into "a man's world." In the end, her heightened female emotions allow her to contribute to a solution, which is her redeeming quality as a character.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "male woman" character appears in the 1970 [[science fiction]] film ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Naïve Expert" ===
Seen in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', this woman scientist does very little. For the sake of the dramatization of the film, she is crucial, but she does not advance the story and does not contribute much to the solution. Instead, her femininity causes more trouble for the team of scientists. She is young, attractive, and subject to experience womanly emotions which add an extra layer to the existing predicament, forcing the man to solve the problem in order to get the team out of trouble. She is "naïve in her actions," messing up every task that is given to her despite her extensive education and knowledge, while her male counterpart stands in stark contrast and ends up saving the day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Evil Plotter" ===
[[File:Alison Doody 2.jpg|thumb|Alison Doody, who played [[Indiana Jones]]'s attractive female counterpart Dr. Elsa Schneider in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''|259x259px]]
The "evil plotter" woman is young and very beautiful, and she uses her feminine charm to trick the men into doing what she wants. She has an ulterior motive, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from what the rest of the team is trying to accomplish. She is the character that the audience and the other characters despise by the end of the movie because she is devilishly smart and knows how to use her scientific knowledge and sexual prowess for evil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This bombshell character type was portrayed by [[Alison Doody]] as [[Dr. Elsa Schneider]] in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Daughter/Assistant" ===
This role of female scientist encompasses many feminine stereotypes portrayed in movies. In this role the woman is subordinate to her male counterpart, who is either her father or her lover. She is smart and capable, but her secondary role does not allow her to demonstrate her abilities. Flicker writes that when this woman plays the role of lover to the male scientist, "her work place is limited to the bed."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She is only good for sexual satisfaction, not for the degree she earned. The assistant role is seen in the female Dr. Medford in the film [[Them! (1954 film)|''Them!'']], as she is portrayed alongside an older gentleman of the same name.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Lonely Heroine" ===

This type of woman scientist is intelligent, attractive, and somewhat independent. Flicker says that she "has appropriated some male traits," such as losing herself in her work. She is both sexual and smart, and she manages to exhibit both qualities in the film. Despite this, she is still subordinate to the men on her team, and depends on them and their work in order to gain respect. She is the most progressive of the woman scientist types, but she lacks her own form of independence and still must rely on a sexual relationship with a man in order to be seen as someone.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "lonely heroine" type is best seen in [[Jodie Foster|Jodie Foster']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s portrayal of Elleonore Arroway in the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:SDCC13 - Gravity panel (9345233475) cropped.png|thumb|Sandra Bullock (center), with director Alfonso Cuarón (right), and producer [[David Heyman]]|195x195px]]

== Female Characters as Objects in Film ==
Flicker argues that women are often pigeonholed into these six limiting roles when written in films. Each of these roles places the female scientist character on the sidelines, and does not allow her to be on the same level as her male counterpart(s). Despite the fact that the women in these roles are educated, and often just as educated as the men on their team, they are used primarily as assistants and sexual characters. Producers strategically write women's roles for the male gaze, often making the female characters use their "weapons of a woman," such as sex appeal, to be attractive to male characters and viewers alike.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
[[File:Laura Mulvey Fot Mariusz Kubik July 24 2010 03.JPG|thumb|Prominent feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey|227x227px]]
Feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] writes that in film, women are passive objects of the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Mulvey, Laura. “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” Film Theory and Criticism : Introductory Readings. Eds. Leo Braudy and Marshall Cohen. New York: Oxford UP, 1999: 833-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Mulvey writes that movies fulfill "a primordial wish for pleasurable looking," and that male audiences are largely catered to in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In her analysis of film, she states that the lead woman in a film often falls in love with her male counterpart, and when she does, she only exists as a character to please him. Through the male character's ownership of the woman, the men in the audience find themselves owning her as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Male gaze is a big factor to consider when looking at female scientists and how they are portrayed in films. Typically women are viewed as sexual objects for pleasure of males who view these films. This has a direct effect on how people interpret women scientists and their role in movies. Instead of being portrayed as superheroes, they begin to obtain a reputation based on sexual appeal.

Considering superhero films, Amy Shackelford mentions how the [[male gaze]] is applied to hypersexualize the female character, further misinterpreting women in the media through visual depiction. Looking at these particular films, screenwriters have a difficult time accomplishing the task of writing female characters. Shackelford also states that it seems like the only way these screenwriters know how to portray female characters in superhero films power is to hypersexualize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/11/female-characters-superhero-films/|title=The Grim Reality of Female Characters in Superhero Films|last=Shackelford|first=Amy|date=November 30, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Mayne supports Laura Mulvey's view. She writes that "most feminist film theory and criticism of the last decade" has been in written in response to Mulvey's 1975 assessment, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; She argues that understanding the often sexist portrayal of women in film requires "an understanding of patriarchy as oppressive and as vulnerable."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mayne goes deeper in her argument claiming that feminist film theory inspired feminist documentaries that are "aimed at rejecting stereotyped images of women."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This criticism also opens the question about "the notion of woman as 'image.'"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Law professor Sarah Eschholz and her colleagues Jana Bufkin and Jenny Long write that in film, women are often young, and female characters are rarely played by middle aged or older women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Eschholz, Sarah, et al. “Symbolic Reality Bites: Women And Racial/Ethnic Minorities In Modern Film.” ''Sociological Spectrum'', vol. 22, no. 3, 2002, pp. 299–334., doi:10.1080/02732170290062658.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only role available to these women is that of the mother, who is not meant to be a leading character. They write that "females' primary societal value is based on physical appearance and youthful beauty."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to their assessment, men are valued at all ages, and arguably more so as they age and become wiser. Most women in film are 35 years old or younger, while their male costars are often older.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite women in film having impressive credentials and extensive educations, they are often reduced to objects for looking, due to a reluctance to hire an older, less attractive woman for a major role.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the traditional husband and wife family, women are often portrayed as the second in command. Their husbands take on the role of family head and get to maintain a bachelor level of freedom, which allows them to work and spend time out with the guys. Eschholz, Bufkin, and Long report on studies that show female characters are more likely to be married and have a family than male characters.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Men have the freedom to work and be protagonists through their actions, while their wives or girlfriends are forced to take a back seat in the story in order to care for the family.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Opposing Views ==
Nöel Carroll references Mulvey's pivotal paper on psychoanalysis and visual pleasure in his writing, and plays devil's advocate to her claim that women are the only subjects of gaze. Carroll acknowledges and agrees with Mulvey's assessment that women in film are strategically placed for the male gaze despite the role of their actual character. Carroll states, "Women in Hollywood film are staged and blocked for the purpose of male erotic contemplation and pleasure."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Carroll, Noël. “The Image of Women in Film: A Defense of a Paradigm.” ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 48, no. 4, 1990, pp. 349–360. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/431572.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carroll adds that men in films are also strategically placed for the purpose of pleasure. He cites such examples as [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], big bodybuilding actors "whose scenes are blocked and staged precisely to afford spectacles of bulging pectorals and other parts."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Similarly to actresses, male actors are also heralded for their facial attractiveness and are sometimes lauded exclusively for being attractive. As an example, Carroll brings in [[Leslie Howard]], an actor in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]],'' who was highly successful in the industry despite being "staggeringly ineffectual."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to Carroll, being subject to the erotic gaze of the audience is not an exclusively female burden; rather, both sexes fall prey to Hollywood camera angles that best show off their bodies.

[[Kristin Thompson]], an American film theorist, analyzes the film ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]].'' In her analysis, she claims that the main character, Laura, was written to embody the role of "passive visual object," which Mulvey and Flicker claim is an extremely prevalent role of women in film.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Thompson, like Carroll, does not believe that this passive role is limited to women in the industry. Thompson claims that Mulvey's assessment stating that women are used as objects and men cannot handle being the subject of gaze is  "common but not universal" in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17326947|title=Breaking the glass armor : neoformalist film analysis|last=1950-|first=Thompson, Kristin,|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691067244|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=17326947}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that men are also presented in flashy ways in film, and gives the example of [[Howard Keel]] in the film ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her analysis aligns with Carroll's conclusion that both sexes must be the subject of the audience's gaze, and that objectification is all-encompassing.

== Impact of Film Portrayals of Women ==
[[File:Female scientist from DAST.png|thumb|Female scientist drawn in a Draw-a-Scientist Test (Chambers, 1983)]]
Studies have shown that female scientists are either underrepresented or misrepresented as film characters.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As Eva Flicker writes, film has a way of taking social realities and expressing women in [[:Category:Media formats|media formats]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The media formats then are able to influence the audience by creating a mirror of metaphors, myths, opinions and a social memory resulting in stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ways that women scientists are portrayed in films have contributed to viewers holding certain stereotypes of scientists. A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] by Jocelyn Steinke of [[Western Michigan University]] and colleagues looked at gender stereotyping by children who have been exposed to images of scientists through films, television shows, and books.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Steinke, Jocelyn, et al. “Assessing Media Influences on Middle School-Aged Children's Perceptions of Women in Science Using the Draw-A-Scientist Test (DAST).” ''Science Communication'', vol. 29, no. 1, 2007, pp. 35–64., doi:10.1177/1075547007306508.&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported on consisted of elementary school students taking the [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|Draw-a-Scientist-Test]], or [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|DAST]]. The results showed that out of the over 4,000 children who participated in the DAST, only 28 girls drew female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another study of 1,137 Korean students between the ages of eleven and fifteen found that 74 percent of them drew male scientists, while only 16 percent had depicted female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study includes the result that gender stereotypes can be the product of the environment a person possess and can influence how a person views themselves and others around them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As social media platforms are being used more and more each day by [[adolescence]]s, the reinforcement of cultural norms is at an all time high.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinke|first=Jocelyn|date=September 2005|title=Cultural Representations of Gender and Science- Portrayals of Female Scientists and Engineers in Popular Films|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1075547005278610|journal=DOI: 10.1177/1075547005278610|volume= 27|pages=27–63|via=Science Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before young women reach adolescence, social media platforms transform their images of women into the different stereotypes of dependent, emotional and less capable beings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''The Shetland Folk Society''' was created in 1945 as a heritage group, to gather, record and support all aspects of [[Shetland]]'s cultural history. The first president was T. A. Robertson ([[Vagaland]]), who served until his death in 1973, after which John J. Graham took on the role. Current president is Douglas Sinclair.

The Shetland Folk Society has been responsible for many key initiatives and publications, including regular volumes of The [[Shetland Folk Book]] (see below), ''Da Sangs At A'll Sing ta dee: a book of Shetland songs'' (Robertson &amp; Robertson, 1973), ''Da Mirrie Dancers: A Book of Shetland Fiddle Tunes'' ([[Tom Anderson]] &amp; [[Tom Georgeson]], 1970), the 1985 reprint of [[Jakob Jakobsen]]'s dictionary and [[Bertie Deyell]]'s collection of ''Shetland Proverbs and Sayings'' (1993).

'''Standoff distance''' is a security term that refers to measures to prevent unscreened and potentially threatening people and vehicles from approaching within a certain distance of a [[building]], [[car]], or other [[shelter (building)|shelter]], roadblock or other location, or to a person such as a law enforcement officer or VIP, or to a friendly area / location.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/63316/army_seeks_safe_soldier_solutions_through_research T'Jae Gibson, Army Research Laboratory (August 15, 2011)  Army seeks safe Soldier solutions through research]
* See also Gen. [[David G. Perkins]] ''Win in a complex world'', and other TRADOC doctrine&lt;/ref&gt; ''See [[Power projection]], [[Identification friend or foe]], [[Display behavior]]''

Standoff distance may be ensured using fixed physical barriers such as fences or bollards; temporary placement of items to block access (e.g., using law enforcement vehicles or police tape to block a road or bridge); physical features other than barriers (these may appear innocuous, such as the [[White House]] lawn or adding an ornamental pond); armed guards or positions (e.g., a police [[sniper]] in [[Overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]]); or deploying police officers with carbines such as an [[M4 carbine|M-4]], instead of just a service sidearm. When police officers have carbines the standoff distance is increased because an attacker who poses a threat can be fired upon from greater distances.

Standoff distance is used when a [[violence|violent]] [[criminal]] is in a fortified position, when [[hostage]]s are under armed threat from [[Kidnapping|kidnappers]], when a [[bomb]] is believed to have been placed, or when other unspecified dangers may be lurking. It is a measure of distance used by government, law enforcement, or military operatives handling the situation to protect their own agents and civilians from physical injury or death while the situation is resolved.

==Firearms==

When an armed and violent criminal is sheltered in a location not easily reachable by a [[tranquilizer]] round or [[disabling shot]] - or [[extreme prejudice]] ammunition, if authorized by mission leaders - police, military, and counterterrorism officers maintain distance (often out of the direct [[Sightline|line of sight]] and behind [[cover (military)|cover]]) while often using a [[megaphone]] to call for backup, the arrest of the subject, or to take him/her into custody.  [[Sniper]] coverage is used often in these situations, and standard procedure for officers or operatives (or citizens taking part in a [[citizen's arrest]]) is to call for heavily [[armor]]ed backup while maintaining cover themselves.  In the wake of active shooter scenarios, some law enforcement agencies have switched to moving in on the suspects, to prevent the gunmen from harming civilians. [[therapy|Therapeutic]] interventions or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] techniques may be used to [[talk down]] the suspects or identified threats and assailants.

==Hostage situations==

In a hostage situation, the primary goal is the safe recovery of the hostages, who are usually held under threat of [[violence]] or other prolonged physical harm ([[starvation]], [[poison]]ing, [[bleeding]], [[illness]]) from [[kidnapping|kidnappers]]. Thus the situation is treated similarly to situations with other armed attackers under cover, but with even more caution. [[sniper]]s are often employed to attempt to provide leverage against the hostage-takers or to fire at the hostage takers if an imminent risk of harm to the hostages is identified. 

Unless all kidnappers can be hit and killed by sniper gunfire almost simultaneously, generally [[extreme prejudice]] (e.g., shooting at gunmen)is not used as freely due to the danger of other kidnappers killing the hostages, as in the [[Munich massacre|1972 Munich]] example. 

This is not true in [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] situations, where the hostage taker is often shot by a snipers with armor-piercing or wall-piercing ammunition if talk or negotiation resolution is impossible.  In all situations the preferred method is to talk the kidnappers into releasing the hostages for [[ransom]] or otherwise talking them down using [[therapy|therapeutic]] or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] techniques, to protect the safety of the hostages and, ideally, have the suspect surrender peacefully.

==Bombs==
With bomb threats, the standoff distance used by law enforcement officers depends on the size and type of the bomb. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;
The smallest standoff distances, about 70 feet from the threat, are used for small [[pipe bomb]]s with about five pounds of explosives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A human suicide bomber with about 20 pounds of explosives strapped to his/her body has a standoff distance of 110 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A briefcase or suitcase bomb with about 50 pounds of explosives has a 150 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Larger car bombs or truck bombs have a much larger standoff distance, as the blast radius is bigger. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A car bomb with a 500 pound bomb has a 320 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A small delivery truck-based truck bomb with a 1,000 pound bomb has a 640 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A huge 18-wheeler truck-sized truck bomb with over 60,000 pounds of explosives has a 1,570 foot standoff distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/OFFSHC/offshc-gets-briefed-on-ieds |title=Office for Bombing Prevention: Improvised Explosive Device Awareness |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.slideshare.net |publisher=Homeland Security |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Standoff distance is also intended to deter terrorists from using [[car bomb]]s by making it more difficult for them to cause catastrophic damage. In the wake of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], many high-risk federal buildings began enforcing standoff distances. It is based on the concept that a blast shock load is essentially a [[high-pressure front]] that moves out radially and decays very quickly&lt;ref&gt;http://govtsecurity.com/mag/blastresistant_facilities_even/&lt;/ref&gt; - because blast falloff is thus often more [[exponentiation|exponential]] than [[linear]] (indeed [[Vector (geometric)|radial]] - any given explosive must cover a circular-shaped area but blast power generally only increases linearly with explosive strength){{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, any standoff distance helps increases survival chances for passersby and minimizes danger, though [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] mitigates this effect if present.  

Hydraulic [[roadblock]]s (sometimes wedge-shaped), or [[bollard]]s can be raised to block approaching vehicles; these can be designed to prevent even a heavy, fast-moving truck from getting through. [[Jersey barrier]]s and concrete planters filled with dirt have also been used to maintain separation between screened and unscreened traffic. Certain infrastructure at risk of terrorist attack, such as bridges, may not be well-suited to standoff distances since their purpose is for traffic to travel along them.

'''Straw marquetry''' is a craft very similar to that of wood [[marquetry]], except that straw replaces the [[wood veneer]]. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.

To mimic the varying shades of wood veneer, [[wheat]] or [[oat]] straw has to be split, then soaked in cold, warm, or hot water. The strips are then ironed, and there will be a variety of tones from pale gold to deepest dark brown. 

There are accounts of nuns in France and Switzerland making a variety of items using straw marquetry.

The most famous straw marquetry was practised by prisoners of war from the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Dartmoor and other prisons had been built for them; the prison most famous for straw marquetry was Norman Cross, [[Huntingdon]]. 

[[Easter eggs]] are decorated with [[straw]] [[applique]], especially in Eastern European countries. Geometric shapes, stars and flower motifs are the most common themes. There is a slight difference in the way the straw is prepared, however; for marquetry, the straws are soaked, split and ironed; for [[Egg (biology)|egg]] decoration the straw is not ironed.

The '''''Taller de Gráfica Popular''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "People's Graphic Workshop") is an artist's print collective founded in [[Mexico]] in 1937 by artists [[Leopoldo Méndez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
The Workshop was founded in 1937 following the dissolution of the [[Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios]] (LEAR, Revolutionary Writers’ and Artists’ League), a group of artists who had supported the goals of the [[Mexican Revolution]].

Initially called the Taller Editorial de Gráfica Popular, its founders built off a rich tradition of printmaking in Mexico, particularly the legacy of [[José Guadalupe Posada]] and [[Manuel Manilla]].

Under President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], the work of the Taller supported the government's policies, including the [[Mexican oil expropriation]].

In 1940, muralist [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] launched an armed assault on the residence of exiled [[Russian Revolution]]ary [[Leon Trotsky]], using the Taller's print shop as a headquarters and including some artists affiliated with the Taller in his squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate =2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some collaboration between the TGP and the artists of the [[New Deal]]-era [[Works Progress Administration]], including [[Rafael Tufiño]].

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Chicano]] and [[African American art]]ists such as [[Elizabeth Catlett]] produced work at the Taller. The Taller became inspiration to many politically active leftist artists; for example, American expressionist painter [[Byron Randall]] went on to found similar artist collectives after becoming an associate member.&lt;ref&gt;Makin, Jean, ed.

Mexico: Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Susan  (2010).  ''Becoming Pablo O’Higgins''.  San Francisco/Salt Lake City: Pince-Nez Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TGP faced financial instability and had to relocate several times, but [[Jesús Alvarez Amaya]] kept it running up to his death in 2010.

==Work==
During its heyday, the Taller specialized in linoleum prints and woodcuts. It produced posters, handbills, banners, and portfolio editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate =2009-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art supported causes such as [[anti-militarism]], [[organized labor]], and [[antifascism|opposition to fascism]].
 
The art was often made through the collaborative process, and the Taller took the anti-commercial policy of not numbering prints, but it sold prints as part of and was the first political publishing workshop in Mexico to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Under the brand ''La Estampa Mexicana'', the TGP sold song lyrics, posters of heroes and Mexican culture and Left movements worldwide, and gave rise to a new generation of ''calaveras'', the Mexican tradition of humorous poetry ridiculing politicians and other popular figures. The [[raised fist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html Mexican posters on social and educational themes]&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as a graphic symbol of resistance and unity.

It still working on art and social issues and it is located in Dr. Villada 46, Colonia Doctores, [[Mexico City]].

'''''The Gross Clinic''''', or, '''''The Clinic of Dr. Gross''''', is an 1875 painting by American artist [[Thomas Eakins]]. It is [[oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|8|ft|cm}} by {{convert|6.5|ft|cm}}.

Many art historians consider ''The Gross Clinic'' to be one of the best American paintings ever made. Dr. [[Samuel D. Gross]], a seventy-year-old professor dressed in a black frock coat, lectures a group of [[Jefferson Medical College]] students.  Included among the group is a self-portrait of Eakins, who is seen at the right-hand side of the painting, next to the tunnel railing, with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing.&lt;ref name=Smarth&gt;{{cite web|last=Floryan|first=Meg|title=Eakins's The Gross Clinic|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/eakins-the-gross-clinic.html|work=[[Smarthistory]]|publisher=[[Khan Academy]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seen over Dr. Gross's right shoulder is the clinic clerk, Dr. Franklin West, taking notes on the operation.

Eakins's signature is painted into the painting, on the front of the surgical table.

==Description==
Admired for its uncompromising [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]], ''The Gross Clinic'' has an important place documenting the history of medicine—both because it honors the emergence of [[surgery]] as a healing profession (previously, surgery was associated primarily with [[amputation]]), and because it shows us what the [[operating theater|surgical theater]] looked like in the nineteenth century.

The painting is based on a surgery witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]].  Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation as opposed to an amputation (which is how the patient would normally have been treated in previous decades).

Here, surgeons crowd around the anesthetized patient in their frock coats.  This is just prior to the adoption of a hygienic surgical environment (see [[asepsis]]).  ''The Gross Clinic'' is thus often contrasted with Eakins's later painting ''[[The Agnew Clinic]]'' (1889), which depicts a cleaner, brighter, surgical theater, with the participants in "[[white coat]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653]&lt;/ref&gt; In comparing the two, the advancement in understanding of the prevention of infection is seen.  Another noteworthy difference in the later painting is the presence of a professional nurse, Mary Clymer, in the operating theater.

It is assumed that the patient depicted in ''The Gross Clinic'' was a teenage boy, although the exposed body is not entirely discernible as male or female; the painting is shocking for both the odd presentation of this figure and the matter-of-fact goriness of the procedure.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;Kimmelman, Michael (June 21, 2002). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5D6153FF932A15755C0A9649C8B63 Art Review: A Fire Stoking Realism.] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the drama is the lone woman in the painting seen in the middle ground, possibly the patient's mother, cringing in distress.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt;  Her dramatic figure functions as a strong contrast to the calm, professional demeanor of the men who surround the patient. This bloody and very blunt depiction of surgery was shocking at the time it was first exhibited.

==Critical reception==
[[File:Gross Clinic on display at the 1876 Centennial.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Gross Clinic'' on display in the U.S. Army Post Hospital at the [[1876 Centennial Exposition]].]]

The painting was submitted for the 1876 [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], but was rejected by the Committee of Selection. When it was eventually displayed in Ward One of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a critic for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' wrote that it was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...one of the most powerful, horrible, yet fascinating pictures that has been painted anywhere in this century...but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it, for not to look at it is impossible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another critic, writing in 1885, said:

{{quote|It is characterized by so many excellent artistic qualities, that one regrets that the work as a whole fails to satisfy. Admirable draughtsman as this painter is, one is surprised that in the arrangement of the figures the perspective should have been so ineffective that the mother is altogether too small for the rest of the group, and the figure of the patient so indistinct that it is difficult to tell exactly the part of the body upon which the surgeon is performing the operation. The monochromatic tone of the composition is, perhaps, intentional, in order to concentrate the effect on the bloody thigh and the crimson finger of the operating professor. But as it is, the attention is at once and so entirely directed on that reeking hand as to convey the impression that such concentration was the sole purpose of the painting. In similar paintings by [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Henri Regnault|Regnault]],&lt;ref&gt;Here the writer no doubt refers to Regnault's 1870 painting, [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/execution-sans-jugement-381.html?no_cache=1 Summary Execution under the Moorish Kings of Grenada], which depicts a decapitation.&lt;/ref&gt; and other artists of the horrible, as vivid a result is obtained without sacrificing the light and color in the other parts of the picture; and the effect, while no less intense, is, therefore, less startling and loud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin|S. G. W. Benjamin]], ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40604/40604-h/40604-h.htm Art in America: A Critical and Historical Sketch]'', Harpers, 1880. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These assessments were not universal. The critic for Philadelphia's ''The Evening Telegraph'', who may have been aware of the personal politics involved in the advisory group of artists who rejected it, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing so fine in the American section of the Art Department of the Exhibition, and it is a great pity that the squeamishness of the Selecting Committee compelled the artist to find a place for it in the United States Hospital building. It is rumored that the blood on Dr. Gross' fingers made some of the members of the committee sick, but, judging from the quality of the work exhibited by them we fear that it was not the blood alone that made them sick. Artists have before now been known to sicken at the sight of pictures by younger men which they in their souls were compelled to acknowledge were beyond their emulation.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Clark, ''The Evening Telegraph'', June 16, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Controversy about the painting has centered on its violence, and on the melodramatic presence of the woman. Modern scholars have suggested that the painting may be read in terms of castration anxiety and fantasies of mastery over the body (e.g. [[Michael Fried]]), and that it documents Eakins's ambivalence about representing sex difference (e.g. [[Jennifer Doyle]]). The painting has also been understood to be drawing an analogy between painting and surgery and as identifying the work of the artist with the emergence of surgery as a respected profession.

In 2002 [[Michael Kimmelman]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting."&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt;  In 2006, in response to the impending sale of this painting, ''The New York Times'' published a "close reading" which sketches some of the different critical perspectives on this work of art.&lt;ref name="shattuck"&gt;Shattuck, Kathryn (November 17, 2006).   [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/arts/design/19shat.html "Got Medicare? A $68 Million Operation"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
After its purchase for US$200 at the time of the Centennial Exhibition, the painting was housed in the College Building of [[Jefferson Medical College]], [[Thomas Jefferson University]] in Philadelphia until it was moved in the mid-1980s to Jefferson Alumni Hall. Although undocumented, in the late-1970s there was a rumor of a substantial offer by a collector who wished to donate the painting to the [[National Gallery of Art]]. On November 11, 2006, the Thomas Jefferson University [[Board of directors|Board]] voted to sell the painting for US$68 million to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington and the new [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]], then under construction in [[Bentonville, Arkansas]]. The sale would represent a record price for an artwork made in the United States prior to World War II.&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;Vogel, Carol (November 11, 2006). Eakins Masterwork Is to Be Sold to Museums. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed sale was seen as a secretive act.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;Salisbury, Stephan (November 14, 2006), A divisive deal, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/16005417.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In late November 2006, efforts began to keep the painting in Philadelphia, including a fund with a December 26 deadline to raise money to purchase it and a plan to invoke a clause regarding "historic objects" in the city's historic preservation code.  In a matter of weeks the fund raised $30 million, and on December 21, 2006, [[Wachovia]] Bank agreed to loan the difference until the rest of the money has been raised, keeping the painting in town at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]].

Pledges alone were not enough to cover the US$68 million purchase price. The [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] was forced to deaccession Eakins's ''The Cello Player'' to an unidentified private buyer; and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] deaccessioned Eakins's ''Cowboy Singing'', along with two oil sketches for ''Cowboys in the Badlands'', to the [[Anschutz collection]] and the [[Denver Art Museum]]. The Denver-based [[Anschutz collection]] purchased ''Cowboys in the Badlands'' at a 22 May 2003 auction at [[Christie's|Christie's New York]] for $5,383,500, which was the previous record for an Eakins painting.&lt;ref&gt;Antiques and the Arts Online (May 27, 2003).

==Restorations==
{{main|Conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' The Gross Clinic}}
The painting has [[art restoration|been restored]] three times. The first restoration between 1917 and 1925 substantially damaged the painting, rendering secondary figures in the composition inconsistently bright or reddish in color.&lt;ref name="K1"&gt;Kennedy, Randy [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/arts/design/19eakins.html "Shedding Darkness on an Eakins Painting", ''The New York Times'', July 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1929, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]], the artist's widow, wrote a letter of complaint regarding the "fancy red light" that had falsified the painting's intended tones.&lt;ref name=Smarth/&gt;&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMARestore1961&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation Project|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html?page=2|work=Philadelphia Museum of Art (website)|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting's backing was reinforced with plywood by H. Stevenson in 1915. This was replaced in 1940 by [[Hannah Mee Horner]], who glued the painting to a plywood backing. Within two decades this backing began to warp and threatened to tear the painting in half.&lt;ref name=PMARestoreProject&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1961 Conservation Treatment of ''The Gross Clinic''|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html?page=3|work=Philadelphia Museum of Art (website)|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, at the request of Jefferson Medical College, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) undertook another restoration, under conservator Theodor Siegl.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Siegl. The Thomas Eakins Collection. Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1978. {{ISBN|0-8122-1162-6}}. Page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Tucker, a later PMA conservator, described the work as "a rescue mission... They were saving the painting from tearing itself in half. These were the nail heads that were starting to work forward into the canvas and show as bumps on the front... Yeah. It was just hair-raising."&lt;ref name=Seattle&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2011860177_grossclinicpainting15.html?syndication=rss 'Gross Clinic' painting undergoes its own public surgery]. Stephan Salisbury. The ''Seattle Times'', May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Siegl used a [[power plane]] to remove the plywood down to the last, thin ply. The rest of the wood and the tenacious glue were painstakingly removed by hand. Siegl and his colleagues also restored, to some extent, the faces in the upper right of the canvas.&lt;ref name=PMARestore1961/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt;

In 2009, in response to long term concerns regarding inconsistencies in the painting's disposition of darkness and light, conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art undertook restoration of ''The Gross Clinic'' from July 2009 to July 2010, during which time the painting was not publicly visible.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt; The restoration sought to revert changes that had been made by the Jefferson Medical College during the 1917 restoration. Definition of parts, including Eakins' self-portrayal, was restored, using as reference an [[ink wash]] copy of the painting made by the artist, as well as a photograph taken by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] previous to the Medical College's changes in 1917.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMARestoreVisual&gt;{{cite web|title=The Visual Record of Changes|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html?page=4|work=Philadelphia Museum of Art (website)|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tigran Melikov's House'''({{lang-az|Tiqran Məlikovun evi}}) is a historic mansion located at crossing of Islam Safarli and Hazi Aslanov streets in [[Baku]], Azerbaijan. The mansion was built between 1895 and 1897 on the order of Tigran Melikov, who was a son of [[Armenians|Armenian]] industrialist, Ambarsum Melikov. It is the first building built in the Gothic style in Baku,&lt;ref name="Fətullayev15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fətullayev|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ensiklopediya201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bakının memarlıq ensiklopediyası|2013|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Józef Gosławski (architect)|Józef Gosławski]]'s first project on personal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Фатуллаев-Фигаров|first=Шамиль|title=Юзеф Гославский (1865 -1904)|url=http://www.polonia-baku.org/ru/goslawski.phtml|website=polonia-baku.org|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1813, while establishing the outer-city, the area was given the architectural look of a square, which is still preserved. The mansion was built at crossing of Islam Safarli and Hazi Aslanov streets. Melikov's mansion was the first building to be built in gothic style in Baku. While building the mansion, [[Adolf Eichler]] was preparing plan of a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] styled church in [[28 May Street]]. 

==Architectural features==
In terms of the difficulty of the residential building, the individual form of the project is formed in the context of the classical style of Baku. The facades are covered with stones. The mansion is full of windows which helps to enlighten it. The rooms in the south and east and the staircase are brightly lit by the lamp on the roof.&lt;ref name="Ensiklopediya200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bakının memarlıq ensiklopediyası|2013|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Profiled arches were used on the two upper floors of the building. On the third floor a balcony is opened on bay window fixed on second floor. Bay windows contains two main and two additional windows. The narrowest part of the residential property is located in the east. Shamil Fatullayev notes, Gosławski created facades under unfluence of Florencian palaces.&lt;ref name="Fətullayev16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fətullayev|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tristan Tzara''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁistɑ̃ dzaʁa|lang}}; {{IPA-ro|trisˈtan ˈt͡sara|lang}}; born '''Samuel''' or '''Samy Rosenstock''', also known as '''S. Samyro'''; {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1896|4 April}} &amp;ndash; 25 December 1963) was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. Under the influence of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara became interested in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and co-founded the magazine ''[[Simbolul]]'' with [[Ion Vinea]] (with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry) and painter [[Marcel Janco]]. During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].

After moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the "presidents of Dada", joined the staff of ''[[Littérature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[André Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''.

During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].

Tristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].

==Name==
''S. Samyro'', a partial [[anagram]] of ''Samy Rosenstock'', was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"&gt;Cernat, p.108-109&lt;/ref&gt; A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature ''Tristan Ruia'', and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name ''Tristan''.&lt;ref name="pcern109"&gt;Cernat, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=15 September 2008 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=27 March 2008 }}; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the ''Tzara'' part of his pseudonym in 1915.&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep ''Tristan'' as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the "infamous pun" ''Triste Âne Tzara'' ([[French language|French]] for "Sad Donkey Tzara").&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations ''Tristan Țara'' and ''Tr. Tzara'', in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, art historian [[Serge Fauchereau]], based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''trist în țară'', meaning "sad in the country"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected ''Tristan'' as a tribute to poet [[Tristan Corbière]] or to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' opera.&lt;ref name="pcern110"&gt;Cernat, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's [[Minister of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Ministry of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as ''țara'' ("the land", {{IPA-ro|ˈt͡sara}}).&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Andra Matzal, [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/node/2948 "România-fantomă o să mai existe în forma unei suferințe psihice" (interview with Andrei Codrescu)]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, at [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ Club Literatura]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613075708/http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ |date=13 June 2009 }}, ''[[Cotidianul]]''; retrieved 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and ''Simbolul'' years===
Tzara was born in [[Moinești]], [[Bacău County]], in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Western Moldavia]]. His parents were [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanians]] who reportedly spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their first language;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business.&lt;ref name="iliv241"&gt;Livezeanu, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vmttcl"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Macarie, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html "Inedit: Tristan Tzara"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309001230/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html |date=9 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, ''née'' Zibalis.&lt;ref name="vmttcl"/&gt; Owing to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated]], and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;

He moved to [[Bucharest]] at the age of 11, and attended the Schemitz-Tierin [[boarding school]].&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the [[Saint Sava National College]]&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1912, when Tzara was aged 16, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing ''[[Simbolul]]''. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds.&lt;ref name="pcern99"&gt;Cernat, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague [[Jacques G. Costin]], who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.186-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] authors, active within [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's own Symbolist movement]]. Alongside their close friend and mentor [[Adrian Maniu]] (an [[Imagism|Imagist]] who had been Vinea's tutor),&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[N. Davidescu]], [[Alfred Hefter|Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[I. M. Rașcu]], [[Eugeniu Sperantia]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]], as well as the journalist and lawyer [[Poldi Chapier]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"&gt;Cernat, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, [[Alexandru Macedonski]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; ''Simbolul'' also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and [[Iosif Iser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tzara, Maxy, Vinea, Costin (1915).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Chemarea]]'' circle in 1915. From left: Tzara, [[M. H. Maxy]], [[Ion Vinea]], and [[Jacques G. Costin]]]]
Although the magazine ceased print in December 1912, it played an important part in shaping [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] of the period. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49-54, 397-398, 412&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming "an interface between arts", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[Gârceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116-121&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chemarea'' and 1915 departure===
Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] kept out of [[World War I]]. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97, 106, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.99, 100-108&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea.&lt;ref name="pcern99"/&gt; According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was "totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'', and, in June 1915, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' published Samyro's known poem ''Verișoară, fată de pension'' ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl").&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"/&gt;

Tzara had enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ttunifi"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html "Tristan Tzara"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother [[Jules Janco|Jules]], had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother [[Georges Janco|Georges]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Zurich|local university]],&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrdada"&gt;Marta Ragozzino, "Tristan Tzara", in ''Art e Dossier'', March 1994, Giunti, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who was a student at the ''[[ETH Zurich|Technische Hochschule]]'', in the Altinger Guest House&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] political statement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.132; Livezeanu, p.241, 249&lt;/ref&gt; After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French.&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"&gt;Cernat, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these pieces were first printed only in the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116, 130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Zürich that the Romanian group met with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Hugo Ball]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] poet and pianist, and his young wife [[Emmy Hennings]], a [[music hall]] performer. In February 1916, Ball had rented the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for [[performance art]] and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111; Hofman, p.2; Richter, p.12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like [[Hans Arp]], [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], [[Otto van Rees]], [[Max Oppenheimer]], and [[Marcel Słodki]], "readily agreed to take part in the cabaret."&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national [[folklore]]s, "Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry&lt;!-- sic --&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Gendron, p.73; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"/&gt; He was soon after involved in Tzara's "simultaneist verse" performance, "the first in Zürich and in the world", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of [[Cubism]], [[Fernand Divoire]] and [[Henri Barzun]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of Dada===
[[File:Placa en Cabaret Voltaire retouched.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] plaque commemorating the birth of Dada]]
It was in this milieu that [[Dada]] was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.&lt;ref name="pcern112"&gt;Cernat, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of performances took place at the [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired."&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[André Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vaché]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: "[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for "international magazine"]."&lt;ref name="hrich14"&gt;Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: "The magazine shall be published in Zürich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich14"/&gt; The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer [[Walter Serner]], who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.&lt;ref name="hrich123"&gt;Richter, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], was first adopted in print in June 1916.&lt;ref name="hrich32"&gt;Richter, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of "[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]" and a [[German language|German-language]] term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116&lt;/ref&gt; Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for "mother" in an unspecified [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dadaist promoter===
Before the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Hofman, p.3-4; Cernat, p.115; Livezeanu, p.249-251; Londré, p.396; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.43, 59&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of "an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater."&lt;ref name="bgend77"&gt;Gendron, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrich33"&gt;Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a "very cool and distant attitude to this new movement" before being approached by the Romanian author.&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''—Richter describes his "energy, passion and talent for the job", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.4; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.45, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: "we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.199, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.217)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara.&lt;ref name="buddevo"&gt;S. Batchelor, "Existence, Enlightenment and Suicide: The Dilemma of Nanavira Thera", in Tadeusz Skorupski (ed.), ''The Buddhist Forum'', Vol. IV (Seminar Papers 1994-1996), [[Routledge]], London, 1996, p.11-13. {{ISBN|0-7286-0255-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Tzara and Ball opened the ''Galerie Dada'' permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent Italian visual artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and with the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'', all of whom were described as "fathers of Dada".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.39-40, 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the same months, and probably owing to Tzara's intervention, the Dada group organized a performance of ''Sphinx and Strawman'', a puppet play by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]], whom he advertised as an example of "Dada theater".&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in touch with ''[[Nord-Sud]]'', the magazine of French poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends),&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; and contributed articles on [[African art]] to both ''Nord-Sud'' and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]'s ''SIC'' magazine.&lt;ref name="hrich167"&gt;Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Zürich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly [[left-wing]] disciples in the German Empire—[[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Jung]], and Heartfield's brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.7-8; Richter, p.102-114&lt;/ref&gt; With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled [[Cologne]], where he became familiarized with the elaborate [[collage]] works of Schwitters and [[Max Ernst]], which he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137, 155, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.397; Richter, p.137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called "Dada presidents", who represented various regions of Europe. According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Théodore Fraenkel]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes: "I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of World War I===
The shows Tzara staged in Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Richter speaks of a "pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" (''see [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt; While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq poèmes'' ("Twenty-five Poems").&lt;ref name="rcard530"&gt;Cardinal, p.530&lt;/ref&gt;

A major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Zürich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.70-74&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use "Dada" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: "Dada belongs to everybody").&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself "switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[Käthe Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.74-78&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' ("Final Dissolution"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent mêlée, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.78-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"&gt;Richter, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who admits that the magazine was "rather tame", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German revolts of 1918]], which "had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was "an association of revolutionary artists."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. {{ISBN|0-520-22395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.&lt;ref name="pcern115"&gt;Cernat, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-123, 181-183&lt;/ref&gt; When Vinea submitted his poem ''Doleanțe'' ("Grievances") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Dada===
[[File:Jane Heap, John Rodker, Martha Dennison, Tristan Tzara, Margaret Anderson, ca. 1920s.jpg|thumb|330px|Tzara (second from right) in the 1920s, with [[Margaret C. Anderson]], [[Jane Heap]], and [[John Rodker]]]]
In late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and [[Claude Rivière]] in editing the Paris-based magazine ''[[Littérature]]''.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529-530; Hofman, p.12-14; Richter, p.167, 173&lt;/ref&gt; Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an "Anti-[[Messiah]]" and a "prophet".&lt;ref name="hrich168"&gt;Richter, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down [[Boulevard Raspail]] through a [[triumphal arch]] made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt; Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from [[Gare de l'Est]] to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt;

He is often described as the main figure in the ''Littérature'' circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; When Picabia began publishing a new series of ''391'' in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine "decked out [...] in all the colors of Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich167"/&gt; He was also issuing his ''Dada'' magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it ''Bulletin Dada'' and later ''Dadaphone''.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13-14; Richter, p.173, 179-180&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, he met American author [[Gertrude Stein]], who wrote about him in ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"''Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''", in ''The Cambridge Handbook of American Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1986 p.13. {{ISBN|0-521-30703-1}}; Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist couple [[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]] (with whom he worked in tandem for "poem-dresses" and other simultaneist literary pieces).&lt;ref name="tgdelau"&gt;Tag Gronberg, "Sonia Delaunay's Simultaneous Fashions and the Modern Woman", in Whitney Chadwick, Tirza True Latimer (eds.), ''The Modern Woman Revisited: Paris between the Wars'', [[Rutgers University Press]], Piscataway, p.114-115. {{ISBN|0-8135-3292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara became involved in a number of Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or [[Paul Éluard]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/tzara-tristan "Tristan Tzara 1896–1963"], in Susan Salas, Laura Wisner-Broyles, ''Poetry Criticism'', Vol. 27, Gale Group Inc., 2000, [http://www.enotes.com/ eNotes.com]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.173-176&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Raymond Radiguet]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by [[hoax]]es and [[false advertising]], announcing that the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film star [[Charlie Chaplin]] was going to appear on stage at its show,&lt;ref name="bgend77"/&gt; or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the ''[[Université populaire]]'' in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"&gt;Richter, p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt; Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the [[working class]].&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"/&gt;

Dada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 [[variety show]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]], which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Dermée and Tzara's earlier work, ''La Première aventure céleste de M. Antipyrine'' ("The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine").&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.179-183&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's melody, ''Vaseline symphonique'' ("Symphonic Vaseline"), which required ten or twenty people to shout "cra" and "cri" on a rising scale, was also performed.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's ''Manifeste cannibale'' ("Cannibal Manifesto"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.180-182&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative. Traditionalist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]], the more reserved modernists [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]] all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an [[agent of influence]] for the [[Central Powers]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugen Lovinescu]], editor of ''[[Sburătorul]]'' and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary "extremism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.126-127, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada stagnation===
[[File:St-Julien-le-Pauvre &amp; houses.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], site of the 1921 "Dada excursion"]]
By 1921, Tzara had become involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with the spirit of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128; Richter, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with [[Raoul Hausmann]] over leadership status.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt; According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.182-183, 192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;

A more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of [[Maurice Barrès]], whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his [[antisemitism]] and [[reactionary]] stance: [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, [[Benjamin Péret]] and others as witnesses (a [[mannequin]] stood in for Barrès).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-186&lt;/ref&gt; Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-185&lt;/ref&gt; During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, [[Maja Kruschek]] and Tzara were in Austria, at [[Imst]], where they published their last manifesto as a group, ''Dada au grand air'' ("Dada in the Open Air") or ''Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol'' ("The Battle of the Singers in [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]").&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.186 (illustration 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also visited [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]], where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'', arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128&lt;/ref&gt; After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing ''[[Contimporanul]]'', which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: Janco later mentioned "some dramatic quarrels" between his colleague and him.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; They avoided each other for the rest of their lives and Tzara even struck out the dedications to Janco from his early poems.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115, 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Evola]] also grew disappointed by the movement's total rejection of tradition and began his personal search for an alternative, pursuing a path which later led him to [[esotericism]] and fascism.&lt;ref name="buddevo"/&gt;

===''Evening of the Bearded Heart''===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg kleine Dada soirée.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s poster for a Dada soirée (ca.1923)]]
Tzara was openly attacked by Breton in a February 1922 article for ''[[Le Journal de Peuple]]'', where the Romanian writer was denounced as "an impostor" avid for "publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114; Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Breton initiated the ''Congress for the Determination and Defense of the Modern Spirit''. The French writer used the occasion to strike out Tzara's name from among the Dadaists, citing in his support Dada's Huelsenbeck, Serner, and [[Christian Schad]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"&gt;Cernat, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the [[Supreme War Council]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Tzara, who attended the Congress only as a means to subvert it,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; responded to the accusations the same month, arguing that Huelsenbeck's note was fabricated and that Schad had not been one of the original Dadaists.&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Rumors reported much later by American writer [[Brion Gysin]] had it that Breton's claims also depicted Tzara as an informer for the [[Prefecture of Police]].&lt;ref name="nzgysin"&gt;[[Nicholas Zurbrugg]], "Brion Gysin", in ''Art, Performance, Media: 31 Interviews'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], Minneapolis, p.190. {{ISBN|0-8166-3832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral.&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hans Richter, the main part of this took place in [[Weimar]], where the Dadaists attended a festival of the [[Bauhaus]] art school, during which Tzara proclaimed the elusive nature of his art: "Dada is useless, like everything else in life. [...] Dada is a virgin microbe which penetrates with the insistence of air into all those spaces that reason has failed to fill with words and conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Bearded Heart" manifesto a number of artists backed the marginalization of Breton in support of Tzara. Alongside Cocteau, Arp, Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Éluard, the pro-Tzara faction included [[Erik Satie]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Serge Charchoune]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Ilia Zdanevich]], and [[Man Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; During an associated soirée, ''Evening of the Bearded Heart'', which began on 6 July 1923, Tzara presented a re-staging of his play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (which had been first performed two years earlier to howls of derision from its audience), for which [[Sonia Delaunay]] designed the costumes.&lt;ref name="tgdelau"/&gt; Breton interrupted its performance and reportedly fought with several of his former associates and broke furniture, prompting a theatre riot that only the intervention of the police halted.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Dada's vaudeville declined in importance and disappeared altogether after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Picabia took Breton's side against Tzara,&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.15; Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the staff of his ''391'', enlisting collaborations from [[Clément Pansaers]] and [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; Breton marked the end of Dada in 1924, when he issued the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. Richter suggests that "Surrealism devoured and digested Dada."&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"/&gt; Tzara distanced himself from new trend, disagreeing with its methods and, increasingly, with its politics.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he and a few other former Dadaists collaborated with Richter and the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] artist [[El Lissitzky]] on the magazine ''G'',&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; and, the following year, he wrote pieces for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-[[Slovenia]]n magazine ''Tank'' (edited by [[Ferdinand Delak]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to Surrealism===
[[File:Paris 18 - Maison Tristan Tzara -1.JPG|thumb|230px|''Maison Tzara'', designed by [[Adolf Loos]]]]
Tzara continued to write, becoming more seriously interested in the theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', which was soon included in the repertoire of [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Garafola, ''Legacies of Twentieth-century Dance'', [[Wesleyan University Press]], Middletown, 2005, p.172. {{ISBN|0-8195-6674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the ''Seven Dada Manifestos''. [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Henri Lefebvre]] reviewed them enthusiastically; he later became one of the author's friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: the Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1984, p.293 {{ISBN|0-520-05742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, Tzara's work was partly recuperated by ''Contimporanul'', which notably staged public readings of his works during the international art exhibit it organized in 1924, and again during the "new art demonstration" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 156, 159, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the short-lived magazine ''Integral'', where [[Ilarie Voronca]] and [[Ion Călugăru]] were the main animators, took significant interest in Tzara's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240, 277, 279, 287&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1927 interview with the publication, he voiced his opposition to the Surrealist group's adoption of communism, indicating that such politics could only result in a "new bourgeoisie" being created, and explaining that he had opted for a personal "[[permanent revolution]]", which would preserve "the holiness of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in [[Stockholm]], where he married [[Greta Knutson]], with whom he had a son, Christophe (born 1927).&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; A former student of painter [[André Lhote]], she was known for her interest in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[abstract art]].&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"&gt;"Greta Knutson", in [[Penelope Rosemont]], ''[[Surrealist Women]]'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London &amp; New York, 1998, p.69. {{ISBN|0-485-30088-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned [[Austria]]n architect [[Adolf Loos]], a former representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; The rigidly [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] ''Maison Tristan Tzara'', built in [[Montmartre]], was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of [[African art]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

In 1929, he reconciled with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; The same year, he issued the poetry book ''De nos oiseaux'' ("Of Our Birds").&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; This period saw the publication of ''[[The Approximate Man]]'' (1931), alongside the volumes ''L'Arbre des voyageurs'' ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), ''Où boivent les loups'' ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), ''L'Antitête'' ("The Antihead", 1933) and ''Grains et issues'' ("Seed and Bran", 1935).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay.&lt;ref name="pcern277"&gt;Cernat, p.277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of ''Le Cœur à barbe'', starring Breton and other leading Surrealists.&lt;ref name="ttzimdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0879262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, he signed his name to ''The Testimony against [[Gertrude Stein]]'', published by [[Eugene Jolas]]'s magazine ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' in reply to Stein's memoir ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;!-- sic --&gt; in which he accused his former friend of being a [[megalomania]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet became involved in further developing [[Surrealist techniques]], and, together with Breton and [[Valentine Hugo]], drew one of the better-known examples of "[[exquisite corpse]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Biberi]], ''Arta suprarealistă'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1973, p.53. {{OCLC|22905196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also prefaced a 1934 collection of Surrealist poems by his friend [[René Char]], and the following year he and Greta Knutson visited Char in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]].&lt;ref&gt;"René Char Bio-Bibliography", in ''Selected Poems of René Char'' (edited by [[Mary Ann Caws]] and Tina Jolas), [[New Directions Publishers]], New York, 1992, p.xii. {{ISBN|0-8112-1191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's wife was also affiliated with the Surrealist group at around the same time.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt; This association ended when she parted with Tzara late in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt;

At home, Tzara's works were collected and edited by the Surrealist promoter [[Sașa Pană]], who corresponded with him over several years.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 106, 109, 116; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara had left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"/&gt; In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend [[Jacques G. Costin]], a ''Contimporanul'' affiliate who did not share all of Vinea's views on literature, who offered to organize his visit to Romania and asked him to translate his work into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliation with communism and Spanish Civil War===

Alarmed by the establishment of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of [[anti-fascism]], and was close to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by [[Kurt Schwitters]] in [[Hanover]], works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, [[ration stamp]] with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he briefly left France and joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.245-246&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] reporter [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], Tzara visited [[Madrid]], which was besieged by the [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]] (''see [[Siege of Madrid]]'').&lt;ref name="iliv246"&gt;Livezeanu, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he published the collection of poems ''Midis gagnés'' ("Conquered Southern Regions").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure ''Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol'' ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, [[Nancy Cunard]] and the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Robin Suleiman, "Committed Painting", in Denis Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 1994, p.938. {{ISBN|0-674-61566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, ''Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure'', Timewell Press, London, 2005, p.221. {{ISBN|1-85725-211-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Weber, "Nancy Cunard: a Troubled Heiress with an Ideological Mission", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the poet was moving away from Surrealism,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; his adherence to strict [[Marxism-Leninism]] was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="pbeit49"&gt;Beitchman, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of [[Utopia]], which combined communist messages with [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[psychoanalysis]] and made use of particularly violent imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the [[party line (politics)|party line]], maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.&lt;ref name="spbuot"&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Pop, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/*articleID_9669-articles_details.html "François Buot, Tristan Tzara. Omul care a pus la cale revoluția Dada"] (book review), in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 195, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others note that the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a follower of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer [[René Crevel]], organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist [[Salvador Dalí]], who was at the time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of [[William Tell]] had alarmed them because it shared likeness with [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Rojas, ''Salvador Dalí, or the Art of Spitting on Your Mother's Portrait'', [[Penn State University Press]], University Park, 1993, p.98. {{ISBN|0-271-00842-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] notes that Tzara, who agreed with [[Stalinism]] and shunned [[Trotskyism]], submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="iliv251"&gt;Livezeanu, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.247-249&lt;/ref&gt; This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt;

===World War II and Resistance===
During [[World War II]], Tzara took refuge from the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation forces]], moving to the southern areas, controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; On one occasion, the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] publication ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' made his whereabouts known to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.marianne2.fr/Tristan-Tzara,-radical,-mondain-et-anticonformiste_a41229.html?PHPSESSID=c3682e2fb29f923d2fc35498af3a6907 "Tristan Tzara, radical, mondain et anticonformiste"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'', 13 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in [[Marseille]] in late 1940-early 1941, joining the group of anti-fascist and Jewish refugees who, protected by American diplomat [[Varian Fry]], were seeking to escape [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. Among the people present there were the anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] socialist [[Victor Serge]], anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], playwright [[Arthur Adamov]], philosopher and poet [[René Daumal]], and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and [[Benjamin Péret]], as well as artists [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Jacques Hérold]], [[Victor Brauner]] and [[Óscar Domínguez]].&lt;ref name="dgmarse"&gt;Danièle Giraudy, Musée de Marseille (eds.), ''Le jeu de Marseille: autour d'André Breton et des surréalistes à Marseille en 1940-1941'', Éditions Alors Hors du Temps, Marseille, p.79sqq&lt;/ref&gt; During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new [[card game]], on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.&lt;ref name="dgmarse"/&gt;

Some time after his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the [[French Resistance]], rallying with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]. A contributor to magazines published by the Resistance, Tzara also took charge of the cultural broadcast for the [[Free French Forces]] clandestine radio station.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He lived in [[Aix-en-Provence]], then in [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]], and ultimately in [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]''.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-allied and antisemitic Romania (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Ioanid]], "The Romanian Press: Preparing the Ground for the Holocaust and Reporting on Its Implementation", in Robert Moses Shapiro, ''Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American and International Journalism during the Holocaust'', Ktav, Hoboken, 2003, p.404. {{ISBN|0-88125-775-3}}; {{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restriște]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-175. {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, with the generalization of antisemitic measures, Tzara was also stripped of his Romanian citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Niculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=23639 "Destinul excepțional al lui Alexandru Șafran"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 523, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1944, five months after the [[Liberation of Paris]], he was contributing to ''[[L'Éternelle Revue]]'', a pro-communist newspaper edited by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], through which Sartre was publicizing the heroic image of a France united in resistance, as opposed to the perception that it had passively accepted German control.&lt;ref name="srsmemor"&gt;Susan Rubin Suleiman, ''Crises of Memory and the Second World War'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2006, p.30-31. {{ISBN|0-674-02206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors included writers Aragon, Char, Éluard, [[Elsa Triolet]], [[Eugène Guillevic]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Jacques Prévert]] and painter [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref name="srsmemor"/&gt;

Upon the end of the war and the restoration of French independence, Tzara was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] a French citizen.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; During 1945, under the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], he was a representative of the Sud-Ouest region to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt; According to Livezeanu, he "helped reclaim the [[Southern France|South]] from the cultural figures who had associated themselves to Vichy [France]."&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt; In April 1946, his early poems, alongside similar pieces by Breton, Éluard, Aragon and Dalí, were the subject of a midnight broadcast on [[Radio in Paris|Parisian Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;"Drop Everything, Drop Dado", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1946&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he became a full member of the PCF&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; (according to some sources, he had been one since 1934).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===International leftism===
Over the following decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing his interest in [[primitivism]], he became a critic of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]'s [[French colonial empires|colonial policy]], and joined his voice to those who supported [[decolonization]].&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; Nevertheless, he was appointed [[cultural ambassador]] of the Republic by the [[Paul Ramadier]] cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.244, 246, 247&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

He returned to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113; Livezeanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"&gt;{{ro icon}} János Farkas, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=154 "Tristan Tzara în Ungaria.

In 1949-1950, Tzara answered Aragon's call and become active in the international campaign to liberate [[Nazım Hikmet]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]] poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' for the pro-Soviet public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcmusic"&gt;Mark Carroll, ''Music and Ideology in Cold War Europe'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.52. {{ISBN|0-521-82072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by [[Louis Durey]] and [[Serge Nigg]]).&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt; Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

His works of the period include, among others: ''Le Signe de vie'' ("Sign of Life", 1946), ''Terre sur terre'' ("Earth on Earth", 1946), ''Sans coup férir'' ("Without a Need to Fight", 1949), ''De mémoire d'homme'' ("From a Man's Memory", 1950), ''Parler seul'' ("Speaking Alone", 1950), and ''La Face intérieure'' ("The Inner Face", 1953), followed in 1955 by ''À haute flamme'' ("Flame out Loud") and ''Le Temps naissant'' ("The Nascent Time"), and the 1956 ''Le Fruit permis'' ("The Permitted Fruit").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imjbokks"&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/dada_surrealism/pdf/books%20from%20schwarz%20catalog-3.pdf ''Books in the Vera and Arturo Schwarz Collection''], at the [[Israel Museum]]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara continued to be an active promoter of modernist culture. Around 1949, having read [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Samuel Beckett]]'s manuscript of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Tzara facilitated the play's staging by approaching producer [[Roger Blin]].&lt;ref name="dbgodot"&gt;[[David Bradby]], ''Beckett: Waiting for Godot'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2001, p.46. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into French some poems by Hikmet&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vargaftig (ed.), ''Poésies de Résistence'', J'ai lu, Paris, 1994. {{ISBN|2-277-23767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hungarian author [[Attila József]].&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; In 1949, he introduced Picasso to art dealer [[Heinz Berggruen]] (thus helping start their lifelong partnership),&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding
"Obituary: Heinz Berggruen, Noted Art Dealer and Collector", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1951, wrote the catalog for an exhibit of works by his friend [[Max Ernst]]; the text celebrated the artist's "free use of stimuli" and "his discovery of a new kind of humor."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956 protest and final years===
[[File:Tristan Tzara grave.jpg|thumb|240px|Tzara's grave in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]
In October 1956, Tzara visited the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], where the government of [[Imre Nagy]] was coming into conflict with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer [[Gyula Illyés]], who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[László Rajk]] (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]]).&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for [[liberalization]],&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; contacted the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and former Dadaist [[Lajos Kassák]], and deemed the anti-Soviet movement "revolutionary".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as "an abstract notion".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of "[[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-Soviet campaigns."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

His return to France coincided with the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], which ended with a Soviet military intervention. On 24 October, Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist [[Laurent Casanova]] reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did.&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as "the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

He was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, dedicating himself to researching the work of 15th-century poet [[François Villon]],&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; and, like his fellow Surrealist [[Michel Leiris]], to promoting [[Primitivism|primitive]] and [[African art]], which he had been collecting for years.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the [[Rive Gauche]], which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde [[Mouvement Jariviste]], an outcome which reportedly pleased him.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of the Nihilists", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1957&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1960, one year after the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] had been established by [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (''see [[Algerian War]]''). Together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Jérôme Lindon]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and other intellectuals, he addressed [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Michel Debré]] a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence.&lt;ref name="laduras"&gt;[[Laure Adler]], ''Marguerite Duras: A Life'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2000, p.233-234. {{ISBN|0-226-00758-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[André Malraux]] announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|French Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="laduras"/&gt;

In 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious [[Taormina Prize]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the [[International Congress on African Culture]], organized by English curator [[Frank McEwen]] and held at the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], ''Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent'', [[Jacana Media]], 2007, p.227. {{ISBN|1-77009-363-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died one year later in his Paris home, and was buried at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

==Literary contributions==

===Identity issues===
Much critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" was stimulated by "young emancipated Jewish writers."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt; while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s."&lt;ref name="gcal887"&gt;Călinescu, p.887&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zuntfhaus zür Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moară la Hârța'' ("At the Mill in Hârța") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.182, 405&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by "the sweet language of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian]] peasants".&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt;

Tzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the cases of Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a "modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]" means of breaking with "the peripheral condition",&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; According to the same author, two important elements in this process were "a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority", an "[[Oedipus complex]]" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.398, 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Zürich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: "DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates."&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as "Orientals".&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a "[[Italic peoples|Latin]]" temperament.&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of "[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was "a barbarian".&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114, 115; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

At home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position. He depicted Dadaists as "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]" who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of "literary anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.296, 299, 307, 309-310, 329&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his "formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.310&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the "[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit", of the "foreign plague" and of "[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească'', [[Editura Fundației Culturale Române]], Bucharest, 1995, p.457. {{ISBN|973-9155-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist poetry===
Tzara's earliest [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist poems]], published in ''Simbolul'' during 1912, were later rejected by their author, who asked [[Sașa Pană]] not to include them in editions of his works.&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]].&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to Symbolist [[musicality]] at that stage, he was indebted to his ''Simbolul'' colleague [[Ion Minulescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49; Emil Manu, "Actualitatea lui Ion Minulescu", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Versuri și proză'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1986, p.8. {{OCLC|18090790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Belgian [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; Philip Beitchman argues that "Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism—and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the [[syntax]] of conventional poetry, and that, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the "hanged man" motif, which served as the basis for his poem ''Se spânzură un om'' ("A Man Hangs Himself"), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].&lt;ref name="pcern52"&gt;Cernat, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; ''Se spânzură un om'' was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators [[Adrian Maniu]] (''Balada spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Ballad") and Vinea (''Visul spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Dream"): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] and [[iconoclastic]] perspective.&lt;ref name="pcern52"/&gt; These pieces also include ''Vacanță în provincie'' ("Provincial Holiday") and the [[anti-war]] fragment ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' ("The Storm and the Deserter's Song"), which Vinea published in his ''Chemarea''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-98, 106&lt;/ref&gt; The series is seen by Cernat as "the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pană.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he became interested in the [[free verse]] work of the American [[Walt Whitman]], and his translation of Whitman's [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Song of Myself]]'', probably completed before [[World War I]], was published by [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] in his magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Beitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, "since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"&gt;Beitchman, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat notes: "That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]].&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.38-39, 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, "the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Vinea===
The transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109, 119, 160&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being "meditative and melancholic", while Tzara's is "[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]".&lt;ref name="pcern117"&gt;Cernat, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117-119&lt;/ref&gt; His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|să ne coborâm în râpa, 
care-i Dumnezeu când cască}}&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
|
let's descend into the precipice
that is God yawning}}

In his ''Înserează'' (roughly, "Night Falling"), probably authored in [[Mangalia]], Tzara writes:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|[...] deschide-te fereastră, prin urmare
și ieși noapte din odaie ca din piersică sâmburul, 
ca preotul din biserică
[...] hai în parcul communal
până o cânta cocoșul
să se scandalizeze orașul [...].}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;
|
[...] open yourself therefore, window
and you night, spring out of the room like a kernel from the peach,
like a priest from the church
[...] let's go to the community park
before the rooster starts crowing
so that the city will be scandalized [...]}}

Vinea's similar poem, written in [[Tuzla, Constanța|Tuzla]] and named after that village, reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|seara bate semne pe far
peste goarnele vagi de apă
când se întorc pescarii cu stele pe mâini
și trec vapoarele și planetele}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;
|
the evening stamps signs on the lighthouse
over the vague bugles of water
when fishermen return with stars on their arms
and ships and planets pass by}}

Cernat notes that ''Nocturnă'' ("Nocturne") and ''Înserează'' were the pieces originally performed at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], identified by [[Hugo Ball]] as "Rumanian poetry",&lt;!-- sic --&gt; and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are noted for their radical break with the traditional form of Romanian verse,&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dennis Deletant]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-01-12&amp;art=3373 "Întoarcerea României în Europa: între politică și cultură"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021120445/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3373&amp;nr=2007-01-12 |date=21 October 2007 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 879, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's diary entry of 5 February 1916, indicates that Tzara's works were still "conservative in style".&lt;ref name="hrich16"&gt;Richter, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In Călinescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that "bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness."&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: "As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [...]."&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;

Alongside pieces depicting a Jewish cemetery in which graves "crawl like worms" on the edge of a town, chestnut trees "heavy-laden like people returning from hospitals", or wind wailing "with all the hopelessness of an orphanage",&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Samyro's poetry includes ''Verișoară, fată de pension'', which, Cernat argues, displays "playful detachment [for] the musicality of [[internal rhyme]]s".&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; It opens with the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Verișoară, fată de pension, îmbrăcată în negru, guler alb,
Te iubesc pentru că ești simplă și visezi
Și ești bună, plângi, și rupi scrisori ce nu au înțeles
Și-ți pare rău că ești departe de ai tăi și că înveți 
La Călugărițe unde noaptea nu e cald.}}&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;
|
Little cousin, boarding school girl, dressed in black, white collar,
I love you because you are simple and you dream
And you are kind, you cry, you tear up letters that have no meaning
And you feel bad because you are far from yours and you study
At the Nuns where at night it's not warm.}}

The [[Gârceni]] pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of "pure poetry", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Valéry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 288; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.62-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada synthesis and "simultaneism"===
Tzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors. Among them were the literary promoters of [[Cubism]]: in addition to [[Henri Barzun]] and [[Fernand Divoire]], Tzara cherished the works of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Dada's condemnation of [[Futurism]], various authors note the influence [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his circle exercised on Tzara's group.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396; Richter, p.19, 191 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.216-217)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he was in correspondence with both Apollinaire&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; and Marinetti.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Tzara is also seen as indebted to the early avant-garde and [[black comedy]] writings of Romania's [[Urmuz]].&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128-129, 341, 343, 346; Amy D. Colin, "Paul Celan's Poetics of Destruction", in Amy D. Colin (ed.), ''Argumentum E Silentio'', [[Walter de Gruyter]], Berlin, 1987, p.158. {{ISBN|3-11-010555-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a large part, Dada focused on performances and [[satire]], with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists. Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[Māori language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Gendron describes these soirées as marked by "heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's "simultaneist poetry", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].&lt;ref name="hrich16"/&gt; Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was "the value of the human voice."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer'' ("The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;

Art historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by "extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396-397&lt;/ref&gt; had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.887; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.54, 60, 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rlword"&gt;Robin Lydenberg, ''Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs'', [[University of Illinois Press]], Urbana &amp; Chicago, p.45. {{ISBN|0-252-01413-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada and anti-art===
The Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as [[prose poetry]],&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected "the language of a sophisticated savage".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for "compress[ing] what we think and feel",&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Hans Richter, the genre "suited Tzara perfectly."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.33-35&lt;/ref&gt; His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: "Dada means nothing", adding "Thought is produced in the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; In addition, Tzara, who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X. Uranus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074348/http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 96, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; probably approved of Serner's vision of a "final dissolution".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.48, 49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that "as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"/&gt;

Despite adopting such [[anti-art]]istic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of "furthening the cause of art."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"&gt;Richter, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this evident in ''La Revue Dada 2'', a poem "as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers", which included the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Cinq négresses dans une auto
ont explosé suivant les 5 directions de mes doigts
quand je pose la main sur la poitrine pour prier Dieu (parfois)
autour de ma tête il y a la lumière humide des vieux oiseaux lunaires}}&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"/&gt;

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire Calligramme.JPG|thumb|190px|One of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s [[calligram]]s, shaped like the [[Eiffel Tower]]]]
''La Revue Dada 2'', which also includes the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] line ''tralalalalalalalalalalala'', is one example where Tzara applies his principles of chance to sounds themselves.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"/&gt; This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's [[calligram]]s, and with his announcement that "Man is in search of a new language."&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"&gt;Mary Lewis Shaw, "Concrete and Abstract Poetry: The World as Text and the Text as World", in Leonard M. Trawick (ed.), ''World, Self, Poem: Essays on Contemporary Poetry from the "Jubliation of Poets"'', [[Kent State University Press]], Kent, 1990, p.169. {{ISBN|0-87338-419-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short [[parody]] piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to "shock the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]".&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt;

The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, [[Ellipse (figure of speech)|ellipses]], ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled ''Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage'' ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the "skinny, idiotic, dirty" reader who "does not understand my poetry."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He called some of his own poems ''lampisteries'', from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.530; Hofman, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] poet [[Isidore Isou]] included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by [[Charles Baudelaire]] with the "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became "destruction of the word for nothing".&lt;ref name="dwslettr"&gt;David W. Seaman, "French Lettrisme—Discontinuity and the Nature of the Avant-Garde", in Freeman G. Henry (ed.), ''Discontinuity and Fragmentation'', [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]], Amsterdam, 1994, p.163. {{ISBN|90-5183-634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to American literary historian [[Mary Ann Caws]], Tzara's poems may be seen as having an "internal order", and read as "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===Plays of the 1920s===
Tristan Tzara's first play, ''[[The Gas Heart]]'', dates from the final period of Paris Dada. Created with what Enoch Brater calls a "peculiar verbal strategy", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.&lt;ref name="ebra25"&gt;Brater, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.&lt;ref name="ebra25"/&gt; The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]]. The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words.&lt;ref name="ebra26"&gt;Brater, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Brater describes ''The Gas Heart'' as a "parod[y] of theatrical conventions".&lt;ref name="ebra26"/&gt;

In his 1924 play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clichés of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34; Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on "the relativity of things, sentiments and events."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a "privileged position for art": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his "most beloved" writers and a "great poet", argued: "''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter—but not theater."&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion Călugăru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.&lt;ref name="pcern277"/&gt;

===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===
After 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from "a studied inconsequentiality" and "unreadable gibberish" to "a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The critic also remarks: "Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with "suffering", had discovered humanity, and had become a "[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]" among poets.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-42&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal calls the piece "an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty",&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the "excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.40-45&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals in the text reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul
je ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi
un bruit glacé froissé au carrefour jeté sur le trottoir humide
aux pieds des hommes pressés courant avec leurs morts
autour de la mort qui étend ses bras
sur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.}}&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;
|
I speak of the one who speaks who speaks I am alone
I am but a small noise I have several noises in me
a ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement
with the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead
around death which extends its arms
on the dial of the hour only alive in the sun}}

The next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a [[Humanism|humanist]] vision with [[Communism|communist]] theses.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbeit49"/&gt; The 1935 ''Grains et issues'', described by Beitchman as "fascinating",&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; was a prose poem of [[social criticism]] connected with ''The Approximate Man'', expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of [[oblivion (eternal)|oblivion]]. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.46-50&lt;/ref&gt; People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grains et issues'' was accompanied by ''Personage d'insomnie'' ("Personage of Insomnia"), which went unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal notes: "In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The post-[[World War II]] volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He was by then undertaking a [[Hermeneutics|hermeutic]] research into the work of [[Goliard]]s and [[François Villon]], whom he deeply admired.&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Influence===
Beside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers. This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by ''[[unu]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; magazine, written by [[Sașa Pană]] and [[Moldov]], cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and [[Tudor Arghezi]], as well as artists [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.889&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was [[Jacques G. Costin]], who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and [[Futurism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.174, 193, 409&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ilarie Voronca]]'s ''Zodiac'' cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to ''The Approximate Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.328&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and Surrealist author [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art.&lt;ref name="ipuranus"/&gt; Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were [[Poland|Polish]] Futurist writer [[Bruno Jasieński]],&lt;ref&gt;Nina Kolesnikoff, ''Bruno Jasieński: His Evolution from Futurism to Socialist Realism'', [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]], Waterloo, 1982, p.15. {{ISBN|0-88920-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]ese poet and [[Zen]] thinker [[Takahashi Shinkichi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Makoto Ueda (poetry critic)|Makoto Ueda]], ''Modern Japanese Poets and the Nature of Literature'', [[Stanford University Press]], Palo Alto, 1983, p.335-336. {{ISBN|0-8047-1166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chile]]an poet and Dadaist sympathizer [[Vicente Huidobro]], who cited him as a precursor for his own ''[[Creacionismo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Vicente Huidobro]], [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/manifiesto1.htm ''El Creacionismo''], at the [[University of Chile]] [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/ Vicente Huidobro site]; retrieved 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate precursor of [[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdism]], he was acknowledged as a mentor by [[Eugène Ionesco]], who developed on his principles for his early essays of literary and social criticism, as well as in tragic farces such as ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont, ''Ionesco's Imperatives: The Politics of Culture'', [[University of Michigan Press]], Ann Arbor, 1993, p.4. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's poetry influenced [[Samuel Beckett]] (who translated some of it into English);&lt;ref name="dbgodot"/&gt; the Irish author's 1972 play ''[[Not I]]'' shares some elements with ''[[The Gas Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brater, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Romanian author is cited as an influence on [[Beat Generation]] members. Beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]], who made his acquaintance in Paris, cites him among the Europeans who influenced him and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref&gt;Josef Jařab, "When All Met Together in One Room: Josef Jařab Interviews Allen Ginsberg", in Heather Hathaway, Josef Jařab, Jeffrey Melnick (eds.), ''Race and the Modern Artist'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, p.242-243. {{ISBN|0-19-512324-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter also mentioned Tzara's use of chance in writing poetry as an early example of what became the [[cut-up technique]], adopted by [[Brion Gysin]] and Burroughs himself.&lt;ref name="rlword"/&gt; Gysin, who conversed with Tzara in the late 1950s, records the latter's indignation that Beat poets were "going back over the ground we [Dadaists] covered in 1920", and accuses Tzara of having consumed his creative energies into becoming a "Communist Party bureaucrat".&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;

Among the late 20th-century writers who acknowledged Tzara as an inspiration are [[Jerome Rothenberg]],&lt;ref name="camroth"&gt;Christine A. Meilick, ''Jerome Rothenberg's Experimental Poetry and Jewish Tradition'', [[Lehigh University Press]], Bethlehem, 2005, p.46-47, 85sqq. {{ISBN|0-934223-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore Isou]] and [[Andrei Codrescu]]. The former [[Situationist International|Situationist]] Isou, whose experiments with sounds and poetry come in succession to Apollinaire and Dada,&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"/&gt; declared his [[Lettrism]] to be the last connection in the [[Charles Baudelaire]]-Tzara cycle, with the goal of arranging "a nothing [...] for the creation of the anecdote."&lt;ref name="dwslettr"/&gt; For a short period, Codrescu even adopted the pen name ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noemi Marin, "The Rhetoric of Andrei Codrescu: A Reading in Exilic Fragmentation", in Domnica Rădulescu (ed.), ''Realms of Exile: Nomadism, Diasporas, and Eastern European Voices'', Lexington Books, New York, p.102. {{ISBN|0-7391-0333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled the impact of having discovered Tzara's work in his youth, and credited him with being "the most important French poet after Rimbaud."&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;

In retrospect, various authors describe Tzara's Dadaist shows and street performances as "[[happening]]s", with a word employed by post-Dadaists and Situationists, which was coined in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.44; Londré, p.397&lt;/ref&gt; Some also credit Tzara with having provided an ideological source for the development of [[rock music]], including [[punk rock]], [[punk subculture]] and [[post-punk]].&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.36; Thomas McLaughlin, ''Street Smarts and Critical Theory: Listening to the Vernacular'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, 1997, p.67. {{ISBN|0-299-15170-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tristan Tzara has inspired the songwriting technique of [[Radiohead]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Tate, ''The Music and Art of Radiohead'', [[Ashgate Publishing]], London etc., 2005, p.195. {{ISBN|0-7546-3980-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the avant-garde authors whose voices were mixed by [[DJ Spooky]] on his [[trip hop]] album ''Rhythm Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Buttimer, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/jx8c/ "DJ Spooky.

In France, Tzara's work was collected as ''Oeuvres complètes'' ("Complete Works"), of which the first volume saw print in 1975,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; and an international poetry award is named after him (''Prix International de Poésie Tristan Tzara''). An international periodical titled ''Caietele Tristan Tzara'', edited by the Tristan Tzara Cultural-Literary Foundation, has been published in [[Moinești]] since 1998.&lt;ref name="ocprofesor"&gt;{{ro icon}} Oltița Cîntec, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-profesor-inimos-din.html "Un profesor inimos din Moinești și o societate cultural-literară atrag atenția întregii lumii asupra României"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213452/http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-profesor-inimos-din.html |date=27 September 2007 }}, in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', 10 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana Tănase, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pic-Adrian-artist-esentialist*articleID_9309-articles_details.html "Pic Adrian: artist esențialist"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 189, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul Cernat, ''Aliluia'', one of the few avant-garde texts authored by Ion Vinea features a "transparent allusion" to Tristan Tzara.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; Vinea's fragment speaks of "the [[Wandering Jew]]", a character whom people notice because he sings ''La moară la Hârța'', "a suspicious song from [[Greater Romania]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181-182&lt;/ref&gt; The poet is a character in [[India]]n novelist [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s ''Thieves of Fire'', part four of his ''The Bubble'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Chandra, ''Fresh Perspectives on Fiction'', Anmol Publications, New Delhi, 2005, p.78. {{ISBN|81-261-2126-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''The Prince of West End Avenue'', a 1994 book by the American [[Alan Isler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bette Pesetsky]], "Shakespeare Meets Emma Lazarus", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg dedicated several of his poems to Tzara,&lt;ref name="camroth"/&gt; as did the [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[Valery Oișteanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Valery Oișteanu]], [http://www.respiro.org/Issue10/poezie_oisteanu.htm "Poeme din exil"] in [http://www.respiro.org/ ''Respiro''], Issue 10/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's legacy in literature also covers specific episodes of his biography, beginning with [[Gertrude Stein]]'s controversial memoir. One of his performances is enthusiastically recorded by [[Malcolm Cowley]] in his autobiographical book of 1934, ''Exile's Return'',&lt;ref&gt;"Lost Generation", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 4 June 1934&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also mentioned in [[Harold Loeb]]'s memoir ''The Way It Was''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Sun Also Rises (Contd.)", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 22 June 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Among his biographers is the French author François Buot, who records some of the lesser-known aspects of Tzara's life.&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt;

At some point between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is believed to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Hoberman]], ''The Red Atlantis: Communist Culture in the Absence of Communism'', [[Temple University Press]], Philadelphia, p.100. {{ISBN|1-56639-767-7}}; Olson, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; While Richter himself recorded the incidental proximity of Lenin's lodging to the Dadaist milieu,&lt;ref name="hrich16"/&gt; no record exists of an actual conversation between the two figures.&lt;ref name="kols43"&gt;Olson, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstsbh"&gt;Jenna Scherer, [http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1087112 "''Travesties'' Shows Importance of Being Stoppard"], in ''[[Boston Herald]]'', 15 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei Codrescu believes that Lenin and Tzara did play against each other, noting that an image of their encounter would be "the proper icon of the beginning of [modern] times."&lt;ref name="kols43"/&gt; This meeting is mentioned as a fact in ''Harlequin at the Chessboard'', a poem by Tzara's acquaintance [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://capa.conncoll.edu/morton.merzbook.html ''The Merzbook: Kurt Schwitters Poems''], translated by [[Colin Morton]], at the [http://capa.conncoll.edu/ Contemporary American Poetry Archive]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; German playwright and novelist [[Peter Weiss]], who has introduced Tzara as a character in his 1969 play about [[Leon Trotsky]] (''Trotzki im Exil''), recreated the scene in his 1975-1981 cycle ''[[The Aesthetics of Resistance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cohen (acting theorist)|Robert Cohen]], ''Understanding Peter Weiss'', [[University of South Carolina Press]], Columbia, 1993, p.130. {{ISBN|0-87249-898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imagined episode also inspired much of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'', which also depicts conversations between Tzara, Lenin, and the Irish modernist author [[James Joyce]] (who is also known to have resided in Zürich after 1915).&lt;ref name="jstsbh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcovusu"&gt;[[Michael Coveney]], "Usurpation Supreme", in ''[[The Observer]]'', 19 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cilenin"&gt;Charles Isherwood, "Lenin, Joyce and Philosophy with Vaudevillian Verve", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His role was notably played by [[David Westhead]] in the 1993 British production,&lt;ref name="mcovusu"/&gt; and by [[Tom Hewitt (actor)|Tom Hewitt]] in the 2005 American version.&lt;ref name="cilenin"/&gt;

Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists on various pieces, Tzara himself was a subject for visual artists. [[Max Ernst]] depicts him as the only mobile character in the Dadaists' group portrait ''Au Rendez-vous des Amis'' ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922),&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; while, in one of [[Man Ray]]'s photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an [[androgynous]] [[Nancy Cunard]].&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Moynagh, introduction to [[Nancy Cunard]], ''Essays on Race and Empire'', Broadview Press, Peterborough &amp; Orchard Park, p.24. {{ISBN|1-55111-230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years before their split, [[Francis Picabia]] used Tzara's [[Calligraphy|calligraphed]] name in ''Moléculaire'' ("Molecular"), a composition printed on the cover of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Alberto Giacometti]] made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bnf.fr/PAGES/presse/dossiers/giacometti.pdf ''Dossier de presse.

===Posthumous controversies===
The many polemics which surrounded Tzara in his lifetime left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by "petty jealousies".&lt;ref name="hrich32"/&gt; In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[Gârceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Ionesco]] argued that "before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110, 367-368&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a "[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]".&lt;ref name="pcern113"&gt;Cernat, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an "illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon", and denounced him as "the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature."&lt;ref name="pcern113"/&gt; Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as "Dr. Barbu", a thick-hided charlatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sanda Cordoș, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Lunatecii-un-mare-roman-de-redescoperit*articleID_28954-articles_details.html "''Lunatecii'' – un mare roman de redescoperit"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 683, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to "[[protochronism]]", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of "Romanian initiatives" and "road openers at a universal level."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.359&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Yusuf and Zulaikha"''' (the English transliteration of both names varies greatly) refers to a medieval Islamic version of the story of the prophet [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar's wife]] which has been told and retold countless times in many languages spoken in [[Muslim world]], such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Its most famous version was written in Persian language by [[Jami]] (1414-1492), in his [[Haft Awrang]] ("Seven Thrones").  The story has by then many elaborations, and is capable of a [[Sufi]] interpretation, where Zulaikha's longing for Yusuf represents the soul's quest for God.

== Other versions of the story ==
Other writers to have retold the story include: [[Mahmud Gami]] ([[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]). It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]].

There exists as well a long poem on the subject, titled as Yusuf and Zalikha, which used to be attributed to [[Ferdowsi]], the great Persian poet of the tenth and eleventh century, however, the scholars have rejected this book based on its low quality and the time line of Ferdowsi's life.&lt;ref&gt;'Yusuf and Zalikha: The Biblical Legend of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife in the Persian Version Ascribed to Abul-Mansur Qasim, Called Firdausi, ca. 932-1021 A.D.,' Edited by Hermann Ethé, Philo Press, Amsterdam, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yousuf and Zulaikha in Asia ==
As in many other [[Muslim]] countries, the narrative of the epic love of Yousuf and Zulaikha was covered in classic literary works of [[East Bengal]] (modern day [[Bangladesh]]): in the 14th century A.D. (during the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah]]), [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] wrote in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] a version of ''[[Yusuf-Zulekha]]'' which is considered one of the greatest literary works of medieval "golden era" of [[Bengali literature]].
