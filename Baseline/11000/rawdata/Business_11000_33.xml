'''Bausch Health Companies Inc.''' (formerly '''Valeant Pharmaceuticals''') is a [[multinational company|multinational]] specialty [[pharmaceutical company]] based in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], [[Canada]]. It develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology, and branded generics. Valeant owns [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]], one of the world's largest suppliers of eye health products.

Founded in California in 1959 as ICN Pharmaceuticals, Valeant grew rapidly through a series of [[mergers and acquisitions]] under the leadership of [[J. Michael Pearson]] and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Its largest acquisitions were Bausch &amp; Lomb in 2013 and [[Salix Pharmaceuticals]] in 2015. Valeant  also tried to acquire [[Actavis]] and [[Cephalon]] and merge with [[Allergan]] in 2014, but failed and was sued for insider trading prior to their bid.

In 2015, the company was involved in a number of controversies surrounding drug price hikes and the use of a [[specialty pharmacy]] for the distribution of its  drugs, which led to an investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and caused its stock price to plummet more than 90 percent from its peak while its debt surpassed $30 billion.

In 2016, Pearson was ousted and replaced by [[Joseph C. Papa]], while investor [[Bill Ackman]] joined the board. In 2017, Ackman's [[Pershing Square Capital Management|Pershing Square]] fund, which held a major stake in the company, sold out for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ackman sells Valeant stake|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-13/valeant-falls-as-bill-ackman-sells-out-departs-company-s-board|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Ackman's exit, [[Paulson &amp; Co.]] increased its stake in the company and became its largest shareholder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valeant: Paulson &amp; Co. Puts (a Bit More) Money Where its Mouth is|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/valeant-paulson-co-puts-a-bit-more-money-where-its-mouth-is-1498512513|website=Barron's|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its founder [[John Paulson]] joined the board, vowing to rebuild the company's core franchises and reduce its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Paulson Joins Valeant Board Of Directors|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/john-paulson-joins-valeant-board-110000874.html|website=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Papa's leadership, by early 2018, the company had become profitable again, had settled the Allergan case for less than expected, and had lowered its debt by $6.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2017/12/30/bill-ackman-and-valeant-settle-allergan-insider-trading-lawsuit-for-290-million|title=Bill Ackman And Valeant Settle Allergan Insider Trading Lawsuit For $290 Million|first=Antoine|last=Gara|publisher=Forbes|date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2017/12/30/bill-ackman-and-valeant-settle-allergan-insider-trading-lawsuit-for-290-million|title=Valeant Shares Rise After Company Pays Down Additional $300 mln in Debt|first=Emma|last=Court|publisher=MarketWatch|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In May, 2018, Papa announced a name change for  Valeant taking effect in July 2018 - with the new name, Bausch Health Companies Inc., helping Valeant distance itself from its past, and a new trading symbol BHC to replace VRX. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/health/valeant-name-bausch-drugs.html|title=Valeant, Distancing Itself From Its Past, Will Change Its Name to Bausch Health|date=2018-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1959–2002: The Panić Years===
In 1959, Yugoslavian immigrant [[Milan Panić]], who had defected to the US three years earlier, founded ICN Pharmaceuticals (International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation) in his [[Pasadena]] garage. Panić ran the company for 47 years, during which ICN established a foothold in the industry by acquiring niche pharmaceuticals and through the development of [[Ribavirin]], an antiviral drug that became the standard treatment for [[hepatitis C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Allergan Fight Conjures Ghost of O.C.'s Past|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/panic-614449-company-valeant.html|website = The Orange County Register|date = 19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ICN merged with SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Viratek Inc., and ICN Biomedicals Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/business/company-news-shareholders-approve-icn-pharmaceuticals-merger.html | title=Shareholders Approve ICN Pharmaceuticals Merger | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=November 3, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2002, following a series of controversies, Panić was forced to retire under pressure from shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Panic Gone, New ICN Team Finds Finances in Disarray | url = http://labusinessjournal.com/accounts/login/?next=/news/2002/jul/29/panic-gone-new-icn-team-finds-finances-in-disarray/|website = Los Angeles Business Journal |date = 29 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–2016: The Pearson Years===
[[File:Valeant Pharmaceuticals' Business Model (26683524705) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pearson in 2016]]
On September 28, 2010, Valeant merged with [[Biovail]]. The company retained the Valeant name and [[J. Michael Pearson]] as CEO, but was incorporated in Canada and temporarily kept Biovail's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valeant-and-biovail-complete-merger-103909108.html | title=Valeant and Biovail Complete Merger | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/21/us-biovail-valeant-idUSTRE65K1LA20100621 | work=Reuters | title=Drugmaker Biovail to buy Valeant in $3.3 billion deal | date=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting on a path of aggressive acquisitions, Pearson would ultimately turn Valeant into a [[platform company]] that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. 

In February 2011, Valeant acquired PharmaSwiss S.A. for €350 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valeant-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-pharmaswiss-sa-114989039.html | title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals to Acquire PharmaSwiss S.A. | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, an attempt to buy drugmaker [[Cephalon]] Inc. for $5.7 billion was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/teva-cephalon-idUSN0220556620110502 | title=Teva to buy Cephalon for $6.8 bln, tops Valeant | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, former Biovail Corporation Chairman and CEO [[Eugene Melnyk]] was banned from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and penalized to pay $565,000 by the [[Ontario Securities Commission]].

By October 2015, Valeant had received subpoenas from the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts]] and the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost_15Oct_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/15/valeant-subpoena_n_8301490.html | title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals Subpeonaed In U.S. After Price-Gouging Allegations | publisher=The Huffington Post via The Canadian Press and the Associated Press | date=October 15, 2015 | accessdate=October 15, 2015 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House oversight committee]] also requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/shkreli-valeant-ceo-set-grilling-congressional-price-hike-hearing/2016-01-19|title=Shkreli, Valeant CEO set for a grilling at congressional price-hike hearing|work=FiercePharma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/valeant-pharmaceutical-interim-ceo-to-testify-before-congress-next-week-1453330153|title=Valeant Pharmaceutical Interim CEO to Testify Before Congress Next Week|author=Jonathan D.

====Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation====
In October 2015, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of [[rigid gas permeable]] contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch &amp; Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Ornstein | first1=Charles | title=Federal Investigators Looking at Valeant’s Contact Lens Dealings | url=https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-investigators-looking-at-valeant-contact-lens-dealings | date=October 27, 2015 | publisher=[[ProPublica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved "buttons", the polymer discs used to make gas permeable contact lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/151-0236-161-0028/valeant-pharmaceuticals-international-inc|website=Federal Trade Commission|title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/02/ftc-approves-final-order-parent-company-bausch-lomb|website=Federal Trade Commission|title=FTC Approves Final Order with Parent Company of Bausch + Lomb|date=February 8, 2017|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Share price erosion and the ousting of Michael Pearson====

From 2015 to 2017, Valeant shares plummeted more than 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modestmoney.com/valeant-pharmaceuticals-vrx-stock-climbing-takeover-rejection/34140|title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) Stock: Climbing on Takeover Rejection!|work=Modest Money|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_Valeant_tumbles_April_2016"&gt;{{citation |title=As Valeant Tumbles, So Does Bill Ackman’s Hedge Fund Herd |author1=Alexandra Stevenson |author2=Matthew Goldstein |date=April 27, 2016 |accessdate=April 28, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/business/dealbook/as-valeant-tumbles-so-does-billackmans-hedge-fund-herd.html |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large hedge funds such as [[Bill Ackman]]'s [[Pershing Square Capital Management]], [[Paulson &amp; Co.]], and [[Viking Global Investors]] lost billions.&lt;ref name="NYT_Valeant_tumbles_April_2016" /&gt; By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.&lt;ref name="NYT_Valeant_tumbles_April_2016" /&gt; However, hedge fund herding&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hedge Fund Herding, and How to End It |date=January 3, 2016 |url=http://www.ai-cio.com/channel/Manager-Selection/Hedge-Fund-Herding,-and-How-to-End-It/ |accessdate=April 28, 2016 |work=Asset International |series=Chief Investment Officer}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to incite hedge fund portfolio managers to continue to buy Valeant shares.&lt;ref name="NYT_Valeant_tumbles_April_2016" /&gt;

In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016, Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and had received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_paycuts_2016"&gt;{{citation |url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/valeant-pharmaceuticals-international-inc-files-annual-report-to-fulfill-debt-covenants |title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals International eyes strategy change; senior managers face pay cut over debacle |first1=Caroline |last1=Chen |first2=Cynthia |last2=Koons |work=Financial Post via Bloomberg News |date= April 29, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Camille Maximilien Frédéric, Count de Renesse-Breidbach''' (9 July 1836 in [[Brussels]] – 12 June 1904 in [[Nice]]) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[nobleman]], entrepreneur and author.

De Renesse was born in 1836 at Brussels to an aristocratical family of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] descent. His parents were Maximilien C.J.G.R van Renesse Breidbach and Berthe Walburge Francoise van Gruben. He was a grandson of Clement Wenceslas van Renesse Breidbach (1774-1833), who had sold the ancestral [[Castle of Renesse]] to [[Leonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies|Leonard du Bus de Gisignies]].

Camille married Countess [[Malvina de Kerchhove de Deterghem]] on 10 November 1868, daughter of Count [[Charles de Kerchove de Denterghem|Charles-Constant de Kerchhove de Deterghem]] (1819-1882) and Eugénie de Limon (1824-1899). While dwelling in [[St. Moritz]] for recreation Count de Renesse got his vision to establish a giant Monte Carlo-like hotel resort with a grand [[hotel]], baths and golf courses in the [[Engadin]] valley for the European aristocracy. After being rejected in [[Celerina/Schlarigna|Celerina]], [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils]] and finally in St. Moritz due to the Badrutt family's huge power, Count de Renesse succeeded in purchasing some 140 hectares of land in [[Maloja (district)|Maloja]], at the [[Lake of Sils]].

Between 1882 and 1884 he put his vision to reality by letting build the ''Hôtel Kursaal de la Maloja'' (nowadays [[Maloja Palace]]). But since just a few days after the grand opening a [[cholera]] epidemic broke out in nearby [[Italy]], Count de Renesse had to file for [[bankruptcy]] after six months. Furthermore, Countess Marvina died of a so-called "fat heart" in [[Basel]] in the same autumn. Nonetheless the hotel remained a lucrative location for Europe's rich people in the following decades. In 1891, [[Stanford University]] completed Encina Hall, a dormitory inspired by the Hôtel Kursaal de la Maloja's architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST24no1.pdf Encina Hall: Leland Stanford's Grand Hotel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624225614/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST24no1.pdf |date=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time a rumour has got abroad that Count de Renesse, being drunk, fell off his residence, the Belvedere tower above the hotel, into the [[Bergell]] valley; in fact he moved to Nice where he wrote some Christian books; there he died in 1904.

'''Chumak''' ({{lang-uk |чумак}}) is a historic occupation on the territory of modern Ukraine as merchants or traders, primarily known for the trade in salt.

Chumaks grew as a merchant class facilitating trade of [[Edible salt|salt]] from the areas of [[Halychyna]] as well as the coastal areas of [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Sea of Azov|Azov Seas]], in addition to other items.

They prospered until the end of the 19th century, when competition from railroads made longer trade routes unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150219213008/http://chumactvo.info/zanepad Chumak (decline)] at the Chumatstvo.info&lt;/ref&gt; The process of transportation was conducted by wagons that were pulled by two [[oxen]] paired with [[yoke]]. Oxen were often of Bessarabian breed.

Chumaks were the most popular during the times of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] (17th century) trading between the [[Tsardom of Russia|Moscow state]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Crimean Khanate]], and [[Moldavia]]. Further modernization marginalized traditional economic activity, and relegated Chumak traders to areas in western Ukraine with the lowest levels of service.

==Influence on the Ukrainian culture==
[[Image:Aivasovsky Ivan Constantinovich - Chumaks leisure.jpg|left|thumb|Chumaks on the break, [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]]]
The style of living of chumaks set a great mark in Ukrainian folklore, language, and overall culture.

In Ukrainian language [[Milky Way]] is called the Chumaks' Way. There is a Ukrainian [[Chumak (surname)|surname Chumak]].

Chumak traders also were featured heavily in Ukrainian folklore and fables. Their trade is mentioned in the literal as well as artistic works of [[Taras Shevchenko]], the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]n-[[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], the song of [[Taras Petrynenko]] ''Ukraina''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12601">'''Companies of the United States with untaxed profits''' deals with those U.S. companies whose offshore subsidiaries earn profits which are retained in foreign countries to defer paying [[Corporate tax in the United States|U.S. corporate tax]]. The profits of United States corporations are subject to a federal corporate tax rate of 21%. In principle, the tax is payable on all profits of corporations, whether earned domestically or abroad. However, overseas subsidiaries of U.S. corporations are entitled to a [[tax deferral]] of profits on active income until repatriated to the U.S., and are regarded as untaxed.&lt;ref name=masondrawbaugh&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/01/us-usa-budget-tax-idUSKBN0L51IX20150201 |title=Obama targets foreign profits with tax proposal, Republicans skeptical |author=Jeff Mason and Kevin Drawbaugh |date=February 1, 2015 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; When repatriated, the corporations are entitled to a foreign tax credit for taxes (if any) paid in foreign countries.

Retaining such profits offshore may be regarded a [[tax strategy]]. Many corporations have accumulated substantial untaxed profits offshore, especially in countries with low corporate tax rates. In recent years it has been estimated that untaxed profits range from US$1.6 to $2.1 trillion. The ''Wall Street Journal'' noted that the "[u]ntaxed foreign earnings are part of a contentious debate over U.S. fiscal policy and tax code."&lt;ref name=thurmlinebaugh/&gt; The profits earned abroad and retained there are subject to a [[foreign exchange risk]], besides other [[financial risk]]s.

The downside of a strategy of retaining profits offshore is that corporations may want or need to pay dividends to shareholders, or to make investments in the United States, besides other reasons. The alternative may be to borrow funds in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt; or access the funds retained offshore in the form of inter-company loans.

==Magnitude==
A number of studies have estimated the untaxed overseas profits to be from US$1.6 to $2.1 trillion. A 2011 study by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. identified $1.375 trillion in undistributed foreign earnings.&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Cash Hoard Grows by $187 Billion in Untaxed Overseas Profits |publisher=Bloomberg |author=[[Richard Rubin (journalist)|Richard Rubin]] |date=March 2, 2012 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-02/cash-horde-expands-by-187-billion-in-untaxed-offshore-accounts }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Wall Street Journal analysis in 2012 found that the amounts for 60 large firms grew by $166 billion in the preceding year, shielding 40% of their earnings.&lt;ref name=thurmlinebaugh&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324034804578348131432634740 |title=More U.S. Profits Parked Abroad, Saving on Taxes |author=Scott Thurm and  Kate Linebaugh |date=March 10, 2013 |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a Bloomberg study found $1 trillion held overseas for 70 U.S.-based multi-national companies, using public annual reports for years ending in 2010 and 2011, and it estimated an overall total of $1.6 trillion.&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt; In 2013, a private research firm study asserted there were more than $2.1 trillion of U.S. corporate profits untaxed in 2013.&lt;ref name=studyreported&gt;{{cite news|title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study |author=Kevin Drawbaugh and Patrick Temple-West |date=April 8, 2014 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, estimates $2.6 trillion held offshore and  two-thirds of that is held by 30 U.S. companies, with Apple, Pfizer, and Microsoft being the top three (see chart).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/business/economy/corporate-tax-economists.html|title=A Tax Cut That Lifts the Economy? Opinions Are Split|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=2017-11-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign profits were up 93% from 2008 to 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Politics and tax policy issues==
It has been suggested that companies hold profits overseas hoping for a [[Repatriation tax holiday|tax holiday]]. In 2012 Northwestern University law professor Thomas Brennan asserted that "companies are holding money outside the U.S. in part because they are waiting for Congress to repeat a 2004 tax holiday law that set a maximum tax rate for repatriation profits of 5.25%. 'Why not do it?' he said. 'It’s pure upside. In the worst-case scenario, you’re going to be taxed as you would have been in any event.'"&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt; The 2004 tax holiday, under President George W. Bush, yielded a lot of repatriation but not much economic benefit, according to one view.&lt;ref name=studyreported/&gt;  A number of the large U.S.-based companies that would benefit, including Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp., were lobbying during 2011-2012 to obtain a repatriation holiday. At the time, however, President Obama was believed to oppose a one-time tax holiday, as it would be a giveaway to big corporations.&lt;ref name=bloomberg2012/&gt;

President Obama's February 2015 budget proposal called for a 14% tax to be applied on untaxed overseas profits, indicating that the proposal would yield $238 billion,&lt;ref name=obamabudget/&gt; implying a $1.7 trillion estimate of untaxed profits. It was proposed as a one-time tax to be imposed whether or not funds are repatriated.&lt;ref name=obamabudget/&gt; The proposal has not been heard about since.

In 2015, the topic of U.S. taxation of companies' operations abroad was addressed by announced and potential U.S. presidential candidates. For example, Republican senators [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]] have called for elimination of U.S. taxes on companies' operations abroad, within a broader proposal for corporate and individual tax rate changes.&lt;ref name=rubio&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/senators-rubio-lee-push-u-tax-plan-cut-134558269--business.html |title=Senators Rubio, Lee push U.S. tax plan to cut corporate rates |date=March 4, 2015 |publisher=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative tax rates==
{{See also|Corporate tax#International corporate tax rates}}
Corporate tax rates vary between tax jurisdictions. The national rates of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries vary from a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 35% in the United States, with an average of 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204 |title=Table II.1. Corporate income tax rate |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the federal tax rates, provincial, state and local taxes may also apply in most jurisdictions. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corporation tax rates|url = http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/rts-eng.html|website = www.cra-arc.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-02-07|first = Government of Canada, Canada Revenue Agency, Taxpayer Services and Debt Management Branch, Taxpayer Services|last = Directorate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the [[dividend tax|taxes on dividends]] paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5k3wh96w246k.pdf?expires=1448516536&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=19E09DD7567FF1DA85E0EC999665FA0B |title=www.oecd-ilibrary.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large multinational companies retain untaxed profits in [[tax haven]] jurisdictions which offer no or very low corporate taxes, as well as other tax benefits.

A '''contingent contract''' is an [[if-then]] agreement that states which actions under certain conditions will result in specific outcomes (Thompson 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;122). Contingent contracts usually occur when [[negotiating]] parties fail to reach an agreement. The [[contract]] is characterized as "contingent" because the terms are not final and are based on certain events or conditions occurring. (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70).

A contingent contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Contingent contracts can also lead to effective agreement when each party has different time preferences. For example, one party may desire immediate payoffs, while the other party may be interested in more long-term payoffs (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;122). Further, contingency contracts can foster an agreement in negotiations involving resolute differences of expectations about the future (Malhotra, Baerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69).

==Use==

Contingent contracts can be used in many types of settings such as work, school, home, etc. In regards to work, a common example of contingent contracts comes in the form of job negotiations. It usually involves the opportunity to discuss [[salary]], position, promotion, etc. However, contingent contracts can often include negotiations regarding [[flextime]], [[job sharing]], responsibilities, etc. Although contingent contracts concerning employment packages are more the exception than the norm, these types of negotiations can be very successful, allowing both parties to walk away feeling very satisfied with the newly agreed upon arrangement (Krutzberg, Naquin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;86-87).

The following examples are everyday agreements that may occur in the [[workplace]]:
* The [[employee]] and [[employer]] agree on a 1% bonus increase at the end of the year if the employee receives all excellent marks on her performance review.
* The employee will be allowed to work two days a week from home after having worked at the company for one year, and if he submits all reports on time.
* The employee will receive full insurance coverage after having worked at the company for one full year, with less than five sick days.

The following example illustrates a behavioral contract between a [[teenager]] and [[parent]]s to be used in the home:
* The teenager agrees to attend all classes, complete homework on time, return home before curfew, communicate with parents in a respectful manner, etc.
* If the teenager violates any of the agreed upon rules, he will choose to suffer the consequences which involve being grounded, no television or Internet, not using the family car, etc.
* The parents agree that if the teenager performs the agreed upon behaviors, then the teenager will be able to keep his privileges.

A contingent contract can be used to create enormous benefit to both parties. One advantage would be that it limits the loss that would occur if the contract failed. Another would be that it wouldn't make one party gain more at the expense of the other. This leads to an increase in trust between both parties, which would allow them to have more beneficial negotiations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=M. H.|last2=Gillespie|first2=J. J.|title=Betting on the Future: The Virtues of Contingent Contracts|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1999|volume=77 |issue=5|pages= 155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In order to be most effective, contingent contracts should possess some of the following characteristics:
* The objectives for each party involved must be aligned (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
* The promise is based on an uncertain event: the action required of one party is only dependent upon the occurrence of some event in the future (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The event must be minor to the contract: the performance of a promise is not the event; rather it is part of the contract (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The event is independent of the promising party: the occurrence of an event is not controlled by the promising party’s will or desire (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The agreements should be formalized in writing with appropriate legal counsel (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
* The parties must mutually decide how the terms of agreement will be measured (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
A contingency contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans

==Value==
Necessary is because the contract is built on expected differences from each party. Each party can leverage their differences through bets that lead to both sides winning (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69). However, contingent contracts do not increase integrative value, rather they affect distribution value (Brett 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;74). Contingency contracts can create value by causing each negotiating party to stop arguing about their different beliefs. Both parties will be better off because they are each confident in their beliefs, ideas or projections (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69).

==Risks and challenges==
Contingency contracts can be beneficial for both parties by producing value and motivating performance, however there are some situations in which contingency contracts are not the best solution (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Here are some limitations (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;71):
* Contingency contracts could be threatening if the other party possesses or has access to more valuable information than you. For example, it would be unfair if one party wanted to bet on the basis of ratings because they have better access to that information.
* Contingency contracts can be risky if both parties are not in agreement of how to measure objectively. For example, define clearly what it means to promote an employee "if she does well" because each party may have different ideas or opinions about whether the contract has been met. This can lead to disagreement, which can cause great distress to the relationship between the parties (Brett 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;74).
* Contingency contracts can be dangerous if there are unequal incentives for each party. For example, there should be incentives for both parties to act in ways that are compatible with your agreement, thereby creating a win-win situation for both parties.

'''Downtown Dartmouth''' is the main [[business]], [[banking]] and government office core of  [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].  It is part of the [[Capital District, Nova Scotia|Capital District]] of the Province.

==Business and buildings==
[[File:Downtown Portland Alderney.jpg|thumb|Downtown Portland Alderney]]
Located in downtown Dartmouth are [[Alderney Landing|Alderney Gate]] which houses a branch of the [[Halifax Public Libraries]] and other municipal office space, the [[Alderney Landing]] market, gallery and theatre building, the 19-story highrise office building [[Queen Square (Dartmouth)|Queen Square]], as well as the main branches of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] and [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]]. Also in the area there several [[condominium]] [[highrise]] buildings.  The "Restaurant 73" building on 73 Alderney Drive is the oldest commercial brick building on the Dartmouth side of the harbour.  Downtown Dartmouth also features historic landmarks such as the Quaker Whaler House, one of the oldest buildings in Halifax Regional Municipality (open to the public seasonally) and Evergreen House, Victorian home to nationally acclaimed folklorist, Helen Creighton (open year-round).

==Transportation==
Downtown Dartmouth is connected by [[ferry]] to [[downtown Halifax]] operated by [[Metro Transit (Halifax)|Metro Transit]] from [[Alderney Landing]]. North America's oldest continually operating saltwater ferry service was started in 1752 by one man rowing customers across the harbour for three cents per trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Harbour Ferries - Metro Transit - Halifax Regional Municipality| url=http://www.halifax.ca/metrotransit/ferries.html| accessdate=13 July 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603230803/http://www.halifax.ca/metrotransit/ferries.html#| archive-date=2011-06-03| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main streets are Alderney Drive ([[Nova Scotia Trunk 7|Trunk 7]]), Portland Street ([[Nova Scotia Route 207|Route 207]]), and Ochterloney Street. Along Alderney Drive and north of the downtown is the [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] railyard. CN's Dartmouth Subdivision (a freight line) runs along the waterfront to [[Halifax Harbour#Port facilities|Autoport]] near [[Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia|Eastern Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Train Geek: [http://www.traingeek.ca/wp/trains/class-1-railways/cn-nova-scotia/dartmouth/ CN's Dartmouth Subdivision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks==
[[File:Dartmouth Landing.jpg|thumb|left|Dartmouth Landing]]
Ferry Terminal Park is the park space along the waterfront adjacent to the Dartmouth Ferry Terminal. In it resides the World Peace Pavilion, opened during the 1995 Halifax [[G7]] Economic Summit. Conceived by Metro Youth for Global Unity, this structure contains [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s and [[brick]]s donated by more than 70 countries, lying on a bed of Nova Scotian [[sand]]. Also within the Ferry Terminal Park is the huge [[bronze]] [[propeller]] from the [[CCGS John A. Macdonald]], an [[icebreaker]] damaged during its 1969 journey through the [[Northwest Passage]], as well as the inlaid [[granite]] [[compass rose]] in the park, which is a replica of the [[compass]] detail on a 1749 map of [[Halifax Harbour]]. Extending from [[Alderney Landing]] is the Events Plaza, a specially designed and equipped outdoor space for [[festival]]s and events. [[Eastern Front Theatre]] performs at [[Alderney Landing]]'s theatre.

The Leighton Dillman Scenic Garden, named after a diligent voluntary keeper of the gardens, sits adjacent to Alderney Drive on a hillside of what is left of the [[Dartmouth Commons]], approximately {{Convert|300|acre|km2}} set aside by the government in the late 18th century for the settlers' common use. Only a small portion of the Commons today remains.

==Past industry and redevelopment==
On Dartmouth Cove were the former [[Dartmouth Marine Slips]], former site of the Nantucket [[Whaling]] Company. The Dartmouth Marine Slips were purchased in the 1990s by [[Irving Shipbuilding]], owners of [[Halifax Shipyard]] which became known for a time as the Halifax Shipyards. Irving operating the two sites together with the marine slips specializing in smaller and faster repair jobs and employing about 44 people. In 2003, Irving announced plans to sell the Slips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayner|first=Kendall|title=Worker's Belittled|newspaper=The Herald|date=March 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-four workers still employed at the shipyard were relocated to other Irving sites in the HRM region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bornais|first=Stephen|title=Homebuilder's Buy Shipyard|newspaper=The Daily News|date=February 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dartmouth Marine Slips closed on June 20, 2003. The plans for development of the property, called Kings Wharf, were published in on July 31, 2007 and a long term construction program began in 2009. Plans for the tallest building in eastern Canada have been introduced and talked about for several years but construction has been delayed with no confirmed start date given.

A '''hacienda''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|h|æ|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|d|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|h|ɑː|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|d|ə}}; {{IPA-es|aˈθjenda|lang}} or {{IPA-es|aˈsjenda|}}), in the [[colony|colonies]] of the [[Spanish Empire]], is an [[Estate (land)|estate]], similar in form to a [[Roman villa]]. Some haciendas were [[plantation]]s, [[Mining|mines]] or [[Factory|factories]]. Many haciendas combined these activities. The word is derived from the Spanish word "hacer" or "haciendo", which means: to make or be making, respectively; and were largely business enterprises consisting of various money making ventures including raising farm animals and maintaining orchards.

The term ''hacienda'' is imprecise, but usually refers to landed estates of significant size.  Smaller holdings were termed [[estancias]] or [[ranch]]os that were owned almost exclusively by Spaniards and [[Criollo people|criollo]]s and in rare cases by mixed-race individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ida Altman]], et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, the term [[estancia]] is used for large estates that in Mexico would be termed haciendas. In recent decades, the term has been used in the United States to refer to an architectural style associated with the earlier estate manor houses.

The hacienda system of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Peru]] was a system of large land holdings. A similar system existed on a smaller scale in the [[Philippines]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

==Origins and growth==
Haciendas were developed as profit-making, economic enterprises linked to regional or international markets. Although the hacienda is not directly linked to the early grants of indigenous American labor, the [[encomienda]], many Spanish holders of encomiendas did acquire land or develop enterprises where they had access to that forced labor. Even though the private landed estates that constituted most haciendas did not have a direct tie to the encomienda, they are nonetheless linked. Encomenderos were in a position to retain their prominence economically via the hacienda. Since the encomienda was a grant from the crown, holders were dependent on the crown for its continuation. As the crown moved to eliminate the encomienda with its labor supply, Spaniards consolidated private landholdings and recruited free labor on a permanent or casual basis. The long term trend then was the creation of the hacienda as secure private property, which survived the colonial period and into the 20th century. Estates were integrated into a [[market economy|market-based economy]] aimed at the Hispanic sector and cultivated crops such as [[sugar]], [[wheat]], fruits and vegetables and produced animal products such as meat, [[wool]], leather, and [[tallow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], "Encomienda and Hacienda: The Evolution of the Great Estate in the Spanish Indies," ''Hispanic American Historical Review,'' 1969, 59: 411-29,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LockhartSchwartz&gt;James Lockhart and [[Stuart B. Schwartz|Stuart Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 134–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teatro de Atequiza, Mexico.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gristmill|Wheat mill]] and theatre of [[Gilberto Rincón Gallardo|Vicente Gallardo]]; Hacienda Atequiza, [[Jalisco, Mexico]], 1886.]]
Haciendas originated in Spanish [[land grant]]s, made to many ''[[conquistador]]s'' and crown officials, but many ordinary Spaniards could also petition for land grants from the crown. The system is considered to have started in present-day Mexico, when the Spanish Crown granted to [[Hernán Cortés]] the title of [[Marquis]] of the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] in 1529. It gave him a tract of land that included all of the present state of [[Morelos]]. Cortés was also granted encomiendas, that gave him access to a vast pool of indigenous labor.

==Personnel==
In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], the owner of an hacienda was called the ''hacendado'' or ''patrón''. Most owners of large and profitable haciendas preferred to live in Spanish cities, often near the hacienda, but in Mexico, the richest owners lived in Mexico City, visiting their haciendas at intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Rendón Garcini, ''Daily Life on the Haciendas of Mexico,'' Banamex-Accova;S/A/ de C.V., Mexico: 1998, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Onsite management of the rural estates was by a paid administrator or manager, which was similar to the arrangement with the encomienda. Administrators were often hired for a fixed term of employment, receiving a salary and at times some share of the profits of the estate.  Some administrators also acquired landholdings themselves in the area of the estate they were managing.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al. (2003), ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' pp. 165–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work force on haciendas varied, depending on the type of hacienda and where it was located.  In central Mexico near indigenous communities and growing crops to supply urban markets, there was often a small, permanent workforce resident on the hacienda.  Labor could be recruited from nearby indigenous communities on an as-needed basis, such as planting and harvest time.&lt;ref name=LockhartSchwartz /&gt; The permanent and temporary hacienda employees worked land that belonged to the ''patrón'' and under the supervision of local labor bosses. In some places small scale cultivators or ''campesinos'' worked small holdings belonging to the hacendado, and owed a portion of their crops to him. In a number of places, the economy of the 18th century was largely a [[barter]] system,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} with little specie circulated on the ''hacienda''.

Stock raising was central to ranching haciendas, the largest of which were in areas without dense indigenous populations, such as northern Mexico, but as indigenous populations declined in central areas, more land became available for grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al. (2003), ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock were animals originally imported from Spain, including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were part of the [[Columbian Exchange]] and produced significant ecological changes.  Sheep in particular had a devastating impact on the environment due to overgrazing.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor G. K. Melville, ''A Plague of Sheep: Environmental Consequences of the Conquest of Mexico," Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Mounted ranch hands variously called ''[[vaquero]]s'' and ''[[gaucho]]s'' (in the [[Southern Cone]]), among other terms worked for pastoral haciendas.

Where the hacienda included working [[mining|mine]]s, as in Mexico, the ''patrón'' might gain immense wealth. The unusually large and profitable [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] ''hacienda'' Santa Lucía, near Mexico City, established in 1576 and lasting to the expulsion in 1767, has been reconstructed by Herman Konrad from archival sources. This reconstruction has revealed the nature and operation of the hacienda system in Mexico, its labor force, its systems of [[land tenure]] and its relationship to larger Hispanic society in Mexico.

[[File:Hacienda San Gabriel.jpg|thumb|left|Gardens of the Hacienda San Gabriel in [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]].]]
The [[Catholic Church]] and  [[Catholic religious order|orders]], especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], acquired vast ''hacienda'' holdings or preferentially loaned money to the hacendados. As the hacienda owners' mortgage holders, the Church's interests  were connected with the landholding class.   In the history of Mexico and other [[Latin America]]n countries, the masses developed some hostility to the church; at times of gaining independence or during certain political movements, the people confiscated the church haciendas or restricted them.

Haciendas in the [[Caribbean]] were developed primarily as sugar [[plantation]]s, dependent on the labor of [[African peoples|African]] [[Slavery in the Spanish Empire|slaves]] imported to the region. were staffed by slaves brought from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214000250/http://www.ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality by (the late) Dr. Robert A.

==South American haciendas==
In [[South America]], the ''hacienda'' remained after the [[Spanish American wars of independence|collapse]] of the [[Spanish Empire|colonial system]] in the early 19th century when nations gained independence. In some places, such as [[Dominican Republic]], with independence came efforts to break up the large plantation holdings into a myriad of small [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers']] holdings, an agrarian revolution. In Argentina and elsewhere, a second, international, money-based economy developed independently of the ''haciendas'', which sank into rural poverty.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Entrada al Palacio San José.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio San José]], Argentina; owned by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], 19th century.]]

In most of [[Latin America]] the old holdings remained. In Mexico the ''haciendas'' were [[Agrarian land reform in Mexico|abolished]] by law in 1917 during the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution]], but remnants of the system affect Mexico today.  In rural areas, the wealthiest people typically affect the style of the old hacendados even though their wealth these days derives from more capitalistic enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Bolivia]], haciendas were more prevalent until the [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro#The 1952 Revolution|1952 Revolution]] of [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]]. He established an extensive program of land distribution as part of the [[Agrarian Reform]]. Likewise, [[Peru]] had haciendas until the Agrarian Reform (1969) of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], who expropriated the land from the hacendados and redistributed it to the peasants.

==Other locations==

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], the hacienda system and lifestyles were influenced by the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization]] that occurred via [[Mexico]] for more than 300 years. Attempts to break up the hacienda system in the Philippines through [[land reform]] laws during the second half of the 1900s have not been successful. There were protests related to the [[Hacienda Luisita]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A '''hand mould''' is a simple [[mold (manufacturing)|mould]] used for low quantity work. It is used in the [[injection moulding]] and the [[printing industry]].
It is made by a hand injection molding machine. It is a simple machine which contains a barrel, handle, nozzle, mold and heaters. 

==Printing==
In the printing industry, a hand mould specifically refers to a two-part mould used for [[casting]] hand-made [[Sort (typesetting)|type]]. Inside the mould is a [[matrix (printing)|matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Knight | first = Edward Henry | title = Knight's American mechanical dictionary | page = 1057 | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin | year = 1876 | volume = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7jZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1057 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, it refers to a system for casting [[movable type]], pioneered by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], which was widely used in the early era of printing in Europe (15th-16th century).&lt;!-- I am not sure how long it continued to be used, can someone fill in please? --&gt;

In this method, the type was made by punching a letter-shaped cavity in a matrix made of some soft metal (typically copper).  Then this matrix would be held in the lower part of the mould, the upper part would close on it, and molten [[type metal]] would be poured into the cavity.  Using the hand mould, the printer could quickly make any additional type he might need.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injection moulding==
In injection moulding, hand moulds refer to simple moulds that have no provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a hand mould is cycled universal heating plates are required to warm the moulds and the moulds must be removed after each cycle to remove the mouldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mould. They are usually single cavity moulds, but may be multi-cavity if the moulding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of the simplicity of the parts. If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from [[aluminum]] or [[brass]], but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional [[steel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harper | first = Charles A. | title = Modern plastics handbook | page = 6.34 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ee4Qf0HaBwC&amp;pg=PT460 | isbn = 978-0-07-026714-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullet casting==
Hand [[cast bullet]]s remain popular with the [[handloading]], [[Muzzleloader|muzzleloading]] and small custom ammunition loading communities. In a tradition dating back to the beginning of firearms, molds matched to the [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] (and the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] for breech loading weapons) are custom made for each weapon. Anywhere from one to six cavities are carved into the molding block, along with appropriate gates and [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprues]]. As the blocks are now usually made out of aluminum, which does not allow lead alloys to stick, only a small amount of parting compound is needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neihandtools.com/mold_info.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://media.midwayusa.com/pdf/instructions/Bullet_Mold.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harvey Grenville Ward''' (1927 — 1995) was Director-General of the [[Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;''Monday World'', journal of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], October 1982, vol.2, no.5, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; noted for his [[anti-communism]] and for his support for [[Ian Smith]]'s government in [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]]. He was a leading member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].

==Biography==

===Background===
Ward was born in [[Southern Rhodesia]] to an English father and a South African mother. His parents settled in [[Africa]] and were engaged in enterprises such as the financing of [[railway]] construction and the building of numerous hotels. They managed the [[Victoria Falls Hotel]] until 1937. He chose a career in [[journalism]] starting with the Cape Argus and then becoming a specialist in African journalism covering the great social upheavals of the late 1950s and 60's for Reuters. He then settled in Salisbury and became Head of News Services at the Rhodesia Herald, eventually becoming Director-General of the [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation]] which, in effect, put him in charge of government [[propaganda]]. Ward is said to have removed references to black sporting achievements from sports programmes carried on state television.&lt;ref&gt;''The Herald'', Harare, Zimbabwe, April 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile===
Following an armed insurrection, several years of negotiations, and finally the imposition of sanctions by South Africa at the behest of The West, the [[Ian Smith|Smith administration]] was replaced by African majority rule in 1979.  Ward described this as "the betrayal of western nations to their own kind." As a prominent supporter of the Smith administration, Ward was forced to leave [[Zimbabwe]]. He and his family moved to [[South Africa]] and advised the white minority government there on avoiding international [[economic sanctions]].

===Anti-communism===
[[Image:WGI Dinner.jpg|thumb|250px|left|At the [[Western Goals Institute]]'s 'El Salvador' Dinner, London, September 25, 1989. L to R: [[Denis Walker]], [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley|Lord Sudeley]], [[El Salvador]]'s Foreign Minister, Andrew Smith (yellow tie), and Harvey Ward (leaning forward).]]
Subsequently, Ward served as a political adviser to many African leaders and was involved in international [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]. His watch-word became "dedicated to fighting [[communism]]" and he traveled worldwide, lecturing on [[Counter insurgency|counter-insurgency]] and [[terrorism]]. He described the [[Soviet Union]] as run by "gangsters" and totally untrustworthy.

He supported the anti-communist revolts in the former [[Soviet Bloc]] saying that it was "a simple matter of good versus evil." In Africa, Ward saw no hope. "Africa is the most exploited of all the continents, and it will stay that way. There has never been any peace in Africa, and I see no end to tribal conflict, spreading of diseases and other plagues," he said.

===Monday Club===
Ward was an overseas member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]] and found himself the center of a minor sensation on July 26, 1977 when immigration officials at [[Heathrow]] Airport held him for seven hours, before formally refusing him permission to enter Britain and placing him aboard another plane to [[Munich]]. He was due to address a meeting of the Africa Committee of the Monday Club at the [[House of Lords]], organized by the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Harold Soref]] on the 29th, and visit family in [[Gloucestershire]]. On being asked why entry had never been refused on previous journeys to Britain by Ward, a [[Home Office]] spokesman said "I don't know. It may have been a mistake or oversight." Formal protests were made to the Home Office by Tory [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) [[John Biggs-Davison]], Sir [[Patrick Wall]], and [[Teddy Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', both on July 27, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he wrote an article entitled ''Zimbabwe Today'' for the Monday Club's journal, ''Monday World'', prophetic in its content.&lt;ref&gt;''Monday World'', October 1982, vol.2, no.5, p.2 - 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife died in 1986 and he moved to [[UK|Great Britain]]. Three of his four children remained in [[South Africa]].

At the October 1988 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, [[Western Goals (UK)]] (which Ward had also joined) held a fringe meeting on the subject of "International Terrorism - how the West can fight back". Harvey Ward, Sir [[Alfred Sherman]], Rev [[Martin Smyth]], MP, and [[Andrew Hunter (British politician)|Andrew Hunter]], MP, were the speakers. The latter spoke concerning top-level links between the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref&gt;''Young European'' Newsletter, December 1988 edition, published by [[Western Goals (UK)]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Ward was working for [[James Gibb Stuart]] at Ossian Books Ltd. in [[Glasgow]]. He continued to travel and lecture, and joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. 

He became an active member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the [[Conservative Monday Club]], and by 1990 was a member of the Club's Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Club News'', January 1991, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character assassination===
In 1991 Ward is claimed to have worked in conjunction with South African security policeman [[Paul Erasmus]] to secretly leak false accusations against [[Winnie Mandela]] and her daughters, accusing them of being nymphomaniacs and drug abusers.  The reports were described as having come from dissidents in the [[African National Congress]], and were issued in an effort to divide the ANC's leadership. They were subsequently taken up by papers such as ''[[Independent (UK)|The Independent]]'', the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. Erasmus later acknowledged profound regret for his actions in this and other matters, and affected a reconciliation with Mandela. He claimed Ward's role in the propaganda campaign during the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irish Times]]'', March 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; but only after Ward had died.

===Death===
In the early 1990s Ward's fourth child Rowena, who had been in the British Police Service returned to live in South Africa and Ward followed, taking up residence in [[Port Elizabeth]] with his son, Harvey and his daughter in law Kathy. His last public engagement was speaking at the Robbie Burns Society in Port Elizabeth in March 1995. One month later had a heart attack during a game of bowls, and died.

'''Henri Giscard d'Estaing''' (born 17 October 1956) is a [[France|French]] business figure and son of former French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]].&lt;ref&gt;Laure Dumont, ''La confrérie des Giscard d'Estaing'', [[L'Expansion]], 01/02/2003 [http://www.lexpansion.com/economie/la-confrerie-des-giscard-d-estaing_20197.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Giscard d'Estaing studied at [[Paris]]' l'Institut d'études politiques ([[Sciences Po]]), before obtaining a masters in Economic Science. "Henri Giscard d’Estaing graduated from Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris and has a Master’s degree in economics. He began his career with Cofremca where he served as an Associate Director between 1982 and 1987, specializing in researching changes in food consumption patterns and their marketing and strategic impacts.

In 1987 he entered the Danone Group and was successively Head of Development, Chief Executive Officer of the British subsidiary HP Food Lea and Perrins, Chief Executive Officer of Evian-Badoit and Head of the Mineral Water division.

== Overview ==

Hoshin Kanri requires a strategic vision in order to succeed. From there, strategic objectives need to be clearly defined, with goals being written for  long periods of a one to five year-long timeframe.&lt;ref name="7 Steps"/&gt; Once the long term timeframe goals are completed, the team can focus on yearly objectives.  Management needs to avoid picking too many vital goals in order to stay focused on what is strategically important.&lt;ref name="MGMT Journal"/&gt; The big goals then need to be broken down into smaller goals, at a weekly and monthly basis, and then implemented so that everyone, from management to the factory floor, is in agreement on what needs to be accomplished. The satisfaction of goals should be reviewed on a monthly basis, with a larger annual review at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="7 Steps"/&gt; Performance measurement is also a key part of the process.&lt;ref name="MGMT Journal"/&gt;

Hoshin Kanri is a top-down approach, with the goals being mandated by management and the implementation being performed by employees. As a result, systems need to be in place to ensure that objectives from senior management are effectively communicated all the way down the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]].&lt;ref name="MGMT Journal"/&gt; As such, a catchball system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use the Catchball Process to Reduce Ambiguity|url=http://www.aleanjourney.com/2011/12/use-catchball-process-to-reduce.html|website=A Lean Journey|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often used in order to aid in the execution of the strategic plan. A catchball system seeks to get opinions of both managers and employees through meetings and interactions in order to ensure the bidirectional flow of goals, feedback, and other information throughout the organization.&lt;ref name="Catchball"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferraro|first1=Antonio|title=What is Catchball|url=http://www.kaizen-news.com/what-is-catchball/|website=Kaizen News|publisher=Kaizen News|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

Companies that use Hoshin Kanri often follow a Think, Plan, Implement, and Review process, which is comparable to [[W. Edwards Deming|W. Edwards Deming's]] [[PDCA|Plan Do Check Act]] cycle.&lt;ref name="MGMT Journal"/&gt; This is because Deming played a role in the spreading of quality control principles that influenced the development of Hoshin Kanri.&lt;ref name="History of Hoshin Kanri"/&gt; The cyclical process is a way to plan for the future, not just to react to what is happening now. The principles of PDCA are heavily embedded into the Hoshin Kanri planning process.&lt;ref name="MGMT Journal"/&gt; Beyond PDCA, [[Joseph M. Juran]] also played a role in spreading quality control principles that influenced Hoshin Kanri, specifically focusing on management's role in the process.&lt;ref name="History of Hoshin Kanri"/&gt;

'''Jerome Lee (J. Lee) Nicholson''' (1863 - November 2, 1924) was an American accountant, industrial consultant, author and educator&lt;ref name="MC 1996"&gt;Chatfield (2014, p. 436)&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name="T 1979"&gt;Taylor (1979, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; known as pioneer in [[cost accounting]]. He is considered in the United States to be the "father of cost accounting."&lt;ref&gt;The Congress (1930). ''International Congress on Accounting, 1929: September 9–14, 1929 ... New York City.'' [Proceedings],  p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H 1959 106"&gt;Hein (1959, p. 106)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson most important contributions to cost accounting consisted of "emphasizing ''[[cost centre (business)|cost centres]]'' and the ''measuring of profits for individual departments'' based on machine hour rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattessich | first1 = Richard | authorlink = Mattessich, Richard | year = 2003 | title = Accounting research and researchers of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century: an international survey of authors, ideas and publications | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Mattessich/publication/24067177_Accounting_research_and_researchers_of_the_nineteenth_century_and_the_beginning_of_the_twentieth_century_an_international_survey_of_authors_ideas_and_publications/links/0046351e43e9b293af000000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History | volume = 13 | issue = 2| page = 143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also he helped establishing the National Association of Cost Accountants (NACA) in 1920, which resulted into the [[Institute of Management Accountants]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Mattessich]] (2007) ''Two Hundred Years of Accounting Research.'' p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Nicholson grew up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="H 1959 106"/&gt; After attending common school and business college, he started in industry. In his spare time he studied accountancy, and eventually in 1901 he obtained his [[Certified Public Accountant]] license for the State of New York.&lt;ref name="H 1959 107"&gt;Hein (1959, p. 107)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Nicholson had started his career at the [[Keystone Bridge Company]], where he worked his way up from office boy to assistant at the engineering department. In drawing up plans for the company foreman and superintendent, he started to develop his interest in cost accounting. At the age of 21, in 1884, he moved to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] where he had obtained an accounting position.&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt; Around 1900 Nicholson started his own accountancy and consultancy firm J. Lee Nicholson and Company, specialized in cost systems for manufacturing organizations.&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt;

During World War I he served at the US [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Department]] as supervising cost accountant in 1917-18. He was promoted to the rank of Major,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1913, p. i)&lt;/ref&gt; and kept using his rank in public life, signed his work with Major J. Lee Nicholson, and is remembered by that name.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Accountants (1921) ''Proceedings of the International Cost Conference.'' p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Accounting review.'' Vol. 34. (1959), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to this position at the Ordnance Department, he was chief of the Division of Cost Accounting of the Department of Commerce. The filling of these positions gave him ample opportunity to become familiar with the war contract situation in its accounting aspects. In the summer of 1917 he was chairman of a conference of delegates from the War, Navy, and Commerce Departments, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Council of National Defense. This conference, in a pamphlet issued July 81, 1917, made certain recommendations regarding government contracts, and these recommendations are presented verbatim in Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]]'s ''Cost Accounting'' (1919).&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;  
[[File:J. Lee Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920 (2).jpg|thumb|Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920]]
Nicholson has been active in accountancy societies since the early 1900s. He joined the New York State Society of CPAs in 1902, where he became its first vice-president, and served as its president. In 1906 he also joined the [[American Association of Public Accountants]]. In 1920 Nicholson was founding president&lt;ref&gt;''Michigan Manufacturer &amp; Financial Record,'' Vol. 31. (1923). p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vangermeersch  |first= Richard | author-link1= Richard Vangermeersch |title=Review of "Proud of the Past: 75 Years of Excellence Through Leadership 1919-1994 by Grant U.

Nicholson authored several books, including "Nicholson on Factory Organization and Costs" published in 1909, "Cost Accounting Theory and Practice" in 1913, and "Cost Accounting" in 1920 and several papers. All three books were published in multiple editions.

Due to his ill-health he retired and moved to California in 1922, where two years later he died suddenly November 2, 1924 in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="H 1959 106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McL 1924"&gt;McLeod, S. C., "Major J. Lee Nicholson Dies Suddenly in San Francisco," ''N.A.C.A. Bulletin,'' November 15, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Early 20th century, when Nicholson started published his first work, the development towards modern [[cost accounting]] was well underway for two decades. Chatfield (2014) summarized that "After hundreds of years of painfully slow progress, cost accounting took off during the 1880s. Between 1885 and 1920, the essentials of modern cost technique were formulated and to some extent standardized in practice. Workable overhead allocation methods were devised, procedures were developed for integrating cost and financial accounts, and [[standard costing]] became routinized."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;

Chandra and Paperman (1976) specified, that "serious studies in cost accounting started only in the 1890s with the writings of [[Captain Henry Metcalfe|Metcalfe]], [[Emile Garcke|Garcke]] and [[John Manger Fells|Fells]], [[George P. Norton|Norton]], [[J. Slater Lewis|Lewis]], and later with [[Alexander H. Church|Church]], Nicholson and [[J. Maurice Clark|Clark]]. They were truly the pioneers who introduced new cost concepts like fixed and variable costs, standard cost, cost centers, relevant costs, etc. in the literature. The development of cost accounting in this period was undoubtedly slow. In addition, cost accounting tried to adapt itself within the framework of [[financial accounting]]. Part of the delay in the establishment of cost accounting concepts may be due to the tendency of cost accountants to keep the methods they had developed within their own firms secret."&lt;ref name="GC 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chandra |first1=Gyan | author-link1=  |last2=Paperman |first2=Jacob B. | author-link2= |title=Direct Costing Vs. Absorption Costing: A Historical Review|journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |volume=3 |issue= 1/4 |pages=1–9 |jstor=40697404|date= 1976 |registration=yes |doi=10.2308/0148-4184.3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The economist [[John Maurice Clark]] is known in the field of accountancy due to his famous ''Studies in the economics of overhead.'' (1909) Source: Mattessich (2007, p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson and Rohrbach (1919) specified that most work on cost accounting was written in the last decade, stating that "more than 90% of this literature has been published in the last decade, and fully 75% in the last five years."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson and Rohrbach [1919, p. 1]; cited in: [[Boyns, Trevor]], and John Richard Edwards. "[http://wvvw.thebhc.org/sites/default/files/beh/BEHprint/v026n2/p0452-p0462.pdf British Cost and Management Accounting Theory and Practice, c. 1850—c. 1950; Resolved and Unresolved Issues]." ''Business and Economic History'' (1997): 452-462.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specific about Nicholson's role Chatfield (2014) noticed, that "Nicholson was less an innovator than a synthesizer. His main contribution was to organize, improve, and propagate this new knowledge as it spread from a tiny minority of pioneering firms to the vast majority of manufacturers who still had no formal cost accounting systems at the beginning of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;

=== ''Nicholson in Factory Organization and Costs,'' 1909 ===

==== Purpose ====
[[File:Nicholson on Factory Organization and Costs, 1909.jpg|thumb|Title page, 1909.]]
In 1909 Nicholson published his first book, entitled "Nicholson in Factory Organization and Costs". In the preview he explained, that this work was primarily intended as a handbook for [[manufacturers]], who are interested in "modern methods of organization and systems"; for [[accountant]]s and cost specialists as a book of reference; and also as a textbook on [[cost accounting]] for the student.&lt;ref name="N 1909 iii"&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. iii)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also Nicholson intention to outline and explain all the best known methods of Factory Organization, that relate to Cost Finding in such a manner as to enable the manufacturer to compare these methods with those in use in his own plant, in order that he may see more clearly the defects in his organization and how to remedy them. Nicholson hoped that the Public Accountant, Systematizer, and Cost Clerk would find this work to be of value as a reference in planning, devising, or changing a factory system.&lt;ref name="N 1909 iii"/&gt;

==== Content ====
The work contains forty-eight chapters. Among other important topics "Organization and Cost Finding" forms the subject of one chapter. In this chapter the author summarizes the most important arguments for and against cost systems; he also shows the effect of cost system on organization, independent of cost finding, pointing out clearly the value of system to management. The second important topic dealt with is " Wage Systems." Under this head the author points out the general relation of wage systems to costs, treating of the pay-rate-system, piece work and the differential rate plan, as well as profit-sharing and stock-distribution.

The author then discusses the "Analysis of Cost Accounting," pointing out the fallacy of including selling and administrative expenses in factory costs; also criticisms of incorrect principles in distributing overhead charges. He then deals with the distribution of indirect expenses and explains the old machine rate, new machine rate, fixed machine rate, new pay rate, etc.&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee Nicholson | first1 = J | year = 1909 | title = Factory Organization and Costs: Book review | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b640215;view=1up;seq=244| journal = [[Journal of Accountancy]] | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and sixth chapters constitute a general introduction to the subject of forms and systems and discuss such topics as principles used in forms and systems, estimated cost systems, actual cost systems, the designs and explanations relating to the conditions under which forms should be used.&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"/&gt;

Chapters seven to forty-two contain a large variety of forms (over 200). While undoubtedly a number of these forms or similar ones are to be found in ordinary treatises, nevertheless a good many, if not the majority of them, are original and have evidently been taken from actual experience. The author elucidates and fully explains the use of all the forms given and the advantages that can be derived from them. The forms are in large clear type and well arranged. And finally, the last chapters treat of mechanical office appliances.

==== Analyses of cost accounting ====
In the third chapter Nicholson described, that in his days there was still a significant lack of knowledge on the subject of factory costs. Although the importance and desirability of accurate methods of ascertaining the cost of production is generally conceded, and while much attention has been devoted to this subject, and large sums of money expended annually in perfecting cost keeping records, there is a general lack of knowledge in many instances of the principles involved; and the problem now in hand is to present an analysis of the elements that go to make cost, and to indicate the lines along which methods must be devised to gather and classify the facts that are used in its actual determination. The accuracy and effectiveness with which this is done rests on, (1) the principles involved, and (2) the methods used.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"&gt;Nicholson (1909, 38-42)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson explained, that the elements that comprise the cost in all manufacturing enterprises are made up of three principal divisions:&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt; 
[[File:Elements of Cost, 1909.jpg|thumb|420px|Elements of Cost, 1909]]
# ''Material'' : Direct material is that element of material that enters into the product itself and can be charged accurately to the article. Indirect material consists of such material as factory supplies used in the processes, but which do not enter into the product itself. These cannot be charged directly to any one article, but must be distributed over the number of articles affected by their use.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt;  
# ''Labor'' : direct labor is limited to that labor which is actually expended on producing the article manufactured. All forms of labor, such as repairing, hand ling, supervising, etc., that are not engaged directly on the article itself, are desig nated as indirect labor. As in the case of indirect material, the expense of this non-productive labor is distributed over that part of the production that is indirectly affected by it.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt; 
# ''Indirect Expense'' : Indirect expense, together with indirect material and indirect labor, compose the last element of Cost, which is sometimes called "Burden" and sometimes "Overhead "; and this large element of cost must be distributed accurately, by some known ratio, over the production^ if correct costs are to be obtained.&lt;ref name="N 1909 38-42"/&gt; 
The elements, that comprise the cost can be graphically depicted (see image). Beside the here three listed principal divisions, it mentions the ''selling and administrative expenses,'' together compromising the total expenses.

==== Forms and systems for control of operations ====
The biggest part of ''Nicholson in Factory Organization and Costs,'' is devoted the description of a control system of operations, which relies on a series of forms, and accompanying procedures. Nicholson explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CHAPTERS VII to XXXI, inclusive, are devoted to the explanation and illustration of the various forms which may be introduced in a manufacturing business. The forms shown are in most cases similar to forms that are to-day in successful operation in factory systems that have been devised by the author. These forms have been used in a number of plants manufacturing different products, and it is believed that in their entirety they cover most of the important conditions which will be found to exist in any one plant.&lt;br&gt;This does not mean that these forms are submitted to the business man or accountant as being absolutely orthodox in design and admitting of no change. No one form is adaptable to all lines of manufacture or accounting, and even in the same line of business the same form cannot be used successfully in every instance, as the volume of business, the conditions of manufacture, and the policy of the management, so far as the plan of organization is involved, would make this impracticable...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The forms and designs were to be used in connection with the several systems in the Factory Organization. Nicholson introduced three of these systems in advance as follows: 
[[File:Class of forms used in the system, 1909.jpg|thumb|Classes of forms in the system, 1909]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# ESTIMATED COST SYSTEMS : In order to assist those who, instead of using an actual cost system, estimate their costs and keep their general accounts in the books in such a way as to make it difficult to form any opinion as to the accuracy of these estimates at the end of the year or at any other time, several methods calculated to aid in such case will be found in the chapters on this subject...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 59)&lt;/ref&gt;
# ACTUAL COST SYSTEM : The importance of this subject, while being generally conceded, is nevertheless sadly neglected, and the only explanation that can be given is that either the business man and his assistants are not able to inaugurate such a system, or the expense that might be involved prevents him from taking any action in this direction. This is the only logical explanation that can be offered where the importance of the matter is conceded and admits of no argument or difference of opinion...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 60-61)&lt;/ref&gt;
# STOCK SYSTEM : Although it is not necessary to inaugurate a perpetual inventory in order to obtain costs, yet it is advisable to do so whenever possible, as a safeguard to prevent waste of material, theft, or losses from any other causes; and also to guard against over-buying or failure to carry in stock such materials as are neces sary for the operation of the plant...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The whole series of forms presented in the work is summarized in a single sheet (see image). They are presented in 24 classes, covering operations from purchasing, material handling, stock keeping, [[time book|time tickets]], and production records, to cost records, further accounting operations, to drawing patterns and monthly reports. It showed building blocks of the information architecture.

==== Classification of factory accounts ====
As mentioned in the introduction, Nicholson helped standardize cost accounting practice,"&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt; and contributed to the introduction of [[standard costing]].&lt;ref name="GC 1976"/&gt; A basic building block in this effort is the classification of the accounting practices and factory procedures and reporting. Nicholson kept developing these classifications in his 1909, 1913 and 1919 books. In his 1909 "Factory Organization and Costs" he introduced the classification of the [[general ledger]] and of the operating ledger:

{{Gallery

 |alt2=Operating ledger, classification of accounts

}}

Nicholson (1909) explained, that the first question to be considered in designing a system is the results to be obtained. If the system is to be a complete one, these results will ultimately be shown in the general accounts, which are usually contained in a [[General Ledger]].&lt;ref name="N 1909 204"&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* These accounts should be so classified as to show both the financial status and  earnings of an enterprise. The proper classification and arrangement of these accounts will affect to a great extent the accuracy and clearness of the results to be obtained. 
* It is not necessary in the case of a small enterprise to have an elaborate or extensive classification of accounts. A few will answer all purposes in such cases, providing that the purpose of each account is well defined and charges and credits to these accounts during the year are properly made. 
[[File:Classification of operating departments, 1909.jpg|thumb|420px|Classification of operating departments, 1909]]
The accounts, however, must be so kept and arranged as to admit of showing proper results, either at the end of the year or monthly, according to the general plan of the system.&lt;ref name="N 1909 204"/&gt; Additional to the classification of general and operating ledger, Nicholson gave a classification of operating departments (see image).

Nicholson (1909) continued, that in the classification of accounts herein set forth, it will be observed that the assets appear under three principal classifications namely:&lt;ref name="N 1909 204"/&gt; 
* ''Property,''  the fixed assets of the enterprise, and by this term is meant assets that cannot readily be converted into cash.
* ''Deferred Charges'', expenses chargeable to future operations of any nature whatever, such as unexpired insurance, prepaid interest, unusual advertising charges, catalogue expenses, or any other expenses that should not be entirely charged off during any one period but should be pro-rated over several months or fiscal periods. This can be done by charging the original amount to any account properly named under this classification, and by writing off or credit ingto this account the proper proportion each month, charging the amount thus written off to some suitable expense account.  
* ''Current Assets,'' assets of a nature that may be termed quick assets, which can be realized upon currently or from time to time, and are intended to represent the accounts from which funds can be derived to meet current liabilities.

Nicholson (1909) continued to explain the ins and out of Accounts Receivable, the Consignment Account, the Factory Account (inventory of raw material as well as finished stock and goods in process of manufacture), Liabilities, Current Liabilities, Sales, Cost of Sales, etc.&lt;ref name="N 1909 205-7"&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 205-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Office appliances ====
About the last sixty pages of his 1909 work, Nicholson devotes to a treatment of mechanical office appliances, giving illustrations of such appliances and explaining fully the use of each one.&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"/&gt; Nicholson explained that the purpose of chapter was to present information to the manufacturer which may aid him in the organization of his office and in the handling of the immense detail connected with the majority of manufacturing plants. He argued, that "the clerk hire generally necessary in the office of a large plant acts as a dead weight on the profits, and any device which promises to lighten this burden on the cost of production is at least worth careful consideration."&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"&gt;Nicholson (1909, 345-47)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson made clear, that the general purpose of mechanical office devices are to lessen the indirect expenses of a factory, and as such clearly within the scope of a book on Factory Costs. The use of these devices would bring four distinct advantages:&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt;
[[File:Time clock, 1909.jpg|thumb|A time clock, one of mechanical office devices introduced in the book.]] 
# They save time in collecting, arranging, and calculating the different items that must be handled in office management: To illustrate this it is only necessary to refer to the function of those time stamps and clocks which register the time of employees on cards in such a way that the computation of the week s pay is only a matter of a short addition and easy multiplication. If wage tables are used even this is dispensed with, as there is then no necessity for the double handling of time records, a feature of the ordinary methods of computing pay rolls. In collecting data for finding costs, the time of beginning and completing operations is usually registered on cards by the workman himself in writing. The use of time stamps in the factory effects a considerable saving of time in this respect alone.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt; 
# They obtain greater accuracy with less labor incurred. Calculating machines gain in accuracy by reason of eliminating the personal equation in the operation itself, etc.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt; 
# Through their use the clerical force may be reduced, either in actual difference in numbers or in the class of clerks hired:  That is to say that the man agement may often substitute a machine, with a clerk of ordinary intelligence and moderate pay, for the skilled employee whose wages are necessarily high.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt; 
# They arrange the work in better form for inspection and use than do the old pen and ink methods. The printed tabular forms and loose sheet devices are surely easier to deal with than cumbersome books and written columns, which have been used from remote times in the accounts of manufacturing firms.&lt;ref name="N 1909 345-7"/&gt;

The presentation of these kind of office appliances was more common in management books in those days. Richard T. Dana (1876-1928) and [[Halbert Powers Gillette]] devoted a substantial part of their (1909) ''Construction Cost Keeping and Management'' to the description of numerous office appliances.

==== Reception ====
A 1909 review in the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' judged, that the work was the "first American treatise on cost accounting proper, dealing with the subject from an accountant's point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quote cited in Taylor (1979) and Solomons (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The review continues: "The author, though keeping to the front in his treatment of important accounting principles applicable to the subject, has nevertheless written the book in clear and untechnical language... While it may be questioned whether the author has been successful in preparing a text-book for students, he has undoubtedly accomplished his prime object, that of supplying the manufacturer with a thorough treatise on a subject in which he is vitally interested, and that of giving professional accountants and cost specialists a valuable reference work."&lt;ref name="JoA 1909"/&gt;

Taylor (1979) recalled, that this 1909 work was the first presentation of a "unified treatment of the estimated cost system." Four years later Nicholson published his second book, ''Cost Accounting Theory and Practice,'' which described the "same methods for determining inventories, cost estimates, and analysis of cost of sales but he varied his verification technique."&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt;

=== ''Cost Accounting Theory and Practice,'' 1913 ===
[[File:Cost Accounting Theory and Practice, 1913.jpg|thumb|Title page, 1913]]
In 1913 Nicholson published ''Cost Accounting Theory and Practice.'' In this work he presented "the same methods for determining inventories, cost estimates, and analysis of cost of sales but he varied his verification technique. This book probably shows the results of his teaching experiences at New York and Columbia Universities. Mr. Nicholson also recommends, in this book, a method for estimating cost of sales at current prices which foreshadowed [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|LIFO]] accounting."&lt;ref name="T 1979"/&gt; Hein (1959) specified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most remarkable developments in this volume is his distinction between operating departments and service or indirect departments with respect to the allocation of overhead. Another historically important contribution is the integration of the factory accounting with the general financial ledger through the use of reciprocal accounts.&lt;br&gt;But Nicholson went well beyond the treatment of "what are costs" and "how to account for costs." He was deeply interested in factory organization as such, and in the relationship of the cost department with the other departments in a company. The reader can infer this emphasis from the "factory organization" part of the title of his first book. A large part of his consulting practice was devoted to problems of organization and management.&lt;ref name="H 1959 109"&gt;Hein (1959, p. 109)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Hillis Newlove|Newlove]] (1975) mentioned that this work was a very famous textbook, which "devoted four chapters to the allocation of burden costs to the special factory orders or to the product on its productive labor and machine (or process) methods; this emphasis greatly exceeded the space devoted to the collection, analysis and control of burden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Newlove  |first= George Hillis | author-link1= George Hillis Newlove |title=In all my years: Economic and legal causes of changes in accounting |journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |volume= 2 |issue= 1/4 | date= 1975| pages=40–44 |jstor=40697368 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System of factory accounting ===
[[File:Special order system flow chart, 1913.jpg|thumb|Special order system, 1913 (partly)]]
In the late 1880s [[Emile Garcke|Garcke]] and [[John Manger Fells|Fells]], had developed a system of factory accounting, and pictured its elements in four complementary flow diagrams. In 1896 [[J. Slater Lewis]] further developed this system, and pictured a diagram of manufacturing accounts, in which the four diagrams were integrated into one whole. A decennium later [[Alexander Hamilton Church]] (1908/10) would further develop this system by introducing the concept of production factors, and picturing the "Principles of Organization by Production Factors" around any organization. Using this concept of production factors Church was able to simplify the system of manufacturing accounts to a "Systems of Controlling Accounts."

In the 1913 ''Cost accounting'' Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach presented not one, but four different method of factory accounting: 
# Special Order System, Productive Labor Method (see image, which only shows some fragments)&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 198)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Special Order System, Process or Machine Method&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 214)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Product System, Productive Labor Method,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 226)&lt;/ref&gt; and 
# Product System, Process or Machine Method.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1913, p. 236)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach published their work, in 1913/19, [[Edward P. Moxey]] published his influential textbook on accountancy, in which he also pictured the relation of stores records to commercial records.

In his 1922 ''Cost accounts'' [[George Hillis Newlove]] further multiple similar Special Order Systems (see images).&lt;ref&gt;[[George Hillis Newlove]] ''[https://archive.org/stream/costaccounts00newl#page/12/mode/2up Cost accounts].'' 1922. p. 13-21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interest costs ===
[[Gary John Previts|Previts]] (1974) shared Nicholson among the foremost pioneers of [[interest]] costs, with William Morse Cole, John R. Wildman, DR Scott, D. C. Eggleston, Thomas H. Sanders and [[G. Charter Harrison]]. According to Previts "the early arguments over treatment of interest cost (both paid and imputed) spurred publication of countless articles and commentaries along with a relatively sound but since unheralded work Interest as a Cost..."&lt;ref name="GJP 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Previts  |first= Gary John | author-link1= Gary John Previts |title=Old Wine and... The New Harvard Bottle|journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |volume=1 |issue= 1/4 | date= 1974| pages=19–20 |jstor=40691037 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson explained his point of view in this matter in the 1913 article "Interest Should be Included as Part of the Cost" in the ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' in which he started the following argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The writer firmly believes in the theory that interest on capital invested should be charged to the proper expense accounts before ascertaining the actual profit from manufacturing or trading.&lt;br&gt;There is a large difference in risk between capital invested in stocks, bonds and real estate and capital invested in manufacturing or other commercial undertakings; and it is not to be disputed that capital invested in commercial enterprises is liable to far greater risk than that of capital invested in securities. It is only fair that the capital invested in commercial enterprises should have credit for at least the same return as that in securities before a trading profit is shown.&lt;br&gt;The two articles in the April number of The Journal by Wm. Morse Cole and [[A. Hamilton Church]] give such logical reasons for the inclusion of interest as a part of the cost...&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Nicholson. "[https://archive.org/stream/journalaccounta04unkngoog#page/n342/mode/2up Interest Should be Included as Part of the Cost]," ''The Journal of Accountancy.'' Vol 15, mr. 2 (May 1913) p. 330-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Previts (1974) further explained, that the opposition consisted of a "politically more prominent group, and in the sense of the outcome, the success of their position may have been in large part because of such political strength. As early as 1911, [[Arthur Lowes Dickinson]] criticized advocates of interest inclusion. Dickinson's allies included [[R. H. Montgomery]], Jos. F. Sterrett, and [[George O. May]]."&lt;ref name="GJP 1974"/&gt;

In the 1919 ''Cost Accounting'' Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]] again deal with the admittedly controversial question as to whether it is proper to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.&amp;nbsp;140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

The opposition view in that time was presented by [[William Andrew Paton]] and Russell Alger Stevenson in their ''Principles of Accounting'' (1919). To these writers, interest charges, whether contractual or non-contractual, are distribution-of-income, not expense, items. But, they say, if these charges are to be made at all, the logical procedure would be to distribute among the factory products the normal return on all the capital invested, not that on the fixed assets only. With this last contention, at least, the reviewer is inclined to agree. But Professors Paton and Stevenson appear to believe that the problem in hand is being solved on other than logical ground. For they say: "The use of interest charges in cost accounts on anything like a rational basis is a procedure which faces almost insurmountable practical obstacles. It is probably this fact rather than the logic of the case that is causing cost accountants to begin to recover from the interest obsession" &lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Paton]] and Russell Alger Stevenson in their ''Principles of Accounting'' (1919), p. 615; Cited in Stanley E. Howard (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniform cost accounting ===
Nicholson has been recognized as a proponent of uniform cost accounting. According to Gerald Berk (1997) Nicholson was part of a group of "associationalists", which promoted the idea that "uniform cost accounting, not enforcement, was the best hope to channel competition away from cut throat pricing into product and manufacturing process improvement."&lt;ref name="GB 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Berk  |first= Gerald | author-link1= |title=Discursive Cartels: Uniform Cost Accounting Among American Manufacturers Before the New Deal |journal= Business and Economic History | volume=26 |issue= 1 | date= 1997| pages=229–251 |jstor=23703309 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These proponents also assumed, that uniform cost accounting would increase factory efficiency. The general idea for manufacturers was, that "the more they would think systematically about 'planning, routing, and scheduling' conversion processes within the firm... the more they [would] understood about the cost of the many products they made, the more they could distinguish the profitable from the unprofitable."&lt;ref name="GB 1997"/&gt; In this context Nicholson had argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a manufacturer can not make money in competition with other concerns when using the same methods of figuring costs, he can only conclude that his goods or his marketing, or both of them, are costing him too much. His next step, naturally, is to analyse closely the methods and conditions under which he is manufacturing and marketing his product, until he finds and corrects the inefficiencies which are handicapping him so seriously...&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson cited in U.S. Federal Trade Commission, 1929. p. 12; Cited in Berk (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 1919 "Cost Accounting" Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]] expressed the idea, that "if the accuracy of the cost estimate has been tested and the sales price of the product has been properly determined on the basis of the tested cost estimates, then the proper profit margin of the product sold would be assured. The objectives of estimate-cost accounting... were to assure proper profit for the products sold and to test their manufacturing costs in detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okamoto | first1 = Kiyoshi | year = 1966 | title = Evolution of Cost Accounting in the United States of America | url = http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/7628/1/HJcom0040100320.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Hitotsubashi journal of commerce and management | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 32–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Association of Cost Accountants ===
[[File:J. Lee Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920.jpg|thumb|360px|Nicholson at International Cost Conference, 1920]]
In 1919 Nicholson conceived and organized the National Association of Cost Accountants.&lt;ref&gt;''Management Accounting,'' Vol. 25, Nr. 1 (1943), p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; For a start he had initiated a special meeting of the [[American Institute of Accountants]] to talk about the subject of cost accounting in manufacturing industries. This meeting was held October 13, 1919 in Buffalo, N.Y., and let to the founding of the National Association of Cost Accountants (NACA), forerunner of the [[Institute of Management Accountants]].&lt;ref name="VJ 2014"/&gt;

A total of 37 accountants attended the meeting, and among them were practitioners as William B. Castenholz, Stephen Gilman, Harry Dudley Greeley, and Clinton H. Scovell and professor of accounting [[Edward P. Moxey Jr.]] A total of 97 charter members joined in the initial organization, and among them were [[Arthur E. Andersen]], Eric A. Camman, Frederick H. Hurdman, William M. Lybrand of [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], [[Robert Hiester Montgomery]], C. Oliver Wellington, and John Raymond Wildman.&lt;ref name="VJ 2014"/&gt;

Nicholson was elected its first President 1919-1920. He was succeeded by William M. Lybrand. In the Presidents report in the first Year book of the National Association of Cost Accountants, Nicholson explained, that the Association had started with 88 Chartered members. In the first year an additional 2.000 applications for membership had been received.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Cost Accountants (U.S.). ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008603734 Year book and proceedings of the ... International Cost Conference]. New York : J. J. Little &amp; Ives Co., 1920. p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Costs accounting,'' 1919 ===

==== State of the art of cost accounting ====
[[File:Cost accounting, 1920.jpg|thumb|''Cost accounting,'' 1919/20]]
In the preface of the 1919 ''Cost Accounting'' Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]] gave their view on the state of the art of cost accounting in the United States.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cost accounting, as a vital factor of successful business administration, has, in the last few years, been brought home in various ways to many manufacturers who before had never seriously appreciated its importance.&lt;br /&gt;The [[Federal Trade Commission]], working for more stable conditions, has conducted a widespread campaign of education, explaining in detail what a cost accounting system is, how it is operated, and the resulting business advantages.&lt;br /&gt;Various manufacturers' associations have first paid skilled accountants to devise cost-finding methods suited to their special trade conditions, and then have instituted a vigorous propaganda to induce all engaged in their own particular industry to adopt them, thus making these methods uniform in the trade and securing uniformity of selling prices and the end of reckless and ignorant price-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Now the government, with its need to levy war taxes and its consequent necessity for searching investigation into income and excess profits, requires that estimates and approximations as to production costs and profits shall give place to rational accounting systems giving actual figures by uniform methods.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1920, p. iii)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the important aims of the book is to "classify the details of cost accounting so that the reader, be he accountant, manufacturer, or student, is given a well-defined idea of the forms and records required for each separate operation."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson and Rohrbach (1919, p. iv) as cited in Burnet (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Content of ''Costs accounting'', 1919====
Nicholson and [[John F. D. Rohrbach|Rohrbach]]'s ''Cost Accounting'' is a revision and extension of Nicholson's "Cost Accounting, Theory and Practice," published in 1913, and represents a forward step in its particular field. There are seven distinct parts of the book, and the last preceding statement applies particularly to the first four parts, designated as follows:&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"&gt;Stanley E. Howard.

New York: The Ronald Press Company. 1919.]" in: ''The American Economic Review,'' Vol. 9, No. 3 (Sep., 1919), pp. 563-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I, Elements and Methods of Cost-Finding ; 
* Part II, Factory Routine and Detailed Reports ; 
* Part III, Compiling and Summarizing the Cost Records ; 
* Part IV, Controlling the Cost Records. 
The following three parts are:
* Part V, The Installation of a Cost System, is both descriptive and suggestive. 
* Part VI, Simplified Cost Finding Methods, is again chiefly descriptive.
* Part VII, Cost-Pius Contracts, is analytical and suggestive, and contains that which will be regarded by many as the most valuable material in the volume. Chapters 31 and 32 contain the senior author's personal, not official, opinions concerning the correct accounting procedure in the handling of cost-plus contracts. In chapter 33, likewise, are found his personal opinions regarding the proper terms of cancellation of such contracts. These chapters are most timely and will be read with interest by professional accountants and contractors.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

==== General Functions of Cost Accounting ====
According to Nicholson (1920) it would be a mistake, to think that the scope of [[cost accounting]] is limited to finding costs only. The functions of a cost system are as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any good cost system, properly operated, performs two distinct, though related, functions.
* The first, which may be called the direct function, is that of ascertaining actual costs. 
* The second, or indirect function, is that of supplying, in its system of reports, the information necessary to organize the many departments of a factory into working units, and to direct their activities in accord with some definite plan.&lt;ref name="N 1920 p.21"&gt;Nicholson (1920, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the relation of cost accounting and general accounting Nicholson (1920) proceeded: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cost accounting, as a science, is a branch of general [[accounting]]. Its province is to analyze and record the cost of the various items of material, labor and indirect expense incurred in the operation of a factory, and to so compile these elements as to show the total production cost of a particular piece of work.&lt;ref name="N 1920 p.21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore: "With the cost books once established, the best modem usage is to incorporate their record in total in the general financial books. In this way the modem cost system builds up an interlocking series of accounts which furnish the material for a detailed study of the operations of a manufacturing business."&lt;ref name="N 1920 p.21"/&gt;

==== Elements and Methods of Cost-Finding ====
In his 1909 "Factory Organization and Costs" Nicholson already presented a first analyses regarding the relation of the cost elements to selling price, which was visualized in a diagram (see above).  In his 1919 work he explained that this analyses can be part of a "uniform methods of cost-finding." This means outlining the standard principles of cost accounting and, from these principles, arriving at uniform  methods of treating costs as applied to a particular industry.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 11-12"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 11-12)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson explained that the greatest advantage to be derived from uniform cost methods is that of insuring a more uniform selling price. This object would be attained, even if the uniform system were not as scientific as it should be; for if errors were made through the method established, all manufacturers would at least be figuring the same way, all would be making the same mistakes, and unfair and ignorant competition would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 11-12"/&gt; Before determining the selling price of an article consideration must be given to the various elements of costs and expenses which have been classified as:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 19-23"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 19-23)&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Direct material 
# Direct labor 
# Direct expenses 
# Indirect charges 
# Selling expenses 
# Administrative expenses 
The standard cost accounting system recognized not only expenses, but also different types of costs, and eventually the selling price:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 19-23"/&gt; 
* ''Prime Cost.'' The sum of the direct material cost plus the direct labor cost is known as the prime cost. 
* ''Factory Cost.'' The sum of the prime cost plus the indirect charges is known as the factory cost. 
* ''Total Cost.'' The sum of the factory cost plus the selling expenses and the administrative expenses is known as the total cost. 
* ''Selling Price''. The sum of the total cost plus the profit is known as the selling price.

These gradations of cost may be further illustrated by means of the following simple diagram (diagram I), which illustrates the steps leading from the material cost to the selling price. This diagram is an extension of the analyses of cost accounting, Nicholson presented in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson (1909, p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; This type of visual analytics was presented earlier by [[Alexander Hamilton Church|Church]] (1901),&lt;ref&gt;[[Church, Alexander Hamilton]], "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101049911280;view=1up;seq=532 The Proper Distribution of Establishment Charges]." in Engineering Magazine, July to Dec. 1901. p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; and became more common in introductory textbooks; see for example Webner (1911),&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank E. Webner]]. ''[https://archive.org/stream/factorycostsawo00webngoog#page/n280/mode/2up Factory costs, a work of reference for cost accountants and factory managers].'' 1911. p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dexter S.

Nicholson continued, that in practice it is customary to allow certain deductions from the established selling prices, or from the established purchasing prices. These deductions can include trade discounts, allowances, rebates and/or cash discount.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 19-23"/&gt; As to the analysis of total of cost elements, every cost element can be traced back to certain kind of expenses, see diagram II. This kind of diagram was also more common in those days; see for example [[Halbert Powers Gillette#Fundamental Divisions of Cost|Dana &amp; Gillette]] (1909),&lt;ref&gt;[[Gillette, Halbert Powers]], and Richard T. Dana. ''[https://archive.org/stream/costkeepingmanag00gilluoft#page/128/mode/2up Construction Cost Keeping and Management].'' Gillette Publishing Company, 1909. p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dexter S.

==== Basic methods of cost-finding ====
As costs furnish the basis for determining the selling prices of the manufactured product, they naturally should be compiled so that the total cost of the job, order, or article may be readily ascertained. Actual conditions in manufacturing determine the system of cost-finding to be used, which should include :&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 25-34)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# A method of ascertaining or reporting the material, labor, and overhead costs. 
# A method of compiling these elements of cost. 
# A method of determining the total cost of the job, order, or article. 
For present purposes the actual conditions which exist in manufacturing industries may be grouped or summarized in two general classes, and the methods of cost-finding applicable to these two classes may be designated as follows:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"/&gt;
[[File:Chart Showing Methods of Cost-Finding Applied to Various Industries, 1919.jpg|thumb|420px|III: Methods of Cost-Finding Applied to Various Industries, 1919]]
* '''Order method of cost-finding''' : When the order is the tangible basis upon which the elements of cost are charged, compiled, and determined, the order method of cost-finding is generally used. In other words, under such conditions the material costs, labor costs, and a pro rata share of the factory overhead are all charged to definite factory orders, and the elements of material, labor, and overhead costs are compiled so that the total factory cost of each individual order may be determined. If a number of units are manufactured under the definite factory order, the unit article cost may be determined by dividing the total factory cost by the total quantity manufactured or produced. Definite factory orders may be issued for the manufacture of a number of units, for a single unit, or for the manufacture of certain parts of a unit.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"/&gt;
* '''Process method of cost-finding''' : Whenever the process of manufacture is continuous for regular periods of time so that the definite factory orders and jobs lose their identity and become part of a large volume of production, the material, labor, and overhead costs are chargeable to the definite processes or operations and the process method of cost-finding is used. This method is sometimes called the "product method of cost-finding." However, in view of the fact that the word *' product" refers more particularly to article rather than operation, the designation "process method of cost-finding" is more explicit and is preferable. This term includes the method commonly known as the "machine-cost method," for the reason that the same general principles of cost-finding apply.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 25-34"/&gt;
 
Form III shows in summarized form the two basic methods of cost-finding and the industries, or departments within a plant, to which they are applicable under the conditions already described.

==== Factory Routine and Detailed Reports ====
Before it can be decided which method of cost-finding may be used in any particular plant, the manufacturing departments of the plant must be classified. In some industries the order method of cost-finding might be applicable to certain departments, and the process method of cost-finding might be applicable to the remaining departments (see diagram IV).&lt;ref name="NR 1919 35-57"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 35-57)&lt;/ref&gt;

In designing the system of "Factory Routine and Detailed Reports" first a classification is presented of factory departments and of factory orders. Diagram 4 shows the classification of various factory departments in summarized form.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagram V summarizes the various kinds of factory orders which may be issued and the functions of these records.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the system of "Factory Routine and Detailed Reports," proposed by Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919), incorporates three types of reports about the handling of material, labor and production:

Diagram VI shows the various steps in the handling of material, and the material reports which are necessary to record 
material costs.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagram VII summarizes the various kinds of labor reports and the routine of reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;  And diagram VIII summarizes the detailed items to be considered in the routine of production and the devising of production reports.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 209)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distribution of Factory Overhead ====
At the turn of the 20th century, factory management was faced with the problem how overhead cost should be assigned to products, which lead to the modelling of costing systems. In the work of Nicholson the idea of [[cost centres]] was emphasizing, although he didn't coined or used the term itself. An accompanying problem was "how to distinguish between 'production' cost centres working directly for production and 'service provider' cost centres working for other centres... [to] cascade the distribution of the charges related to these cost centres."&lt;ref name = "LZ 2015"&gt;Levant, Yves, and Henri Zimnovitch. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yves_Levant/publication/228925061_Equivalence_methods_a_little-known_aspect_of_the_history_of_costing/links/0046353a1b54f372e2000000.pdf Equivalence methods: a little-known aspect of the history of costing]." at ''researchgate.net.'' Accessed 2015-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Samuel Paul Garner|Garner]] (1954) Nicholson in (1913) as well as to Webner (1917) and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor]], where the first to tackle this problem.&lt;ref name = "LZ 2015"/&gt;

Nicholson and Rohrbach (1919) further summarized, that the factory overhead that cannot be absorbed in the article cost directly is applied indirectly in the following manner:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 163-182"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 163-182)&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The elements of factory overhead cost are assigned equitably to specific departments of the factory, including productive, non-productive, and miscellaneous departments. 
# The total cost of the indirect departments is then transferred to, and distributed over, the productive departments on some fair basis. 
# The total amount of factory overhead expenses chargeable to each productive department is determined, and is then distributed over the various jobs, orders, articles, or processes.

Nicholson continued explaining about different methods of distributing overhead. Assuming the departmental method of distributing overhead has been adopted, he said, there still remains the most complex problem of all - upon what basis shall the overhead be distributed within the departments so that each job, order, or article may be charged with the portion that properly belongs to it? In those days five methods were more or less standard, applied under definite conditions of manufacture. These are:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 163-182"/&gt;
[[File:Classification Chart of Factory Overhead, 1919.jpg|thumb|420px|IX. Classification Chart of Factory Overhead, 1919]]
# ''Prime-cost method'' : the most simple method, which divides the total overhead expenses by the total material and labor costs, resulting in a decimal figure which is the rate to be used. 
# ''Productive-labor-cost method'' : based upon the principle that indirect expenses are incurred in proportion to the cost of the labor involved. To operate the plan, the total amount of overhead expenses for a definite period is divided by the total cost of the direct labor for the same period.
# ''Productive-labor-hours method'' : similar as the productive-labor-cost method, but the amount of labor is measured by time and not by cost.
# ''Machine-rate methods'' : All machine-rate methods are based upon the principle that overhead expense accrues in proportion to the number of hours of machine operation.
# ''Miscellaneous methods'' : Various modifications and combinations of methods for the distribution of overhead have been devised to meet special conditions in different lines of business. For the most part they are "percentage" plans in some form or other.
The items which make up the factory overhead and the methods of distributing them first to departments and then to product are summarized in diagram IX.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 163-182"/&gt;

==== Compiling and Summarizing the Cost Records ====
Further classification of cost accounting details have been made as follows:

}}

Diagram X summarizes the information entered on different kinds of cost sheets and the method of posting and checking the data they contain,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 230)&lt;/ref&gt; and diagram XI shows in concrete form the cost summarizing records described all of Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919). The authors noted, that the distribution record, may be used for all summary purposes. The 
sheets of each summary may be classified in sections in a loose-leaf binder, each section being kept separate by means of tab 
indexes, thus providing a means for ready reference. The folios of each section should be numbered for posting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 292)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controlling the Cost Records ====
In the chapter about "General Ledger Control of Factory Accounts," Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach explained that in large manufacturing concerns it is customary to provide a chart or a classified list of accounts showing the exact name of each and the transactions to be recorded therein. Where the classification is elaborate, it is well to use account numbers or symbols so as to facilitate ready reference to them and thus save the bookkeepers' time. The authors advise, that such a chart should be printed upon heavy paper or cardboard and hung in view of those who have occasion to refer to it frequently. Where desks are equipped with glass tops and the chart is inserted under the glass, reference can be made to it very readily.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 310-314"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 310-314)&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of each concern govern the number of copies of the chart of accounts to be prepared and the members of the staff to whom they are to be given. Ordinarily it is necessary for each clerk in the accounting and cost departments to have his own copy, while an additional copy should be given to the purchasing agent and treasurer or the officer who is in charge of the accounting records. Portions of the chart of accounts may be given to the plant superintendent, production manager, factory foreman, stock clerks, and factory clerks.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 310-314"/&gt;

The chart shown in diagram XII gives a classified list of accounts of a large manufacturing concern. Last part of the system presented are the scheme's concerning the controlling the cost records:&lt;ref name="NR 1919 310-314"/&gt;

Diagram XIII summarizes the discussion of the factory ledger accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason that it is advantageous to draw up a classification sheet of the general ledger accounts of a large manufacturing plant, the factory ledger accounts may also be illustrated by means of a chart (diagram XIV). In preparing such a chart, the accounts should be given symbol numbers. It may be noted that factory ledger controlling accounts vary in number from the three simple accounts previously described to several hundred.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 331-332"&gt;Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919, p. 331-332)&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrangement of the accounts in the ledger should receive attention. While they are often arranged according to their symbol numbers, as their classification is more or less standardized according to Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919), they may be grouped in sections in the following order: 
# Raw material accounts 
# Work in process accounts 
# Part-finished stock accounts 
# Finished stock accounts 
# Productive labor accounts 
# Distributed overhead accounts 
# Detailed factory overhead accounts 
The sections should be distinguished by means of tab indexes marked according to the classifications. Where detailed overhead accounts are kept for each department, it may be well to furnish additional tab indexes within this section marked with the departments of the plant so that the overhead accounts of one department may be readily distinguished from those of another.&lt;ref name="NR 1919 331-332"/&gt; With these [[classification chart]]s Nicholson &amp; Rohrbach (1919) presented their idea's, which became known as the definition of [[cost centres]].&lt;ref name = "LZ 2015"/&gt;

==== Reception ====
In a 1919 review in ''The American Economic Review,'' Stanley E. Howard stated, that the materials of the volume are well organized. The reader is given a bird's eye view of the problems dealt with, and is then shown in detail the development of cost and controlling records from the various business and factory forms. The authors have taken pains to emphasize relationships, presenting frequent summary charts. Fundamentals regarding the forms for orders, reports, and records have been illustrated, and the mistake has not been made of confounding multiplicity of illustration with clarity of exposition.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

The volume is intended for use by accountants, manufacturers, and students. Members of the first two groups, according to Howard (1919), would find particularly useful the information contained in the tables of approved depreciation rates for different types of assets, as well as the discussion of the relationship between Overtime and the modification of standard depreciation rates.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

Howard (1919) ended his review by stating, that the issue is probably beclouded by reason of the different points of view involved. The cost accountant wishes, among other things, to furnish the selling department adequate data upon which to base a price policy. The general accountant has in mind the preparation of correct, unpadded statements of condition and of operation. For the purposes of the one certain information is needed, which by the other should be discarded. Reconciliation of the opposing ideas ought to be possible, perhaps along the lines suggested by Messrs. Nicholson and Rohrbach.&lt;ref name = "SEH 1919"/&gt;

A second 1919 review by Arthur R. Burnet in the ''Publications of the American Statistical Association'' called the entire work a happy combination of theory and practical examples. Burnet found that the book is being used as a handbook in a number of organizations where cost systems were being installed or improved. The forms are illustrated and can be followed in actual practice. The chapter on the examination of the plant preparatory to the installation of a cost system, according to Burnet in those days, contained a valuable checking list which should furnish statisticians with a wealth of suggestions for the analysis of business.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur R. Burnet. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2964891 Reviewed Work: Cost Accounting by J. Lee Nicholson, John F. D. Rohrbach," in: ''Publications of the American Statistical Association,'' Vol. 16, No. 126 (Jun., 1919), pp. 405-406.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1920 review, in the ''Financial World,'' more in particular mentioned,  that "in the methods of manufacture, greater care must be exercised. The functions of a cost system are well stated by Major J. Lee Nicholson..." in his 1919 work.&lt;ref&gt;''Financial World,'' Vol 32, Part 2, (1919-20) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Profitable Management,'' 1923 ===
Nicholson last book was ''Profitable Management,'' published in 1923. A 1923 review in ''The Annalist'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The volume on "Profitable Management" by J. Lee Nicholson 's a bright star in the Ronald catalogue, and in its 117 pages it presents a vast array of worldly wisdom which should be taken to heart by men of business, great and small.  For while the major part of Mr. Nicholson's counsels on the varied phases of commercial activity have reference to the more extensive industries, they are applicable to every kind of business which is called into existence for profit making...&lt;ref&gt;''The Annalist: A Magazine of Finance, Commerce and Economics,'' New York Times Company. Vol. 22 (1923) p. 705&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hein (1959) further evaluated, that "modern writers on management theory and practice would have to examine it closely to find points not now being advocated in the current literature. It contains such recommendations as the costing of clerical and selling procedures, and the setting of standards as a means for comparison and control. Even today such procedures have not been widely adopted, although, since clerical costs are increasing at a faster rate than are factory costs, such control has much greater significance at the present time than it had in the early 1920s." &lt;ref name="H 1959 107"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Nicholson reputation as cost accounting pioneer was acknowledged in his days. A 1920 article in ''The Packages,''  mentioned that "Major J. Lee Nicholson... reputation as a cost accountant and author extends from one end of the country to the other..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Packages,'' Vol. 23. (1920). p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson is further remembered as founder of the National Association of Cost Accountants.&lt;ref name="McL 1924"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Cost Accountants (U.S.) . ''Official Publications.'' Vol. 7.  (1964). p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Evolution of Cost Accounting to 1925'' [[Samuel Paul Garner|S. Paul Garner]] (1954) &lt;ref&gt;[[Garner, S. Paul]], ''Evolution of Cost Accounting to 1925,'' University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; described a number of important contributions by Nicholson. Hein (1959) summarized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, [Nicholson] proposed a summary of requisitions as an aid in posting to stores ledgers and cost records. In this same area of accounting for raw materials, Nicholson was an exponent of the use of a true perpetual inventory system. He did not originate this idea, but brought it to a high stage of perfection, designing raw materials ledger cards which had spaces not only for amounts and values, but also for items received and requisitioned, with the balance on hand indicated."&lt;ref&gt;Hein (1959, p. 108-9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hein (1959) further summarized:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Garner credits Nicholson with the original development of the several methods of accounting for scrap (although some earlier pioneering work had been done in this area), and he feels that the works of subsequent writers are primarily elaborations of Nicholson's treatment. In the differentiation of the uses of, and the accounting for job order costing and process costing, Nicholson was especially farsighted, missing only the now-taken-for granted concept of equivalent production in the valuation of inventories and the calculation of the cost of goods sold. He was apparently the first individual to develop the concepts and comparative advantages of accounting for costs departmentally, on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis that is, pyramided and non-pyramided departmental costs.&lt;ref name="H 1959 109"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Chatfield (2014) Nicholson's later writings "anticipated post-1920 developments in the use of cost figures for decision making and in the psychology of cost control."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt; He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Nicholson's] experiences as head of a management consulting firm focused his attention on the relationship between [[cost accounting]] and [[industrial efficiency]]. He emphasized that cost accounting is a service function whose value depends on its usefulness to other departments. As a staff man negotiating with foremen and executives, the cost accountant must be diplomatic, yet forceful enough to take full advantage of the discipline that costing makes possible. Nicholson stressed the importance of supplying cost figures that are appropriate for each executive level, and the need to educate foremen and department heads about overhead costs as a first step toward controlling such costs. Cost accountants should give department managers comparative costs of materials, labor, overhead, production quantities, and inventories. Each production department should in turn inform the sales department how all these amounts are likely to vary in relation to changes in sales volume.&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore Nicholson "refined and disseminated new knowledge about cost accounting, which had recently undergone revolutionary changes... As one of the earliest American cost accountants to teach the subject at the university level, he helped standardize practice and facilitate the interaction of ideas between academics and practitioners."&lt;ref name="MC 1996"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">The [[anti-trust]] [[class-action]] lawsuit '''Jung v. AAMC ''' alleged collusion to prevent American [[medical resident|trainee doctors]] from negotiating for better working conditions. The [[Medical resident work hours|working conditions of medical residents]] often involved 80- to 100-hour workweeks.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit had some early success, but failed when the U.S. Congress enacted a statute exempting matching programs from federal anti-trust laws.

==Background==
Every year, American medical students and graduates participate along with foreign-trained physicians in a national matching plan to obtain a position in an accredited resident training program.  Applicants and programs that participate in the matching plan submit rank-ordered preferences for training.  A mathematical algorithm is used to place an applicant in a preferred program that also prefers the applicant.

The [[National Resident Matching Program]], also referred to as "The Match", is one of several national matching plans in the United States.

==Lawsuit==
The suit was launched on behalf of all current and former medical residents against defendants that oversaw and participated in the matching process as well as institutions that employed medical residents.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three physicians who launched the suit alleged that the [[National Resident Matching Program|NRMP Matching program]] was an [[anti-competitive practice]], claiming that:

* fourth-year medical students were required to apply to the Match, and had no opportunity to negotiate their terms of employment with teaching hospitals ''(if they did not apply, they could not enter a residency accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], and hence could not become certified as physicians by an [[American Board of Medical Specialties|ABMS-recognized board]], meaning that they cannot practice their specialty)''
* the defendants limited the number of residency positions available in U.S. teaching hospitals 
* the defendants placed "substantial obstacles to the ability of a resident to transfer employment from one employer to another during the period of a residency"
* the ACGME encouraged or required participation in the Match as a condition of accreditation for institutions offering residencies.
* the defendants shared information on conditions of employment, and reviewed them in order to keep salaries low.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants challenged the admissibility of the lawsuit with several arguments, including a lack of jurisdiction &lt;ref name=opinion&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2004419300FSupp2d119_1407/JUNG%20v.%20ASSOCIATION%20OF%20AMERICAN%20MEDICAL%20COLLEGES]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the plaintiffs had not been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S1546-1440(03)00007-3| issn = 1546-1440| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 40–47| last = Bierig| first = Jack R.| title = Jung v.

The federal district court did allow the case to proceed against 17 defendants, ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Court finds that plaintiffs adequately have alleged a common agreement to displace competition in the recruitment, hiring, employment and compensation of resident physicians and to impose a scheme of restraints that has the purpose and effect of fixing, artificially depressing, standardizing and stabilizing resident physician compensation and other terms of employment among certain defendants.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legislative change==
The lawsuit ended when Congress enacted legislation as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] added to an unrelated bill (the [[Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004|Pension Funding Equity Act]]) that exempted participation in a matching program from federal anti-trust laws.

The rider was called "Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs" (Section 207). Neither the rider nor the then-ongoing Jung v. AAMC case was debated. The rider was lobbied for by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and the [[American Hospital Association]], and sponsored by Senator [[Judd Gregg]] of New Hampshire and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; Senators [[Herb Kohl|Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold|Feingold]], and [[Jeff Bingaman|Bingaman]] publicly criticized the way in which the rider was added.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;

The rider praised the 50-year-old Matching Program, saying that "[a]ntitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long standing process" and  "would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research"&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The bill containing the rider was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 8, 2004.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The new law prohibited  "using allegations related to the Match to support any antitrust claim",&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; retroactively.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; The court ruled that the plaintiff's case was dependent on allegations related to the Match.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; The case was dismissed under the authority of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html |first=S. |last=Robinson |title=Antitrust Lawsuit Over Medical Residency System Is Dismissed |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl-Heinz Werner Toosbuy''' (23 February 1928 – 8 June 2004) was a Danish businessman, the founder and owner of [[ECCO]], the Danish shoe company.

Karl Toosbuy trained as a shoemaker and by his early 30s, was running a [[Copenhagen]] factory. In 1963, he moved with his wife Birte and daughter Hanni to [[Bredebro]] on the west coast of Denmark, just north of the German border. Toosbuy started ECCO in what had been an empty factory.&lt;ref name="ecco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.ecco.com/en/company/heritage|publisher=global.ecco.com|title=ECCO.com|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lo Hoi-sing''' ({{zh|t=羅海星|p=Luó Hǎixīng}}; 1949 – 14 January 2010) was a [[Hong Kong]] businessman born into a communist Hong Kong family. He was famous for rescuing Chinese dissidents in [[Operation Yellowbird]] after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], for which he was arrested in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's Message: Jailing of a Hong Kong Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/25/world/china-s-message-jailing-of-a-hong-kong-man.html?pagewanted=1|publisher=New York Times|date=1991-04-25 | first=Sheryl | last=Wudunn | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released at the request of [[British Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] in 1991.

==Biography==
Lo was born in 1949 to {{ill|Lo Fu (editor)|zh|羅孚 (作家)|lt=Lo Fu}} ({{zh|t=羅孚|labels=no}}), a communist Chinese editor of a [[Hong Kong]] newspaper.  He was raised and educated in Hong Kong and later continued his studies in the city of [[Guangzhou]], where he experienced the [[Cultural Revolution]] during the 1960s.  He later returned to Hong Kong and began working for a communist newspaper, like his father.

Lo ended his ties with the Communist Party when his father was arrested by the Chinese government. He instead began working in [[Beijing]] as the chief representative for the [[Trade Development Council]] of Hong Kong, but he resigned the post in early 1989 after seeking business opportunities in trade between Hong Kong and the PRC.

Lo was married to children's author {{ill|Chow Mat-mat|zh|周蜜蜜}} (Zhou Mimi), the daughter of the well known writer [[Huang Qingyun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/2165123/pioneer-chinese-childrens-literature-huang-ching-yuen-dies-98|title=Pioneer of Chinese children’s literature Huang Ching-yuen dies at 98|last=Ng|first=Kang-chung|date=21 September 2018|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo died in 2010 at [[Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Mary Hospital]] in [[Pok Fu Lam]] from the combined effects of a [[lung infection]], [[diabetes]], and a weaked immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=a3d2c80014d26210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD|title=Man who aided escape of mainland dissidents dies|publisher=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Defence Industry of [[Azerbaijan]]''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Respublikasının Müdafiə Sənayesi Nazirliyi}}) is a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan]] in charge of design, manufacturing, regulation and maintenance of products in the fields of defense, radio electronics, instrument engineering.

The Ministry was established on December 16, 2005 by presidential decree. The new Ministry, incorporated the [[State Departments for Military Industry]] and for [[Armaments and the Military Science Center]], each of which was formerly a separate agency within the [[Military of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani Defense Ministry]].[[Yavar Jamalov]] was in charge of heading this ministry between March 2006 – 23 June 2018. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.az/articles/politics/131950 Azerbaijani Defense Industry Minister Yavar Jamalov dies. news.az]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Azerbaijan has a desire to become a major arms exporter to the [[South Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Middle East]]. It was announced in January 2008 that the defence industry of Azerbaijan would begin to manufacture [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s, as well as small calibre artillery guns.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Monitoring Service, APA News Agency,, [http://www.un-az.org/undp/bulnews55/en3.php AZERBAIJAN TO START MANUFACTURING ARMS, MILITARY HARDWARE IN 2008], 26 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this has actually taken place is unclear. The new ministry is cooperating with the defence sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Giragosian, [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/02/2b0bdd2d-49a6-4bff-826d-05edefe4dbdb.html Azerbaijan: Baku Signals New Determination For Defense Reform], RFE/RL, February 01, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 several more military factories were created in Azerbaijan.

According to Sumarinly, the MDI has been in talks with various [[Israel]]i defense firms and two [[Turkey|Turkish]] companies about the production of an armored vehicle based on the [[Russia]]n [[T-55]] [[tank]]’s chassis. MDI will also provide 30 South-African-designed Matador and Marauder armored vehicles to the army.

==Potential future projects==
Murad Bayar, the undersecretary for Turkish Defense Industries, said that Turkey aimed to manufacture new tanks for the Turkish Armed Forces. "Some of these tanks could be manufactured in Azerbaijan, and some can be produced in Turkey, joint production with Azerbaijan in line with this country`s needs in the future." Bayar told.&lt;ref name="azmitup1"&gt;[http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=242528 Azerbaijan May Join Turkey's New Tank Manufacturing Project, Bureaucrat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijani-made prototypes of Orbiter 2M [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] are expected to undergo testing for up to two years. Full-scale production won’t begin before 2013, under the existing timetable.&lt;ref name="Abbasov"/&gt;  Production of drones has started at Azad Systems, a joint venture between Azerbaijan’s Defence Industry Ministry and Israeli manufacturer Aeronautics.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel Markets UAVs To Moslems"/&gt;

According to the Azerbaijani APA agency in November 2010, "Azerbaijan is in the negotiations with some other countries on helicopter production." - said by the Minister of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan, [[Yavar Jamalov]].

== Modernization ==
In 2011, the reconstructed instrument-making plant of the Jihaz Production Association of the Ministry of Defence Industry was opened in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.president.az/articles/1697/print|title=Официальный сайт президента Азербайджанской Республики - НОВОСТИ » Мероприятия     Ильхам Алиев принял участие в открытии Бакинского приборостроительного завода Министерства оборонной промышленности|last=President|website=ru.president.az|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the industry started its own production of short-range missiles. Approximately 125 types of products are being developed, and projects for creating air-to-ground, air-to-air, and ground-to-ground missiles are being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.rambler.ru/articles/34832560-azerbaydzhan-zamahnulsya-na-ballisticheskie-rakety/|title=Азербайджан замахнулся на баллистические ракеты|work=Рамблер/новости|access-date=2018-10-30|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2017, there was a demonstration of the national armoured vehicle “Tufan”, which is resistant to mines. About six months was spent for the development of this armoured vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mdi.gov.az/?/en/news/view/443/|title=Presentation of National Armored Vehicle “Tufan” of the Ministry of Defence Industry has been Performed|date=2017-02-14|website=www.mdi.gov.az|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{eastern name order|Zwack Péter János}}
'''Péter János Zwack''' (21 May 1927 – 5 August 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meghalt Zwack Péter|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/08/05/meghalt_zwack_peter/|publisher=[[Index.hu]]|accessdate=6 August 2012|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] businessman, investor, philanthropist, diplomat and the Hungarian Ambassador to the [[United States]] from 1990 until 1991. He was the [[CEO]] and owner of the company [[Zwack]].

==Biography==
===In emigration===
Zwack was born into a prominent family which owned the [[Zwack]] PLC. During [[World War II]] Budapest and the Zwack factory were completely destroyed. After the war, in 1948 the new Communist regime nationalized the factory. The Zwack family fled the country. János Zwack with his son Péter, great grandson of József Zwack, the founder of the factory, was able to escape with the original Zwack recipe in his pocket. Béla Zwack remained behind to give the communist government a "fake" Zwack recipe and went on to become a regular factory worker.

Meanwhile, János and Péter migrated to the [[United States]] and after several months in [[Ellis Island]]'s refugee camp were granted US entry purely because they possessed the Zwack recipe. They later settled in the [[Bronx]] in 1949 when Péter was 22 years old. It was in the U.S. that Péter learned all the ins and outs of the spirits industry.

Together with [[Tibor Eckhardt]] he founded a charity named ''First Aid for Hungary'' in 1956 which helped the refugees of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].

===Political career in Hungary===
Zwack became chairman of the [[Entrepreneurs' Party]] in 1992. Two years later he made an electoral alliance with [[SZDSZ]], [[Fidesz]] and the [[Agrarian Alliance]], according to which he was the joint candidate of the four parties in [[Kecskemét]] during the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1994|1994 Hungarian parliamentary election]]. He won a seat to the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] as the only independent MP. He resigned from his party leader position in 1995. Between 1995 and 1997 he was a member of the Kossuth Prize and Széchenyi Prize Committee.

During the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 Hungarian parliamentary election]] he was supported by SZDSZ but he did not repeat his success four years ago. After that he joined to SZDSZ. In 1999 he became a member of the party's leadership. He was one of the party's chargé d'affaires from 2000 to 2003. In 2002 he was elected to a member of the parliament again but he resigned half years later.

===Death===
Zwack died in [[Italy]] on 5 August 2012 at the age of 85.

'''Salvador María del Carril''' (August 5, 1798{{spaced ndash}}January 10, 1883) was a prominent Argentine jurist and policy-maker, as well as his country's first Vice President

==Life and times==

===Early life===
Born in the [[Andes]]-range city of [[San Juan, Argentina]], del Carril was a precocious student, and enrolled in the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|University of Córdoba]] Law School while still in his teens. Mentored by the school's prestigious ecclesiastical Dean, [[Gregorio Funes]], del Carril received a ''[[juris doctor]]'' in 1816, at age 18. He relocated to [[Buenos Aires]], the capital of the newly declared [[United Provinces of South America]], and following a stint as a journalist, he was appointed as an official in the Finance Ministry.

General [[José María Pérez de Urdininea]], Governor of his native [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan Province]] (which had recently seceded from [[Mendoza Province]]), called on del Carril to replace [[Francisco Narciso de Laprida]] as his Minister of Government in 1822, the highest-ranking advisory position. Amid the turmoil surrounding the [[Argentine War of Independence]], however, Pérez de Urdininea was returned to active duty in [[Bolivia]] by General [[José de San Martín]], leaving del Carril as Governor of San Juan.&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina.'' London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of San Juan===
Taking office in January 1823, the 24-year-old Governor undertook an ambitious modernization program, commissioning the construction of roads, bridges, water works, public buildings and parks, purchasing the province's first [[printing press]], and establishing San Juan's first newspaper. Inheriting a province devastated by the wars, he ordered the first Agricultural Census and created a charitable association. The first lawyer to occupy the governor's post, he established San Juan's [[judicial system]] and in 1825, promulgated the "May Charter," the province's first [[constitution]].

The liberal May Charter, the first in Argentina to guarantee [[freedom of worship]] and mandate the [[separation of church and state]], also forced the closure of monasteries, and ran into arduous opposition from the [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Catholic Church]]. Facing a firestorm of protest, the governor was overthrown on July 26, and the May Charter was publicly burned.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

===National policy-maker===

Del Carril's efforts, however, had gained him the respect of the influential [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], a Buenos Aires lawmaker who, in 1826, was elected the first [[President of Argentina]], and who appointed del Carril Argentina's first Finance Minister. Saddled by the [[Cisplatine War]], the nation's finances became dependent on credit from [[Baring Brothers]] in [[London]], and del Carril offered the nation's exports as collateral. His introduction of the [[Argentine peso fuerte]] - the first local currency [[gold standard|convertible into gold]], and the first in Argentina with that name - concentrated wealth into exporters and others with access to [[hard currency]], making peso circulation scarce for the public in general and the war more difficult to finance. Rivadavia's [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|National Bank]] was mismanaged under del Carril, additionally, and unrest resulted in President Rivadavia's resignation in 1827.

The dissolution of national government ensued within months, in favor of an [[Argentine Confederation]]. The advent of the populist Governor of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Manuel Dorrego]], was opposed by del Carril, who became an adviser to a conservative insurrection led by General [[Juan Lavalle]]. Lavalle's violent 1828 overthrow of Dorrego returned del Carril to the cabinet as Finance and [[Foreign relations of Argentina|Foreign Minister]]. A countercoup led by General [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], a supporter of Dorrego's, forced Lavalle to call elections, though del Carril's manipulation of the results triggered Rosas' overthrow and del Carril's subsequent exile in [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;Levene, Ricardo.

===Exile and return===
Del Carril remained an active opponent of Rosas' while in exile, supporting a failed 1830 invasion of [[Entre Ríos Province]] and negotiating an entente with the Governor of [[Corrientes Province]]. He struggled financially, however, though these diffulties were mitigated by his meeting Tiburcia Domínguez y López Camelo, whom he married and had seven children with. Rosas' grasp on power began to slip after the 1838 [[blockade]] imposed by [[Louis-Philippe|France]] following the death of a French journalist in Buenos Aires, and del Carril was named Supply Commissioner to the [[French Navy]] fleet stationed in the [[Río de la Plata]]. His tenure in the post attracted controversy, however, when he became conspicuously wealthy in the process.

The 1843 overthrow of his ally, President [[Fructuoso Rivera]] of [[Uruguay]], forced del Carril yet again into exile, and he fled to [[Brazil]]. He cultivated a friendship via corrspondence with the powerful Governor of Entre Ríos, [[Justo José de Urquiza]], in subsequent years, and following the latter's defeat of Rosas' forces in the 1852 [[Battle of Caseros]], del Carril returned to Argentina.&lt;ref name=lopez&gt;López, Vicente Fidel. ''Historia de la República Argentina''. Buenos Aires: Sopena, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice Presidency===

Del Carril was elected to the assembly that approved the 1853 [[Argentine Constitution]]. Enmities remaining from the Rosas era thwarted an opportunity to return to the Governor's post in San Juan, however, and despite his personal efforts, Buenos Aires lawmakers rejected the new constitution. His belonging to the Buenos Aires-centric [[Unitarian Party]] and rapport with Urquiza (whom Buenos Aires distrusted) made del Carril an easy choice for the latter's running-mate in the elections that November, however, and their national unity ticket was elected handily in the [[electoral college]].

President Urquiza took care to preserve balance in his government between the two camps, placing the Vice President as a counterweight to the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalist]] Interior Minister ([[Home Secretary]]), [[Santiago Derqui]]. Del Carril became the most prominent voice for Buenos Aires interests in the administration, and compounded with a falling-out with erstwhile allies in his native San Juan Province, this ultimately frustrated his hopes that Urquiza might support his 1860 presidential candidacy (support which was tantamount to victory).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Nominating Derqui instead, Urquiza's choice led to renewed conflict with Buenos Aires, and to Derqui's resignation and exile in 1861.  National unity on the brink, del Carril negotiated a settlement between Urquiza and the leader of the Buenos Aires insurrection, General [[Bartolomé Mitre]], and when the latter was elected President the following September, del Carril was appointed to the [[Argentine Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt; 
[[File:Recoleta 087.jpg|thumb|A memorial to del Carril sits atop his Recoleta crypt]]

Del Carril was a conservative justice, and reliably voted in favor of the executive's frequent use of [[state of siege]] declarations and [[capital punishment]]. This record helped him secure an appointment as Chief Justice in 1870 by Mitre's supporter and successor, President [[Domingo Sarmiento]], and an uneventful tenure ended with his retirement in 1877. He was again in the spotlight, however, after the 1881 publication by historian Ángel Carranza of correspondence between del Carril and Lavalle during the 1828 coup. The letters revealed that del Carril pressed for the duly-elected Governor Dorrego's execution, advising Lavalle that claims of a fair trial should be concocted, adding that ''"if we should need to lie to posterity, we lie."'' The former Vice President lived afterwards in seclusion, and died in his Buenos Aires home in 1883, at age 84.&lt;ref name=lopez/&gt;

===Epilogue===

Del Carril became a wealthy man, and in later life owned over 130,000 hectares (330,000 acres) of land in the agriculturally productive [[La Pampa Province]] (worth around a million dollars, at the time).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Debts incurred by his wife's spending habits strained the marriage, however, and the seasoned lawyer obtained a discharge of his responsibility for their repayment (leaving the debts in her name, solely). The couple subsequently separated, and after the judge's 1883 burial in an ornate [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] crypt, Mrs. del Carril commissioned the grave's sculptor, Camilo Romairone, to create a bust of her likeness - with its back turned towards that of her husband's; she died in 1898.

'''Sherin Naiken''' (born March 30, 1984) is a Seychellois [[economist]] and [[Financial management|finance expert]]. She is the [[chief executive officer]] of the [[Seychelles Tourism Board]], since July 1, 2013. Under her leadership, tourism has increased with specific campaigns targeting markets such as the United Kingdom.

==Early life and education==
Naiken was born and grew up in the [[Anse Royale]] administrative district of [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]], Seychelles, where she completed her early education.&lt;ref name="sn"/&gt; She holds a B.Sc degree in Economics and Business Studies from the [[University of Manchester]], [[United Kingdom|U.K]]; and an M.Sc degree in [[Finance]] from the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pfsr.org/news/sherin-naiken-the-ceo-of-the-seychelles-tourism-board-and-mother-of-two-qualifies-with-a-master-of-science-in-finance/|title=Sherin Naiken, the CEO of the Seychelles Tourism Board and mother of two qualifies with a Master of Science in Finance|work=Seychelles Ministry of Tourism and Culture|date=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She started her career in 2006 at the Ministry of National Development as an industrial officer before she rose through the ranks to become director of investment promotion.&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.sc/article.html?id=250550|title=Up Close … with Sherin Naiken|work=[[Seychelles Nation]]|date=9 August 2016|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, she was appointed CEO of the [[Seychelles Tourism Board]], succeeding Elsia Grandcourt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seychelles.travel/en/newsletter/609-e-newsletter-issue-76-76/seychelles-tourism-board-76-183/4050-sherin-naiken-appointed-new-chief-executive-of-seychelles-tourism-board-sherin-naiken-appointed-new-chief-executive-of-seychelles-tourism-board|title=Sherin Naiken Appointed New Chief Executive Of Seychelles Tourist Board|work=Seychelles Travel|date=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, she remained upbeat about the tourism prospect of the islands, attributing the economic reforms of the government for the increase of visitors early in the year, particularly from the UK and France. She also linked this with a marketing drive executed under her leadership of the tourism board, with the campaign "luxury within reach" targeting potential visitors in the UK. To further promote this work, she appeared in interviews with the [[BBC]], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meriton-Jean|first1=Sharon|title=Seychelles Tourism Board CEO live on CNN: Hint of recovery in European tourism arrivals to the islands|url=http://www.seychellesnewsagency.com/articles/2525/Seychelles+Tourism+Board+CEO+live+on+CNN+Hint+of+recovery+in+European+tourism+arrivals+to+the+islands|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Seychelles News Agency|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Retail shrink.jpg|thumb|right|Items lost to shrinkage]]
In accounting, '''inventory shrinkage''' (sometimes shortened to '''shrinkage''' or '''shrink''') is when a retailer has fewer items in stock than in the inventory list due to clerical error or goods being damaged, lost, or stolen between the point of manufacture (or purchase from a supplier) and the [[point of sale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Wal-Mart Is Getting Hit Hard by Thieves: The problem of shrinkage|first1=Kyle|last1=Stock|first2=Shannon|last2=Pettypiece|date=August 18, 2015|magazine=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-18/wal-mart-is-getting-hit-hard-by-thieves|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects profit: if  shrinkage is large, profits decrease. This leads retailers to increase prices to make up for losses, passing the cost of shrinkage onto customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Here's how much Walmart loses every year to theft|first=Chris|last=Matthews|date=June 5, 2015|magazine=Fortune|url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/05/walmart-theft/|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}{{Citation needed|reason=This article does not say prices are raised to make up shrinkage|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the retail industry in the United States experienced shrinkage rates of around 1.52% of sales.&lt;ref name="National Retail Security Survey 2009"&gt;''National Retail Security Survey'' (2009) University of Florida{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, retailers in Europe and Asia Pacific reported average shrinkage of about 1.27% and 1.20% of sales, respectively.&lt;ref name="Global Retail Theft Barometer 2008"&gt;''Global Retail Theft Barometer 2008''{{full|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
According to the 2008 National Retail Security Survey conducted at the University of Florida shrinkage rate of 1.51% translates into $36.3 billion in annual loss ($15.5 billion to employee theft and $12.9 billion to shoplifters). [[Theft]], both internal and external to the company, continues to be the driving force behind retail inventory shrinkage, at 78.3% of all shrinkage in 2008. Of that portion, 42.7% is attributed to employee (also known as internal) [[theft]] and 35.6% was due to external theft, known as [[shoplifting]].

The prevention of this type of shrinkage is one reason for [[security guard]]s, [[IP camera|cameras]] and [[security tag]]s. Other causes of shrinkage include:
* Administrative errors such as shipping errors, warehouse discrepancies, and misplaced goods.
* Cashier or price-check errors in the customer's favour.
* Damage in transit or in the store.
* Paperwork errors.
* Perishable goods not sold within their [[shelf life]].
* Vendor fraud.

===Loss at the POS terminal===
Shrinkage in retail that is caused by employee actions typically occurs at the [[point of sale]] (POS) terminal. There are different ways to manipulate a POS system, such as a cashier giving customers unauthorized discounts, creating fraudulent returns, or simply removing cash from the register. These transactions that differ from normal transactions are called POS exceptions. Traditionally POS fraud is fought by surveillance staff monitoring a POS terminal or by manually searching in surveillance video recordings. Modern POS systems can have automatic alerts when specific exceptions are detected. Also exception reports and listings based on employees, refunds, [[price override]]s, terminals etc. are possible to detect with modern systems. Modern networked based POS systems can also include network video to POS exception listings, giving quick access to detailed information of what has happened.

In the United States the National Retail Security Survey is published annually as part of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101021072459/http://soccrim.clas.ufl.edu/criminology/srp/srp.html Security Research Project] at the [[University of Florida]].  The Security Research Project endeavors to study various elements of workplace related crime and deviance with a special emphasis on the retail industry.  Since theft is hidden, no study can be completely accurate.

Inventory management systems allow for better control over inventory and will inform companies of the source of the inventory shrinkage, saving costs associated with stock-outs or excess inventory.

Shrinkage figures can be calculated by:
* Beginning Inventory + Purchases − (Sales + Adjustments) = Booked (Invoiced) Inventory
* Booked Inventory − Physical Counted Inventory = Shrinkage
* Shrinkage/Total Sales x 100 = Shrinkage Percent

'''System dynamics''' ('''SD''') is an approach to understanding the [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] behaviour of [[complex system]]s over time using [[Stock and flow|stocks, flows]], internal [[feedback loop]]s, table functions and time delays.&lt;ref&gt;Abidin N, Z., Mamat M, Dangerfield B, Zulkepli JH, Baten MA, et al.

==Overview==
System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the 1950s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes, SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

Convenient [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the 1990s and have been applied to diverse systems. SD models solve the problem of simultaneity (mutual causation) by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control. The best known SD model is probably the 1972 ''[[The Limits to Growth]]''. This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital, with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays, would lead to economic collapse during the 21st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios.

System dynamics is an aspect of [[systems theory]] as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system, the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components, is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are [[chaos theory]] and [[social dynamics]]. It is also claimed that because there are often properties-of-the-whole which cannot be found among the properties-of-the-elements, in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts.

==History==
System dynamics was created during the mid-1950s&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay (1971). Counterintuitive behavior of social systems. Technology Review 73(3): 52–68&lt;/ref&gt; by Professor [[Jay Forrester]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1956, Forrester accepted a professorship in the newly formed [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. His initial goal was to determine how his background in science and engineering could be brought to bear, in some useful way, on the core issues that determine the success or failure of corporations. Forrester's insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering, which led to the creation of system dynamics, were triggered, to a large degree, by his involvement with managers at [[General Electric]] (GE) during the mid-1950s. At that time, the managers at GE were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in Kentucky exhibited a significant three-year cycle. The [[business cycle]] was judged to be an insufficient explanation for the employment instability. From hand simulations (or calculations) of the stock-flow-feedback structure of the GE plants, which included the existing corporate decision-making structure for hiring and layoffs, Forrester was able to show how the instability in GE employment was due to the internal structure of the firm and not to an external force such as the business cycle. These hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics.&lt;ref name="UDE"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Origin of System Dynamics: Jay W. Forrester and the History of System Dynamics"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''. Retrieved 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal [[computer modeling]] stage. [[Richard Bennett (computer scientist)|Richard Bennett]] created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE (Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations) in the spring of 1958. In 1959, [[Phyllis Fox]] and [[Alexander Pugh]] wrote the first version of
[[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]] (DYNAmic MOdels), an improved version of SIMPLE, and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first, and still classic, book in the field titled ''Industrial Dynamics'' in 1961.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

From the late 1950s to the late 1960s, system dynamics was applied almost exclusively to corporate/managerial problems. In 1968, however, an unexpected occurrence caused the field to broaden beyond corporate modeling. [[John F. Collins]], the former mayor of Boston, was appointed a visiting professor of Urban Affairs at MIT. The result of the Collins-Forrester collaboration was a book titled ''Urban Dynamics''. The [[Urban Dynamics]] model presented in the book was the first major non-corporate application of system dynamics.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

The second major noncorporate application of system dynamics came shortly after the first. In 1970, Jay Forrester was invited by the [[Club of Rome]] to a meeting in Bern, Switzerland. The Club of Rome is an organization devoted to solving what its members describe as the "predicament of mankind"—that is, the global crisis that may appear sometime in the future, due to the demands being placed on the Earth's [[carrying capacity]] (its sources of renewable and nonrenewable resources and its sinks for the disposal of pollutants) by the world's exponentially growing population. At the Bern meeting, Forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind. His answer, of course, was that it could. On the plane back from the Bern meeting, Forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world's socioeconomic system. He called this model WORLD1. Upon his return to the United States, Forrester refined WORLD1 in preparation for a visit to MIT by members of the Club of Rome. Forrester called the refined version of the model WORLD2. Forrester published WORLD2 in a book titled [[World Dynamics]].&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

==Topics in systems dynamics==
The elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback, accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays.

As an illustration of the use of system dynamics, imagine an organisation that plans to introduce an innovative new durable consumer product.  The organisation needs to understand the possible [[market dynamics]] in order to design marketing and production plans.

===Causal loop diagrams===
{{Main article|Causal loop diagram}}
In the system dynamics methodology, a problem or a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) may be represented as a [[causal loop diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. (2000). Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World. New York: McGraw&lt;/ref&gt; A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system’s behavior over a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Donella. (2008). Thinking in Systems: A Primer. Earthscan&lt;/ref&gt;

The causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows:

[[Image:Adoption CLD.svg|centre|Causal loop diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

There are two feedback loops in this diagram.  The positive reinforcement (labeled R) loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product, the stronger the word-of-mouth impact.  There will be more references to the product, more demonstrations, and more reviews.  This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow.

The second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement (or "balancing" and hence labeled B).  Clearly, growth cannot continue forever, because as more and more people adopt, there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters.

Both feedback loops act simultaneously, but at different times they may have different strengths.  Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years, and then declining sales in the later years. However, in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G. P. (1986), Problems with causal-loop diagrams. Syst. Dyn. Rev., 2: 158–170. doi:10.1002/sdr.4260020207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock and flow diagrams===
{{Main article|Stock and flow}}
Causal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system’s structure and behavior, and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a causal loop diagram is transformed to a [[stock and flow]] diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way; such models are usually built and simulated using computer software.

A stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time.  A flow is the rate of change in a stock.

[[Image:Simple stock and flow diagram.gif|centre|frame|A flow is the rate of accumulation of the stock]]

In our example, there are two stocks: Potential adopters and Adopters.  There is one flow: New adopters.  For every new adopter, the stock of potential adopters declines by one, and the stock of adopters increases by one.

[[Image:Adoption SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

===Equations===
The real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation.  Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a [[spreadsheet]], there are a [[Comparison of system dynamics software|variety of software]] packages that have been optimised for this.

The steps involved in a simulation are:

*Define the problem boundary
*Identify the most important stocks and flows that change these stock levels
*Identify sources of information that impact the flows
*Identify the main feedback loops
*Draw a causal loop diagram that links the stocks, flows and sources of information
*Write the equations that determine the flows
*Estimate the parameters and initial conditions.  These can be estimated using statistical methods, expert opinion, market research data or other relevant sources of information.&lt;ref name="Sterman2001CMR"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sterman |first=John D. |year=2001 |month= |title=System dynamics modeling: Tools for learning in a complex world |journal=California management review |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=8–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simulate the model and analyse results.

In this example, the equations that change the two stocks via the flow are:

 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Potential adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{-New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't want to mark up this great contribution, but shouldn't this be something like potential adopters at t(0) - sum(new adopters at t(i))? Yes --&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

===Equations in discrete time===
List of all the equations in [[discrete time]], in their order of execution in each year, for years 1 to 15 :

 &lt;math&gt;1) \ \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}=\mbox{Potential adopters} / (\mbox{Potential adopters } + \mbox{ Adopters}) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;2) \ \mbox{Imitators}=q \cdot \mbox{Adopters} \cdot \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;3) \ \mbox{Innovators}=p \cdot \mbox{Potential adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4) \ \mbox{New adopters}=\mbox{Innovators}+\mbox{Imitators} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\ p=0.03 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ q=0.4 &lt;/math&gt;

====Dynamic simulation results====
The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in ''adopters'' that follows a classic s-curve shape.&lt;br /&gt;
The increase in ''adopters'' is very slow initially, then exponential growth for a period, followed ultimately by saturation.

===Equations in continuous time===
To get intermediate values and better accuracy, the model can run in continuous time: we multiply the number of units of time and we proportionally divide values that change stock levels. In this example we multiply the 15 years by 4 to obtain 60 trimesters, and we divide the value of the flow by 4.&lt;br&gt;
Dividing the value is the simplest with the [[Euler method]], but other methods could be employed instead, such as [[Runge–Kutta methods]].

List of the equations in continuous time for trimesters = 1 to 60 :
*They are the same equations as in the section ''Equation in discrete time'' above, except equations ''4.1'' and ''4.2'' replaced by following :
 &lt;math&gt;10) \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters} \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{Valve New adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{Valve New adopters } &lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; \ TimeStep = 1/4 &lt;/math&gt;

*In the below stock and flow diagram, the intermediate flow 'Valve New adopters' calculates the equation :
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters } \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Adaption SFD continuous time.png|centre|Dynamic stock and flow diagram of ''New product adoption'' model in continuous time|frame]]

==Application==
System dynamics has found application in a wide range of areas, for example [[Population dynamics|population]], agriculture&lt;ref&gt;F. H. A. Rahim, N. N. Hawari and N. Z. Abidin, “Supply and demand of rice in Malaysia: A system dynamics approach”, International Journal of Supply Chain and Management, Vol.6, No.4, pp. 234-240, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ecosystem model|ecological]] and [[Economics|economic]] systems, which usually interact strongly with each other.

System dynamics have various "back of the envelope" management applications. They are a potent tool to:
*Teach [[system thinking]] reflexes to persons being coached
*Analyze and compare assumptions and [[mental model]]s about the way things work
*Gain qualitative insight into the workings of a system or the consequences of a decision
*Recognize archetypes of dysfunctional systems in everyday practice

Computer software is used to [[computer simulation|simulate]] a system dynamics [[model (abstract)|model]] of the situation being studied. Running "what if" simulations to test certain policies on such a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time.  System dynamics is very similar to [[systems thinking]] and constructs the same [[causal loop diagram]]s of systems with feedback.  However, system dynamics typically goes further and utilises simulation to study the behaviour of systems and the impact of alternative policies.&lt;ref name="SysDynSociety"&gt;[http://www.systemdynamics.org/ System Dynamics Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

System dynamics has been used to investigate resource dependencies, and resulting problems, in product development.&lt;ref name="Repenning:2001kx"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Repenning |first=Nelson P. |year=2001 |month= |title= Understanding fire fighting in new product development |journal= The Journal of Product Innovation Management |volume= 18 |issue=5|pages= 285–300|doi= 10.1016/S0737-6782(01)00099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Repenning:1999ng"&gt;Nelson P. Repenning (1999). ''Resource dependence in product development improvement efforts'', [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] Department of Operations Management/System Dynamics Group, Dec 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A system dynamics approach to  [[macroeconomics]], known as ''[[Minsky (economic simulator)|Minsky]]'',  has been developed by the economist [[Steve Keen]].&lt;ref name="SForge"&gt;&amp;nbsp;[http://sourceforge.net/blog/january-2014-potm/&amp;nbsp;SourceForge]&amp;nbsp;Minsky&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Project of the month January 2014. Interview with Minsky development team. Accessed January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used to successfully model world economic behaviour from the apparent stability of the [[Great Moderation]] to the sudden unexpected [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]].

===Example===
[[Image:Causal Loop Diagram of a Model.png|thumb|600px|center|Causal loop diagram of a model examining the growth or decline of a life insurance company.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"/&gt;]]

The figure above is a causal loop diagram of a system dynamics model created to examine forces that may be responsible for the growth or decline of [[life insurance]] companies in the [[United Kingdom]]. A number of this figure's features are worth mentioning. The first is that the model's negative feedback loops are identified by ''C's'', which stand for ''Counteracting'' loops. The second is that double slashes are used to indicate places where there is a significant delay between causes (i.e., variables at the tails of arrows) and effects (i.e., variables at the heads of arrows). This is a common causal loop diagramming convention in system dynamics. Third, is that thicker lines are used to identify the feedback loops and links that author wishes the audience to focus on. This is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention. Last, it is clear that a decision maker would find it impossible to think through the dynamic behavior inherent in the model, from inspection of the figure alone.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Feedback"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''.

=== Example of piston motion ===
# Objective: study of a crank-connecting rod system.&lt;br /&gt; We want to model a crank-connecting rod system through a system dynamic model. Two different full descriptions of the physical system with related systems of equations can be found  [[Piston motion equations#Position|here]] {{en icon}} and [[:fr:Système bielle-manivelle#Équations horaires|here]] {{fr icon}}; they give the same results. In this example, the crank, with variable radius and angular frequency, will drive a piston with a variable connecting rod length.
# System dynamic modeling: the system is now modeled, according to a stock and flow system dynamic logic.&lt;br /&gt; The figure below shows the stock and flow diagram [[Image:TRUE Piston SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram for crank-connecting rod system|frame]]
# Simulation: the behavior of the crank-connecting rod dynamic system can then be simulated.&lt;br /&gt; The next figure is a 3D simulation created using [[procedural animation]]. Variables of the model animate all parts of this animation: crank, radius, angular frequency, rod length, and piston position.

'''Walter Haefner''' (13 September 1910 &amp;ndash; 19 June 2012) was a Swiss businessman and a [[thoroughbred]] racehorse owner and breeder in Ireland.

As a young man Haefner went to work in the auto industry as an employee of the Swiss division of [[General Motors|General Motors Corporation]]. He eventually moved to England where he acquired an automobile franchise before returning home to open a [[Volkswagen]] dealership. Recognizing the important role a computer could play in his growing chain of dealerships, in 1957 Haefner became one of the first in Switzerland to import an [[IBM]] system for business use. This led to his 1964 creation of Automation Center A.G., a computer services company in [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/06/20/feat.html|title=Cashing in on Computer Software in Switzerland and the U.S.|last=Orol|first=Ron|publisher=[[Forbes|Forbes.com]]|date=20 June 2000|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he expanded operations to the US and, after merging his company with [[Russell Artzt]]'s and [[Charles Wang]]'s publicly owned software company, [[CA Technologies|Computer Associates International, Inc.]], in 1987, Haefner was CA's largest individual shareholder until his death. He continued to own [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren]], a highly successful Swiss automobile dealership chain. Until his death, at age 101, he was the oldest person worth more than a billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_The-Worlds-Billionaires_Age_40.html|title=The World's Billionaires (sorted by age)|page=40|publisher=Forbes.com|date=10 March 2010|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moyglare Stud Farm==
In 1962 Haefner purchased the {{convert|440|acre|km2|sing=on}} Moyglare Stud Farm near the town of [[Maynooth]], [[County Kildare]], Ireland. His [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]] have won numerous [[Group One]] and [[British Classic Races]] in England, Ireland, and France as well as important races at other venues in Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong.

In the United States Moyglare's racing stable was handled by [[Horse trainer|trainer]] [[Christophe Clement]] while [[Dermot K. Weld]] is the trainer in charge of its European operations. In 1991 Weld became the first European-based trainer to win a race in Hong Kong when Moyglare's colt [[Additional Risk]] won the [[Hong Kong Mile|Hong Kong Invitational Bowl]] at [[Sha Tin Racecourse]].

In 1975 the [[Curragh Racecourse]] honored Moyglare's contribution to Irish racing by naming a Group I race the [[Moyglare Stud Stakes]]. In 1988 [[Trinity College, Dublin]] awarded Haefner an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] doctorate for his services to the Irish bloodstock industry and for his contributions to education in Ireland.

'''Yulia Volodymyrivna Tymoshenko''' ({{lang-uk|Ю́лія Володи́мирівна Тимоше́нко}}, {{IPA-uk|ˈjulʲijɐ voɫoˈdɪmɪrʲivnɐ tɪmoˈʃɛnko|pron}}; born '''Hrihyan''', Грігян,&lt;ref name=Grigyan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCJpAAAAMAAJ An orange revolution: a personal journey through Ukrainian history] by [[Askold Krushelnycky]], [[Harvill Secker]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-436-20623-8}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 27 November 1960) is a Ukrainian politician.

She is the leader of the [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]] political party. She strives for Ukraine's integration into the [[European Union]] and strongly opposes the membership of Ukraine in the [[Eurasian Customs Union]]. She supports [[NATO]] membership for Ukraine.

Tymoshenko co-led the [[Orange Revolution]] and was the first woman appointed [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]], serving from 24 January to 8 September 2005, and again from 18 December 2007 to 4 March 2010. She placed third in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women#2005 (top 10 selection)|list of the world's most powerful women]] in 2005.

She finished second in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|Ukrainian presidential election of 2010]] runoff, losing by 3.5 percentage points to the winner, [[Viktor Yanukovych]].

After the 2010 presidential election, a number of [[Criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko since 2010|criminal cases]] were brought against her. In 2011, she was convicted of [[embezzlement]] and abuse of power, and sentenced to seven years in prison. The prosecution and conviction were viewed as politically biased by many western governments. She was released in 2014, in the concluding days of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Euromaidan revolution]], and then rehabilitated. In the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election]], she received 12.8% of the vote, coming in second place after [[Petro Poroshenko]] who won the election.

Yulia's paternal grandfather, Abram Kapitelman ({{lang-uk|Абрам Кельманович Капітельман}}), was born in 1914. After graduating from [[Dnipropetrovsk State University]] in 1940, Kapitelman was sent to work in [[Western Ukraine]], where he worked "one academic quarter" as the director of a public Jewish school in the city [[Sniatyn]].&lt;ref name="mak-info"/&gt; Kapitelman was mobilized into the army in the autumn of 1940 and subsequently was killed while taking part in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War (1941–1945)]] on 8 November 1944, with the rank of "lieutenant" in [[Signal corps]].&lt;ref name="mak-info"/&gt;

===Commercial career===
Tymoshenko has worked as a practicing economist and academic. Prior to her political career, she became a successful but controversial businesswoman in the [[Natural gas|gas]] industry, becoming by some estimates one of the richest people in the country. Before becoming Ukraine's first female prime minister in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/9/23/202629.shtml|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604215457/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/9/23/202629.shtml|archivedate= 4 June 2011 |title= Ukraine's First Woman Prime Minister |publisher=Archive.newsmax.com |date=24 September 2005 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tymoshenko co-led the [[Orange Revolution]].&lt;ref name="BBCprofile"&gt;[[#BBCprofile|BBC News profile]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was placed third in [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women#2005 (top 10 selection)|''Forbes'' magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women 2005]].&lt;ref name="forbes05" /&gt;

After graduating from the Dnipropetrovsk State University in 1984, Tymoshenko worked as an engineer-economist in the "Dnipro Machine-Building Plant" (which produced missiles) in Dnipropetrovsk until 1988.&lt;ref name=beginnings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurasianhome.org/xml/t/databases.xml?lang=en&amp;nic=databases&amp;country=188&amp;letter=all&amp;person=478|title=Eurasian Home Databases - Personalities - Tymoshenko Yuliya Volodymyrivna|work=eurasianhome.org|date=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303072454/http://eurasianhome.org/xml/t/databases.xml?lang=en&amp;nic=databases&amp;country=188&amp;letter=all&amp;person=478|archivedate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, as part of the ''[[perestroika]]'' initiatives, Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko borrowed 5000 [[Soviet rubles]] and opened a video-rental cooperative, perhaps with the help of Oleksander's father, Gennadi Tymoshenko, who presided over a regional film-distribution network in the provincial council.&lt;ref name=d2000&gt;{{cite web|url= http://2000.net.ua/2000/svoboda-slova/realii/71218|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111003121331/http://2000.net.ua/2000/svoboda-slova/realii/71218|archivedate= 3 October 2011 |title= Alexander Fidel.

From 1989 to 1991, Yulia and [[Oleksandr Tymoshenko]] founded and led a commercial [[video rental shop|video-rental]] company "Terminal" in Dnipropetrovsk,&lt;ref name=d2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="tymoshenko.com.ua"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Tymoshenko_Profile/1291005.html Ukraine's Gold-Plaited Comeback Kid], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (23 September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Tymoshenko established (jointly with her husband Oleksandr, Gennadi Tymoshenko, and Olexandr Gravets)&lt;ref name=d2000/&gt; "The Ukrainian Petrol Corporation", a company that supplied the agriculture industry of Dnipropetrovsk with fuel from 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name=beginnings/&gt; Tymoshenko worked as a general director.

From late December 1999 to January 2001, Tymoshenko was the Deputy Prime Minister for the fuel and energy sector in the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet]] of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].&lt;ref name="LushnyckyRiabchuk2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrej N.

In 2000, Tymoshenko's government provided an additional 18&amp;nbsp;billion Hryvna for social payments. Half of this amount was collected due to withdrawal of funds from shadow schemes, the ban on barter payments and the introduction of competition rules to the energy market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MARY MYCIO  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/09/news/mn-23176 |title=Ukraine's Deputy Premier May Be Out, but She's Not Down |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=9 February 2001 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 2000, [[Oleksandr Tymoshenko]], CEO of United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU) and Yulia Tymoshenko's husband, was detained and arrested.

===Campaigns against Kuchma and 2002 election===
On 9 February 2001, Tymoshenko founded the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] (the National Salvation Committee merged into it),&lt;ref name=Europe/&gt; a political bloc that received 7.2% of the vote in the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]]. She has been head of the [[All-Ukrainian Union Fatherland|Batkivshchina]] (Fatherland) political party since the party was organised in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://batkivshchyna.te.ua/?page=history Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2001, Tymoshenko was arrested and charged with forging customs documents and smuggling gas in 1997 (while president of [[United Energy Systems of Ukraine]]).&lt;ref name="beginnings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Europe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B3bwDpegCCYC&amp;pg=PA549 The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century: the Baltic and European states in transition] by Ian Jeffries, {{ISBN|978-0-415-25230-0}} (2004), p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt; Her political supporters organized numerous protest rallies near the [[Lukyanivska Prison]] where she was held in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2001/02/19/2981921/ Пристрасті за українською Жанною д'Арк], [[Ukrainska Pravda]] (19 February 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2001, Pechersk District Court (Kiev) found the charges groundless and cancelled the arrest sanction. According to Tymoshenko, the charges were fabricated by Kuchma's regime at the behest of oligarchs threatened by her efforts to eradicate corruption and institute market-based reforms. On 9 April 2003, the Kiev Court of Appeal issued a ruling that invalidated and cancelled proceedings on the criminal cases against Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko. Despite Tymoshenko being cleared of the charges, Moscow maintained an arrest warrant for her should she enter Russia.  In 2005, all charges were declared groundless and lifted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-ukraine-tymoshenko-analysis-idUSTRE4940GP20081005 ANALYSIS-Russia finds unlikely ally in Ukraine's Tymoshenko], [[Reuters]] (5 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2005/09/26/arrest-warrant-lifted-on-tymoshenko/ Arrest warrant lifted on Tymoshenko], [[Euronews]] (26 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the charges were dropped, Tymoshenko reassumed her place among the leaders of the grassroots [[Ukraine without Kuchma|campaign against President Kuchma]] for his alleged role in the murder of the journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]]. In this campaign, Tymoshenko first became known as a passionate, revolutionist leader, an example of this being a TV broadcast of her smashing prison windows during one of the rallies. At the time, Tymoshenko wanted to organise a national referendum to [[impeach]] President Kuchma.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Jeffries (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3bwDpegCCYC&amp;pg=PA549 The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century: the Baltic and European states in transition], {{ISBN|978-0-415-25230-0}}, p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the Orange Revolution===
[[File:Timoshenko-bez-kosy.JPG|thumb|Yulia Tymoshenko]]
In the Autumn of 2001, both Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko attempted to create a broad opposition bloc against the incumbent president, [[Leonid Kuchma]], in order to win the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Ukrainian presidential election of 2004]].&lt;ref name="Motherland"/&gt;

In late 2002, Tymoshenko, [[Oleksandr Moroz]] ([[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]), [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[Communist Party of Ukraine]]) and Viktor Yushchenko ([[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]) issued a joint statement concerning "the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine". In the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, the communist party stepped out of the alliance, but the other parties remained allied and Symonenko was against a single candidate from the alliance&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&amp;pg=PA117 Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], [[M.

In March 2004, Tymoshenko announced that leaders of "Our Ukraine", BYuT and [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] were working on a coalition agreement concerning joint participation in the presidential campaign. Tymoshenko decided not to run for president and give way to [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. On 2 July 2004, Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the ''Force of the people'', a coalition which aimed to stop "the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine."  The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko should win the October 2004 presidential election. Tymoshenko was actively campaigning for Yushchenko, touring and taking part in rallies all over Ukraine. After Viktor Yushchenko had dropped out of the campaign due to his mysterious poisoning, Tymoshenko continued campaigning on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2009/12/11/162738.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708110747/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2009/12/11/162738.html|archivedate=8 July 2012 |title=Tymoshenko does not regret supporting Yushchenko in 2004 |publisher=En.for-ua.com |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial vote on 31 October, two candidates – Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko – proceeded to a runoff. As Tymoshenko earlier envisaged, Yushchenko received endorsement from former competitors who didn't make it to the runoff, such as Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party), Anatoliy Kinakh (Party of Industrials and Entrepreneurs), former Kyiv city mayor Oleksanrd Omelchenko and others.

On 6 November 2004, Tymoshenko asked people to spread the orange symbols (orange was the color of Yushchenko's campaign). "Grab a piece of the cheapest orange cloth, make ribbons and put them everywhere" she said. "Don't wait until the campaign managers give those to you".

When allegations of fraud began to spread, the "orange team" decided to conduct a parallel vote tabulation during 21 November 2004 runoff and announce the results immediately to people on Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti) in Kyiv. Tymoshenko called Kyiv residents to gather on the square and asked people from other cities and towns to come and stand for their choice. "Bring warm clothes, lard and bread, garlic and onions and come to Kyiv" she said. On 22 November 2004, massive protests broke out in cities across Ukraine: The largest, in Kiev's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], attracted an estimated 500,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khokhlova |first=Veronica |title=New Kids on the Bloc |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FFE395A0C758EDDA80994DC404482 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 November 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106070544/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FFE395A0C758EDDA80994DC404482 |archivedate=6 November 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These protests became known as the [[Orange Revolution]]. On 23 November 2004, Tymoshenko led the participants of the protest to the President's Administration. On Bankova Street, special riot police prevented the procession from going any further, so people lifted Tymoshenko up and she walked on the police's shields to the Administration building.

On 3 December 2004, the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] invalidated the results of the runoff and scheduled the re-run for 26 December 2004. After the cancellation of Viktor Yanukovych's official victory and the second round of the election, Viktor Yushchenko was elected president with 51.99% of votes (Yanukovych received 44.2% support).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm Profile: Viktor Yushchenko], BBC News (9 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months into [[First Tymoshenko Government|her government]],{{#tag:ref|Key economic achievements of Tymoshenko's government
Increased salaries, pensions, scholarships; Fulfilled one of the paragraphs of social program from Yushchenko's election agenda on support for new families: in 2005 a social aid for a newborn child was increased 12 times; "Contraband stop" campaign was launched. The campaign was accompanied by eradication of shadow schemes in business; Call for nationalization and re-privatization of more than 3000 enterprises. Eventually the government nationalized and then re-privatized country's biggest metallurgical plant "Kryvorizhstal". In October 2005 it was sold for $4 billion to a new owner, which was an impressive amount compared to $8.5 billion received by the government from privatization between 1991 and 2004; On 16 June 2005 president Viktor Yushchenko, speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Lytvyn and Yulia Tymoshenko signed a memorandum on guarantees of ownership rights and ensuring lawfulness for their implementation. According to Yushchenko, "Ukrainian government brought murky privatization practice to the end"; Reaction to crises on internal market; In April–May 2005 Ukraine faced so called "meat, sugar and petrol crises" when prices for the abovementioned products went up by 30–50% over a couple of weeks. These crises allegedly resulted from a cartel conspiracy and it took Tymoshenko's government about 1,5 month to get the prices down to the initial level with the help of "goods intervention" mechanism; The meat crisis was caused by increased demand for meat as a result of increased salaries. Tymoshenko's government lifted duties on imported meat, which dropped the speculative prices Tymoshenko's political opponents (Yushchenko and Yanukovych) kept criticizing her for importing "low quality meat". At that time Tymoshenko's government made a decision to increase production of poultry, which eventually made Ukraine a poultry exporter. The sugar and petrol crises were caused by a "cartel conspiracy" which increased prices for the abovementioned goods by 30–50%. Tymoshenko's government organized import of cane sugar and dropped duties on oil products import. In a couple of months the prices stabilized. In 2006 Anti Monopoly Committee, who investigated the "sugar crisis" issued a conclusion which said that it was a cartel monopoly with a participation of Petro Poroshenko, then-head of the National Council of Security and Defense.
In May 2005, at the height of the petrol crisis, Viktor Yushchenko publicly sharply criticized Tymoshenko for "pressure on oil traders". |group=nb}} internal conflicts within the post‐Revolution coalition began to damage Tymoshenko's administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051118115613/http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/editorial/23161/ Zinchenko's bombshell], ''Kyiv Post'' (7 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120418221254/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/23653/ Oleksandr Zinchenko talks], ''Kyiv Post'' (21 December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4226814.stm Orange Revolution in turmoil], BBC News (8 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2005, Viktor Yushchenko gave an Independence Day speech during which he called Tymoshenko's government "the best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2005/08/24/3012700//|title=CEC: The statement by Yushchenko on the Maidan on the occasion of Independence Day|work= Ukrainian Pravda|date=24 August 2005|accessdate=24 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his interview for the Associated Press, he said that during the time of her presidency at UESU, Tymoshenko accumulated an 8 million Hryvna debt, and that she had used her authority as prime minister to write off that debt. Tymoshenko has repeatedly stated that the mentioned amount was not a debt, but fines imposed by the Tax Inspection from 1997 to 1998, and that all the cases regarding UESU had been closed before she became prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-09-13-ukraine_x.htm |title=Ukraine president lashes out at ousted PM |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=13 September 2005 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tymoshenko blamed Yushchenko's closest circle for scheming against her and undermining the activities of her Cabinet. She also criticised Yushchenko, telling the BBC that he had "practically ruined our unity, our future, the future of the country", without rooting out corruption as he pledged to do and that the president's action was absolutely illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4231414.stm |title=Ukrainian ex-PM slams dismissal |publisher=BBC News |date=9 September 2005 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Tymoshenko's discharge in September 2005, the General Prosecutor Office of the Russian Federation dismissed all charges against her. On 18 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling which invalidated all criminal cases against Tymoshenko and her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://censor.net.ua/photo_news/186197/verhovnyyi_sud_postavil_tochku_v_dele_timoshenko_esche_v_2005_godu_dokument|title=CEC: The Supreme court put the point in the case of Tymoshenko in 2005.

After her dismissal, Tymoshenko started to tour the country in a bid to win the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] as the leader of her [[Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc|Bloc]].{{#tag:ref|On 7 December 2005, Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko held a convention in Kiev.

With the Bloc coming second in the election, and winning 129 seats, many speculated that she might form a coalition with Yushchenko's "Our Ukraine" party and the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) to prevent the [[Party of Regions]] from gaining power.&lt;ref name=pm2006/&gt; Tymoshenko again reiterated her stance in regard to becoming prime minister.&lt;ref name=pm2006&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4848958.stm Ukraine leaders jostle for power], BBC News (27 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, negotiations with "Our Ukraine" and SPU faced many difficulties as the various blocs fought over posts and engaged in counter-negotiations with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1107869.stm Timeline: Ukraine], BBC News (last updated 26 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2006, the Ukrainian media reported that the parties had finally reached a coalition agreement, which appeared to have ended nearly three months of political uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5101380.stm Ukraine allies 'agree coalition'], BBC News (21 June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5105192.stm Ukraine coalition deal confirmed], BBC News (22 June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tymoshenko's nomination and confirmation as the new prime minister was expected to be straightforward. However, the political intrigue that took place broke the plan. BYuT partners "Our Ukraine" and Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) could not come to agreement regarding distribution of powers, thus creation of the Coalition of Democratic Forces was put on hold. Yushchenko and oligarchs from his narrow circle were trying to impede Tymoshenko from returning to the office of Prime Minister. Her nomination was preconditioned on the election of her long-time rival [[Petro Poroshenko]] from "Our Ukraine" to the position of speaker of the parliament. Oleksandr Moroz, the chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, also expressed his interest in becoming speaker. Tymoshenko stated that she would vote for any speaker from the coalition.&lt;ref name=Poro/&gt; Within a few days of the signing of the coalition agreement, it became clear that the coalition members mistrusted each other,&lt;ref name=Poro&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131005115321/http://www.day.kiev.ua/uk/article/panorama-dnya/chinnik-moroza Парламент почав працювати, але коаліції в ньому більше немає], День (7 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; since they considered it a deviation from parliamentary procedures to hold a simultaneous vote on Poroshenko as the speaker and Tymoshenko as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanforum.net/news/166/oleksandr_moroz_announced_a_new_coalition_for_ukraine Oleksandr Moroz announced a new coalition for Ukraine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235037/http://www.europeanforum.net/news/166/oleksandr_moroz_announced_a_new_coalition_for_ukraine |date=25 July 2011 }}, [[European Forum for Democracy and Solidarity]] (11 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=31839, [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (4 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

After lengthy negotiations, SPU suddenly pulled out of the Coalition and joined the alliance with the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine. Oleksandr Moroz assured that the team of Viktor Yushchenko was conducting secret negotiations with the Party of Regions. According to that deal, Viktor Yanukovych was supposed to become the speaker, while Yuriy Yekhanurov kept the prime minister portfolio. These negotiations were conducted by Yekhanurov himself upon Yushchenko's request.

The only possible solution envisaged by Tymoshenko was dismissal of the Verkhovna Rada (according to the Constitution) and an early parliamentary election. In addition to meeting with top officials of the Bush administration, Tymoshenko gave speeches at the Kennedy Center for Strategic and International Studies and the National Press Club. She also received an award for her contribution to the development of democracy in Ukraine from the influential NGO Conservative Political Action Conference. |group=nb}} On 31 March 2007, Tymoshenko initiated a "100 thousand people Maidan" aimed to urge the president to call an early parliamentary election.{{#tag:ref|On 31 March 2007, Tymoshenko and her political party initiated and conducted the "100 thousand people Maidan".

On 4 April 2007, president Yushchenko issued an edict "On early termination of duties of the Verkhovna Rada" as a reaction to violation of the Constitution by the Party of Regions, which had started dragging individual deputies into the "ruling coalition" (this being illegal, as coalitions should be formed by factions and not by individual deputies). In doing so, the Party of Regions was trying to achieve a constitutional majority of 300 votes which would enable prime minister Yanukovych to override the president's veto and control the legislative process. Party of Regions didn't obey this edict. In order to dismiss the Verkhovna Rada, Yulia Tymoshenko and her supporters in the parliament (168 deputies from BYuT and "Our Ukraine" factions) quit their parliamentary factions on 2 June 2007. That step invalidated the convocation of the Verkhovna Rada and cleared the path to an early election.

An early parliamentary election was held on 30 September 2007.

On 15 October 2007, the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc agreed to form a majority coalition in the new parliament of the 6th [[convocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian Parliament Continues Shift Towards Yushchenko|url=http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/212097-svershilos-byut-i-nu-ns-parafirovali-soglashenie-o-sozdanii-koalicii|work=[[Korrespondent]]| date = 15 October 2007|accessdate=15 October 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November, a coalition was signed between the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] and Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, which was associated with President Yushchenko. Both parties are affiliated with the Orange Revolution.  On 11 December 2007, the Coalition failed in its attempt to appoint Tymoshenko prime minister, falling one vote short (225 members of parliament supported her nomination). On 12 December 2007, the media reported on the possible attempted assassination of Yulia Tymoshenko. BYuT and Tymoshenko herself said it was an intimidation. On 18 December, Tymoshenko was once again elected as Prime Minister (supported by 226 deputies, the minimal number needed for passage), heading the [[second Tymoshenko Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliament named Tymoshenko as the Prime Minister of Ukraine|url= http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/319536-parlament-naznachil-timoshenko-premer-ministrom-ukrainy|work= [[Korrespondent]]|date= 18 December 2007|accessdate= 18 December 2007 | language =Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Term as Prime Minister 2007–2010, and 2008 political crisis===
{{main article|Second Tymoshenko Government}}
On 11 July 2008, Party of Regions tried to vote no-confidence to Tymoshenko's government in the parliament, but could not collect enough votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/52072/Premier-survives-no-confidence-vote Premier survives no confidence vote], [[Daily Express]] (11 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition of Tymoshenko's Bloc (BYuT) and Yushchenko's Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc (OU-PSD) was put at risk due to deliberate misinterpretation of Tymoshenko's opinion on the ongoing [[2008 South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Russia. Yushchenko's office accused her of taking a softer position in order to gain support from Russia in the upcoming 2010 election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president's deputy chief of staff, went as far as to accuse her of 'high treason'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/ukraine-pm-accused-of-high-treason/84135/|title=Ukraine PM Accused of 'High Treason'|publisher=The New York Sun|date=19 August 2008|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Ukrainska Pravda]] and [[Newswire.ca]] Yulia Tymoshenko expressed her solidarity with Georgia on 13 and 14 August, and later preferred to stay neutral on the issue as according to Constitution President Yuschenko headed foreign policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2008/08/14/3522613/ |title=Tymoshenko keeps silent on Georgia.

According to [[BYuT]], Viktor Baloha (Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat) criticized the premier at every turn, doing the dirty job for the President and accusing her of everything from not being religious enough to damaging the economy and plotting to kill him, and the accusation of 'betrayal' over Georgia was simply one of the latest and most pernicious attacks directed at the premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.intv-inter.net/downloads/pdf/newsletter/BYuT_Inform_Newsletter_Issue_84.pdf |format=PDF |title=Newsletter for the international community providing views and analysis from the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) |publisher=[[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]] |date=8 September 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029054137/http://www.intv-inter.net/downloads/pdf/newsletter/BYuT_Inform_Newsletter_Issue_84.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/politics/133612-baloha-tymoshenko-not-orthodox-she-practices-another-faith.html|title=Baloha: Tymoshenko not Orthodox, she practices another faith|publisher=[[UNIAN]]|date=29 July 2008|accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/politics/130584-baloha-tymoshenko-promised-putin-not-to-support-ukraines-joining-nato-map.html|title=Baloha: Tymoshenko promised Putin not to support Ukraine's joining NATO MAP|publisher=[[UNIAN]]|date=16 July 2008|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/politics/109143-baloha-accuses-tymoshenko-of-deliberate-destroying-coalition.html|title=Baloha accuses Tymoshenko of deliberate destroying coalition UNIAN|date=10 April 2008|accessdate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/society/110138-baloha-calls-on-to-sack-ministers-from-governments-economic-bloc.html|title=Baloha calls on to sack Ministers from government's economic bloc|publisher=[[UNIAN]]|date=15 April 2008|accessdate=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2008, for the first time Tymoshenko accused the National Bank of Ukraine in the conscious manipulation of the hryvnia, and President Yushchenko of colluding with the leadership of the NBU, which led to depreciation of the national currency to the level of 8 UAH per US dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2008/12/18/3642740/|title=The scandalous Tymoshenko briefing: President covers and earns on currency speculation|publisher=Pravda.com.ua|date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of Tymoshenko's second term as prime minister coincided in time with the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]] of 2008, which required her government to respond to numerous challenges that could have led the country's economic collapse.{{#tag:ref|Tymoshenko herself outlines the biggest achievements of her government&lt;ref name="tymoshenko.ua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/page/achievements|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813013132/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/page/achievements|archivedate=13 August 2011 |title=Achievements |publisher=Tymoshenko.ua |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing anti crisis program for the key industries (mining and metallurgical sector, agrarian sector, chemical production, construction and development), strengthening Ukraine's energy independence through direct gas deals with Russian Federation, restoring Ukraine's fame as the world's bread basket due to unprecedentedly rich crops of grain (53.3&amp;nbsp;million tons in 2008, and 46 million tons in 2009), preventing drop in the agricultural production, revitalization of high-tech industries such as space engineering and aircraft construction, resuming of series construction of Antonov aircraft, getting final [[UEFA]]'s confirmation for conduct [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro-2012 tournament in Ukraine]], introducing independent high school graduate testing, obtaining WTO membership, and commencing negotiations on [[EU association]].|group=nb}}

Tymoshenko's government launched an anti corruption campaign and identified it as one of its priorities.{{#tag:ref|Tymoshenko introduced an apparatus of the Cabinet of Ministers' Commissioner for anti corruption issues and made sure that a number of anti corruption laws and government regulations (acts) were adopted.

According to Tymoshenko, the efficient anti corruption campaign [167] and significant financial discipline armed the government with additional resources for dealing with burning social problems during the crisis period. Due to that the following goals were achieved: pensions, stipends and salaries to the state-run organizations' employees were paid on time; gas and electricity prices for households were not raised; people received their deposits from the bankrupt banks; additional payments for teachers, healthcare workers and librarians were provided; financial aid to families with a newborn child was increased in several times; those who qualify, received more than 5500 state subsidized apartments; about 6 million of clients of former Soviet Oshchadbank received compensations for their lost savings; people could register their land plots free of charge.|group=nb}}

===Gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine (2009)===
The conditions leading to the [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|2009 gas dispute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordenergy.org/2009/02/the-russo-ukrainian-gas-dispute-of-january-2009-a-comprehensive-assessment/|title=The russo-ukrainian gas dispute of January 2009: a comprehensive assessment|publisher=Oxfordenergy.org|accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created in 2006, under the Viktor Yushchenko government, when Ukraine started buying Russian gas through an intermediary, Swiss-registered RosUkrEnergo. (Fifty percent of RosUkrEnergo shares were owned by the Russian "Gazprom", with 45 percent and 5 percent owned by Ukrainian businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Ivan Fursin, respectively). Some sources indicate that notorious criminal boss Sergiy Shnaider (nick [[Semion Mogilevich]], associated with Dmytro Firtash) also owned shares in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luke Harding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables-russian-mafia-gas |title=WikiLeaks cables link Russian mafia boss to EU gas supplies |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/new-and-conflicting-details-emerge-over-mogilevich-92521.html |title=New and conflicting details emerge over Mogilevich's alleged involvement in nation |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tymoshenko resumed her prime minister duties in 2007, she initiated direct relations between Ukraine and Russia with regard to gas trading. A 2 October 2008 Memorandum signed by Tymoshenko and Vladimir Putin stipulated liquidation of intermediaries in gas deals between the two countries and outlined detailed conditions for future gas contracts. The gas conflict of 2009 broke out because of two factors, the lack of a gas contract for 2009 and a $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion debt that Ukraine had yet to pay for gas received in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081120/118434473.html |title=Medvedev tells Gazprom to recover $2.4 bln gas debt from Ukraine |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Tymoshenko stated that it was the "RosUkrEnergo" company that was responsible for the debt, rather than the state of Ukraine. She called for an end to corruption in the gas trade area and the establishment of direct contracts with the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=192188475&amp;cat_id=244315174 |title=Yulia Tymoshenko: RosUkrEnergo has lost nothing, but only paid off its debts to Gazprom |publisher=Kmu.gov.ua |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"RosUkrEnergo", with the aid of its ties to Yushchenko's administration, managed to disrupt the signing of a gas contract scheduled for 31 December 2008. [[Alexey Miller|Oleksiy Miller, head of "Gazprom"]], stated that trader "RosUkrEnergo" broke down talks between "[[Gazprom]]" and "Naftogaz Ukrainy": "Yes indeed, in late December 2008, the prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine came to agreement, and our companies were ready to seal the deal for $235 per 1000 cubic meters of natural gas with the condition that all the export operations from Ukraine will be done bilaterally. RosUkrEnergo then suggested to buy gas at $285 price." On 31 December 2008, president Viktor Yushchenko gave Oleg Dubyna, head of "Naftogaz Ukrainy", a direct order to stop talks, not sign the agreement and recall the delegation from Moscow. The decision made by the president of Ukraine brought on the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zik.ua/en/news/2010/03/06/219714 |title=Oleh Dubyna Yushchenko and RUE guilty of 20-day gas spat with Russia in 2008 |publisher=Zik.ua |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/9758x75e |title=Prosecution witness confirms links between Yushchenko and RosUkrEnergo (audio) |publisher=Tymoshenko.ua |accessdate=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215231540/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/9758x75e |archivedate=15 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2009, Prime Minister Tymoshenko said, "The negotiations on $235 gas price and $1.7–1.8 transit price, that started on October 2 and successfully have been moving forward since, have been broken up because, unfortunately, Ukrainian politicians were trying to keep "RosUkrEnergo" in business as a shadow intermediary... The negotiations between the two prime ministers and later between "Gazprom" and "Naftogaz Ukrainy" were ruined by those Ukrainian political groups, who have gotten and are planning to get corrupt benefits from "RosUkrEnergo"." On 17 January 2009, President of Russia Dmitriy Medvedev said, "I think that our Ukrainian partners and us can trade gas without any intermediaries, especially without intermediaries with questionable reputation. The problem is that some participants of negotiations insisted on keeping the intermediary referring to the instructions from the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bierman |first=Stephen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=agCru3iDPGAA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022141903/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=agCru3iDPGAA |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2013 |title=Russia-Ukraine Gas Row May Center on RosUkrEnergo, Analyst Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2009, at 10&amp;nbsp;am, "Gazprom" completely stopped pumping gas to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/01/russ-j03.html?view=print|title=Russia cuts off Ukrainian gas supply - World Socialist Web Site|first=Niall|last=Green|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January, the Russian monopolist offered to sell Ukraine gas for $450 per 1000 cubic meter (minus a fee for gas transit through Ukraine), which was defined as a standard price for Eastern European countries. On 8 January 2009, the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukraine would have to pay $470 for 1000 cubic meters of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.ua/society/178348-putin-yakscho-ukrajina-pide-na-470-dolariv-tranzit-mojliviy-za-3-4-dolari.html|title=Putin: if Ukraine goes to $ 470, transit is possible for 3-4 dollars|publisher= Unian.ua|date=8 January 2009|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1 and 18 January, Central and Eastern European countries received significantly less gas. Ukrainian heat-and-power stations were working to utmost capacity. Due to sub-zero temperatures, the entire housing and public utilities sectors were on the verge of collapse. On 14 January, the European Commission and the Czech presidency in the European Union demanded the immediate renewal of gas deliveries in full capacity lest the reputations of Russia and Ukraine as reliable EU partners be seriously damaged. On 18 January 2009, after five-day-long talks, prime ministers Putin and Tymoshenko came to agreement on the renewal of gas delivery to Ukraine and other EU countries. The parties agreed upon the following: A return to direct contract deals between "Gazprom" and "Naftogaz Ukrainy"; the removal of non-transparent intermediaries; the introduction of formula-based pricing for Ukraine (which also works for other Eastern European countries); and a switch to a $2.7 transit fee, which is close to the average price in Europe.  According to the new gas contract, in 2009 Ukraine paid an average price of $232.98 per 1000 cubic meters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukraineanalysis.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/the-new-gas-deal-threats-and-risks-for-ukraine/ |title=THE NEW GAS DEAL: THREATS AND RISKS FOR UKRAINE |publisher=Ukraineanalysis.wordpress.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other European consumers were paying above $500 per 1000 cubic meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20081112/118261776.html |title=Gazprom says natural gas prices for Europe to drop in 2009 |publisher=En.ria.ru |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first round of the presidential election on 17 January 2010, Tymoshenko took second place with 25% of the vote, and Yanukovych took first place with 35%.

On 3 February 2010, two days before the run-off, the deputies from Party of Regions, Communist Party of Ukraine, "Our Ukraine – People's Self-Defense" bloc and independent MPs amended the Law on Election of President, which changed the mode of composition and functioning of election commissions. BYuT warned that these amendments would create opportunities for the massive rigging of elections. Tymoshenko called on president Yushchenko to veto the law. Hanne Severinsen, former rapporteur of PACE Monitoring Committee on Ukraine, also called on the president to veto the law. Severinsen's statement read: "Unfortunately, the Party of Regions, as in 2004, is trying to create conditions for vote fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/67xmnoz4 |title=Hanne Severinsen: Party of Regions trying to repeat 2004 |publisher=Tymoshenko.ua |accessdate=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111224530/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/67xmnoz4 |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appeal====
[[File:Судять.jpg|thumb|Yulia Tymoshenko in 2011.]]
On 24 October 2011, Tymoshenko filed an appeal to the decision of Pechersk district court of Kyiv regarding the "gas case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/politics/2011/10/111024_tymoshenko_appeal_ak.shtml|title=Tymoshenko filed the appeal on a sentence on "gas business"|publisher= Bbc.com|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal started hearing the case. Tymoshenko herself was not present in the courtroom because of her health condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.mobi/a/24408285.html|title=The court considered possible a preliminary review of the complaint Tymoshenko without her|publisher= Radio Svoboda|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the hearing, the judge, Olena Sitaylo, had to call an ambulance and was hospitalized. On 13 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal resumed the hearing. All subsequent court sessions took place without Tymoshenko's presence. Immediately prior to the hearing of the appeal, the board of judges was altered: Sitaylo, the chief justice, was appointed the day before the first hearing; other justices were appointed several days prior to the court session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novaukraina.org/news/urn:news:AA7F7D|title=The trial of Tymoshenko will continue "in any weather"|publisher= Novaukraina.org|date=20 December 2011|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the judges did not have time to study the 84-page case log. The manner of the process proved that the decision to alter the board of judges was made beforehand. At the very end, Tymoshenko's defense boycotted the court session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fakty.ictv.ua/ua/index/read-news/id/1437911|title=Protection of Tymoshenko will not go to court|publisher= Fakty.ictv.ua|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling which fully supported the verdict of the Pechersk court. The judges didn't find any violations during the pre-trial investigation or trial on the "gas case", overruling the claims of Tymoshenko's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2011/12/14/125211.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709040426/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2011/12/14/125211.html|archivedate=9 July 2012 |title=Court of Appeals leaves Yulia Tymoshenko in custody |publisher=En.for-ua.com |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cassation====
On 26 January 2012, Tymoshenko's defense submitted a [[Court of cassation|cassation appeal]] to the High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases regarding the "gas case" verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/01/26/144035.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709112624/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/01/26/144035.html|archivedate=9 July 2012 |title=Tymoshenko's defense submitted cassation appeal against "gas sentence" |publisher=En.for-ua.com |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August 2012, after a 7-month delay that impeded filing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, the panel of judges of the aforementioned court began hearing the case. The panel finished hearing the case on 21 August and went to the jury room to make decision. The ruling of the Court, issued on 29 August 2012, stated that the appeal of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's defense on the "gas case" should not be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/court-reads-out-cassation-complaints-against-tymoshenkos-gas-case-verdict-311681.html |title=Tymoshenko's cassation in gas case read out in court |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media, diplomats, members of parliament and members of an EU special monitoring mission, Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, attended the court sessions. The ruling was announced on the day following public hearing of "Tymoshenko vs Ukraine" (regarding unlawful arrest of ex-prime minister and holding her in custody) case at the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ua/ukr/analytics/espch-nachal-publichnye-slushaniya-po-delu-timoshenko-protiv-28082012143100|title=The European Court of human rights has completed its public hearings in the case "Tymoshenko against Ukraine"|publisher= Rbc.ua|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union, PACE, and governments of the United States, Great Britain and Canada expressed frustration with the cassation ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/day-after-day/staunch-court |title=A staunch court |publisher=Day.kiev.ua |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We are deeply disappointed with the consequences of the current situation, when two important opposition leaders cannot stand in the upcoming parliamentary elections, [and] when the court disrespects international standards for fair and transparent processes", a representative of the European Commission, Michael Mann, said in Brussels on 29 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.nrcu.gov.ua/en/148/509412/|title=EU deeply disappointed by court ruling on Tymoshenko's appeal against gas case verdict|publisher= Old.nrcu.gov.ua |date=29 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aftermath — Manafort case ====
According to the September 2018 indictment in which [[Paul Manafort]] confessed as part of a plea bargain with [[U.S.]] [[special prosecutor]] [[Robert Mueller]], Manafort helped former Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to conduct a media campaign in the West directed against Tymoshenko in order to undermine the support for her by [[Presidency of Barack Obama|the administration]] of then U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="6489514 Mana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manafort-approved-black-ops"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/ex-trump-aide-paul-manafort-approved-black-ops-to-help-ukraine-president|title=Ex-Trump aide Paul Manafort approved 'black ops' to help Ukraine president|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=5 April 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 April 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was designed to make Tymoshenko look like a supporter of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name="6489514 Mana"&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/manafort-s-mysterious-israeli-connection-everything-we-know-so-far-1.6489514 Manafort’s Mysterious Israeli Connection: Everything We Know So Far], [[Haaretz]] (18 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment also states that in July 2011, former U.S. journalist [[Alan Friedman]] sent Manafort a confidential six-page document entitled "Ukraine - the digital road map", which contained a plan for "destruction" of Tymoshenko using video, articles and social networks.&lt;ref name="5b9c2e61e4b046313fbb2867"&gt;[https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5b9c2e61e4b046313fbb2867 Paul Manafort’s Plea Deal Could Be Bad News For A Bunch Of Washington Operatives], [[Huffpost]] (14 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manafort-approved-black-ops"/&gt; The plan included creating a website, posting on the Internet, and sending out e-mails to "the target audience in Europe and the U.S."&lt;ref name="manafort-approved-black-ops"/&gt; It was also proposed to edit the page of Yulia Tymoshenko in Wikipedia in order to emphasize the "corruption and legal proceedings" related to her.&lt;ref name="manafort-approved-black-ops"/&gt;

Following the [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution]], on 21 February 2014, Parliament voted for her release in a 310–54 veto-proof vote.&lt;ref name="RTNYT21214"/&gt; To do so, the members of parliament decriminalized the Article on which Tymoshenko was charged and brought it into compliance with Article 19 of the UN Convention against corruption.

On 22 January 2015, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] announced the termination of consideration of the case of ''Yulia Tymoshenko v.

The Ukrainian government, in its exchange with the Court, had acknowledged a violation of Tymoshenko's rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights under articles 3 (prohibition of torture), 6 (right to a fair trial), 7 (no punishment without law), 8 (right to respect for private and family life), partly in conjunction with article 13 (right to an effective remedy), article 18 (political motivation), article 10 (freedom of expression) and article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention (right not to be tried or punished twice). Taking note of the Ukrainian government's declaration and following measures, as well as of Tymoshenko's agreement with it, the Court struck out the application from its list of cases, as asked by the government, following article 39 of the Convention (friendly settlements).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-4988882-6120225&amp;filename=Decision%20Tymoshenko%20v.%20Ukraine%20%28no.%202%29%20-%20examination%20discontinued.pdf European Court discontinues examination of second case brought by former Ukrainian Prime Minister Tymoshenko], ECHR Press Release, 22 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
{{Main article|Family of Yulia Tymoshenko}}

Yulia Tymoshenko's mother, Lyudmila Mykolayivna Telehina (born Nelepova), was born on 11 August 1937 in [[Dnipropetrovsk]].&lt;ref name="mak-info"/&gt; Her father, Volodymyr Abramovych Hrihyan, was born on 3 December 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. His Soviet passport gave his nationality as Latvian.&lt;ref name="mak-info"/&gt; His mother was Maria Yosypivna Hrihyan, born in 1909.&lt;ref name="mak-info"/&gt;

[[Ukrainian media]] have published speculation regarding the genealogy of Tymoshenko. Some of the hypotheses have no scientific evidence (for example, the hypothesis of the [[Armenian people|Armenian]] origin of the surname "Grigyan");

Tymoshenko's critics have suggested that, as an oligarch, she gained her fortune improperly. Some have speculated that her familiarity with the illegal conduct of business common in Ukraine uniquely qualifies her to combat corruption—if she is willing to do so.

{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote= Yushchenko is being dishonest—which shouldn't surprise us—but he is also being self-serving when he says that Yanukovych and Tymoshenko "are cut from the same cloth." For one thing, even Tymoshenko's most ardent detractors realize that, if she were president, Ukraine would not be sliding toward a 20-year dictatorship. For another, if anyone is cut from the same cloth as Yanukovych, it's Viktor Yushchenko, who's shown a remarkable willingness to seek rapprochement with him and the Regionnaires since 2005. Yushchenko should be ashamed. Worse, Yushchenko should be on meds. A perfectly reasonable argument for EU engagement with Ukraine became, in the manner of all of Yushchenko's speeches in the last years of his presidency, a rant against Tymoshenko and thereby self-destructed. I had once suggested that Yushchenko probably couldn't forgive himself for being too weak to stand up to the powerful Tymoshenko. His feelings of impotence are obviously still going strong.

The title, "Ukraine, Gas and Handcuffs: The Trial of Yulia Tymoshenko", demonstrates a clear understanding that energy is the key source of Ukraine’s dependence. The author draws a clear parallel between Ukraine and the fate of Yulia Tymoshenko, who was also denied her freedom because of her fight against corruption, the oligarchy and the dependence of the Ukrainian energy sector on Russian energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/14_ottobre_05/figlia-yulia-tymoshenko-diritti-umani-negati-mia-madre-0f965f8c-4c87-11e4-8c5c-557ef01adf3d.shtml|title=La figlia di Yulia Tymoshenko "Diritti umani negati a mia madre"|publisher=milano.corriere.it|date=5 October 2014|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lintraprendente.it/2014/10/vera-storia-del-processo-tymoshenko-pilotato-da-mosca/|title=Vera storia del processo Tymoshenko.
