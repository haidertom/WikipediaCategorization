'''Academic authorship''' of [[academic journal|journal]] [[manuscript|articles]], books, and other original works is a means by which [[academia|academics]] communicate the results of their [[list of academic disciplines|scholarly work]], establish [[scientific priority|priority]] for their discoveries, and build their reputation among their peers.

Authorship is a primary basis that employers use to evaluate academic personnel for employment, promotion, and [[tenure]]. In [[academic publishing]], authorship of a work is claimed by those making intellectual contributions to the completion of the [[research]] described in the work. In simple cases, a solitary scholar carries out a research project and writes the subsequent article or book. In many [[list of academic disciplines|disciplines]], however, [[collaboration]] is the norm and issues of authorship can be controversial. In these contexts, authorship can encompass activities other than writing the article; a researcher who comes up with an experimental design and analyzes the data may be considered an author, even if she or he had little role in composing the text describing the results. According to some standards, even writing the entire article would not constitute authorship unless the writer was also involved in at least one other phase of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dickson |year= 1978 | journal=Wildl. Soc. Bull. |volume= 6 | first1=J. G.| issue=4 |pages= 260–261 | last2=Conner | jstor=3781489 | first2=R. N. | last3=Adair | first3=K. T. | title=Guidelines for Authorship of Scientific Articles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Guidelines for assigning authorship vary between [[institution]]s and disciplines. They may be formally defined or simply cultural custom. Incorrect application of authorship rules occasionally leads to charges of [[academic dishonesty|academic misconduct]] and sanctions for the violator. A 2002&lt;!--published in 2005--&gt; survey of a large sample of researchers who had received funding from the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] revealed that 10% of respondents claimed to have inappropriately assigned authorship credit within the last three years.&lt;ref name=Martinson2005&gt;{{Cite journal

| issue = 7043
| bibcode = 2005Natur.435..737M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first large scale survey concerning such issues. In other fields only limited or no empirical data is available.

===Authorship in the natural sciences===
The natural sciences have no universal standard for authorship, but some major multi-disciplinary [[academic journal|journals]] and institutions have established guidelines for work that they publish. The journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' (''PNAS'') has an editorial policy that specifies "authorship should be limited to those who have contributed substantially to the work" and furthermore, "authors are strongly encouraged to indicate their specific contributions" as a [[footnote]]. The [[American Chemical Society]] further specifies that authors are those who also "share responsibility and accountability for the results"&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/ethics/ethics.pdf Editors of the Publications Division of the American Chemical Society. 2006. Ethical Guidelines to Publication of Chemical Research.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018}} and the U.S. [[United States National Academies|National Academies]] specify "an author who is willing to take credit for a paper must also bear responsibility for its contents. Thus, unless a footnote or the text of the paper explicitly assigns responsibility for different parts of the paper to different authors, the authors whose names appear on a paper must share responsibility for all of it."&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;

===Authorship in mathematics, theoretical computer science and high energy physics===
In mathematics, the authors are usually listed in alphabetical order (this is the so-called Hardy-Littlewood Rule). This usage is described in the "Information Statements on the Culture of Research and Scholarship in Mathematics" section of the [[American Mathematical Society]] website,&lt;ref name="ams culture"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/committees/cprof-home#culture|title = Information Statements|website =  Committee on the Profession|publisher = American Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the 2004 statement: ''[http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf Joint Research and Its Publication]''.

In other branches of knowledge such as economics, business, finance or [[particle physics]], it is also usual to sort the authors alphabetically.&lt;ref name="author listing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waltman | first1 = L | year = 2012 | title = An empirical analysis of the use  of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing | url = | journal = Journal of Informetrics | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 700–711 | doi = 10.1016/j.joi.2012.07.008 | arxiv = 1206.4863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in medicine===
The medical field defines authorship very narrowly. According to the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]], designation as an author must satisfy four conditions. The author must have:
# Contributed substantially to the conception and design of the study, the acquisition of data, or the analysis and interpretation
# Drafted or provided critical revision of the article
# Provided final approval of the version to publish
# Agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved

Acquisition of funding, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship. Many authors - especially those in the middle of the byline - do not fulfill these authorship criteria.&lt;ref name="advances.sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauermann|first1=Henry|last2=Haeussler|first2=Carolin|title=Authorship and contribution disclosures|journal=Science Advances|volume=3|issue=11|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1700404.full|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1700404|year=2017|page=e1700404|bibcode=2017SciA....3E0404S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical journals have abandoned the strict notion of author, with the flexible notion of ''contributor''.&lt;ref name=Rennie1997&gt;{{Cite journal

| last2 = Yank | first2 = V.
| last3 = Emanuel | first3 = L.

| pages = 579–85
| doi = 10.1001/jama.278.7.579
| pmid = 9268280
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between about 1980-2010 the average number of authors in medical papers increased, and perhaps tripled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsao|first1=CI|last2=Roberts|first2=LW|title=Authorship in scholarly manuscripts: practical considerations for resident and early career physicians.|journal=Academic Psychiatry |date= |volume=33|issue=1|pages=76–9|pmid=19349451|doi=10.1176/appi.ap.33.1.76|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in the social sciences===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) has similar guidelines as medicine for authorship. The APA acknowledge that authorship is not limited to the writing of manuscripts, but must include those who have made substantial contributions to a study such as "formulating the problem or hypothesis, structuring the experimental design, organizing and conducting the statistical analysis, interpreting the results, or writing a major portion of the paper".&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association. (2001). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (5th ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; While the APA guidelines list many other forms of contributions to a study that do not constitute authorship, it does state that combinations of these and other tasks may justify authorship. Like medicine, the APA considers institutional position, such as Department Chair, insufficient for attributing authorship.

===Authorship in the humanities===
Neither the Modern Languages Association&lt;ref&gt;Gibaldi, J. (1998). ''MLA style manual and guide to scholarly publishing'' (2nd ed.). New York: Modern Language Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt; nor the Chicago Manual of Style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]|edition = 15th|date =2006|location = Chicago|publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn =  978-0226104041}}&lt;/ref&gt; define requirements for authorship (because usually humanities works are single-authored and the author is responsible for the entire work).

==Growing number of authors per paper==
From the late 17th century to the 1920s, sole authorship was the norm, and the one-paper-one-author model worked well for distributing credit.&lt;ref name="Greene2007"/&gt; Today, shared authorship is common in most academic disciplines, with the exception of the humanities, where sole authorship is still the predominant model. In particular types of research, including particle physics, genome sequencing and clinical trials, a paper's author list can run into the hundreds. In 1998, the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab]] (CDF) adopted a (at that time) highly unorthodox policy for assigning authorship. CDF maintains a ''standard author list''. All scientists and engineers working at CDF are added to the standard author list after one year of full-time work; names stay on the list until one year after the worker leaves CDF. Every publication coming out of CDF uses the entire standard author list, in alphabetical order. Other big collaborations, including most particle physics experiments, followed this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/newsletter/2012/201207/multiauthor_papers/|title=Multiauthor Papers: Onward and Upward|author=Christopher King|date=July 2012|accessdate=6 December 2017|work = ScienceWatch Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large, multi-center clinical trials authorship is often used as a reward for recruiting patients.&lt;ref name="Regalado1995"/&gt;

A paper published in the [[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]] in 1993 reported on a clinical trial conducted in 1,081 hospitals in 15 different countries, involving a total of 41,021 patients. There were 972 authors listed in an appendix and authorship was assigned to a group.&lt;ref name="Investigators1993"/&gt; In 2015, an article in high-energy physics was published describing the measurement of the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] based on collisions in the [[Large Hadron Collider]]; the article boasted 5,154 authors, the printed author list needed 24 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-more-than-5-000-authors-1.17567|title=Physics paper sets record with more than 5,000 authors|author=Davide Castelvecchi|date=15 May 2015|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large authors lists have attracted some criticism. They strain guidelines that insist that each author's role be described and that each author is responsible for the validity of the whole work. Such a system treats authorship more as ''credit'' for scientific service at the facility in general rather that as an identification of specific contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, M. Rights or rewards? Changing frameworks of scientific authorship. In ''Scientific Authorship'', Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 253–280.&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator wrote, "In more than 25 years working as a scientific editor ... I have not been aware of any valid argument for more than three authors per paper, although I recognize that this may not be true for every field."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/37855 | pmid = 9288957 | year = 1997 | last1 = Van Loon | first1 = A. J. | title = Pseudo-authorship | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 6646 | pages = 11 |bibcode = 1997Natur.389...11V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of shared authorship has been attributed to [[Big Science]]—scientific experiments that require collaboration and specialization of many individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Price|first= Derek John de Solla |date = 1986|chapter = Collaboration in an Invisible College|title = Little science, big science...and beyond |pages = 119–134|location= New York|publisher = Columbia University Press|url = http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Little_science_big_science_and_beyond.pdf |isbn = 0-231-04956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the increase in multi-authorship might be a consequence of the way scientists are evaluated. Traditionally, scientists were judged by the number of papers they published, and later by the impact of those papers. The former is an estimate of quantity and the latter of quality. Both methods were adequate when single authorship was the norm, but vastly inflate individual contribution when papers are multi-authored. When each author claims each paper and each citation as his/her own, papers and citations are magically multiplied by the number of authors. Furthermore, there is no cost to giving authorship to individuals who made only minor contribution and, actually, there is an incentive to do so. Hence, the system rewards heavily multi-authored papers. This problem is openly acknowledged, and it could easily be "corrected" by dividing each paper and its citations by the number of authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Põder E | year = 2010 | title = Let's correct that small mistake | url = | journal = J. Am. Soc. Inform. Sci. Tech | volume = 61 | issue = 12| pages = 2593–2594 | doi = 10.1002/asi.21438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lozano | first1 = G. A. | year = 2013 | title = The elephant in the room: multi-authorship and the assessment of individual researchers | url = | journal = Current Science | volume = 105 | issue = 4| pages = 443–445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the rise in shared authorship may also reflect increased acknowledgment of the contributions of lower level workers, including graduate students and technicians, as well as honorary authorship, while allowing for such collaborations to make an independent statement about the quality and integrity of a scientific work.

==Honorary authorship==
''Honorary authorship'' is sometimes granted to those who played no significant role in the work, for a variety of reasons. Until recently, it was standard to list the head of a German department or institution as an author on a paper regardless of input.&lt;ref name="Pearson, H 2006"/&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], however, warns that such practices "dilute the credit due the people who actually did the work, inflate the credentials of those so 'honored,' and make the proper attribution of credit more difficult."&lt;ref name=National/&gt; The extent to which honorary authorship still occurs is not empirically known. However, it is plausible to expect that it is still widespread, because senior scientists leading large research groups can receive much of their reputation from a long publication list and thus have little motivation to give up honorary authorships.

A possible measure against honorary authorships has been implemented by some scientific journals, in particular by the ''Nature'' journals. They demand&lt;ref name="NaturePolicies"/&gt; that each new manuscript must include a statement of responsibility that specifies the contribution of every author. The level of detail varies between the disciplines. Senior persons may still make some vague claim to have "supervised the project", for example, even if they were only in the formal position of a supervisor without having delivered concrete contributions. (The truth content of such statements is usually not checked by independent persons.) However, the need to describe contributions can at least be expected to somewhat reduce honorary authorships. In addition, it may help to identify the perpetrator in a case of scientific fraud.

==Ghost authorship==
''Ghost authorship'' occurs when an individual makes a substantial contribution to the research or the writing of the report, but is not listed as an author.&lt;ref name="Ghost authorship in industry-initiated randomised trials"/&gt; Researchers, statisticians and writers (e.g. [[medical writer]]s or [[technical writers]]) become ''ghost authors'' when they meet authorship criteria but are not named as an author. Writers who work in this capacity are called [[Ghostwriting#Academic|ghostwriters]].

Ghost authorship has been linked to partnerships between industry and higher education. Two-thirds of industry-initiated [[randomized controlled trial|randomized trials]] may have evidence of ghost authorship.&lt;ref name="Ghost authorship in industry-initiated randomised trials"/&gt;
Ghost authorship is considered problematic because it may be used to obscure the participation of researchers with conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="Handling of scientific dishonesty in the Nordic countries. National Committees on Scientific Dishonesty in the Nordic Countries"/&gt;

Litigation against the pharmaceutical company, [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] over health concerns related to use of their drug, [[Rofecoxib]] (brand name Vioxx), revealed examples of ghost authorship.&lt;ref name=Ross2008&gt;{{Cite journal
| last1 = Ross | first1 = Joseph S.

| last3 = Egilman | first3 = David S.

| volume = 299

| pages = 1800–12
| doi = 10.1001/jama.299.15.1800
| pmid = 18413874
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Merck routinely paid medical writing companies to prepare journal manuscripts, and subsequently recruited external, academically affiliated researchers to pose as the authors.

Authors are sometimes included in a list without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat1264 | title = Authorship without authorization | pmid = 15516947 | year = 2004 | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | page = 743|bibcode = 2004NatMa...3..743. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even if this is done with the benign intention to acknowledge some contributions, it is problematic since authors carry responsibility for correctness and thus need to have the opportunity to check the manuscript and possibly demand changes.

==Order of authors in a list==
Rules for the order of multiple authors in a list have historically varied significantly between fields of research.&lt;ref name="On Academic Authorship (RPH 2.8)"/&gt; Some fields list authors in order of their degree of involvement in the work, with the most active contributors listed first;&lt;ref name="advances.sciencemag.org"/&gt; other fields, such as mathematics or engineering (e.g., [[control theory]]), sometimes list them alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/40958 | pmid = 9237742 | year = 1997 | last1 = Stubbs | first1 = C. | title = The serious business of listing authors. | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = 6640 | page = 320 |bibcode = 1997Natur.388Q.320. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPAC96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICALEPCS99"/&gt; Historically biologists tended to place a [[principal investigator]] (supervisor or lab head) last in an author list whereas organic chemists might have put him or her first.&lt;ref name="Pearson, H 2006"/&gt; Research articles in high energy physics, where the author lists can number in the tens to hundreds, often list authors alphabetically.  In Computer Science in general the principal contributor is the first in the author list. However, the practice of putting the principal investigator last in the author list has increasingly become an accepted standard across most areas in science and engineering.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there data to back this up?|date=September 2017}}

Although listing authors in order of the involvement in the project seems straightforward, it often leads to conflict. A study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that more than two-thirds of 919 corresponding authors disagreed with their coauthors regarding contributions of each author.&lt;ref name="Reliability of disclosure forms of authors' contributions"/&gt;

==Responsibilities of authors==
Authors' reputations can be damaged if their names appear on a paper that they do not completely understand or with which they were not intimately involved.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Numerous guidelines and customs specify that all co-authors must be able to understand and support a paper's major points.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In a notable case, American stem-cell researcher [[Gerald Schatten]] had his name listed on a paper co-authored with [[Hwang Woo-suk]]. The paper was later exposed as fraudulent and, though Schatten was not accused of participating in the fraud, a panel at his university found that "his failure to more closely oversee research with his name on it does make him guilty of 'research misbehavior.'"&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Constance. (2006.) Schatten: Pitt Panel Finds "Misbehavior" but Not Misconduct. ''Science'', '''311''':928.&lt;/ref&gt;

All authors, including co-authors, are usually expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted for publication. In some cases, co-authors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of  papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce,&lt;ref name="Lessons from the Pearce affair: handling scientific fraud"/&gt; (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception)&lt;ref name="Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1994-1995) |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/7/4972.htm |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and the co-authors of [[Jan Hendrik Schön]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]]. More recent cases include [[Charles Nemeroff]],&lt;ref name="Journal editor quits in conflict scandal - The Scientist - Magazine of the Life Sciences"/&gt; former editor-in-chief of ''[[Neuropsychopharmacology]]'', and the so-called Sheffield Actonel affair.&lt;ref name="Actonel_Case_Media_Reports"/&gt;

Additionally, authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. Both scientific and academic censure can result from a failure to keep primary data; the case of [[Ranjit Chandra]] of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] provides an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Memorial University to re-examine Chandra case|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/memorial-university-to-re-examine-chandra-case-1.575308|website = www.cbc.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientific journals also require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors may have commercial or non-commercial [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. Outlined in the author disclosure statement for the ''[[American Journal of Human Biology]]'',&lt;ref name="American Journal of Human Biology - Wiley InterScience"/&gt; this is a policy more common in scientific fields where funding often comes from corporate sources. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about [[research ethics|ethical]] aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/ |title=Did a British university sell out to P&amp;G? - By Jennifer Washburn - Slate Magazine |work= |accessdate=2010-04-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323070938/http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anonymous and unclaimed authorship==
Authors occasionally forgo claiming authorship, for a number of reasons. Historically some authors have published anonymously to shield themselves when presenting controversial claims. A key example is [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymous publication of [[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]], a speculative, pre-Darwinian work on the origins of life and the cosmos. The book argued for an evolutionary view of life in the same spirit as the late Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Lamarck had long been discredited among intellectuals by this time and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among the political radicals, materialists, and atheists - Chambers hoped to avoid Lamarck's fate.

In the 18th century, [[Émilie du Châtelet]] began her career as a scientific author by submitting a paper in an annual competition held by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]; papers in this competition were submitted anonymously. Initially presenting her work without claiming authorship allowed her to have her work judged by established scientists while avoiding the bias against women in the sciences. She did not win the competition, but eventually her paper was published alongside the winning submissions, under her real name.&lt;ref&gt;Terrall, M. The uses of anonymity in the age of reason. In ''Scientific Authorship'' Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 91–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and engineers working in corporate and military organizations are often restricted from publishing and claiming authorship of their work because their results are considered secret property of the organization that employs them. One notable example is that of [[William Gosset]], who was forced to publish his work in statistics under the pseudonym “Student” due to his employment at the [[Guinness]] brewery. Another account describes the frustration of physicists working in nuclear weapons programs at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]] – years after making a discovery they would read of the same phenomenon being "discovered" by a physicist unaware of the original, secret discovery of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Gusterson, H. The death of the authors of death - Prestige and creativity among nuclear weapons scientists. In ''Scientific Authorship'' Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 282–307.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">[[Image:RibonucleaseA SS paleRib.png|thumb|right| Folded, 3-D structure of ribonuclease A]]
'''Anfinsen's dogma''' (also known as the '''thermodynamic hypothesis''') is a postulate in [[molecular biology]] that states that, at least for a small globular protein in its standard physiological environment, the [[protein structure|native structure]] is determined only by the protein's [[amino acid]] [[primary structure|sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anfinsen CB | title=Principles that govern the folding of protein chains | journal=Science | volume=181 |issue=4096 |year=1973 | pages=223–230 | pmid=4124164 | doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dogma was championed by the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1972/press.html|title=Press Release: The 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|website=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian B. Anfinsen]] from his research on the folding of ribonuclease A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=White FH | title=Regeneration of native secondary and tertiary structures by air oxidation of reduced ribonuclease | journal=J. Biol. Chem. | volume=236 |year=1961 | pages=1353–1360 | pmid=13784818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Anfinsen CB, Haber E, Sela M, ((White FH Jr)) | title=The kinetics of formation of native ribonuclease during oxidation of the reduced polypeptide chain | journal=PNAS | volume=47 | issue=9 |year=1961 | pages=1309–1314 | pmid=13683522 | doi=10.1073/pnas.47.9.1309 | pmc=223141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postulate amounts to saying that, at the environmental conditions (temperature, solvent concentration and composition, etc.) at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique, stable and kinetically accessible minimum of the free energy.
The three conditions:

:'''Uniqueness''': requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable free energy. Hence the free energy minimum must be ''unchallenged''.

:'''Stability''': small changes in the surrounding environment cannot give rise to changes in the minimum configuration. This can be pictured as a free energy surface that looks more like a funnel (with the native state in the bottom of it) rather than like a soup plate (with several closely related low-energy states); the free energy surface around the native state must be rather steep and high, in order to provide stability.

:'''Kinetical accessibility''': means that the path in the free energy surface from the unfolded to the folded state must be reasonably smooth or, in other words, that the folding of the chain must not involve highly complex changes in the shape (like knots or other high order conformations).

How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of [[protein folding]], which has a related concept called [[Levinthal's paradox]]. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) to explore all possible conformations and choose the appropriate one, it would also arguably make computational prediction of protein structures under the same basis unfeasible if not impossible.

Also, some proteins need the assistance of another protein called a [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone protein]] to fold properly. It has been suggested that this disproves Anfinsen's dogma. However, the chaperones do not appear to affect the final state of the protein; they seem to work primarily by preventing [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of several protein molecules prior to the final folded state of the protein.

[[Prion]]s are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal [[amyloid]] buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |title=Protein Folding and Misfolding |publisher=Yale University Rhoades Lab |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719110222/http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |archivedate=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">The '''archaeology of religion and ritual''' is a growing field of study within [[archaeology]] that applies ideas from [[religious studies]],  theory and methods, anthropological theory, and archaeological and [[historical method]]s and theories to the study of [[religion]] and [[ritual]] in past human societies from a material perspective.

==Definitions==

Religion may be defined as “a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs,” &lt;ref name=dict&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Religion) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ritual is “an established or prescribed procedure for a religious or other rite.” &lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ritual) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists may study the material traces of religious ritual (for example, the ritual destruction of ceramic vessels during the [[Aztec]] [[New Fire ceremony]] &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ‘’Ancient Mesoamerica, ‘’ Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;) or the material correlates of religion as a totalized worldview (for example, Elizabeth Kyder-Reid’s study of the Southern [[Redemptorist]]s’ reconfiguration of landscape and artifacts to reflect their ideals of community and poverty in material form &lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ‘’Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.’’  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

As in [[religious studies]] and the [[Anthropology of religion]], many archaeologists differentiate between “[[world religions]],” and “traditional” or “[[indigenous religions]].”  “World religions” are defined by Bowie (2000: 26) &lt;ref name="Bowie"&gt;Bowie, F.  (2000) The Anthropology of religion.  Oxford: Blackwell.  Quoted in Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; as:

# Based on written scriptures.
# Has a notion of salvation, often from outside.
# Universal, or potentially universal.
# Can subsume or supplant primal religions.
# Often forms a separate sphere of activity.

while indigenous religions are defined as:

# Oral, or if literate, lacks written/formal scriptures and creeds.
# ‘This worldly’.
#  Confined to a single language or ethnic group.
#  Form basis from which world religions have developed.
#  Religious and social life are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Bowie"/&gt;

However, Timothy Insoll (2004: 9) &lt;ref&gt;Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that these categorizations arise from a much-critiqued [[neo-evolutionism|neo-evolutionary]] perspective.  Strict dichotomies of religious forms may also contribute to skewing research toward state religions, leaving [[household]] religious practice, and the relationships between these, under-investigated (a trend noted by Elson and Smith, 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  Ancient Mesoamerica, Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;).  Insoll (2004:9) argues that archaeologists may contribute to blurring the boundaries of world and indigenous religions.

The archaeology of religion also incorporates related anthropological or religious concepts and terms such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[tradition]], [[religious symbolism|symbolism]], and the [[sacred]].

==Theory==

===Anthropology of religion===

Theory within the archaeology of religion borrows heavily from the [[Anthropology of religion]], which encompasses a broad range of perspectives.  These include: [[Émile Durkheim]]’s functionalist understanding of religion as serving to separate the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]];&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile. (1998)  ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.’’  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]]’s idea of religion as “[[the opium of the people|the opium of the masses]]” or a [[false consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1992) ‘’Early Writings.’’  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Geertz]]’s loose definition of religion as a “system of symbols” that orders the world,&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford (1973:90) ''The Interpretation of Cultures.’’  New York: Basic Books.  P. 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Turner]]’s work on ritual, including [[rites of passage]] and [[liminality]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Victor (1995) ''The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure.’’  Aldine Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]]’s religious types &lt;ref&gt;Heydebrand, Wolf (1994) ‘’Sociological Writings: Max Weber.’’  Continuum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and thoughts on the relationship between economics and religion;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (2002) ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: and Other Writings.''  Trans. Peter Baehr.  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]’ structuralist understandings of [[totemism]] and [[myth]];&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Paul-François (2008) ‘’Lévi-Strauss on Religion: The Structuring Mind (Key Thinkers in the Study of Religion’’).  Equionox Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Douglas]]’ idea of the division of “[[Purity and Danger|purity and danger]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary (2003 [1966]) ''Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concept of Pullution and Taboo.''  Routledge Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion, identity, and practice===

Archaeological studies of religion increasingly recognize religion as an organizing principle in social life, rather than as a separate sphere of activity.  They include religion as an axis of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that structures social life and personal experience.  Therefore, entire artifact assemblages (rather than specifically “religious” artifacts, such as rosary beads) can be interpreted according to the ways that they simultaneously create, display, and constrain notions of self according to religious ideas.  For example, John Chenoweth (2009) &lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"&gt;Chenoweth, John M.  (2009)  Social identity, material culture, and the archaeology of religion: Quaker practices in context.  ''Journal of Social Archaeology'' 9: 319&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted ceramic assemblages and burials according to [[Quaker]] ideals of plainness and modesty.

Because social identity is both imposed and negotiated through social practice, including material practice, archaeologies of religion increasingly incorporate practice-based theory.  Building upon [[Anthony Giddens]]’ idea of structuration &lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1986) ‘’The Constitution of Society: Outline of A Theory of Structuration.’’  Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s ideas of both practice &lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1977) ‘’Outline of a Theory of Practice.’’  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural capital,&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1987) ‘’Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.’’  Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; theories of material practice posit that people use material goods to negotiate their places within social structures.  Examples of the archaeological interpretation of religion and ritual as part of social negotiation, transformation or reinforcement include Chenoweth’s work on [[Quaker]] religious practice,&lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"/&gt; Kyder-Reid’s work on the Southern Redemptorists,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.''  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Timothy Pauketat’s work on feasting in [[Cahokia]] (Pauketat et al., 2002 &lt;ref&gt;Pauketat, Timothy, Lucretia S. Kelly, Gayle J. Fritz, Neal H. Lopinot, Scott Elias, and Eve Hargrave (2002) The Residues of Feasting and Public Ritual at Cahokia.  ''American Antiquity,'' Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 257–279&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Religion, power, and inequality===

Because religion and political power are often intertwined&lt;ref&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics].  ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1991) ''Religious Regimes and State Formation: Perspectives From European Ethnography.''  State University of New York Press (August 13, 1991) {{ISBN|978-0791406519}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in early states, the archaeology of religion may also engage theories of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]].   John Janusek’s study of [[Tiwanaku]] religion, for example, explored the ways that religion served to integrate societies within the Andean state.&lt;ref&gt;Janusek, John Wayne (2006) The changing ‘nature’ of Tiwanaku religion and the rise of the Andean state.  ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 38(3): 469–492&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Colonialism|Colonial]] regimes frequently justified expansion through a commitment to religious conversion; archaeologies of coloniality may therefore intersect with the archaeology of religion.  James Delle’s 2001 article on [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] and landscape in [[Jamaica]] &lt;ref&gt;Delle, James (2001) Race, Missionaries, and the Struggle to Free Jamaica.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity.''  Charles E. Orser, Jr., ed.  Pp. 177–195.  Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Voss’ work on missions, [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[empire]] &lt;ref&gt;Voss, Barbara (2008) Domesticating Imperialism: Sexual Politics and the Archaeology of Empire.  ''American Anthropologist'' 110(2): 191–203&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate how religion has intersected with colonial regimes.

===Historical method and theory===

Historical archaeologists have made major contributions to the understanding of the religion and ritual of peoples who have remained underrepresented (or misrepresented) in the historical record, such as colonized peoples, indigenous peoples, and enslaved peoples.  Mandatory religious conversion was common in many colonial situations (e.g. the Spanish colonization of the Americas), which led to syncretic religious practice, rejection or resistance to new religions, covert practice of indigenous religions, and/or misunderstandings and misinterpretations of both indigenous and colonizer religions (Hanks 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. (2010).  ''Converting Words: Maya in the Age of the Cross''.  Berkeley: University of California Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Klor de Alva 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Klor de Alva, J. Jorge (1982).  Spiritual Conflict and Accommodation in New Spain: Toward a Typology of Aztec Responses to Christianity.  In George A. Collier, Renato Rosaldo, and John D. Wirth (eds), ''The Inca and Aztec States, 1400–1800: Anthropology and History.''  New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Wernke 2007&lt;ref name="Wernke, Steven 2007"&gt;Wernke, Steven (2007)  Analogy or Erasure?  Dialectics of Religious Transformation in the Early Doctrinas of the Colca Valley, Peru.  ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;).

This research combines archaeological and anthropological method and theory with historical method and theory.  In addition to recovering, recording, and analyzing material culture, historical archaeologists use archives, oral histories, ethnohistorical accounts.  Researchers read texts critically, emphasizing the historical context of the documents (especially regarding underrepresented peoples whose voices may be distorted or missing) in order to better understand religious practices that may have been discouraged or even severely punished.  Combined archaeological, historical, and anthropological data sets may contradict each other, or the material record may illuminate the details of covert or syncretic religious practice, as well as resistance to dominant religious forms. For example, our understanding of the religious practice of enslaved peoples in the United States (e.g. Leone and Frye 2001,&lt;ref name="Leone, Mark P 2001"&gt;Leone, Mark P. and Gladys Marie Frye (2001) A Coherent Religion among African Slaves.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity'', ed. By C. Orser.  University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; Fennell 2007 &lt;ref name="Fennell, Christopher 2007"&gt;Fennell, Christopher (2007) ''Crossroads and Cosmologies: Diasporas and Ethnogenesis in the New World''.  University of Florida Press,&lt;/ref&gt;) has increased dramatically thanks to research in historical archaeology.

== Material correlates==

Because archaeology studies human history through objects, buildings, bodies, and spaces, archaeologists must engage theories that connect anthropological and sociological theories of religion to [[material culture]] and landscapes. Theories of materiality &lt;ref&gt;Meskell, Lynn (2005) ''Archaeologies of Materiality.''  Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and landscape &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Matthew (2006) ''Ideas of Landscape.'' Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; serve to connect human activities, experiences, and behaviors to social practices, including religion.  Theories of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] &lt;ref&gt;Hammelkis, Yannis, Mark Pluciennik, and Sarah Tarlow (eds) (2001) ''Thinking Through the Body: Archaeologies of Corporeality.''  Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; also serve to interpret human remains as they relate to religion and ritual.

The archaeology of religion makes use of the same material evidence as other branches of archaeology, but certain artifact classes are particularly emphasized in studying religion and ritual in the past:

*'''Human remains and [[burial]] assemblages''' can offer many clues to religious and ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Christopher (1995) Mortuary Practices: Their Social, Philosophical-Religious, Circumstantial, and Physical Determinants.  ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 105–200&lt;/ref&gt;  Human remains themselves are used in all branches of archaeology for information on sex, age, occupation, and disease.  Methods of interment (including burial position, cremation, burial location, primary and secondary burials, etc.) contribute to understanding changing religious practice, as well as social difference within groups (e.g. Lohmann 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, Roger Ivar (2005) The Afterlife of Asabano Corpses: Relationships with the Deceased in Papua New Guinea.  ''Ethnology,'' Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 189–206&lt;/ref&gt;).  Total burial contexts, i.e., the setting, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[ecofacts]], and human remains themselves, may provide evidence of religious beliefs about [[death]] and the afterworld.
*'''Religious buildings''', such as [[temple]] complexes, [[kivas]], and missions, are often used to examine communal religious and ritual activity (e.g. Barnes 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina L. (1995) An Introduction to Buddhist Archaeology.  ‘’World Archaeology,’’ Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 165–182&lt;/ref&gt; Graham 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Elizabeth (1998) Mission Archaeology.  ‘’Annual Review of Anthropology’’, Vol. 27, pp. 25–62&lt;/ref&gt; Reid ''et al.'' 1997 &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Andrew, Paul Lane, Alinah Segobye, Lowe Borjeson, Nonofo Mathibidi, and Princess Sekgarametso (1997) Tswana Architecture and Responses to Colonialism.  ''World Archaeology,'' Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 370–392&lt;/ref&gt; ).  Part of [[archaeoastronomy]] is the investigation of how buildings are aligned to astral bodies and events, such as solstices, which often coincide with religious or ritual activities.  Archaeological examinations of religious buildings can reveal unequal access to religious knowledge and ritual.  Religious buildings frequently contain religious iconography that provides insight into the symbolic dimensions of religious life.
*Within landscape archaeology, '''sacred [[landscapes]]''' are an increasingly important focus of study (e.g. Clendinnen 1980 &lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest.  ''Comparative Studies in Society and History,'' Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393
&lt;/ref&gt;). Landscapes are imbued with sacred meaning throughout the world; [[aboriginal Australian]] [[songlines]], and the related belief that mythical events are marked on the landscape, are one example.  Human modifications to landscapes, such as Kyder-Reid’s study of the Redemtorists’ modifications of their estate to emphasize communality,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. '' Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; may point to the enactment of religious views.

*'''Religious iconography, [[symbols]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Robb, John E. (1998) The Archaeology of Symbols.  ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 27, pp. 329–346&lt;/ref&gt; '''ethnographic texts and ethnographic analogy''' are important tools that archaeologists use to compare with the material record to examine religions in the past (e.g. Clendinnen 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest. ‘’ Comparative Studies in Society and History,’’ Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393&lt;/ref&gt; Elson and Smith 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ''Ancient Mesoamerica,'' Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;). Though texts are not direct “windows to the past,” particularly for societies with few or no written records, they are valuable lines of evidence that may be contradicted or supported by the material record.
*'''Common artifact classes''' such as [[ceramic art|ceramics]] have been increasingly reinterpreted within a religious framework. According to the idea of religion as a form of social practice and a total worldview, any artifact may potentially be used to embody religious ideas and ideals in material form.  Patterns of artifact and [[ecofact]] use within ritual contexts may expose preferences or sacred meanings of certain materials; the ritual use of [[pine]] among the ancient Maya is one example (Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Morehart, Christopher T., David L. Lentz, and Keith M. Prufer (2005)  Wood of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Pine (PINUS SPP.) by the Ancient Lowland Maya.  ''Latin American Antiquity'’, 16(3), pp. 255–274&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Modern religious use of archaeological sites===
Contemporary religious groups often claim archaeological sites as part of their heritage, and make use of archaeological sites and artifacts in their religious practice (e.g. Wallis 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Robert J. and Jenny Blain (2003) Sites, Sacredness, and Stories: Interactions of Archaeology and Contemporary Paganism.  ‘’Folklore’’, Vol. 114, No. 3, pp. 307–321&lt;/ref&gt;).  These practices and religious interpretations of sites may clash with archaeological interpretations, leading to disputes about heritage, preservation, use of sites, and the “ownership” of history (Bender 1999 &lt;ref&gt;Bender, Barbara (1999) ‘’Stonehenge: Making Space’’.  Berg Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Biblical archaeology===
Biblical archaeology is a field of archaeology that seeks to correlate events in the Bible with concrete archaeological sites and artifacts (Meyers 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Eric M. (1984) The Bible and Archaeology.  ‘’The Biblical Archaeologist,’’ Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 36–40&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson 1916&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G.H. (1916) The Value of Biblical Archaeology.  ‘’The Biblical World,’’ Vol. 47, No. 6, pp. 381–387&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bibliographic coupling occurs when two works [[citation|reference]] a common third work in their [[Bibliography|bibliographies]]. It is an indication that a probability exists that the two works treat a related subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martyn | first1 = J | year = 1964 | title = Bibliographic coupling | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 20 | issue = 4| page = 236 | doi=10.1108/eb026352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two documents are ''bibliographically coupled'' if they both ''cite'' one or more documents in common. The "coupling strength" of two given documents is higher the more citations to other documents they share. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of bibliographic coupling. In the figure, documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E. Thus, documents A and B have a bibliographic coupling strength of 3 - the number of elements in the intersection of their two reference lists.

Similarly, two authors are ''bibliographically coupled'' if the cumulative reference lists of their respective oeuvres each contain a reference to a common document, and their coupling strength also increases with the citations to other documents that their share. If the cumulative reference list of an author's oeuvre is determined as the [[multiset]] union of the documents that the author has co-authored, then the ''author bibliographic coupling strength'' of two authors (or more precisely, of their oeuvres) is defined as the size of the multiset intersection of their cumulative reference lists, however.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = D. | last2 = Strotmann | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Evolution of research activities and intellectual influences in information science 1996–2005: Introducing author bibliographic-coupling analysis | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 59 | issue = 13| pages = 2070–2086 | doi = 10.1002/asi.20910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic coupling can be useful in a wide variety of fields, since it helps researchers find related research done in the past. On the other hand, two documents are '''[[Co-citation|co-cited]]''' if they are both independently ''cited by'' one or more documents.

==History==
The concept of '''bibliographic coupling''' was introduced by M. M. Kessler of [[MIT]] in a paper published in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliographic coupling between scientific papers," ''American Documentation'' 24 (1963), pp. 123-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been embraced in the work of the information scientist [[Eugene Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Multiple Independent Discovery and Creativity in Science," ''Current Contents'', Nov. 3, 1980, pp. 5-10, reprinted in [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays.html Essays of an Information Scientist], vol. 4 (1979-80), pp. 660-665.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest citation analysis methods for document similarity computation and some have questioned its usefulness, pointing out that two works may reference completely unrelated subject matter in the third. Furthermore, bibliographic coupling is a retrospective similarity measure,&lt;ref&gt;Garfield Eugene, 2001.[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/drexelbelvergriffith92001.pdf ''From Bibliographic Coupling to Co-Citation Analysis via Algorithmic Historio-Bibliography''] presented at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents lies in the past and is static, i.e. bibliographic coupling strength cannot change over time, since outgoing citation counts are fixed.

The [[Co-citation|'''co-citation''' analysis]] approach introduced by Henry Small and published in 1973 addressed this shortcoming of bibliographic coupling by considering a document's incoming citations to assess similarity, a measure that can change over time. Additionally, the co-citation measure reflects the opinion of many authors and thus represents a better indicator of subject similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Small, 1973. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf "Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202085010/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' (JASIS), volume 24(4), pp. 265-269. doi = 10.1002/asi.4630240406&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Robert Amsler published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Robert Amsler, Dec. 1972 [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL12801639W/Applications_of_citation-based_automatic_classification?v=2 "Applications of citation-based automatic classification"], Linguistics Research Center, University Texas at Austin, Technical Report 72-14.&lt;/ref&gt; describing a measure for determining subject similarity between two documents by fusing bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webla.sourceforge.net/javadocs/pt/tumba/links/Amsler.html Class Amsler] written by Bruno Martins and developed by the XLDB group of the ''Department of Informatics'' of the ''Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon'' in Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Howard White and Belver Griffith introduced author co-citation analysis (ACA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Howard D. | last2 = Griffith | first2 = Belver C. | year = 1981 | title = Author Cocitation: A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 163–171 | doi = 10.1002/asi.4630320302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 2008 did Dangzhi Zhao and Andreas Strotmann combine their work and that of M. M. Kessler to define author bibliographic coupling analysis (ABCA), noting that as long as authors are active this metric is not static and that it is particularly useful when combined with ACA.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"/&gt;

More recently, in 2009, Gipp and Beel introduced a new approach termed [[Co-citation Proximity Analysis]] (CPA). CPA is based on the concept of co-citation, but represents a refinement to Small's measure in that CPA additionally considers the placement and proximity of citations within a document's full-text. The assumption is that citations in closer proximity are more likely to exhibit a stronger similarity relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 [http://gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp09a.pdf Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) – ''A new approach for identifying related work based on Co-Citation Analysis''] in Proceedings of the 12th international conference on scientometrics and informetrics (issi’09), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), 2009, pp. 571-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, a chronological overview of citation analysis methods includes: 
* Bibliographic coupling (1963) 
* Co-citation analysis (published 1973) 
* Amsler measure (1972)
* Author co-citation analysis (1981)
* Author bibliographic coupling analysis (2008)
* Co-citation proximity analysis (CPA) (2009)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11267">[[File:Bingham_mayo.jpg|thumb|302px|[[Mayonnaise]] is a Bingham plastic. The surface has ridges and peaks because Bingham plastics mimic solids under low shear stresses.]]
A '''Bingham plastic''' is a [[viscoplastic]] material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses but flows as a [[viscosity|viscous]] [[fluid]] at high stress. It is named after [[Eugene C. Bingham]] who proposed its mathematical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=E.C. |last= Bingham| year=1916 |journal=US Bureau of Standards Bulletin| volume=13 |pages= 309–353 |title= An Investigation of the Laws of Plastic Flow |doi=10.6028/bulletin.304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as a common [[mathematical model]] of [[mud]] flow in [[drilling engineering]], and in the handling of [[slurry|slurries]]. A common example is [[toothpaste]],&lt;ref name=Steffe&gt;{{cite book| first=J.F.| last= Steffe |year=1996| title=Rheological Methods in Food Process Engineering| edition=2nd |isbn= 0-9632036-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will not be [[extruded]] until a certain [[pressure]] is applied to the tube. It is then pushed out as a solid plug.

==Explanation==
[[File:Bingham1a.svg|thumb|left|302px|Figure 1. Bingham Plastic flow as described by Bingham]] 
'''Figure 1''' shows a graph of the behaviour of an ordinary viscous (or Newtonian) fluid in red, for example in a pipe. If the pressure at one end of a pipe is increased this produces a stress on the fluid tending to make it move (called the [[shear stress]]) and the volumetric flow rate increases proportionally. However, for a Bingham Plastic fluid (in blue), stress can be applied but it will not flow until a certain value, the [[yield stress]], is reached. Beyond this point the flow rate increases steadily with increasing shear stress. This is roughly the way in which Bingham presented his observation, in an experimental study of paints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=E.C. |last=Bingham |year= 1922| title= Fluidity and Plasticity| publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |location= New York| page= 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties allow a Bingham plastic to have a textured surface with peaks and ridges instead of a featureless surface like a [[Newtonian fluid]]. 
[[File:Bingham2a.svg|thumb|right|302px|Figure 2. Bingham Plastic flow as described currently]]
'''Figure 2''' shows the way in which it is normally presented currently.&lt;ref name=Steffe/&gt; The graph shows [[shear stress]] on the vertical axis and [[shear rate]] on the horizontal one. (Volumetric flow rate depends on the size of the pipe, shear rate is a measure of how the velocity changes with distance. It is proportional to flow rate, but does not depend on pipe size.) As before, the Newtonian fluid flows and gives a shear rate for any finite value of shear stress. However, the Bingham plastic again does not exhibit any shear rate (no flow and thus no velocity) until a certain stress is achieved. For the Newtonian fluid the slope of this line is the [[viscosity]], which is the only parameter needed to describe its flow. By contrast, the Bingham plastic requires two parameters, the '''yield stress''' and the slope of the line, known as the '''plastic viscosity'''.

The physical reason for this behaviour is that the liquid contains particles (such as clay) or large molecules (such as polymers) which have some kind of interaction, creating a weak solid structure, formerly known as a '''false body''', and a certain amount of stress is required to break this structure. Once the structure has been broken, the particles move with the liquid under viscous forces. If the stress is removed, the particles associate again.

==Definition==
The material is an elastic solid for [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, less than a critical value &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt;. Once the critical shear [[shear stress|stress]] (or "[[yield (engineering)|yield stress]]") is exceeded, the material flows in such a way that the [[shear rate]], ∂''u''/∂''y'' (as defined in the article on viscosity), is directly proportional to the amount by which the applied shear stress exceeds the yield stress:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial u} {\partial y} = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \tau &lt; \tau_0 \\ (\tau - \tau_0) / \mu_\infty, &amp; \tau \ge \tau_0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Friction factor formulae==
In fluid flow, it is a common problem to calculate the pressure drop in an established piping network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics. | first1=Ron | last1=Darby | publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-8247-0444-4| chapter= Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the friction factor, ''f'', is known, it becomes easier to handle different pipe-flow problems, viz. calculating the pressure drop for evaluating pumping costs or to find the flow-rate in a piping network for a given pressure drop. It is usually extremely difficult to arrive at exact analytical solution to calculate the friction factor associated with flow of non-Newtonian fluids and therefore explicit approximations are used to calculate it. Once the friction factor has been calculated the pressure drop can be easily determined for a given flow by the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;  f = {2 h_f g D \over L V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ h_f}&lt;/math&gt; is the frictional head loss  ([[SI units]]: m)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ f}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Darcy friction factor]]  (SI units: Dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ L}&lt;/math&gt; is the pipe length  (SI units: m)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration  (SI units: m/s²)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ D}&lt;/math&gt; is the pipe diameter  (SI units: m)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ V}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean fluid velocity  (SI units: m/s)

===Laminar flow===
An exact description of friction loss for Bingham plastics in fully developed laminar pipe flow was first published by Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Buckingham| first= E.|year= 1921| title= On Plastic Flow Through Capillary Tubes| journal= ASTM Proceedings| volume=21| pages=1154–1156}}&lt;/ref&gt; His expression, the ''Buckingham–Reiner'' equation, can be written in a dimensionless form as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ f_L = \ {64 \over \mathrm{Re}}\left[1 + {\mathrm{He}\over 6 \mathrm{Re}} - {1\over3} \left( {\mathrm{He}^4 \over f^3 \mathrm{Re}^7}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ f}&lt;/math&gt; is the laminar flow Darcy friction factor  (SI units: dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \mathrm{Re}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Reynolds number]]  (SI units: dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \mathrm{He}}&lt;/math&gt; is the Hedstrom number  (SI units: dimensionless)

The [[Reynolds number]] and the Hedstrom number are respectively defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re} = { \rho V D  \over \mu}, &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{He} = { \rho D^2 \tau_o \over \mu^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of fluid  (SI units: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic viscosity of fluid  (SI units: kg/m s)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \tau_o}&lt;/math&gt; is the yield point (yield strength) of fluid  (SI units: MPa)

===Turbulent flow===
Darby and Melson developed an empirical expression &lt;ref name=Darby&gt;Darby, R. and Melson J.(1981). "How to predict the friction factor for flow of Bingham plastics". ''Chemical Engineering'' '''28''': 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
that was then refined, and is given by:&lt;ref name=Darbyetal&gt;{{cite journal| last=Darby| first= R. |date= September 1992| title= Prediction friction loss in slurry pipes| journal= Chemical Engineering |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_T = 4*10^a \mathrm{Re}^{-0.193} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ f_T}&lt;/math&gt; is the turbulent flow friction factor (SI units: dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt; a = -1.47\left[1 + 0.146 e^{-2.9\times {10^{-5}}\mathrm{He}} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
Note: Darby and Melson's expression is for a Fanning friction factor, and needs to be multiplied by 4 to be used in the friction loss equations located elsewhere on this page.

==Approximations of the Buckingham–Reiner equation==
Although an exact analytical solution of the Buckingham–Reiner equation can be obtained because it is a fourth order polynomial equation in ''f'', due to complexity of the solution it is rarely employed. Therefore, researchers have tried to develop explicit approximations for the Buckingham–Reiner equation.

===Swamee–Aggarwal equation===
The Swamee–Aggarwal equation is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor ''f'' for laminar flow of Bingham plastic fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Swamee, P.K. and Aggarwal, N.(2011). "Explicit equations for laminar flow of Bingham plastic fluids". ''Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering''. {{doi|10.1016/j.petrol.2011.01.015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approximation of the implicit ''Buckingham–Reiner'' equation, but the discrepancy from experimental data is well within the accuracy of the data.
The Swamee–Aggarwal equation is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; f_L = {64 \over \mathrm{Re}} + {64 \over \mathrm{Re}} \left( {\mathrm{He}\over 6.2218 \mathrm{Re}}\right)^{0.958}&lt;/math&gt;

===Danish–Kumar solution===
Danish ''et al.'' have provided an explicit procedure to calculate the friction factor ''f'' by using the Adomian decomposition method.&lt;ref&gt;Danish, M. ''et al.'' (1981). "Approximate explicit analytical expressions of friction factor for flow
of Bingham fluids in smooth pipes using Adomian decomposition method". ''Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation'' '''16''': 239–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The friction factor containing two terms through this method is given as:

:&lt;math&gt; f_L = \frac{K_1 + \dfrac{4 K_2}{\left( K_1 + \frac{K_1 K_2}{K_1^4 + 3 K_2}\right)^3}}{1+ \dfrac{3 K_2}{\left(K_1 + \frac{K_1 K_2}{K_1^4 + 3 K_2}\right)^4}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; K_1 = {16 \over \mathrm{Re}} + {16 \mathrm{He} \over 6\mathrm{Re}^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; K_2 = - {16 \mathrm{He}^4 \over 3\mathrm{Re}^8}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Combined equation for friction factor for all flow regimes==

===Darby–Melson equation===
In 1981, Darby and Melson, using the approach of Churchill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Churchill| first=S.W. |date= November 7, 1977| title= Friction factor equation spans all fluid-flow regimes| journal= Chemical Engineering| pages= 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Churchill and Usagi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Churchill| first1=S.W. |last2= Usagi| first2= R.A. |year= 1972| title= A general expression for the correlation of rates of transfer and other phenomena| journal= AIChE Journal| volume= 18| number=6| pages= 1121–1128| doi=10.1002/aic.690180606}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an expression to get a single friction factor equation valid for all flow regimes:&lt;ref name=Darby/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f = \left[{f_L}^m + {f_T}^m \right]^{1/m}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt; m = 1.7 + {40000\over \mathrm{Re}} &lt;/math&gt;

Both Swamee–Aggarwal equation and the Darby–Melson equation can be combined to give an explicit equation for determining the friction factor of Bingham plastic fluids in any regime. Relative roughness is not a parameter in any of the equations because the friction factor of Bingham plastic fluids is not sensitive to pipe roughness.

{{Paleontology}}
'''Biostratigraphy''' is the branch of [[stratigraphy]] which focuses on correlating and assigning relative ages of rock [[Stratum|strata]] by using the [[fossil]] assemblages contained within them. Usually the aim is correlation, demonstrating that a particular [[Horizon (geology)|horizon]] in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at some other section. The fossils are useful because [[sediment]]s of the same age can look completely different because of local variations in the [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environment]]. For example, one section might have been made up of [[clay]]s and [[marl]]s while another has more [[chalk]]y [[limestone]]s, but if the fossil species recorded are similar, the two sediments are likely to have been laid down at the same time.

Biostratigraphy originated in the early 19th century, where geologists recognised that the correlation of fossil assemblages between rocks of similar type but different age decreased as the difference in age increased.  The method was well-established before [[Charles Darwin]] explained the mechanism behind it—[[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Archeocyathids.JPG|thumb|The first reef builder is a worldwide index fossil for the Lower Cambrian]]
[[Ammonite]]s, [[graptolite]]s, [[archeocyathid]]s, and [[trilobite]]s are [[index fossil]]s that are widely used in biostratigraphy. [[micropaleontology|Microfossils]] such as [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[conodont]]s, [[dinoflagellate]] cysts,  [[ostracods]], [[pollen]], [[spores]] and [[foraminifera]]ns are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; trilobites, for example, are particularly useful for sediments of [[Cambrian]] age. To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can occur in many different places. They must also be short lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favoured over forms that evolve much more slowly, like [[nautiloid]]s.  Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a fauna, not an individual species, as this allows greater precision. Further, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range.  For instance, the presence of the trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Fossil assemblages were traditionally used to designate the duration of periods. Since a large change in fauna was required to make early stratigraphers create a new period, most of the periods we recognise today are terminated by a major extinction event or faunal turnover.

== Fossils as a basis for stratigraphic subdivision ==

===Concept of stage===
{{further|Faunal stage}}
A stage is a major subdivision of strata, each systematically following the other each bearing a unique assemblage of fossils. Therefore, stages can be defined as a group of strata containing the same major fossil assemblages. French [[palaeontologist]] [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] is credited for the invention of this concept. He named stages after geographic localities with particularly good sections of rock strata that bear the characteristic fossils on which the stages are based.

===Concept of zone===
{{further|Chronozone}}
In 1856 German palaeontologist [[Albert Oppel]] introduced the concept of zone (also known as biozones or Oppel zone). A zone includes strata characterised by the overlapping range of fossils. They represent the time between the appearance of species chosen at the base of the zone and the appearance of other species chosen at the base of the next succeeding zone. Oppel's zones are named after a particular distinctive fossil species, called an index fossil. Index fossils are one of the species from the assemblage of species that characterise the zone. 

The zone is the fundamental biostratigraphic unit. Its thickness range from a few to hundreds of metres, and its extant range from local to worldwide. Biostratigraphic units are divided into six principal kinds of biozones:
*''Taxon range biozone'' represent the known stratigraphic and geographic range of occurrence of a single taxon.
*''Concurrent range biozone'' include the concurrent, coincident, or overlapping part of the range of two specified taxa.
*''Interval biozone'' include the strata between two specific biostratigraphic surfaces. It can be based on lowest or highest occurrences.
*''Lineage biozone'' are strata containing species representing a specific segment of an evolutionary lineage.
*''Assemblage biozones'' are strata that contain a unique association of three or more taxa.
*''Abundance biozone'' are strata in which the abundance of a particular taxon or group of taxa is significantly greater than in the adjacent part of the section.

====Index fossils====
[[Image:DiplograptusCaneySprings.jpg|thumb|''Amplexograptus'', a [[graptolite]] index fossil, from the [[Ordovician]] near Caney Springs, [[Tennessee]].]]
To be useful in stratigraphic correlation index fossils should be:
*Independent of their environment
*Geographically widespread (provincialism/isolation of species should be avoided as much as possible)
*Rapidly evolving

*Easy to preserve (Easier in low-energy, non-oxidized environment)
*Easy to identify
====Faunal succession====
Fossil organisms succeed one           
another in a definite and determinable order and  
therefore any time period can be recognized by its 
fossil content.

'''Bone healing''', or '''fracture healing''', is a [[Cell growth|proliferative]] [[physiological]] process in which the body facilitates the repair of a [[bone fracture]].

Generally [[bone fracture#Treatment|bone fracture treatment]] consists of a doctor reducing (pushing) displaced bones back into place via relocation with or without anaesthetic, stabilizing their position to aid union, and then waiting for the bone's natural healing process to occur.

Adequate nutrient intake has been found to significantly affect the integrity of the fracture repair.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title=How to Speed Fracture Healing | author=Susan E. Brown, PhD | url=http://www.sygdoms.com/pdf/fracture/8.pdf | publisher=Center for Better Bones | quote=While no scientist has yet conducted a clinical trial using all 20 key nutrients for fracture healing, several studies have found multi-nutrient therapy to reduce complication and accelerate fracture healing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age, Bone type, drug therapy and pre existing bone pathology are factors which affect healing. The role of bone healing is to produce new bone without a scar as seen in other tissues which would be a structural weakness or deformity.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez-Barrena E, Rosset P, Lozano D, Stanovici J, Ermthaller C, Gerbhard F. Bone fracture healing: Cell therapy in delayed unions and nonunions. ''Bone''. 2015;70:93–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of the entire regeneration of the bone can depend on the angle of dislocation or fracture. While the bone formation usually spans the entire duration of the healing process, in some instances, bone marrow within the fracture has healed two or fewer weeks before the final remodeling phase.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

While immobilization and surgery may facilitate healing, a fracture ultimately heals through physiological processes. The healing process is mainly determined by the [[periosteum]] (the [[connective tissue]] membrane covering the bone). The periosteum is one source of precursor cells which develop into [[chondroblasts]] and [[osteoblasts]] that are essential to the [[healing]] of bone. Other sources of precursor cells are the [[bone marrow]] (when present), [[endosteum]], small [[blood vessels]], and [[fibroblasts]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferretti C, Mattioli-Belmonte M. Periosteum derived stem cells for regenerative medicine proposals: Boosting current knowledge. ''World Journal of Stem Cells''. 2014;6(3):266-277. doi:10.4252/wjsc.v6.i3.266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary healing==
Primary healing (also known as direct healing) requires a correct anatomical reduction which is stable, without any gap formation. Such healing requires only the remodeling of lamellar bone, the [[Haversian canal]]s and the blood vessels without [[fibrocartilage callus|callus]] formation. This process may take a few months to a few years.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt;

===Contact healing===
When the gap between the bone ends is less than 0.01 mm, and interfragmentary strain is less than 2%, contact healing can occur. In this case, cutting cones, which consists of osteoclasts, form across the fracture lines, generating cavities at a rate of 50–100 μm/day. Osteoblasts fill up the cavities with the Haversian system. This caused the formation of lamellar bone that oriented longitudinally along the long axis of the bone. Blood vessels form that penetrate the Harversian system. Remodelling of [[lamellar bone]] results in healing without [[fibrocartilage callus|callus]] formation.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt;

===Gap healing===
If the fracture gap is 800 μm to 1 mm, the fracture is filled by osteoclasts and then by lamellar bone oriented perpendicular to the axis of the bone. This orientation of lamellar bone is weak, thus a secondary osteonal reconstruction is required to re-orient the lamellar bone longitudinally. This process takes three to eight weeks.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt;

== Secondary healing ==
Secondary healing (also known as indirect fracture healing) is the most common form of bone healing. It usually consists of only [[endochondral ossification]]. Sometimes, [[intramembranous ossification]] occurs together with endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification, mediated by [[periosteum|perisoteal]] layer of bone, occurs without formation of [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]]. For endochondral ossification, deposition of bone only occurs after the mineralised cartilage.&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt; This process of healing occurs when the fracture is treated conservatively using [[orthopaedic cast]] or immobilisation, [[external fixation]], or [[internal fixation]].&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Marsell|last2=Thomas A|first2=Einhorn|title=The biology of fracture healing|journal=Injury|date=1 June 2012|volume=42|issue=6|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2011.03.031|pmid=21489527|pmc=3105171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major phases of fracture healing, two of which can be further sub-divided to make a total of five phases:&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahamutha|first1=Affshana|last2=JothiPriya|first2=Saveethna|title=Healing Mechanism in Bone Fracture|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research|date=2015|volume=7|issue=7|pages=441-442|url=http://www.jpsr.pharmainfo.in/Documents/Volumes/vol7Issue07/jpsr07071511.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction ===
After [[Bone fracture|fracture]], blood cells accumulate adjacent to the injury site. Soon after fracture, blood vessels constrict, stopping further bleeding. Within a few hours, the extravascular blood cells form a clot called a [[hematoma]]&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015" /&gt; that acts as a template for callus formation. These cells, including [[macrophage]]s, release inflammatory mediators such as cytokines ([[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNFα), [[interleukin-1 family]] (IL-1), [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6), [[Interleukin 11|11]] (IL-11), and [[Interleukin 18|18]] (IL-18)) and increase blood capillary permeability. Inflammation peaks by 24 hours and completes by seven days. Through [[tumor necrosis factor receptor 1]] (TNFR1) and [[tumor necrosis factor receptor 2]], TNFα mediates the differentiation of [[mesenchymal stem cell]] (originated from the [[bone marrow]]) into [[osteoblast]] and [[chondrocyte]]s. [[Stromal cell-derived factor 1]] (SDF-1) and [[CXCR4]] mediate recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells. IL-1 and IL-6 are the most important cytokines for bone healing. IL-1 promotes formation of callus and of blood vessels. IL-6 promotes differentiation of osteoblasts and [[osteoclast]]s.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012" /&gt; All cells within the blood clot degenerate and die. Within this area, the [[fibroblast]]s replicate. Within 7-14 days, they form a loose aggregate of cells, interspersed with small blood vessels, known as [[granulation tissue]].&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015" /&gt; Osteoclasts move in to reabsorb dead bone ends, and other necrotic tissue is removed.&lt;ref name="Nyary Tamas 2015 p 7-14"&gt;Nyary Tamas, Scamell BE. (2015). Principles of bone and joint injuries and their healing. ''Surgery(Oxford)''. 33 (1), p 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repair ===
[[File:Scaphoid fracture with a radiolucent line after 12 days.jpg|thumb|Radiolucency around a 12 day old [[scaphoid fracture]] that was initially barely visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarraya|first1=Mohamed|last2=Hayashi|first2=Daichi|last3=Roemer|first3=Frank W.|last4=Crema|first4=Michel D.|last5=Diaz|first5=Luis|last6=Conlin|first6=Jane|last7=Marra|first7=Monica D.|last8=Jomaah|first8=Nabil|last9=Guermazi|first9=Ali|title=Radiographically Occult and Subtle Fractures: A Pictorial Review|journal=Radiology Research and Practice|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1–10|issn=2090-1941|doi=10.1155/2013/370169}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ CC-BY 3.0]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Seven to nine days after fracture, the cells of the [[periosteum]] replicate and transform. The periosteal cells [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal to (on the near side of)]] the fracture gap develop into [[chondroblast]]s, which form [[hyaline cartilage]]. The periosteal cells [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal to (at the far end of)]] the fracture gap develop into [[osteoblast]]s, which form [[Bone#Woven vs. lamellar bone|woven bone]]&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt; through [[bone resorption]] of calcified cartilage and recruitment of bone cells and osteoclasts.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt; The fibroblasts within the granulation tissue develop into chondroblasts which also form hyaline cartilage. These two new tissues grow in size until they unite with each other. These processes culminate in a new mass of heterogeneous tissue known as a [[Fibrocartilage callus|fracture callus]].&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt; Callus formation peaks at day 14 of fracture.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt; Eventually, the fracture gap is bridged.&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt;

The next phase is the replacement of the hyaline cartilage and woven bone with [[Bone#Extracellular|lamellar bone]]. The replacement process is known as [[endochondral ossification]] with respect to the hyaline cartilage and bony substitution with respect to the woven bone. Substitution of woven bone happens before substitution of hyaline cartilage. The lamellar bone begins forming soon after the collagen matrix of either tissue becomes mineralized.&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt; At this stage, the process is induced by IL-1 and TNFα.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt;  The mineralized matrix is penetrated by [[microvessel]] and numerous [[osteoblast]]s. The osteoblasts form new lamellar bone upon the recently exposed surface of the mineralized matrix. This new lamellar bone is in the form of  [[Cancellous bone|trabecular bone]]. Eventually, all of the woven bone and cartilage of the original fracture callus is replaced by trabecular bone, restoring most of the bone's original strength.&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt;

=== Remodelling ===
[[bone remodeling|Remodeling]] begins as early as three to four weeks after fracture and may take 3 to 5 years to complete.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt; The process substitutes the trabecular bone with [[compact bone]].  The trabecular bone is first resorbed by [[osteoclast]]s, creating a shallow resorption pit known as a "Howship's lacuna". Then osteoblasts deposit compact bone within the resorption pit. Eventually, the fracture callus is remodelled into a new shape which closely duplicates the bone's original shape and strength. This process can be achieved by the formation of electrical polarity during partial weight bearing a long bone;&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt; where electropositive convex surface and electronegative concave surface activates osteoclasts and osteoblasts respectively.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt; This process can be enhanced by certain synthetic injectable biomaterials, such as [[bonesupport|Cerament]], which are osteoconductive and promote bone healing.&lt;ref name="Mahamutha 2015"/&gt;

=== Obstructions ===
[[File:Photographs of surgical cases and specimens (1865) (14762515012).jpg|thumb|Femur (top) healed while improperly aligned]]
# Poor blood supply which leads to the death of the osteocytes. Bone cell death also depends on degree of fracture and disruption to the Haversian system.
# Condition of the soft tissues. Soft tissue between bone ends restricts healing.
# Nutrition and drug therapy. Poor general health reduces healing rate. Drugs that impair the inflammatory response impede healing also.
# Infection. Diverts the inflammatory response away from healing towards fighting off the infection.
# Age. Young bone unites more rapidly than adult bone. 
# Pre-existing bone malignancy.
# Mechanical factors such as the bone not being aligned, and too much or too little movement. Excess mobility can disrupt the bridging callus, interfering with union; but slight biomechanical motion is seen to improve callus formation.&lt;ref name="Nyary Tamas 2015 p 7-14"/&gt;

===Complications===
Complications of fracture healing include:
# Infection: this is the most common complication of fractures and predominantly occurs in open fractures.  Post-traumatic wound infection is the most common cause of chronic osteomyelitis in patients.  Osteomyelitis can also occur following surgical fixation of a fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowbotham|first1=Emma|last2=Barron|first2=Dominic|title=Radiology of fracture complications|journal=Orthopaedics and Trauma|date=2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=52–60|doi=10.1016/j.mporth.2008.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Nonunion|Non-union]]: no progression of healing within six months of a fracture occurring.  The fracture pieces remain separated and can be caused by infection and/or lack of blood supply (Ischaemia) to the bone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahagirdar|first1=Rajeev|last2=Scammell|first2=Brigitte E|title=Principles of fracture healing and disorders of bone union|journal=Surgery|date=2008|volume=27|issue=2|pages=63–69|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2008.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of non-union, atrophic and hypertrophic. Hypertrophic involves the formation of excess callus leading to bone ends appearing sclerotic causing a  radiological  "Elephants Foot" appearance&lt;ref name="Nyary Tamas 2015 p 7-14"/&gt; due to excessive fracture ends mobility but adequate blood supply.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt; Atrophic non-union results in re-absorption and rounding of bone ends&lt;ref name="Nyary Tamas 2015 p 7-14"/&gt; due to inadequate blood supply and excessive mobility of the bone ends.&lt;ref name="Richard 2012"/&gt;
#[[Malunion|Mal-union]]: healing occurs but the healed bone has 'angular deformity, translation, or rotational alignment that requires surgical correction'.  This is most common in long bones such as the femur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Andrew T|last2=Vallier|first2=Heather A|title=Noncontiguous and open fractures of the lower extremity: Epidemiology, complications, and unplanned procedures|journal=Injury|date=2016|volume=47|issue=3|pages=742–747|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2015.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Delayed union: healing times vary depending on the location of a fracture and the age of a patient.  Delayed union is characterised by 'persistence of the fracture line and a scarcity or absence of callus formation' on x-ray.  Healing is still occurring but at a much slower rate than normal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Children's geographies''' is an area of study within [[human geography]] and [[Childhood studies]] which involves researching the places and spaces of children's lives.

==Context==
Children's geographies is the branch of human geography which deals with the study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterised experientially, politically and ethically.

Ever since the cultural turn in geography, there has been recognition that society is not homogenous but heterogeneous. It is characterized by diversity, differences and subjectivities. While feminist geographers had been able to strengthen the need for examination of gender, class and race as issues affecting women, 'children' as an umbrella term encompassing children, teenagers, youths and young people, which are still relatively missing a 'frame of reference' in the complexities of 'geographies'. In the act of theorizing children and their geographies, the ways of doing research and the assumed ontological realities often "frame 'children' and 'adults' in ways that impose a bi-polar, hierarchical, and developmental model". This reproduces and enforces the hegemony of adult-centered discourses of children within knowledge production. Children's geographies has developed in academic human geography since the beginning of the 1990s, although there were notable studies in the area before that date. The earliest work done on children's geographies largely can be traced to [[William Bunge]]'s work on spatial oppression of children in Detroit and Toronto where children are deemed as the ones who suffer the most under an oppressing adult framework of social, cultural and political forces controlling the urban built environment.

This development emerged from the realisation that previously human geography had largely ignored the everyday lives of children, who (obviously) form a significant section of [[society]], and who have specific needs and capacities, and who may experience the world in very different ways. Thus children's geographies can in part be seen in parallel to an interest in [[gender]] in [[geography]] and [[feminist geography]] in so much as their starting points were the gender blindness of mainstream academic geography. Children's geographies also shares many of the underpinning principles of [[Childhood Studies]] (and the so-called New Social Studies of Childhood) and [[Sociology of the family]] - namely, that childhood is a social construction and that scholars should pay greater attention to children's voices and agency, although recent 'new wave' scholarship has challenged these principles (Kraftl, 2013)&lt;ref name="Kraftl 13–23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2013-11-01|title=Beyond ‘voice’, beyond ‘agency’, beyond ‘politics’? Hybrid childhoods and some critical reflections on children's emotional geographies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458613000054|journal=Emotion, Space and Society|series=Children's Emotional Geographies|volume=9|pages=13–23|doi=10.1016/j.emospa.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially,  politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, [[family]], and [[social class|class]].The current developments in children's geographies are attempting to link the frame of analysing children's geographies to one that requires multiple perspectives and the willingness to acknowledge the 'multiplicity' of their geographies.

Children's geographies is sometimes coupled with, and yet distinguished from the geographies of childhood. The former has an interest in the everyday lives of children; the latter has an interest in how (adult) society conceives of the very idea of childhood and how this impinges on children's lives in many ways. This includes imaginations about the nature of children and the related (spatial) implications. In an early article, Holloway and Valentine termed these 'spatial discourses' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Sarah L.|last2=Valentine|first2=Gill|date=2000-01-01|title=Spatiality and the New Social Studies of Childhood|journal=Sociology|volume=34|issue=4|pages=763–783|doi=10.1017/s0038038500000468|jstor=42856231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children’s geographies can be observed through the various lenses provided by foci, thus the plurality inspired by post-modern and post-structural social geographers (Panelli, 2009).&lt;ref name="Panelli, 2009"&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=baf32734-ce2a-4c53-a853-a46684a2b4fa%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=12&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=39053680], Panelli, 2009. Approaches to Human Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; These focii include, but are not limited to: the history of its emergence (key authors and texts), the nature of the child (geographical concepts, family contexts, society contexts, gender variation, aged-based variation, cultural variation), children in the environment (home, school, play, neighbourhood, street, city, country, landscapes of consumption, cyberspace), designing environments for children (children as planners, utopian visions), environmental hazards (traffic, health and environment, accidents), indirect experience of place (not medium specific, literature, T.V. and cyberspace), social issues (children’s fears, parent’s fears for their children, poverty and deprivation, work, migration, social hazards, crime and deviance), citizenship and agency (environmental action, local politics, interest in the environment), and children’s geographical knowledge (environmental cognition, understanding the physical environment) (McKendrick, 2000).&lt;ref name="McKendrick, 2000"&gt;[http://chd.sagepub.com/content/7/3/359], McKendrick, 2000. The Geography of Children - An Annotated Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the methodologies of researching children's worlds and the ethics of doing so has been distinguished by the [[otherness of childhood]].

There is now a journal dedicated to work in the subdiscipline: Children's Geographies&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;issn=1473-3285 Journal of Children's Geographies]&lt;/ref&gt; which will give readers a good idea of the growing range of issues, theories and methodologies of this developing and vibrant sub-discipline. Another relevant journal is Children, Youth and Environments,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=chilyoutenvi CYE Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; published as an interdisciplinary tri-annual with a worldwide readership.

=== Theoretical trends in children's geographies ===

Recently, there has been vibrant debate about the political value of nonrepresentational approaches to childhood. Some scholars argue that nonrepresentational theories encourage a focus upon the banal, everyday, ephemeral and small-scale at the expense of understanding and critically interrogating wider-scaled and longer-standing processes of marginalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Katharyne|last2=Elwood|first2=Sarah|date=2012-01-01|title=Mapping children’s politics: the promise of articulation and the limits of nonrepresentational theory|url=http://epd.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1068/d9011|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=788–804|doi=10.1068/d9011|pmc=4307017|pmid=25635154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ansell|first=N.|date=2008-08-28|title=Childhood and the politics of scale: descaling children's geographies?|url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0309132508090980|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=190–209|doi=10.1177/0309132508090980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that, whilst valid, nonrepresentational and 'new wave' approaches extend beyond the small-scale, offering useful and in some cases fundamental ways to critically and creatively re-think the ways that we do research with children and their 'common worlds'.&lt;ref name="Kraftl 13–23"/&gt;

A second key conceptual trend has been in work on [[Subjectivity]], children's [[Political geography]] and emotion. For instance, Louise Holt (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Louise|date=2013-01-01|title=Exploring the emergence of the subject in power: infant geographies|url=http://epd.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1068/d12711|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=645–663|doi=10.1068/d12711}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the work of [[Judith Butler]] to critically examine the emergence of the infant as a 'subject' through power relations that are often gendered, as well as infanthood is a stage in the lifecourse that is subject to particular kinds of social construction. Elsewhere, there has been a surge in interest in children's political geographies, which has to some extent been informed both by developments in nonrepresentational theory and in theories of subjectivity. Central to this scholarship (especially in the work of Tracey Skelton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skelton|first=Tracey|date=2013-04-01|title=Young People, Children, Politics and Space: A Decade of Youthful Political Geography Scholarship 2003–13|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562576.2013.780717|journal=Space and Polity|volume=17|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1080/13562576.2013.780717|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsi Pauliina Kallio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallio|first=Kirsi Pauliina|last2=Häkli|first2=Jouni|date=2013-04-01|title=Children and Young People's Politics in Everyday Life|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562576.2013.780710|journal=Space and Polity|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/13562576.2013.780710|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jouni Hakli) has been a move beyond a traditional concern with children's participation in decision-making processes to highlight the range of ways in which they may be 'political' - from 'micropolitical' engagements with ethnic or social in the school or the street to critical considerations of major policy documents such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Children in the environment ==
Since the age range assumed to constitute as childhood is quite vague within the cumulative research of children’s geographies it is evident the multitude of environments they experience will be quite broad. The array of spaces and places experienced by children includes, but are not restricted to, homes, schools, playgrounds, neighbourhoods, streets, cities, countries, landscapes of consumption, and cyberspace. As environment has been noted by a multitude of social geographers to entail a socio-spatial aspect, it is important to note that over time the recognition of the multiplicity of the term “environment” has both diverged and converged as social geography has evolved (Valentine, 2001; Bowlby, 2001).&lt;ref name="Valentine, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/002919501753129925 | volume=55 | title=Whatever happened to the social?

=== Children at school ===
Although schools are such a relatively large institution in society, it has been noted that this environment has received little recognition in comparison to institutions of health (Collins and Coleman, 2008).&lt;ref name="Collins and Coleman, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00081.x | volume=2 | title=Social Geographies of Education: Looking Within, and Beyond, School Boundaries | year=2008 | journal=Geography Compass | pages=281–299 | last1 = Collins | first1 = Damian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins and Coleman also note the centrality of schools in everyday life as they are “found in almost every urban and suburban neighbourhood” and most children experience a considerable time within this environment in their day-to-day lives. The role of this environment in a child’s life is pivotal to their development, especially in respects to the inclusionary and exclusionary processes of society experienced firsthand in schools (MacCrae, Maguire and Milbourne, 2002).&lt;ref name="MacCrae, Maguire and Milbourne, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13603110304785 | volume=7 | title=Social exclusion: exclusion from school | year=2003 | journal=International Journal of Inclusive Education | pages=89–101 | last1 = Macrae | first1 = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of social exclusion as bullying is an inter-personal socio-spatial aspect whose implications have been extensively researched both within school boundaries and how it is enabled by technology (Olweus and Limber, 2010; Black, Washington, Trent, Harner and Pollock, 2009).&lt;ref name="Olweus and Limber, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.2010.01015.x | volume=80 | title=Bullying in school: Evaluation and dissemination of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program. | year=2010 | journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry | pages=124–134 | last1 = Olweus | first1 = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black, Washington, Trent, Harner and Pollock, 2009"&gt;[http://hpp.sagepub.com/content/11/5/733], Black, Washington, Trent, Harner and Pollock, 2009. Translating the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program Into Real-World Practice.&lt;/ref&gt; School, therefore, is not only a place where children learn quantifiable subjects, but also a learning ground of life interaction skills needed later on.

Research in children's geographies has been central to the development of scholarship on 'geographies of education'. For many commentators, this work - which spans [[Social geography]], [[Cultural geography]], [[Political geography]] and [[Urban geography]] - does not (yet) constitute an identifiable subdiscipline of human geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thiem|first=C.

As they argue, children's geographers have not only undertaken a huge range of research in schools, but that work has been central in developing geographers' understandings of both education spaces more widely, and schools in particular.

==== As an institution ====
Although schools are a relatively large institution in society, it has been noted that this environment has received little recognition in comparison to institutions of health (Collins and Coleman, 2008).&lt;ref name="Collins and Coleman, 2008" /&gt; Collins and Coleman also note the centrality of schools in everyday life as they are “found in almost ''every'' urban and suburban neighbourhood” and most children experience a considerable time within this environment in their day-to-day lives. The implications of home schooling have largely been a field of assumptions, taking after common myths (Romanowki, 2010),&lt;ref name="Romanowski, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3200/TCHS.79.3.125-129 | volume=79 | title=Revisiting the Common Myths about Homeschooling | year=2006 | journal=The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas | pages=125–129 | last1 = Romanowski | first1 = Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although later work by geographers has examined in considerable detail the significance of space, place. emotion and materiality to the experiences of homeschoolers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2013-07-01|title=Towards geographies of ‘alternative’ education: a case study of UK home schooling families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00536.x/abstract|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=436–450|doi=10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00536.x|issn=1475-5661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The variance between public and private sector institutions and the implications of social status of children within the school community has also been a contentious field (Nissan and Carter, 2010).&lt;ref name="Nissan and Carter, 2010"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/b625160263r4245m/], Nissan and Carter, 2010. Social Identity and Schooling Idequality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the majority of research by children's and youth geographers on education has focussed on institutions like schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holton|first=Mark|last2=Riley|first2=Mark|date=2016-07-03|title=Student geographies and homemaking: personal belonging(s) and identities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649365.2015.1126626|journal=Social &amp; Cultural Geography|volume=17|issue=5|pages=623–645|doi=10.1080/14649365.2015.1126626|issn=1464-9365}}&lt;/ref&gt; that work has been challenged in a number of ways by scholarship on the geographies of alternative education. Examining a diverse range of non-State-funded, explicitly 'alternative' education spaces in the UK (like [[Homeschooling]], [[Waldorf education]], [[Montessori education]], [[Forest school (learning style)]] and [[Care farming]]), Peter Kraftl examines the connections and disconnections between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' education sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://policypress.co.uk/geographies-of-alternative-education-1|title=Policy Press {{!}} Geographies of alternative education - Diverse learning spaces for children and young people By Peter Kraftl|website=Policy Press|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on nonrepresentational children's geographies, Peter Kraftl explores how alternative educators work to intervene into children's bodily habits, how they create spaces in which mess and disorder are valorised, and how they work with conceptions of 'nature' that both resonate with and, critically, counter mainstream assumptions about children's disengagement with 'nature' in Western societies (see [[Nature deficit disorder]]). In doing so, alternative educators are attempting to create 'alter-childhoods' - alternative constructions, imaginations and ways of treating childhood that are knowingly different from a perceived mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2015-01-02|title=Alter-Childhoods: Biopolitics and Childhoods in Alternative Education Spaces|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2014.962969|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=105|issue=1|pages=219–237|doi=10.1080/00045608.2014.962969|issn=0004-5608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance to social interactions ====
As children grow they look to the influential adults in their lives for guidance (parents, caregivers and teachers). Most researchers and adults alike agree that communication is key to healthy child development across all modal environments, especially within schools (Lasky, 2000; Hargreaves, 2000; Hargreaves and Fullan, 1998; Hargreaves and Lasky, 2004).&lt;ref name="Lasky, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X00000305 | doi=10.1016/S0742-051X(00)00030-5 | volume=16 | title=The cultural and emotional politics of teacher–parent interactions | year=2000 | journal=Teaching and Teacher Education | pages=843–860 | last1 = Lasky | first1 = Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hargreaves, 2000"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02754066], Hargreaves, 2000. Professionals and Parents: Personal Adversaries or Public Allies?&lt;/ref&gt; Lasky's focus remains on the cultural and emotional dynamic between teachers and the parents of their students. Where as Hargreaves continuously exemplifies through his data the significant improvement in child performance at school because of an equal power-play communication between teachers and parents/caregivers. Where there may be a lack of influential adults, children may look to older age groups within the school environment to observe acceptable behaviours and [[attention seeking]] behaviours. Research has begun to display the components of the “high quality experience” provided by controlled school-based mentoring relationships (Ahrens et al. 2011). However, other research disputes that the experience is as helpful as it claims to be, suggesting child-mentoring situations often fall short or are only temporarily beneficial (Spencer, 2007; Pryce, 2012).&lt;ref name="Pryce, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10560-012-0260-6 | volume=29 | title=Mentor Attunement: An Approach to Successful School-based Mentoring Relationships | year=2012 | journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | pages=285–305 | last1 = Pryce | first1 = Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pryce’s research highlights the attunement of the mentor to the other’s needs highly dictates the beneficial nature of the mentor relationship.

==== Relevance of technology ====
The introduction of technology into children’s lives has provided a new platform upon which the school environment is no longer contained within a space. The place’s previous temporal and geographical constrictions have been mobilized by the used of the Internet. The outcomes of this mobilization have both been constructive and destructive in the availability of material to learning children (Sancho, 2004)&lt;ref name="Sancho, 2004"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F1-4020-2495-9_10], Virtual Geographies of Educational Change: The More Complex the Problems the Simpler the Answers.&lt;/ref&gt; and more extrapersonal interactions among children. The educational benefit of I.C.T. (Interactive Computer Technology) in the classroom has been a subject supported by various researchers (Aviram and Talmi, 2004).

==== Relevance to the creation of social identities ====
The school is an institution in which children observe one another and experiment continuously with their self-image (Hernandez, 2004).&lt;ref name="Hernandez, 2004"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F1-4020-2495-9_7], Hernandez, 2004. Mapping Visual Cultural Narratives to Explore Adolescents' Identities.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez’s research recognized a need to recognize children as individuals, and to incorporate their “personal maps” into the educational process, so the gap between the school environment and external environment does not elevate dangerously. The centrality of schools to social geography is pivotal. Public institutions in Canada and the USA were defined as “nation-building institutions, which sought to create common citizens from ethnically, linguistically and religiously diverse populations” (Moore, 2000; Sweet, 1997). The connection between nation-building and public education has held the view that schools shape the knowledge and identities of children (Collins and Coleman, 2008).&lt;ref name="Collins and Coleman, 2008" /&gt; Whether the connection is seen to create negative, destructive social norms or positive, construction of progressive values is dependent “on one’s broader political/moral compass” (Collins, 2006; Hunter 1991).

'''Clothing fetishism''' or '''garment fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetish]] that revolves around a fixation upon a particular article or type of [[clothing]], a collection of garments that appear as part of a fashion or uniform, or a person dressed in such a garment.

The clinical definition of a sexual fetish would require that a person be fixated on a specific garment to the extent that it exists as a recurrent (or exclusive) stimulus for sexual gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Masters WH, Johnson VE, Kolodny RC: ''Human sexuality'', 5th ed. New York: Harper Collins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Silva WP |title=ABC of sexual health. Sexual variations |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7184 |pages=654–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10066212 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/318/7184/654.pdf | format=PDF |pmc=1115095 |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7184.654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One who exhibits a clothing fetish may be aroused by the sight of a person wearing a particular garment, or by wearing the garment oneself which can be because of the look one achieves by wearing it or the way it feels while it is being worn (and might also get some arousal by seeing somebody in it and imagining how it feels). In later case arousal may originate from the way its fabric feels (see [[#By fabric type|clothing fetish by fabric type]]) or from the way the garment feels and functions as whole ([[#Restrictive clothing|restrictive clothing]] being an example).

Others with a clothing fetish may be aroused by the sight of such garments, even without wearing them and in the absence of other person wearing them, and may also derive pleasure from collecting them.

==Relative prevalence of garment fetishism==
[[File:Dasha Astafieva at One Sunset, West Hollywood.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Playboy Playmate]] [[Dasha Astafieva]] wearing a [[see-through clothing|see-through]] [[fishnet]] dress without any [[undergarments]], poses for photographers at a [[Playboy]] party in USA, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/hugh-hefner-gal-pal-dasha-astafieva-bares-playboy-red-carpet-article-1.357435|title=Hugh Hefner gal pal Dasha Astafieva bares all on Playboy red carpet|work=NY Daily News|author=Lauren Johnston|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In order to determine the relative prevalence of different fetishes, researchers at the [[University of Bologna]] obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide from 381 Internet discussion groups. The relative prevalences were estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. The top garment fetish was clothes worn on the legs or buttocks (such as stockings or skirts), followed by footwear, underwear, whole-body wear (such as [[costume]]s and coats), and upper-body wear (such as jackets or waistcoats).&lt;ref name="scorolli"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scorolli C, Ghirlanda S, Enquist M, Zattoni S, Jannini EA |title=Relative prevalence of different fetishes |journal=Int. J. Impot. Res. |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=432–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17304204 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901547 | url = http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v19/n4/full/3901547a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By garment type==
Although almost any type of garment in theory can be the subject of a fetish, common clothing fetishes include footwear, female [[underwear]] and [[uniform]]s. A wide range of other garments have been the subject of less common fetishes.

Separate from fetishes as a paraphilia are garments worn to enhance appearance, such as tight jeans or other eye-catching clothing. The difference is whether, for the person concerned, the clothing is the focus of a sexual fetish, or is merely appreciated and found pleasing.

===Restrictive clothing===
Clothing that limits the wearer's movement is commonly used for this property, particularly among [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] enthusiasts and it has common appearance in bondage-related [[fetish fashion]]. Such restrictive fashion, among others, includes [[corset]]s, [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]]s, and [[hobble skirt]]s. As many restrictive items of clothing belong to women's fashion, male restrictive clothing fetishists can have problems in obtaining and using such items without being labeled as [[transvestite]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Corsets====
{{See also|Corset#Fetish|Tightlacing}}
The [[training corset]] and [[bondage corset]] has also become a staple in fetish wear, particularly among professional dominants. A [[submissive]] or slave may also be forced to wear a tightly laced corset as a form of punishment or simply restriction. And the masochistic practice known as [[tightlacing]] creates a particular type of pleasure for the wearer. In the 1980s, pop music performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] reintroduced and popularized the corset as a daring example of [[underwear as outerwear]]. This influence continues to the present day in both fetish and mainstream fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Hobble skirts====
[[File:Open-Bottom-Girdle-RHT-Stockings-small.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Lingerie Model wearing full-fashioned stockings, with an open-bottom [[girdle]], see-through [[panties]], and [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]].]]
A [[hobble skirt]] is a long, tight skirt, extending below the knees and often ankle length, which is so tight that it is difficult to walk in. When used as fetish clothing, it is often made of [[latex]] or [[PVC]] and sometimes [[corset]]ed, to increase the restriction.

Such skirts were briefly a mainstream fashion in the 1910s; however, they were soon abandoned as impractical. They were revived in the 1950s by [[John Willie]] and others as a bondage/fetish style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbleskirt.com/About.aspx|title=Custom Hobble Skirts|publisher=|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockings and socks===
Stocking fetishists usually find sexual partners clothed in sheer nylon or silk stockings to be sexually stimulating, or find the act of a person donning or removing a pair of stockings arousing. Some men find it arousing to collect and wear stockings, sometimes hidden under a pair of trousers.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, David (2004). ''Fashion and Fetishism''. Sutton. {{ISBN|0-7509-3808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Foot fetishism|feet]] and [[Shoe fetishism|shoes]], sock fetishists often require some specific attraction in the object which may include particular styles or knit patterns. People with a fetish for socks may have no special attraction to feet or shoes. Some speculate that the strong attraction some men exhibit to the smell of socks worn by women may be an example of the existence of human pheromones – the hypothesis being that the sweat from women's feet may contain chemical attractants that arouse a male subject and that when a male subject is exposed to the smell of women's feet or footwear at a young age that young man may carry a strong psycho-chemical imprint which motivates his enthusiasm for worn socks or shoes later in life.

Many male sock fetishists are also highly specific regarding the nature of the socks that stimulate them, and this may be a product of exposure to particular types of clothing during the teenage years. This belief is supported by observations that the nature of sock fetishism appears to differentiate according to age brackets and periods of clothing trends. Among men who exhibit an interest in women's socks who were in their early pubescent period during the late 1980s/early 1990s when slouch socks were a popular clothing trend, there is a tendency to exhibit a strong interest in very heavy slouchy socks, whereas younger men with a sock fetish tend to show greater interest in the short ankle-style socks that became popular in later years.  There is also a regional trend in sock fetishes, with men who spent their teenage years living in northern climates exhibiting a strong interest in heavy wool socks.

===Sneakers===
Sneaker fetishism is another specific form of [[shoe fetishism]] and like [[boot fetishism]] it can be accompanied by a fetish for the material from which it is made for example the rubber which the [[Shoe#Outsole|outsole]] and sidewall are made of can be a source of [[rubber fetishism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Swimwear ===
{{Main|spandex fetishism}}
Swimwear fetishism is a sexual fetish relating to swimwear. It can also involve printed or electronic material with swimwear being worn.

===Jackets and coats===
Jacket fetishism is usually associated with the fixation or attraction to padded nylon jackets – though it can also be associated with leather jackets, particularly in association with [[Bondage (BDSM)]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In a survey, researchers at the University of Bologna found that 9% of members of online fetish groups were in groups related to upper-body wear such as jackets.&lt;ref name="scorolli" /&gt;

===Jeans===

The style and cut of jeans can also enhance their sexual appeal to fetishists of either gender. Jeans without pockets on the back are sometimes viewed as showing off one's buttocks and therefore more flattering. Stretch jeans are often viewed as attractive because they have the appearance of being skin tight, while not binding like regular denim jeans would. An example of fetish denim would be "Zip Around Jeans", so called because their zipper unzips starting in the front and continues all the way to the back. Other popular styles include the lace up jean and multi button style jeans.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Crop Tops (Half-Shirts)===

[[Crop top]]s are particularly appealing to [[Navel fetishism|navel fetishists]] since exposure of the [[navel]] is accentuated by the bared midriff characteristic of such garments.  In so doing, the crop-top can highlight [[navel piercings]], which have become popular.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Gender-related clothes==
Fetishism may include various garments typically worn by or associated with a particular gender or gender expression. For example, this could describe an individual who is attracted to people wearing masculine-associated clothing items, like [[gym shorts|basketball shorts]] or a [[Suit (clothing)#Suit etiquette for men|man's suit]]. Certain gender-related elements of clothes could be the source of a fetish, include [[lace]], [[ruffle]]s, [[floral]] print, [[embroidery]], [[back closure]]s, or various colors (such as [[mauve]] and pink).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Uniforms==
{{Main|Uniform fetishism}}
Among the most common uniforms in uniform fetish are those of a doctor, schoolgirl, police officer, nurse, [[French maid]], sports player, waitress, cheerleader and [[Playboy Bunny]]. Some people also regard [[nun]]s' [[religious habit|habits]] or even [[apron]]s as uniforms. Sometimes, a uniform may be used appropriate to what is being done. For example, someone may wear a nurse's uniform to administer an [[enema]], a police uniform to handcuff and cage someone, or two equals dress as inmates for [[cell mate]] on cell mate activities in a prison setting or as submissive to a third (guard) player. This may add a sense of authenticity to the game play.&lt;ref name="isbn0894790110"&gt;The Visual Dictionary of Sex, Dr. Eric J Trimmer (editor), {{ISBN|0-89479-011-0}}; A &amp; W Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==By fabric type==

===Fur===

[[File:Titian - Venus with a Mirror - Google Art Project.jpg |thumb|Venus with a Mirror, by [[Tiziano Vecellio]] (circa 1555) inspired [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]´s novel Venus im Pelz ([[Venus in Furs]])]]
Fur fetishism refers to the [[sexual fetishism]] that revolves around people wearing fur, or in certain cases, to the garments themselves.

These materials may be fetishised because the garment acts as a fetishistic [[wiktionary:surrogate|surrogate]] or [[second skin (fetishism)|second skin]] for the wearer's own skin. The material may be regarded as providing a [[superstimulus]] that is more intense than the normal response associated with real skin. This is heightened by the fact that the [[fur]] was originally an animal's skin and hair.

The most famous, and one of the earliest depictions of the topic was the semi-autobiographical novel [[Venus in Furs]] (1870) by [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. After the novel's success, Sacher-Masoch apparently decided to take on a fetish [[sadomasochism]]-lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Written in the flesh: a history of desire. Author: Edward Shorter. Editor: University of Toronto Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8020-3843-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-3843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1884, he had sent a copy of the novel to [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], who gave Sacher-Masoch immortality when, in 1891 he used this ancient [[Austrian nobility]] name as an [[eponym]] for what today is called [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoming]].

===Leather===
{{Main|Leather subculture}}
Leather fetishism is the name popularly used to describe a sexual attraction to people wearing leather and or to the garments themselves. The smell and the sound of leather is often an erotic stimulus for people with a leather fetish. Leather uniforms may also become a fetish. Leather is occasionally finished with a glossy surface and produced in bright colors, providing visual stimuli for some leather fetishists.

The feel of tight leather garments worn may be experienced as a form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. Some [[bondage equipment]] is made from leather straps. The term "[[leather culture]]" was applied in the 1960s in the USA gay [[sadomasochistic]] [[subculture]] as an umbrella term for alternative sexual practices. The [[pony]] fetish involves the use of equestrian like gear fitted to humans.

===Latex/PVC===
[[File:Black Latex Catsuit 777.jpg|thumb|200px|A woman wearing a black [[latex]] fetish catsuit and [[thigh-high boots]].]][[File:Fetish clothing - blue PVC shorts and top 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman wearing blue [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] shorts and top]]
{{Main|latex and PVC fetishism}}
Latex fetish is the [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to [[latex clothing]] or garments and sometimes called rubber fetishism as latex is a type of rubber. Latex or rubber fetishists may refer to themselves as "Rubberists". Varieties of latex fetishism include [[body inflation]] and attraction to transparent rubber. Latex fetishism includes wearing clothing made from latex, observing it worn by others, and enjoyment of erotic fantasies featuring latex garments, catsuits, hoods, [[underwater diving|divers]] or industrial protective clothing. A common latex fetish icon is the [[dominatrix]] wearing a skin-tight glossy black latex or PVC [[catsuit]].

PVC fetishism is often closely associated with latex fetishism even though the two materials are very different. PVC fetishism involves an erotic attraction to shiny plastic clothes made from [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), polyurathane or similar man made materials. PVC may be mistaken for shiny [[patent leather]]. PVC fetishism also includes an erotic attraction to clothing such as clear plastic raincoats, [[slipcover]]s, custom clothing made out of clear PVC or inflatable items.

Nylon fetishism includes the wearing of shiny raincoats, jackets and trousers. In the case of heterosexuals, special preferences often include nylon clothing items designed for or belonging to the other sex.

===Spandex===
{{Main|spandex fetishism}}

Spandex fetishism is a [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to people wearing [[stretch fabric]]s or, in certain cases, to the garments themselves, such as [[leotard]]s. One reason why spandex and other tight fabrics may be fetishised is that the garment forms a "[[second skin (fetishism)|second skin]]," acting as a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. Wearers of skin-tight nylon and cotton spandex garments can appear naked or coated in a shiny or matte substance like paint. The tightness of the garments may also be seen as [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. Another reason is that nylon-spandex fabric (preferred by many spandex fetishists) is often produced with a very smooth and silk-like finish, which lends a tactile dimension to the fetish – as well as a visual one. There is a sexual attraction to [[leotard]]s and other dance related clothing. This also goes for gymnasts too.

In comic books, [[superhero]]es, [[superheroine]]s, and [[supervillain]]s are generally depicted as wearing costumes made of spandex or a similar material. The superheroines always wear skintight, very flashy and bright-coloured costumes that usually cover only just enough of the body to be presentable. Fantasies involving superheroes or the wearing of superhero costumes are commonly associated with spandex fetishism.

Full-body suits called [[zentai]] entirely immerse the wearer in skin tight fabric. The suits are essentially [[catsuit]]s with gloves, feet, and a hood. The wearer experiences [[total enclosure]] and those who enjoy [[erotic objectification]] might make use of the garment's anonymizing aspect. The word ''zentai'' means ''whole body'' in Japanese.

'''Convenience Technologies''' enable viewers and users of [[television]], [[Internet]], [[mobile devices]], [[Digital Video Recorders]] (DVR), [[Video on Demand]] (VOD) and [[Digital Versatile Disc]] (DVD) to more easily seek out specific content and view it in individualized patterns. These technologies increase viewers’ ability to choose when they want to watch a program with the use of DVR, VOD and DVD, and where to watch a program with the use of [[DVD]], [[iPOD]], TiVo ToGo and mobile phones. These technological enhancers provide the most comprehensive and varied adjustments in the technological potential of the medium ([[Amanda D. Lotz]], 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59).&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. "The Television Will Be Revolutionized." New York University Press. Retrieved April 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Convenience Technologies encourage active selection instead of generally watching what “comes on next” or “is on”. Because of this, consequently, viewers focused more on programs they wanted to watch than on the networks that supplied them (Lotz, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59)

The main problem for networks is that the DVR using audience appears, by basically every measure that’s vital to advertisers, more wanted than the non-DVR crowds. According to a  Horizon Media Study, early adopters of technology are usually above the national average in income, in a “well-off” set. They are typically college graduates and white-collar workers (Lowry, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Brian. Variet, September 27-October 3, 2010, Vol. 420, Issue 7, p.&amp;nbsp;15-20, 2p. DVRS Along for the divide&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Policy Research''' (or [[Cultural policy|Cultural Policy Studies]]) is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[Cultural Studies]] in the 1990s. A quarter of a century later, by now both “Cultural Policy Research” and "Cultural Policy Studies" each match almost 100 million entries in the World Wide Web.

Cultural Policy Research grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, Culture, A reformer's Science, SAGE, London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Princeton University e.g. founded its Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies 1994 “to improve the clarity, accuracy and sophistication of discourse about the nation's artistic and cultural life.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, combining social sciences, a wide range of the humanities, jurisprudence and economics. As all political sciences do, the research focuses on the content dimension ([[:en:policy|policy]]), the formal-institutional dimension ([[:en:polity|polity]]) and the practical dimension ([[:en:politics|politics]]), particularly affecting decision processes and the results obtained. Cultural Policy Research asks: What do the [[:en:Actor (policy debate)|actor]]s and [[:en:Structure and agency|agent]]s in the Cultural Policy sphere actually do when they do what they do? Which purposes they do pursue by that? What are their goals and which means do they use? What is the result of their action for society and for the citizens’ intellectual and artistic freedom?

Among the many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world, there are several UNESCO Chairs in Cultural Policy from the programme launched in 1992 by the [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;http://en.unesco.org/unitwin-unesco-chairs-programme&lt;/ref&gt; to promote international inter-university cooperation:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">'''Dance theory''' is the philosophy underpinning contemporary dance, including formal ideologies, aesthetic concepts, and technical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology, [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/music-and-theater-arts/21m-675-dance-theory-and-composition-fall-2003/ Course Description: Dance Theory and Composition], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fairly new field of study, developing largely in the 20th Century. It can be considered a branch of [[expression theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Milton H. Snoeyenbos and Carole A. Knapp, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3331991?uid=5353408&amp;uid=3739584&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=67&amp;uid=62&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=33214&amp;sid=47698937002387 Dance Theory and Dance Education], Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Jul., 1979), pp. 17-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely related to [[music theory]] and specifically [[musicality]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichelle, [http://danceadvantage.net/2010/03/29/musicality-in-dance/ Musicality In Dance: What Is It? Can It Be Taught?] March 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While musicality deals with finding a particular matching pair of dance and music that fit each other in various respects, dance theory is a broad term encompassing the [[Dance_history|origins]], [[List of dance style categories|styles]], [[genre]], [[Footwork (dance)|footwork]], [[Art|artistic expression]], etc. of dance.

Three broad categories of dance theory, as you may find them described in universities or dance institutes, are philosophy (concerning the aesthetic meanings behind dance, or [[semiotics]]), choreology (movement analysis and description), sociology (regarding the role of dance in society and culture).&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary-Dance.org [http://www.contemporary-dance.org/dance-theory.html Dance Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance theory deals with [[anatomical]] movements (such as foot-work, etc.), as well as [[Connection (dance)|partner interactions]], and their associations to each other and to music as art. It explores the communicative, physical, mental, emotional, and artistic aspects of dance as a medium of human expression and interaction.  In doing so the various nuances between the dance genres and styles are analyzed with respect to their [[social setting]]s and [[culture]]s.

As dance is a ubiquitous element of culture, dance theory attempts to determine the instinctual nature of dance, and what makes various movements appear natural or forced.

it is possible through understanding including the writing and drawing of dances within a sphere to understand that all dance is based on natural body movements that is the moving of joints limbs and legs and fingers, dance theory is based on these founding principles that is the sphere and lines of the body to derive and show and demonstrate how dance is done which movements to do by which movement at which speed so hypothetically it is possible to draw and work out a dance by using sphere lines and arrows etc to build up a dance and a routine starting with examples and extenuating etc many dance books state how this is done.

'''''Degenerates and Perverts''''' is an art history book written by [[Eileen Chanin]] and Steven Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artlink.com.au/articles/2785/degenerates-and-perverts/ |title=Degenerates and Perverts |last=Furby |first=Paula |website=www.artlink.com.au |access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about the [[1939 Herald Exhibition of French and British Contemporary Art]], a groundbreaking exhibition of [[contemporary art]] which stayed in Australia throughout the [[Second World War]]. This exhibition included works by masters such as [[Picasso]] and [[Van Gogh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/9780522851045/Degenerates-Perverts-1939-Herald-Exhibition-0522851045/plp |title=Degenerates and Perverts: The 1939 Herald Exhibition of Modern Art |website=www.abebooks.com |access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; available at bargain war-time prices. It has been regarded as a missed opportunity for Australia to establish a world-class art collection. The book includes reproductions of many of the artworks, and discusses the story of the exhibition and the myths which have grown up around it.

''Degenerates and Perverts'' was published by the [[Miegunyah Press]] (an imprint of [[Melbourne University Press]]) in 2005, and included an introductory essay by Judith Pugh. The book won the [[NSW History Awards]] and was shortlisted for the [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]].

The title comes from a comment by art gallery director [[J. S. McDonald]] that modern art was "the work of degenerates and perverts".

[[Image:Eggdrop1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A package designed to protect three [[eggs (food)|eggs]] from a fall of ten meters is dropped by a [[physics]] teacher on a lift.]]
The '''egg drop contest''' is an experiment usually performed by [[college]] or primary [[school]] students. Competitors typically attempt to create a device that can keep a raw [[chicken]] [[egg (food)|egg]] intact when dropped from a height. Students are asked to build a device made from a limited or not limited amount of materials to support an egg when dropped from various heights.

==Naked egg drop==
A variation of the egg drop competition is the naked egg drop, in which an exposed raw egg is dropped into a container below that must catch the egg and keep it from breaking. 

==Egg hurl==
Another common variation on the egg drop competition is the egg hurl competition, where the containers are hurled by a device such as a [[trebuchet]] or [[Pneumatic weapon|air cannon]].  This variation is often used by schools that lack tall structures from which to drop the containers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm Canyon High School Egg Hurl Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070740/http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm |date=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2009/06/15/egg_throwing09_feature.shtml "The Rowntree's Randoms Egg Throwing Championships - Swaton 28 June"] ''[[BBC]]''-[[Lincolnshire]], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The egg hurl variation adds additional difficulties to the design of the container, since it is initially hurled at high speed and has to cope with horizontal as well as vertical velocities upon landing.

==Regional competitions==
Often schools work together to make larger competitions that pit more students against each other.  One of the larger regional egg drop competitions is the Winston-Salem / Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition that takes place during Engineers Week (late February) each year. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfceggdrop.com Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Egg drop is one of 18 events in the [http://www.sciencenc.com/ North Carolina Science Olympiad] elementary competition. More than 100 teams compete in this annual competition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenc.com/event-help/EggDrop.php North Carolina Science Olympiad Egg Drop ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lippard, Jeremy M. Berg, ''Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry'', University Science Books, '''1994''', {{ISBN|0-935702-72-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Enzymes]] are biological catalysts: biopolymers that [[catalyze]] a [[Chemical reaction|reaction]]. Although a small number of natural enzymes are built from [[RNA]]–termed [[Ribozymes]]–most enzymes are [[proteins]].  Like any other protein an enzyme is an [[amino acid]] [[polymer]] with added [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] and other [[post-translational modifications]].   Often most of the amino acid polymer is indirectly involved with the enzymes function, perhaps providing ancillary structure or connectivity, indirect activity regulation, or molecular identification of the enzyme.  As a result, most enzymes are large molecules weighing many [[kilodalton]]s.  This bulk can obscure various investigative techniques such as [[NMR]], [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]], [[electrochemistry]], [[crystallography]], among others.   It is standard practice to compare spectroscopic data from enzymes to similar spectroscopic data derived from better characterized small molecules.  In this way the understanding of metalloenzymes and other [[metalloprotein]]s have developed.  In many cases the small molecule analogs were created for other reasons; however, it has been increasingly common for groups to intentionally make small molecule analogs also known as enzyme mimics.  These enzyme mimics are prime examples of [[bioinorganic chemistry]].

== Motivation ==

Most enzyme mimics studies are motivated by a combination of factors including factors that are unrelated to the enzyme.  Several of the factors that are related to the enzyme are listed below.

'''Defining the active site structure.''' A number of important active sites are still poorly defined.  This includes the [[oxygen evolving complex]] and [[nitrogenase]].  In an effort to understand these enzymes small molecule analogs are created and compared to the data which exists for the proteins.

'''Understanding the active site function.''' The structure of some enzymes are very well characterized, however, the function of some component of the active site is poorly understood.  This is often investigated through [[site-directed mutagenesis]].  In addition the synthesis of a model complex can suggest the function of various components.

'''Reproducing the enzymes function.'''  A number of enzymes are an interest since they catalyze a reaction chemist find challenging.  These reactions include the partial oxidation of a hydrocarbon by [[methane monooxygenase]](MMO) or the oxidation and production of [[hydrogen]] by [[hydrogenase]].  "Functional" enzyme mimics or bioinspired catalysts are designed with characteristics of the enzyme in hopes of reproducing the enzymes functionality.

== Significant examples ==

This list is extremely abbreviated in terms of the enzymes mimicked and the primary investigators working on each enzyme mimic.

[[Richard H. Holm|Richard Holm]]'s work on mimics of [[nitrogenase]] and creation of [[iron sulfur cluster]]s.

[[Stephen Lippard]]'s work on [[methane monooxygenase|MMO]].

Thomas Rauchfuss's, Marcetta Darensbourg's and Christopher Pickett's work on [[Hydrogenase mimic]]s.

[[Harry B. Gray|Harry Gray]]'s work with [[porphyrin]]s complexes.

[[Ronald Breslow]] and Larry E. Overman coined the term of "artificial enzyme".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[computer graphics]], a '''fragment''' is the data necessary to generate a single [[pixel]]'s worth of a drawing primitive in the [[frame buffer]].  

This data may include, but is not limited to:
* [[Raster graphics|raster position]]
* [[Z-buffering|depth]]
* interpolated attributes (color, [[Texture mapping|texture coordinates]], etc.)
* [[Stencil buffer|stencil]]
* [[Alpha compositing|alpha]]
* window ID

As a scene is drawn, drawing primitives (the basic elements of graphics output, such as points, lines, circles, text etc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://baikalweb.jinr.ru/doc/cern_doc/asdoc/gks_html3/node28.html The Drawing Primitives by Janne Saarela ]&lt;/ref&gt; ) are [[Rasterisation|rasterized]] into fragments which are textured and combined with the existing frame buffer. How a fragment is combined with the data already in the frame buffer depends on various settings. In a typical case, a fragment may be discarded if it is farther away than the pixel that is already at that location (according to the [[depth buffer]]). If it is nearer than the existing pixel, it may replace what is already there, or, if [[alpha blending]] is in use, the pixel's color may be replaced with a mixture of the fragment's color and the pixel's existing color, as in the case of drawing a translucent object.

In general, a fragment can be thought of as the data needed to [[Shader|shade]] the pixel, plus the data needed to test whether the fragment survives to become a pixel (depth, alpha, stencil, scissor, window ID, etc.)

'''Frequency separation''' is a term used in [[Helioseismology|Helio]] and [[Asteroseismology]] for the spacing in frequency between adjacent modes of oscillation having the same [[angular degree]] (l) but different [[radial order]] (n).

For a Sun-like star the frequency can be further described using the 'large frequency spacing' between modes of different radial order (136 μHz in the Sun), and the 'small frequency spacing' between modes of even and odd angular degree within the same radial order (9.0 μHz in the Sun). The period corresponding to the large frequency spacing can be shown to be approximately the same as the time required for a sound wave to travel to the centre of the Sun and return, confirming the global nature of the oscillations seen.&lt;ref name="sunmusic"&gt;{{cite book

A further frequency separation, the rotational splitting can be seen in high-resolution solar data between modes of the same angular degree, but different azimuthal order (m).  This gives information

'''Funk art''' is an American [[art movement]] that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; An [[anti-establishment]] movement, Funk art brought [[figurative art|figuration]] back as subject matter in [[painting]] again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]] were depicting. The movement’s name was derived from the [[jazz]] musical term "[[funk]]y", describing the passionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The term [[funk]] also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in California's [[Bay Area]] in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a [[collective]] art style or group.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"&gt;Karlstrom, Paul J. ''Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt;

==History==

===Bay Area===
The Funk art movement was a regional art movement, most predominant in [[Northern California]]. Some notable cities where the Funk movement was concentrated in consisted of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Marin County]], [[Big Sur]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many Funk artists began as [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] painters in the 1950s. The movement originated from the bohemian underground in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"&gt;Engelbach, Barbara ''Looking for Mushrooms: Beat Poets, Hippies, Funk, Minimal Art San Francisco 1955-68''. Köln König: Museum Ludwig, Köln, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the Bay Area, specifically [[San Francisco]], was a free and spiritual environment due to its [[beatnik]] art culture and the youth political activism reacting against the [[Vietnam War]] going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"/&gt; A variety of different cultures existed in the city, including poetry, jazz, and art. The freedom of thinking and culture was one of the main reasons that Funk art, a combination of both painting and sculpture, could develop and prosper in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

The Funk art that occurred throughout Northern California was the exact opposite of the "Fetish Finish" sculptures made in [[Southern California]] and the "primary structures" constructed in New York at the time.&lt;ref name="Selz"&gt;Selz, Peter. ''Funk''. Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Funk art in the Bay Area was unique and not similar to any other movement of the 1960s.  [[Jess Collins|Jess]], [[Wally Hedrick]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Viola Frey]], [[Wallace Berman]] and [[Bruce Conner]] were notable Funk artists who emerged from the Bay Area. Jess was one of the earliest and most influential Funk artists.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; In 1967, [[Peter Selz]], the first director of the University of Art Museum in Berkeley, California, organized a Funk Show there. Selz wanted to showcase the strange mindset in California through an array of Funk pieces.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; The exhibition featured works from [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Mowry Baden]] and [[Bruce Conner]], and it brought national recognition to the movement for the first time.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;Albright, Thomas. ''[[Art in the San Francisco Bay Area (book)|Art in the San Francisco Bay Area 1945-1980]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0520051939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this show, not many people outside of the Bay Area had seen or heard of Funk works, which relieved artists of pressures to become successful.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

==Characteristics and techniques==
The characteristics and techniques of Funk art works were more important than the subject matter.

===Self-identification===
Unlike earlier movements, such as [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], Funk art was not concerned with public [[morality]]. Its artists were committed to identifying with their works on a personal level instead of the social or existential. Through their absurdist works, Funk artists demonstrated personal feelings, emotions and processes and in this way their work had a closer [[nature v culture|relationship to nature rather than to culture]]. The works had creative freedom and demonstrated the artists' lives, personalities and experiences.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Funk artists treated their work with a sense of humor, senselessness, confrontation, vulgar sexuality and [[autobiographical]] references.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; In their pieces, Funk artists are sometimes self-deprecating and [[ironic]].  Although the works are humorous, they sometimes cover a more serious undertone.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Since there was no clear meaning in many pieces, Funk art contains a sense of ambiguity.

===Found objects===
Funk art was inspired by [[popular culture]], contains attitude and uses an unlikely mixture of materials and techniques. One of the movement's main characteristics is that it incorporates found objects from [[Consumerism|consumer culture]]. It was a part of the larger movement called [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]], which also included paintings that were composed of three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; [[Bruce Conner]] was known for his assemblage works, including ''Arachne'', ''Spider Lady'', ''For Marilyn'', ''Cosmic Death Song'', and ''Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron''.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many of the Funk [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] pieces were composed of thrown out garbage to demonstrate that Funk art was not a part of consumer culture.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; The pieces are usually three dimensional, but they resemble paintings more than sculptures.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; [[Jess Collins|Jess]] and [[Wally Hedrick]] were two of the first Funk artists to use found objects in their works.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The objects used tended to be items that were not meant to be noticed.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; The idea of using ordinary subject matter and common objects in art was influenced by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; This concept is also influenced by the pieces of the [[Dada]] movement because both art movements use everyday objects and have a sense of freedom.The objects and debris used in works symbolized decay many of the time.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Due to the artists lack of concern with impeccable technique, durability or form, the works each possessed a somewhat sloppy finish.

==Ceramics==
Non-functional ceramic art was an important element in the Funk art movement, especially in Regina{{Where|date=June 2015}} and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Funk art ceramics were primarily composed from clay and possessed themes that were thought of as inappropriate by artists belonging to other movements.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;  Similar to its three dimensional paintings, Funk ceramics contained vulgar male humor, as well as sexual references.&lt;ref name="Shields"&gt;Shields, Scott A. "California Funk." ''Ceramics Monthly 56.9'' (2008): 38-41. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Funk works, the ceramics also used funny and absurd styles and images to relay the message that people should not take art or themselves too seriously. The ceramics were unrefined and blatant, and they all possessed the idea of a functionless sculpture for sculptures sake.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;

===Robert Arneson===
[[Robert Arneson]] started the ceramic art movement within Funk art in the Bay Area.  Before him, ceramics were considered more of a craft rather than a prestigious art form.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; After him, ceramics caught on as a serious form of art nationally.{{cn|date=June 2015}} [[Robert Arneson]] created many ceramic sculptures, which eventually became a common work of Funk artists. Some believe his ceramics were influenced by [[pop art]] sculptures because they were of mundane, everyday objects. A main difference was that [[Robert Arneson]] also included personal elements to his sculptures, which was a defining factor of Funk art.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; His works were playful and full of color.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;
[[Robert Arneson]], along with other Funk artists, such as [[Roy De Forest]], [[Manuel Neri]], and [[William T. Wiley]] taught at the [[University of California, Davis]], which was a center for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art, Interview with Bruce Nauman http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/nauman80.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Students from [[University of California, Davis]], such as Margaret Dodd, [[David Gilhooly]], [[Victor Cicansky]], Chris Unterseher, and Peter Vandenberge, continued Arneson's ceramics tradition.

In 1967, [[Robert Arneson]] drafted ceramicist [[Clayton Bailey]] to cover his classes at [[University of California, Davis]] while he took a [[sabbatical]].&lt;ref name=WOW&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

==Exhibitions==

Founded in [[Folsom, California]], in 1962, the [[Candy Store Gallery]] played a key role in promoting Funk art by means of regular exhibitions until its closure in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

'''CEMS - The Global Alliance in Management Education''' or '''CEMS''' (formerly the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies) is a cooperation of leading business schools and universities with multinational companies and NGOs. The CEMS Global Alliance includes 31 academic institutions from every continent, 71 corporate partners and 7 social partners (NGOs) from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cems.org/about-cems/overview/key-facts-figures|title=Key Facts &amp; Figures - CEMS|website=www.cems.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEMS administers delivery of the CEMS MIM degree in its member schools, supports the CEMS Alumni Association (CAA) and facilitates general cooperation among its members.

==CEMS MIM==
'''CEMS Master's in International Management''' (CEMS MIM) is a one-year degree program taught jointly by CEMS business schools and universities available to a select group of students at the member institutions. Created in 1988 by founding members from the [[University of Cologne]], [[HEC Paris]], [[ESADE]] and the [[Bocconi University|Università Bocconi]], the CEMS MIM was the first supra-national MSc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattsymonds/2014/05/20/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-masters-in-management/|title=The Rise And Rise Of The Masters In Management|first=Matt|last=Symonds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of CEMS is to set a global standard of excellence for pre-experience Master’s programs in Management, providing education and research for students who aspire to play a leading role in the development and direction of enterprises in a global context.

CEMS MiM usually consists of two semesters, of which one is at the home university and the other is spent abroad in a fellow CEMS member school. Some CEMS universities also allow their students to spent both semesters at CEMS member schools. In addition to completing one's home degree, graduation from CEMS also requires successful completion of a business project, skill seminars, an international internship, and 2 foreign language exams. While the CEMS MIM is a high-quality academic degree, its unique characteristics lie in the additional focus on practical business skills, language proficiency and early international experience.

Every CEMS academic member has a limited number of places available for the CEMS MIM intake, therefore, the selection process is challenging and in many cases, schools may have pre-requisites to be admitted into the selection process, including a high grade average and proof of language skills.

The selection process differs slightly among the academic members, but often it is required to already be enrolled or selected for a Master of Business degree with a member university prior to applying for the CEMS MIM. All of the CEMS graduates receive both a degree from their home institution as well as from CEMS, thus the CEMS MIM is often referred to as a "dual-degree".

==Corporate Partners==

CEMS currently totals 71 Corporate Partners which contribute financially on an annual basis and provide the programme with human resources and input into the curriculum itself. This means that they chart skills courses, give lectures or invite CEMS students to company activities where students learn about certain corporate practices or solve cases. These connections are very useful to promote the company to the students, while the students gain insight into real-world problems and solution approaches.

==Social Partners==

The first ever CEMS Social Partners joined the organisation in December 2010. These are the first in a series of non-profits and NGOs that contribute to the alliance in a way identical to Corporate Partners (selection and admission of students, governance, curriculum delivery, proposal of internships and employment opportunities). This new initiative is part of a major sustainability drive from within CEMS. In the same vein, CEMS has also signed the PRME (Principles of Responsible Management Education) declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cems.org/sustainability/strategy/social-partners|title=Social Partners - CEMS|website=www.cems.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alumni Association (CAA) ==
The CEMS Alumni Association (CAA) enables the multicultural experience of CEMS graduates to flourish. Founded in 1993 by CEMS graduates, the association is an international network throughout the world of CEMS graduates. To date, nearly 13,000 CEMS students have graduated and gone on to become CEMS alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cemsalumni.org/news/facts-figures/http://www.cemsalumni.org/news/facts-figures |title= CEMS Alumni Association - CEMS |website= www.cemsalumni.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAA is led by an alumni board and is present in many countries through local committees (LCs) made up of CEMS alumni. The LCs are responsible for keeping in contact with CEMS alumni and organizing professional and social activities. They meet on a regular basis to discuss the activities and development of the association. The alumni board comprises: the CAA President, the CEMS Executive Director, a representative of the CEMS Student Board, a representative of CEMS member schools, 3 local committee representatives, 2 senior alumni and 2 junior alumni.

The alumni board's mission is to foster the CEMS alumni community by proposing and developing initiatives that reflect CAA objectives and foster career and personal development opportunities of its alumni members. The alumni board also represents alumni interests on the CEMS Executive Board and supports development of the CEMS alliance. In addition, the CEMS Alumni Association supports alumni to positively influence management education, business, global governance and society.

In [[astronomy]], a '''guide star''' is a reference [[star]] used to accurately maintain the tracking by a [[telescope]] of a heavenly body, whose motion across the sky is primarily due to the [[rotation]] of the [[Earth]].

Accurate telescope pointing and tracking is critical for obtaining good astronomical images and [[astrophotograph]]s. However, because the Earth rotates, the sky appears to be in a constant state of motion relative to the Earth. Although this movement appears to be relatively slow when viewed with the naked eye, with the high magnification and consequently smaller field of view provided by even a small telescope this motion becomes apparent on timescales of the order of seconds.

Though [[space telescope]]s are not mounted on a spinning planet, they still use guide stars including those listed in the HST [[Guide Star Catalog]].

Computer-controlled [[electric motor]]s are commonly employed to allow the telescope to move in sync with the apparent motion of the sky, according to a pre-computed [[pointing model]]. However, there is usually a significant non-zero error associated with the model, which is an approximation to the true motion of the sky.

Most modern professional telescopes use a guide star. An [[autoguider]] is pointed to a sufficiently luminous star that lies near the object being observed and, if the pointing begins to drift, the error can be detected and the movement corrected. This is most accurate when the corrections are applied by a computer, but amateur telescopes often have manual correction (requiring the observer to continuously follow the star by eye for the exposure period, which may be a significant length of time).

Guide stars are also employed in [[adaptive optics]]. In this application, the star is not used to correct for the rotation of the Earth, but to correct for [[turbulence]] in the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. By measuring the observed motion of the guide star, and making minute distortions to the primary mirror, the telescope can produce images with much greater sharpness than is possible without adaptive optics. However, only about 1 percent of the night sky is close enough to a natural guide star to use adaptive optics, so various methods to create artificial [[laser guide star]]s have been developed, including the sodium laser system developed by the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and used by the [[University of California]]'s [[Lick Observatory|Lick]] and [[Keck Observatory|Keck]] observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/June02/Pennington.html | title=Science and Technology Review: Adaptive Optics Sharpen the View from Earth | publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] | date=2002-06-12 | accessdate=2008-06-21 | author=Arnie Heller }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hassan Mourad .jpg|thumb|Hassan Mourad]]
'''Hassan Sobhi Mourad''' (January 3, 1942 – August 14, 2015) was an academic, a [[calligrapher]], an artist, a researcher, an author and a poet. He specialized in [[Arabic Calligraphy]], its development and teaching, drawing to all age groups, as well as contributing in writing art-related articles. Born in [[Syria]], Hassan Mourad lived abroad in various countries and continents for over thirty-five years due to his career in [[diplomatic service]]. Though living abroad for most of his adult life, he remained passionate about the [[Arabic Language]], its history and the art of Arabic Calligraphy. Mourad was influenced at the early age of 14 by a fellow Syrian writer without having ever met him; this artist, AbdulRahman Fakhoory, predicted a bright future in art for Mourad.

Mourad was also influenced by other great Arab artists, such as [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashim the Calligrapher]], the Turkish Hamid Alamady, Mostapha Raqim and Hamdallah Alamasy, as well as the Persian Meer Ali Tabreez, Abbas Akhaween and others.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Having so many historical figures to look up to built a foundation of an ever growing passion for Arabic Calligraphy, which encouraged Mourad to learn the principles and arts with patience, diligence, and willingness. For years thereafter, he continued studying and developing his skill, building on his talent, and learning secrets of the arts.

Mourad designed artworks and logos for various purposes, and a mural for [[King Fahd Academy (Germany)|King Fahd Academy]] in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. He participated in restoring artworks, scripts, and decorations of an old palace in his early years of practicing art. He also copied pages of the [[Quran]] in the [[Diwani Script]] that was never used for the Quran before.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabiangallery.com/hassan-smourad.html|title=Hassan S.Mourad|website=ArabianGallery.com Calligraphy by Hassan S.Mourad|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mourad used [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and Ottoman scripts in decorations he designed for many pieces of his work, also copying many versus of the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The artist was the first to employ the Arabic letter, applying artistic value without distorting the letter, in creating an artwork for his 1986 exhibition in [[Utrecht]], the [[Netherlands]]. He created pieces of fine art with his individual touch of art, with variations in both color and black and white. Mourad was passionate about Arabic Calligraphy, the Arabic script, and its principles of beauty and the distribution of its letters, which in professional calligraphy follow meticulous rules and principles.  He is cited as a professional academic and calligrapher, and through extensive research of the history of Arabic Calligraphy, Mourad concludes that the Misnad style of Arabic Calligraphy is the original form of Arabic Calligraphy and has influenced future calligraphy styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://purescience.uobabylon.edu.iq/service_showrest.aspx?pubid=1088|title=كلية  التربية للعلوم الصرفة {{!}} جامعة بابل|website=purescience.uobabylon.edu.iq|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelle Borromeo Actor Headshots 30.jpg|thumb|180px|Head shot of actress]] 
A '''head shot''' or '''headshot''' is a modern (mostly digital files ) [[portrait]] where the focus is on the person. The term is usually applied for professional profile images on social media, the 'about us page' or a corporate website and promotional pictures of [[actor]]s, [[model (profession)|models]], and [[author]]s. 

==Entertainment industry==
In [[theater]], film, and [[television]], [[actor]]s, [[Model (person)|models]], [[singers]], and other entertainers are often required to include a head shot, along with their résumé, when applying for a job. These head shots are usually more artistic: they intend to portray the subject in the best possible light.&lt;ref name="popphoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popphoto.com/how-to/2015/04/tips-pro-peter-hurley-high-end-headshot-photography|title=Tips From a Pro: Peter Hurley on High-End Headshot Photography|last=Kolonia|first=Peter|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Popular Photography|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center.  A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called "looks". It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person’s shoulders are called "three-quarter" shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color.&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/headshots/taking-your-best-shot/|title=Taking Your Best Shot|last=Sanville|first=Michael|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Backstage|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors' head shots, when printed and not simply uploaded online to an industry database, are done in an 8"×10" format. Other promotional images, for example, press shots and lobby prints, may be in many different aspect ratios. Acting head shots are often not photographic prints, instead they are typically printed via a lithographic or laser process.

The main purpose of an actor's head shot is identification. Therefore, the most important feature of an actor's head shot is that it represents the subject. Theatrical head shots are usually very "neutral" looking shots of the actor clearly showing their facial features.

Head shots are intended to show a person as they currently appear and reflect their best qualities. Therefore, if an actor's hair has been recently cut or colored, they would often get a new head shot to reflect their new image. Additionally, if an actor has a scar or facial blemish, it is expected to be visible on the head shot and not digitally removed from the image. Pimples or spots are temporary and, therefore, are usually digitally retouched.

==Modeling industry==
[[File:Modelling Headshot by Headshot London Photography.jpg|thumb|180px|Modelling headshot]]
Modeling head shots or comp cards, sometimes also called tear sheets, are a compilation of images for casting in one sheet with a résumé of work, name and relevant statistics. They are often done in color; however in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, they may be in black-and-white. Models often use them for castings and modeling work applications. A close-up head shot is often required to show a model's skin complexion for beauty work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Modeling head shots are usually used for:
* Comp cards or tear sheets
* Modeling portfolios
* TV advertisements for skin products
* Magazine advertisements for creams and other skin or hair products
* Online industry profiles

Models' head shots are also often professionally retouched to ensure their close-up beauty photograph appears perfect without blemishes or spots.

[[Comp card]]s are one of the cornerstones of a model’s “marketing materials”. They are about 5½×8” and printed on both sides. Almost all 
comp cards are in color but may include black-and-white images. A model may have four to five images on the comp card and at least one of these images will be a head shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Corporate and business head shots==
[[File:Corporate Headshot of Douglas Anderson.jpg|alt=|thumb|269x269px|Example of corporate head shot featuring entrepreneur and business coach Douglas Anderson of DA Talent]]
Corporate head shots are portraits often produced digitally and used for engaging in social media, the 'about us' page and industry specialty sites. A ''headshot'' or ''head shot'' is often used for branding and to showcase the executive team, style and personality.  Corporations will use the headshot to merge branding between the people working for them and its agency. 

Corporate head shots serve a variety of purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artofheadshots.com/professional-profile-picture/|title=Professional profile picture|last1=Locke|first1=David|date=October 26, 2017|website=artofheadshots.com|publisher=Business professional specialized in headshot photography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding headshots==
Branding headshots may be a corporate or business headshot with the difference being that the image is designed to convey the individual's or a corporate branding identity. A corporation may chose a streamlined background for all its headshots while an individual may chose an action, experience or background objects to identify his or her brand. Large corporations, firms and/or agencies will usually have a manual for the type and style of headshot to be photographed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">'''Hierotopy''' (from {{lang-grc|ἱερός}}, sacred + {{lang-grc|τόπος}}, place, space) is the creation of [[sacred]] spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002  by [[Russia]]n art-historian and [[Byzantinism|byzantinist]] [[Alexei Lidov]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy. The creation of sacred spaces as a form of creativity and subject of cultural history" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.Lidov, Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2006, pp. 32-58&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious [[image]]s, [[ritual]], [[song]], [[incense]], [[light]]) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[religious studies]], but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Pavel Florensky]]) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. Though related with religious [[mysticism]], hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. 

According to the hierotopic approach, [[icon]]s and other sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the erection of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]], as well as the work of [[Abbot Suger]] in the conception of first [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642&lt;/ref&gt; architectural compounds &lt;ref&gt;G. Zelenskaya. "New Jerusalem near Moscow. Aspects of the Conception and New Discoveries" in: ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 745-773&lt;/ref&gt; and even cities&lt;ref&gt;E. Kirichenko. "The Church and the City: on the Symbolic and Structural Unity of the Russian Sacred Space" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 292-322&lt;/ref&gt; and countries&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Петрухин, Владимир Яковлевич|V. Petrukhin]]. "Hierotopy of the Russian Land and the Primary Chronicle" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow, 2006, pp. 480-490&lt;/ref&gt; have become products of hierotopic creativity. 

The topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture &lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts&lt;ref&gt;L. Beliaev. "The Hierotopy of the Orthodox Feast: on the National Traditions in the Making of Sacred Spaces" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 270-291&lt;/ref&gt; and folk customs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moroz. "Sacred and Horrible Places. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Traditional Culture" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 259-269&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest.&lt;ref&gt;N. Isar. "Vision and Performance. A Hierotopic Approach to Contemporary Art", in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 341-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chegodaev. "The Hierotopy of the Ancient Egyptian Sarcophagus" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 18-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six international [[symposium|symposia]] (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.

== Spatial icons ==
The concept of the ''[[spatial icon]]'' plays a central role in  hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009, Ch. 2. Spatial Icons. The miraculous performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople. pp. 39-70, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of "sacred landscapes", such as the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the [[Donkey walk]] in [[medieval]] Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp.533-562&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of sacred spaces ==
The transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a [[theophany]], such as a divine visitation or omen, this  primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or [[temple]]s as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the [[First Temple]], as recounted in the [[Old Testament]], can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the [[Tabernacle]]. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype.  Multiple "New Jerusalems" (reproductions of the Holy City of [[Jerusalem]]), aimed to establish a link to the space of the [[Holy Land]], are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image-paradigms ==
The perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of ''image-paradigms''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-paradigms as a category of visual culture. Hierotopic approach to the art history", ''Russian Journal of Art History(Iskusstvoznanie)'', 2011, No 3-4, pp.109-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-Paradigms as a Notion of Mediterranean Visual Culture: a Hierotopic Approach to Art History" in ''Crossing Cultures. Papers of  the International Congress of Art History. CIHA-2008'', Melbourne, 2009, pp.177-183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], which was present in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''IGNITOR''' is the Italian name for a nuclear research project of [[magnetic confinement fusion]], developed by [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] Laboratories in [[Frascati]]. Construction (in Russia) is not complete.

The project theory is based on ignited plasma in [[tokamak]]. Started in 1977 by Prof. [[Bruno Coppi]] of [[MIT]], IGNITOR is based on the 1970s [[Alcator]] machine at MIT which pioneered the high magnetic field approach to plasma magnetic confinement, continued with the [[Alcator C-Mod|Alcator C/C-Mod]] at MIT and the [[FT/FTU]] series of experiments.  

Compared to the [[ITER]] international project, IGNITOR would be much smaller and cheaper: the ITER reactor is 19,000 tons{{vague|which tons?|date=January 2010}} in weight while the IGNITOR is only 500 tons in weight. IGNITOR is designed to produce approximately 100 [[Megawatt|MW]] of fusion power (and ITER to produce ~500 MW fusion power).

==Development==
At a meeting with the scientific attachés of the European embassies in Moscow in early February 2010 [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]], Director of the [[Kurchatov Institute]],  announced that an initiative aimed at developing a fast paced joint research programme in nuclear fusion research was strongly supported by the Governments of Russia and Italy.

The original proposal had been initiated earlier by [[Evgeny Velikhov]] (President of the Kurchatov Institute) and Bruno Coppi (Head of the High Energy Plasmas Undertaking, MIT) during the early developments of the [[Alcator C-Mod]] programme at MIT, where well known scientists of the Kurchatov Institute made key contributions to experiments that identified the unique confinement and purity properties of the high density plasmas produced by the high field Alcator machine. In effects this investigated, for the first time, physical processes leading to attain self-sustained fusion burning plasmas.

The collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is directed at the construction of the Ignitor machine, the first experiment proposed to achieve ignition conditions by nuclear fusion reactions on the basis of existing knowledge of plasma physics and available technologies. Ignitor is part of the line of research on high magnetic field, experiments producing high density plasmas that began with the Alcator and the Frascati Torus programs at MIT and in Italy, respectively. It remains, at the world level, the only experiment capable of reaching ignition by the magnetic field confinement approach. However, several fusion scientists have contested the claim made for IGNITOR that it is a bigger step towards fusion power than the international [[ITER]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to existing plans, Ignitor will be installed at the Triniti site at [[Troitsk, Moscow Oblast|Troitsk]] near Moscow that has facilities which can be upgraded to house and operate the machine. This site will become open and made to be easily accessible to scientists of all nations. The management of the relevant research programme will involve Italy and Russia only to facilitate the success of the enterprise. The proponents have suggested that the [[United States|US]] become an Associate Member of this effort with a similar arrangement to that made with [[CERN]] for its participation in the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] (Large Hadron Collider) Programme.

The goal to produce meaningful fusion reactors in a reasonable time leads to pursuing the achievement of ignition conditions in the near term in order to understand the plasma physical regimes needed for a net power producing reactor. In addition, an objective other than ignition that can be envisioned for the relatively near term is that of high flux neutron sources for material testing involving compact, high density fusion machines. This has been one of the incentives that have led the Ignitor Project to adopt [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) superconducting cables in the machine design, a first in fusion research. Accordingly, the largest coils (about 5 m diameter) of the machine will be made entirely of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cables.

In the context of the Italy-Russia summit meeting held in Milan on 26 April 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legnostorto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28544&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt; the agreement to proceed with the proposed joint Ignitor program has been signed. The participants, from the Russian side, have included the Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], the Deputy Prime Minister [[Igor Sechin]], the Energy Minister [[Sergei Shmatko]], and the Vice Minister of Education and Research Sergey Mazurenko. Participants from the Italian side have included Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister Valentino Valentini (who had a key role in forging the agreement on the Ignitor program), and the Minister of Education and Research [[Mariastella Gelmini]] who, together with Sergey Mazurenko, signed the agreement in the presence of the two Prime Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banchedati.camera.it/sindacatoispettivo_16/showXhtml.Asp?idAtto=1684&amp;stile=6&amp;highLight=1 Dati Camera dei Deputati]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/esteri/10_aprile_26/putin-berlusconi-incontro-nucleare_d26240c2-5113-11df-884e-00144f02aabe.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Charles Napier Webb''' (13 January 1946 – 9 May 1980) was a Scottish historian and biographer. He was born in [[Edinburgh]], and was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He is remembered primarily for his books ''The Harmonious Circle'', ''The Occult Underground'' (originally titled ''Flight from Reason''), and ''The Occult Establishment''.

In 1980 his important biography of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]], titled ''The Harmonious Circle'', was published. He spent 8 years researching the book, making contacts with the Gurdjieff community worldwide. The New York Review of Books described Webb's research and knowledge of the subject as "extremely comprehensive",&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Dinnage, "The Great Mystifier", The New York Review of Books, 23 October 1980. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1980/oct/23/the-great-mystifier/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mistlberger described the book as "scholarly and occasionally gossipy" with Webb being "unquestionably a sincere researcher" who became "deeply involved in the matter of his subject" while remaining "fundamentally an outsider, an investigative journalist".&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Mistlberger, "The Three Dangerous Magi: Osho, Gurdjieff, Crowley", 2010, pages 327 &amp; 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamdgidi wrote that, amongst all the biographers of Gurdjieff, "only Webb claimed to have been independent and outside the circle of Gurdjieff's followers", and in 2004, in ''Inventors of Gurdjieff'', Paul Beekman Taylor described ''The Harmonious Circle'' as "the first systematic biographical account by a writer who hadn't known Gurdjieff personally"&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad H. Tamdgidi, "Gurdjieff and Hypnosis: A Hermeneutic Study", Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Pages 15 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Webb established that Gurdjieff's writings revealed substantial evidence of familiarity with the languages and cultures of central Asia, but Webb regarded Gurdjieff more as a self-taught innovator than a member of an esoteric Asiatic group, and, although seeing some of its forms having derived from Asia, saw the content of his teachings deriving from western occult traditions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Paul Johnson, "Initiates of Theosophical Masters", State University of New York Press, 1995, p140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb's theories of Gurdjieff's identity as a Russian foreign agent in Central Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, "Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen", 2008, Quest Books, pp124-125. {{ISBN|978-0835608572}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theories on where he actually travelled before 1917, are considered controversial points in ''The Harmonious Circle''.

Webb's work challenges theories of [[secularism]], theories of decline in organised religion and [[spirituality]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Webb argued that the 19th and 20th centuries had also been marked by a revolt against the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and that the rise of ''irrationalism'' was much more marked than the rise of rationalism, especially before, during and after the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]. Webb traced the influence of [[occult]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] groups and writers on literature, philosophy and politics.

Webb was generally ignored in his lifetime, but with the increasing rise of [[New Age]] spirituality in later years, his work now seems increasingly prescient. After increasing mental health difficulties, Webb committed suicide in 1980.

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] has lauded him as a serious researcher of occultism: "By focusing on functional significance of occultism in political irrationalism, Webb rescued the study of [[Nazi occultism]] for the [[history of ideas]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism: The Ariosophists of Austria and Germany 1890–1935, originally published in 1985 by the Aquarian Press in Wellingborough, England&lt;/ref&gt;

His major works ''The Occult Underground'' and ''The Occult Establishment'' were translated into German and published in 2009 and 2008 respectively.

[[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] established the "James Webb Prize for the History of Ideas" in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/264/the_damned_the_strange_death_of_james_webb.html Gary Lachman, "The Damned: the strange death of James Webb"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722035959/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/264/the_damned_the_strange_death_of_james_webb.html |date=22 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/history-subject-notes Trinity College, History Subject Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007194611/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/history-subject-notes |date=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Green holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from [[University of California]], Los Angeles; a Master of Science in Genetics from [[San Diego State University]]; and a Doctorate of Environmental Science and Engineering (D.Env.) from University of California, Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green’s research has focused on energy and environmental policy at think tanks in North America. After completing his doctoral degree in 1994, he studied environmental policy at the Libertarian [[Reason Foundation]] in California. He then spent three years studying Canadian and American environmental policy at the fiscally-conservative [[Fraser Institute]] in Vancouver, British Columbia. On returning to the United States, Green was executive director of the [[Environmental Literacy Council]] for one year before joining the American Enterprise Institute in 2006. He returned to Canada in 2013, becoming Senior Director, Energy and Natural Resources of the Fraser Institute. There, his research concerned energy and natural resource policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/author.aspx?id=14827&amp;txID=2729]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green has also served on advisory and review boards.  From 1996 to 1999, he was a member of the California [[REACH Commission]], and from 1996 to 2001, he was a member of the [[California Departmental Transportation Advisory Committee]]. He has twice served as expert reviewer for publications of the [[United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group]], including a 1999 special report on aviation and the global atmosphere, and a 2001 volume on the science of climate change.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green’s work has appeared in [[National Review]], Financial Times, [[Wall Street Journal]], Financial Post, [[Washington Post]], [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]]. He has written policy analyses, articles in popular magazine, opinion columns, book chapters, and a textbook for middle-school students entitled ''Global Warming: Understanding the Debate''. In 2011, he published a supplementary textbook for college students studying energy and energy policy, ''Abundant Energy: Fuel of Human Flourishing''. Green has been a guest on talk radio and television news programs, and has given presentations on public policy to student groups, business groups, and legislative staff. He has testified before local, regional, and national regulatory and legislative bodies, including appearances before committees of both houses of the United States Congress, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and U.S. House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2011, in written testimony to the [[United States Senate|United States Senate's]] Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee he said "In conclusion, the idea that government can create jobs in the economy is a myth." During Committee questioning he conceded "It would be absurd to say the government cannot create jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franken|first1=Al|title=Giant of the Senate|date=May 30, 2017|publisher=Twelve|location=2896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he co-authored an article with [[Steven F. Hayward]] entitled, 'Market-Friendly Energy', in ''[[The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs]]'', published by the [[George W. Bush Presidential Center]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green describes himself as “a [[free-market environmentalist]],” and believes that most environmental problems stem from an absence of properly defined and enforced property rights, and/or insufficient societal wealth to afford environmental protection. He has testified that although he believes the environment worth protecting such environmental protection must not harm other American values considered cardinal such as property rights, due process, economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

On climate change, Green has repeatedly stated that he believes the climate is warming, and greenhouse gases are partially responsible. He is, however skeptical of computer models that contain unsubstantiated assumptions about positive feedback loops, and he has expressed contempt for computerized projections of future or regional climate change, comparing them to “computerized horoscopes.” Green has testified that as no technology currently exists to significantly and affordably reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, he favors an agenda of adaptation and resilience-building. To hedge against the risk of more extreme climate change, Green favors increased research into [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Concerning energy policy, Green considers himself an “energy realist,” and does not believe there are currently technologies that can substantially or affordably substitute for conventional energy sources such as coal, nuclear power, oil, and natural gas. To the extent that such alternatives do exist, Green has shown they pose environmental and economic challenges, and he believes they should not be hastily adopted without considering potential unintended adverse consequences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''The McKnight Brain Institute''' (MBI) at the [[University of Florida]] is a research and teaching center, which conducts integrated Research in [[neuroscience]], [[neurology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[psychiatry]], [[cognitive science]], and related areas. The MBI is one of the nation’s most comprehensive and technologically advanced centers devoted to discovering how the normal brain operates, and how we can repair the brain following injury, disease, or aging.  The MBI has over 300 faculty from 50 Departments in the UF with current major research focuses including neurodegeneration (such as AD, PD, and ALS), age-related memory loss, brain and spinal cord injuries, brain tumors, and addiction.

The MBI at UF is the flagship of four McKnight Brain Institutes across the United States.  '''Dr. Tetsuo Ashizawa''' is the current '''Executive Director of the MBI'''.  Former Executive Directors include Dr. William G. Luttge, the founding Director, Dr. Douglass Anderson, and Dr. Dennis A. Steindler.

== History ==

Dr. Luttge joined UF in 1971 as an assistant professor of neuroscience in the College of Medicine after earning his Ph.D. in biological sciences at the University of California, Irvine. The neuroscience department at the College of Medicine was one of the first of its kind in the country, and Luttge quickly became its leader, researching the molecular and behavioral actions of steroids in the brain.

In December 1991, Luttge came across an excerpt from an obscure newsletter, ''Commerce Business Daily'', announcing a call for proposals for a competitive Department of Defense (DoD) grant to build a major national brain and spinal cord research center. Around the same time, the University of Florida (UF), through its Health Science Center, College of Medicine and its teaching hospital, Shands at UF, made a strategic decision to create a unique campus-wide program to enhance the multidisciplinary research, clinical care and educational skills of the entire university. This program was named the University of Florida Brain Institute (UFBI).

Newly appointed as director of UF’s Brain Institute, Luttge embarked on a logistical tour de force to meet all requirements of the grant application. The requirements, such as a $36,000,000 matching grant from UF, were soon met. And on June 11, 1992, UF had won the $18,000,000 grant, beating out several prestigious universities and neuroscience research centers.
Construction of the new institute building couldn’t be completed, however, until the Defense Department and Veterans Affairs awarded another $20,000,000 for the project in 1996 and 1997. On October 22, 1998,  The University of Florida officially opened the doors to its world-class, $60 million UF Brain Institute building.

The MBI-UF was renamed the '''Evelyn F. &amp; William L. McKnight Brain Institute''' of the University of Florida (MBI-UF) to celebrate and commemorate a $15,000,000 gift from the '''McKnight Brain Research Foundation'''. This award was the largest cash gift in UF history and it was matched by the State of Florida to help create over a $30,000,000 permanent endowment devoted to fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying the formation, storage and retrieval of memories, the impairments in these processes associated with aging, and the development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention and/or alleviation of these impairments in humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">'''[[Time-domain reflectometry]]''' or TDR is a [[Measurement|measurement technique]] which correlates the frequency-dependent electric and [[dielectric]] properties of materials such as [[soil]], [[Agriculture#Agricultural production systems|agrarian products]], [[snow]], [[wood]] or [[concrete]] to their moisture content.

Measurement usually involves inserting a sensor into the substance to be tested and then applying either Standard Waveform Analysis to determine the average moisture content along the sensor or Profile Analysis to provide moisture content at discrete points along the sensor. A spatial location can be achieved by appropriate installation of several sensors.
[[File:Simple Time Domain Reflectometer Diagram.png|thumb|right|Functional principle of a TDR meter]]

== Standard Waveform Analysis ==
[[File:TDR-Waveguide Moisture Measurement.jpg|thumb|right|A TDR waveguide with exposed wires]]
In the waveform analysis a sensor (usually a probe) is placed in the material to be tested. The sensor contains a [[waveguides|waveguide]] consisting of two or three parallel wires which is connected via a [[coaxial cable]] to a voltage [[Pulse (physics)|pulse generator]] which sends precisely defined voltage pulses into the sensor. As the pulse travels along the waveguide its progress varies depending on the moisture content of the material being examined. When the pulse reaches the end of the waveguide it is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]]. This reflection is visualised in a TDR [[waveform]] using an [[oscilloscope]] connected to the sensor. The intensity of the pulse in the probe is measured and related to moisture content, with higher voltage indicating an increase of moisture. By comparing the measured reflection to the initial pulse the average moisture content and relative [[Permittivity|permitivity]] of the sample can be calculated by using an [[equivalent circuit]] as a reference.

Standard waveform analysis can be used either manually (hand held instruments) or [[Automaton|automatically]] for monitoring moisture content in several areas such as [[hydrology]], [[agriculture]] and [[construction]].

== Profile Analysis ==
Standard Waveform Analysis is unable to provide a spatial moisture profile. More sophisticated methods such as Profile Analysis are required. This method uses a variety of techniques to add spatial information to the measurement results.

* '''Reconstruction algorithm''': One approach is to model the pulse propagation in the waveguide and calibrate the model against laboratory measurement. By comparing real sample measurements to the model, the moisture distribution can be inferred. 
:The usefulness of this method is limited by the complexity of the algorithms, the limited amplitude resolution and interference in the TDR equipment.

* '''Alteration of Cross Section''': Altering the cross section of the waveguide alters the pulse reflections and creates artificial reflections at each alteration of the cross section. This enables segmentations of the waveguide by applying a different cross section to each segment. 
:However the difficulty of distinguishing the artificial pulse reflection from a real variance prevents the use of this technique for automated data analysis.

[[File:Moisture Detection in Buildings with TDR.png|thumb|Moisture detection in buildings using profile analysis]]
* '''Subdivision''': The waveguide is subdivided into segments by using [[PIN diode]]s. Each segment provides its own pulse reflection thus showing the moisture content in that segment alone. This enables the moisture content to be mapped to the individual segments and therefore shows the spatial moisture distribution.
:As the length of the waveguide increases the reflections become weaker and eventually disappear. This limits the use of this method as do the influence of the diode [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] on the signal and manufacturing costs associated with the complexity of the waveguide compared to other methods.

* '''Length Variation''': This method uses several waveguides with different lengths mounted parallel to each other. As a separate waveguide must be connected for each area, the costs of this method are very high.

Profile analysis allows fully automatic measurement and monitoring of spatial moisture content and thus a leak monitoring of building [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[landfill]] barriers and [[Deep geological repository|geological repositories]] in [[Salt mining|salt mines]].

'''Mikhail Naumovich Epstein''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Нау́мович Эпште́йн}}; or Epshtein, born April 21, 1950) is a Russian-American literary theorist and critical thinker. Mikhail Epstein is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Cultural Theory and Russian Literature at Emory University, USA. He worked as Professor of Russian and Cultural Theory at Durham University, UK, in 2012–2015. He moved from the USSR (Moscow) to the USA (Atlanta) in 1990 and from the USA to England (Durham) in 2012 and then back to Atlanta, to resume teaching at Emory, in 2015. He was founder and director of Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University &lt;ref&gt;[Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University] [https://www.dur.ac.uk/chi/]&lt;/ref&gt; (2012–2015).

His areas of specialization include [[postmodernism]], cultural and literary theory; the history of [[Russian literature]]  (particularly Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Platonov and 20th century poetry) and intellectual history; contemporary philosophical and religious thought;  new methods and interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities; semiotics, language evolution and neologisms; and ideas and electronic media. Professor Epstein is also an expert on Russian philosophy of the 19th and 20th century and on thinkers like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. He writes essays on cultural, social, ethical and international issues.

==Biography==
Epstein was born in [[Moscow]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage. He graduated from the philological faculty of Moscow State University in 1972. He was a member of Soviet Writers Union since 1978 and the founder and director of the Laboratory of Contemporary Culture in Moscow (1988–89).

He moved to the USA in 1990 and was fellow of Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ([[Washington D.C.]]) in 1990–1991. He joined Emory faculty in 1990. In 1992–1994 he received grant from National Council for Soviet and East European Research to work on the history of Russian thought of the late Soviet period. He has authored InteLnet (Intellectual network, 1995) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/intelnet2.html inteLnet]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other interdisciplinary web sites in the humanities.

One of his major continuing  projects is "On the Future of the Humanities: Paradigmatic Shifts and Emerging Concepts" on which he worked as an inaugural senior fellow at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry (Emory University, 2002–03)and as a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University (2011). He had visiting professor appointments at Wesleyan University (1990) and University of Oregon at  Eugene (2002).

Mikhail Epstein has won national and international prizes, including Andrei Bely prize ([[St. Petersburg]], 1991); The Social Innovations Award 1995 from the Institute for Social Inventions (London) for his electronic Bank of New Ideas; the International Essay Contest set up by [[Lettre International]] and Weimar – Cultural City of Europe 1999; and Liberty Prize, awarded for his outstanding contribution in the development of Russian-American cultural connections (New York, 2000).

Epstein maintains blogs on "Facebook", "Snob" and "Live Journal" networks, where, in particular, since 2007 he conducts and reports "СЛОВО ГОДА" – a [[Word of the year (Russia)|Russian-language "Word of the Year"]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snob.ru/profile/27356/blog/101993 "СЛОВО ГОДА-2015. ИТОГИ ВЫБОРОВ" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and Terms==

In the realm of [[aesthetics]], Epstein (together with poet and conceptual artist [[Dmitry Prigov]]) is credited with introducing the concept of "[[new sincerity]]" (''novaia iskrennost'') as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today," in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258-59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen," dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, "A Catalogue of New Poetries," in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exploration of contemporary spirituality, Epstein focuses on the concept of "post-atheism," or "minimal [or poor] religion," discussed in particular in his correspondence with the Protestant thinker Thomas Altizer and extensively examined in Charles Taylor's book "The Secular Age" (2007) that refers to Epstein's innovative work.

Mikhail Epstein has coined a number of new concepts and terms (in English and in Russian) that now circulate on tens of thousands of websites in various branches of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|title=The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prostitution''' is the business or practice of engaging in [[sexual activity]] in exchange for [[payment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prostitution|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prostitution|publisher=US Legal|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes described as '''sexual services''', '''commercial sex''' or, colloquially, '''hooking'''. It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as "'''the world's oldest profession'''" in the [[English-speaking world]].{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/rush_limbaugh_calls_sandra_fluke_a_prostitute_is_prostitution_really_the_world_s_oldest_profession_.html|title=Rush Limbaugh calls Sandra Fluke a "prostitute": Is prostitution really the world's oldest profession?|author=Forrest Wickman|date=6 March 2012|website=Slate Magazine|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who works in this field is called a '''prostitute''', and is a type of [[sex worker]]. 

Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms, and [[prostitution law|its legal status]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]] (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being permissible but unregulated, to an enforced or unenforced crime, or a regulated profession. It is one branch of the [[sex industry]], along with [[pornography]], [[Stripper|stripping]], and [[Erotic dance|erotic dancing]]. [[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In [[Escort agency|escort prostitution]], the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is [[street prostitution]]. Although the majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients, a prostitute can be, and have clients of, any [[gender]] or [[sexual orientation]].

== Etymology and terminology ==
[[File:EN BESKYTTERINDE AF INDUSTRIEN.gif|thumb|Prostitute c.1890]]

''Prostitute'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''prostituta''. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of "''pro''" meaning "up front" or "forward" and "''stituere''", defined as "to offer up for sale".{{sfn|Perkins|Lovejoy|2007|pp=2–3}} Another explanation is that ''prostituta'' is a composition of ''pro'' and ''statuere'' (to cause to stand, to station, place erect). A literal translation therefore is: "to put up front for sale" or "to place forward". The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states, "The notion of 'sex for hire' is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one 'exposed to lust' or sex 'indiscriminately offered.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=prostitute&amp;searchmode=none |title=''prostitute'' |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ |title=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''prostitute'' was then carried down through various languages to the present-day Western society. Most [[sex worker activists]] groups reject the word ''prostitute'' and since the late 1970s have used the term ''sex worker'' instead. However, ''sex worker'' can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sexual nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex%20worker |title=''sex worker'' |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-120025|title = Sociology of Sex Work| journal=Annual Review of Sociology| volume=35| pages=213–234|year = 2009|last1 = Weitzer|first1 = Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirck van Baburen - The Procuress - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1622)]]

A variety of terms are used for those who engage in prostitution, some of which distinguish between different types of prostitution or imply a value judgment about them. Common alternatives for ''prostitute'' include ''[[Escort agency|escort]]'' and ''whore''; however, not all professional escorts are prostitutes.

The English word ''whore'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''hōra'', from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*hōrōn'' (prostitute), which derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] ''*keh₂-'' meaning "desire", a root which has also given us Latin ''cārus'' (dear), whence the French ''cher'' (dear, expensive) and the Latin ''cāritās'' (love, charity). Use of the word ''whore'' is widely considered [[pejorative]], especially in its modern slang form of ''ho''. In Germany, however, most prostitutes' organizations deliberately use the word ''Hure'' (whore) since they feel that ''prostitute'' is a bureaucratic term.  Those seeking to remove the social stigma associated with prostitution often promote terminology such as ''[[sex worker]]'', ''commercial sex worker'' (CSW) or ''sex trade worker''.  Another commonly used word for a prostitute is ''hooker''. Although a popular etymology connects "hooker" with [[Joseph Hooker]], a Union general in the [[American Civil War]], the word more likely comes from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the [[Corlear's Hook]] area of [[Manhattan]] in the 1820s, who came to be referred to as "hookers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AmericanHeritage.com / History Now |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521101352/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |archivedate=21 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''streetwalker'' solicits customers on the streets or in public places, while a ''[[call girl]]'' makes appointments by phone, or in recent years, through email or the internet.

Correctly or not, use of the word ''prostitute'' without specifying a sex may commonly be assumed to be female; compound terms such as ''[[male prostitution]]'' or ''male escort'' are therefore often used to identify males.  Those offering services to female customers are commonly known as ''gigolos''; those offering services to male customers are ''hustlers'' or ''rent boys''.

===Procuring===
{{main|Procuring (prostitution)}}
Organizers of prostitution may be known as ''[[pimp]]s'' (if male) and ''[[madam]]s'' or ''[[Mama-san]]'' (if female). More formally, one who is said to practice procuring is a ''procurer'', or ''procuress''.

===Clients===
{{Redirect|Mongering|those who monger|Monger (disambiguation)}}
Clients of prostitutes, most often men by [[prevalence]], are sometimes known as ''johns'' or ''tricks'' in North America and ''punters'' in the [[British Isles]]. These slang terms are used among both prostitutes and law enforcement for persons who solicit prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |title=Adult Industry Terms and Acronyms |publisher=Forum.myredbook.com |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209113009/http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''john'' may have originated from the frequent customer practice of giving one's name as "John", a common name in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, in an effort to maintain anonymity. In some places, men who drive around [[red-light district]]s for the purpose of soliciting prostitutes are also known as ''[[kerb crawler]]s''.

Female clients of prostitutes are sometimes referred to as ''janes'' or ''sugar mamas''.&lt;ref name="janes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="janes2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sm1" /&gt;

=== Other meanings ===
The word "prostitution" can also be used metaphorically to mean debasing oneself or working towards an unworthy cause or "selling out".&lt;ref name="education.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |title=prostitution – Dictionary definition and pronunciation – Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323211921/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |archivedate=23 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, "prostituting oneself" or "whoring oneself" the services or acts performed are typically not sexual.  For instance, in the book ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', [[Holden Caulfield]] says of his brother ("D.B."): "Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me." D.B. is not literally a prostitute; Holden feels that his job writing [[B-movie]] screenplays is morally debasing.

The prostitution metaphor, "traditionally used to signify political inconstancy, unreliability, fickleness, a lack of firm values and integrity, and venality, has long been a staple of Russian political rhetoric."&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"&gt;Riabova, Tatiana and Riabova, Oleg (2015) "Gayromaidan" in Fedor, Julie; Portnov, Andriy; and Umland, Andraes (eds.) ''Journal of Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society: Sociographic Essays on the Post-Soviet Infrastructure for Alternative Healing Practices, Volume 1, Issue 1'' Columbia University Press.

For the sake of the longed alliance with imperialist democracies [Stalin] has brought the Comintern to the last stages of political prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/09/newwar.htm |publisher=Marxists.org |title = New War Flows from Versailles Banditry |author=Trotsky, Leon| authorlink = Leon Trotsky |date = September 1938 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides targeting political figures, the term is used in relation to organizations and even small countries, which "have no choice but to sell themselves", because their voice in world affairs is insignificant. In 2007, a Russian caricature depicted the Baltic states as three "ladies of the night", "vying for the attentions of Uncle Sam, since the Russian client has run out of money".&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"/&gt;

Usage of the "political prostitute" moniker is by no means unique to Russian political lexicon, such as when a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' contributor expressed the opinion that [[Donald J. Trump]] was "prostituting himself to feed his ego and gain power" when he ran for President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-gerdy/winner-or-just-another-po_b_9347740.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |title = Winner or Just Another Political Prostitute? |author=Gerdy, Tom |date = 29 February 2016 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work researcher and writer Gail Pheterson writes that these metaphorical usages exist because "the term "prostitute" gradually took on a Christian moralist tradition, as being synonymous with debasement of oneself or of others for the purpose of ill-gotten gains".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/466259|jstor=466259|title=The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness|journal=Social Text|issue=37|pages=39|year=1993|last1=Pheterson|first1=Gail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'', the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', and also the Indian ''[[tawaif]]''. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their beauty, and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[File:Pompeii-wall painting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from the [[Pompeii]] brothel]]

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome]] was legal, public, and widespread. A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category '''''prostibulae'''''. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose, sometimes by large-scale "prostitute farmers" who took [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=New Advent |accessdate=26 August 2018|quote= But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, [[Muhammad]] sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]] – muta'a in Iraq and [[sigheh]] in Iran – which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of fixed-term marriage was abrogated and ultimately forbidden by either Muhammad, or one of his successors, [[Umar]]. Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]], and [[Osaka]], Japan. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesan]]s in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The oiran were considered a type of {{nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the {{nihongo|''tayū''|太夫}} was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and an educated wit was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761. Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a "private agreement" reached between a woman and a man in a [[brothel]]. [[Yoshiwara]] has a large number of [[soapland]]s that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as toruko-buro, meaning [[Turkish bath]].

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of South Asia, particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans danced, sang, recited poetry and entertained their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film, and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm |title=Mapping cultures |publisher=The Hindu |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Main|Courtesan}}
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] the definition of a prostitute has been ambiguous, with various secular and canonical organizations defining prostitution in constantly evolving terms. Even though medieval secular authorities created legislation to deal with the phenomenon of prostitution, they rarely attempted to define what a prostitute was because it was deemed unnecessary "to specify exactly who fell into that [specific] category" of a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rollo-Koster|first=Joelle|title=From Prostitutes to Brides of Christ: The Avignonese Repentises in the Late Middle Ages|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|year=2002|volume=31|issue=1|page=110|doi=10.1215/10829636-32-1-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known definition of prostitution was found in Marseille's thirteenth-century statutes, which included a chapter entitled De meretricibus ("regarding prostitutes").&lt;ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110" /&gt; The Marseillais designated prostitutes as "public girls" who, day and night, received two or more men in their house, and as a woman who "did business trading [their bodies], within the confine[s] of a [[brothel]]."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} A fourteenth-century English tract, Fasciculus Morum, states that the term prostitute (termed '[[meretrix]]' in this document), "must be applied only to those women who give themselves to anyone and will refuse none, and that for monetary gain".{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} In general prostitution was not typically a life-time career choice for women. Women usually alternated their career of prostitution with "petty retailing, and victualing," or only occasionally turning to prostitution in times of great financial need.{{sfn|Roberts|1992|p=65}} Women who became prostitutes often did not have the familial ties or means to protect themselves from the lure of prostitution, and it has been recorded on several occasions that mothers would be charged with prostituting their own daughters in exchange for extra money.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Medieval civilians accepted without question the fact of prostitution, it was necessary part of medieval life.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=16}} Prostitutes subverted the sexual tendencies of male youth, just by existing. With the establishment of prostitution men were less likely to collectively rape honest women of marriageable and re-marriageable age.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=32}} This is most clearly demonstrated in [[St. Augustine]]'s claim that "the removal of the institution would bring lust into all aspects of the world."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=34}} Meaning that without prostitutes to subvert male tendencies, men would go after innocent women instead, thus the prostitutes were actually doing society a favor.

In urban societies there was an erroneous view that prostitution was flourishing more in rural regions rather than in cities, however it has been proven that prostitution was more rampant in cities and large towns.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Although there were wandering prostitutes in rural areas who worked according to the calendar of fairs, similar to riding a circuit, in which prostitutes stopped by various towns based on what event was going on at the time, most prostitutes remained in cities. Cities tended to draw more prostitutes due to the sheer size of the population and the institutionalization of prostitution in urban areas which made it more rampant in metropolitan regions.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Furthermore, in both urban and rural areas of society, women who did not live under the rule of male authority were more likely to be suspected of prostitution than their oppressed counterparts because of the fear of women who did not fit into a stereotypical category outside of marriage or religious life.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Secular law, like most other aspects of prostitution in the Middle Ages, is difficult to generalize due to the regional variations in attitudes towards prostitution.{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–31}} The global trend of the thirteenth century was toward the development of positive policy on prostitution as laws exiling prostitutes changed towards [[sumptuary laws]] and the confinement of prostitutes to [[red light districts]].{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}}

Sumptuary laws became the regulatory norm for prostitutes and included making [[courtesans]] "wear a shoulder-knot of a particular color as a badge of their calling" to be able to easily distinguish the prostitute from a respectable woman in society.{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}} The color that designated them as prostitutes could vary from different earth tones to yellow, as was usually designated as a color of shame in the Hebrew communities.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | pp=95-117}} These laws, however, proved no impediment to wealthier prostitutes because their glamorous appearances were almost indistinguishable from noble women.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | p=101}}

Although brothels were still present in most cities and urban centers, and could range from private bordelages run by a procuress from her home to public baths and centers established by municipal legislation, the only centers for prostitution legally allowed were the institutionalized and publicly funded brothels.{{sfnm|Karras|1998|1p=32|Rossiaud|1996|2p=6}} However this did not prevent illegal brothels from thriving. Furthermore, brothels theoretically banned the [[patronage]] of married men and clergy also, but it was sporadically enforced and there is evidence of clergymen present in brawls that were documented in brothels.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=41}} Thus the clergy were at least present in brothels at some point or another. Brothels also settled the "obsessive fear of the sharing of women" and solved the issue of "collective security."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=42}} The lives of prostitutes in brothels were not cloistered like that of nuns and "only some lived permanently in the streets assigned to them."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=43}} Prostitutes were only allowed to practice their trade in the brothel in which they worked.{{sfn|Geremek|2006|p=216}} Brothels were also used to protect prostitutes and their clients through various regulations. For example, the law that "forbid brothel keepers [from] beat[ing] them."{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}} However, brothel regulations also hindered prostitutes' lives by forbidding them from having "lovers other than their customers" or from having a favored customer.{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}}

Courts showed the conflicting views on the role of prostitutes in secular law as prostitutes could not inherit property, defend themselves in court, or make accusations in court.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=37}} However, prostitutes were sometimes called upon as witnesses during trial.&lt;{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–107}}

=== 16th–17th centuries ===
By the end of the 15th century attitudes seemed to have begun to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] 1494 which later swept across Europe, and which may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] from the earlier 13th century, may have been causes of this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague, and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothel-keeping and prostitution was also used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the sixteenth-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}}
[[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold: “acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]]."{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the fourteenth century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were to be excluded from the Church as long as they practiced.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=36}} Around the twelfth century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. 'Magdalene Homes' were particularly popular and peaked especially in the early fourteenth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1994|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–4}} Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes, with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/History/teaching/protref/women/WR0911.htm|title=L. Roper: Luther on sex, marriage and motherhood. The University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves by particular signs, sometimes wearing very short hair or no hair at all, or wearing [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated in this case the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession. In some cultures, prostitutes were the sole women allowed to sing in public or act in theatrical performances.

=== 18th century ===
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ,'' the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfn|Gazali|2001|p=106}}&lt;ref name=Nedim&gt;{{cite book|title=Nedim and the poetics of the Ottoman court|author=Kemal Sılay|isbn=978-1-878318-09-1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]], who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also worked as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242 "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are {{linktext|bardash}}es [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]], and the details of their sexual practices.

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they frequently visited local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-19th-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–5]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation mandating pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. This legislation applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. France, instead of trying to outlaw prostitution began to view prostitution as an evil necessary for society to function. France chose to regulate prostitution, introducing a Morals Brigade onto the streets of Paris.{{sfn|Harsin|1985|pp=3, 25}}  A similar situation did in fact exist in the [[Russian Empire]]; prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels were given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. A major work, ''[[Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects]]'', was published by [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]] in 1857, which estimated that
the County of London had 80,000 prostitutes and that 1 house in 60 was serving as a brothel.{{Sfn|Gale|p=245}} [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During this period, prostitution was also very prominent in the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco]] as the population was mainly men, due to the influx from the [[Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Sears|2014| }} One of the more successful madams was [[Belle Cora (Arabella Ryan)|Belle Cora]], who inadvertently got involved in a scandal involving her husband, Charles Cora, shooting US Marshal William H. Richardson.{{sfn|Jensen|2011| }} This led to the rise of new statutes against prostitution, gambling and other activities seen as "immoral".{{sfn|Sears|2014| }}

=== 20th century ===
The leading theorists of Communism opposed prostitution. Communist governments often attempted to repress the practice immediately after obtaining power, although it always persisted. In contemporary Communist countries, it remains illegal but is nonetheless common.{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FSNB0G7f4CsC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=prostitution+in+former+soviet+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vtvOji8f76&amp;sig=t6tNuWtoT4OzR2W5shTCYe1SfWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia4520td3aAhUGJ8AKHbOqCKY4ChDoAQhSMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20former%20soviet%20countries&amp;f=false 169]}} The economic decline brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to increased prostitution in many current or former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Slate Explainer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, prostitution was widely legal in the United States. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. On the other hand, prostitution generated much national revenue in South Korea, hence the military government encouraged [[prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|prostitution for the U.S. military]].&lt;ref name=IBT20130429&gt;{{cite news | first=Palash | last=Ghosh | title=South Korea: A Thriving Sex Industry In A Powerful, Wealthy Super-State | date=29 April 2013 | publisher=[[International Business Times]] | url =http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647 | accessdate = 21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joongang20081030&gt;{{cite news|first=Soo-mee |last=Park |title=Former sex workers in fight for compensation |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[Joongang Daily]] |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430220310/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of [[prostitution in the United Kingdom]] itself, it prohibited such activities as running a brothel. Soliciting was made illegal by the [[Street Offences Act 1959]]. These laws were partly repealed, and altered, by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] and the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]].

Beginning in the late 1980s, many states in the US increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. Penalties for felony prostitution vary, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison.

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]].

In the 21st century, [[Afghan]]s revived a method of prostituting young boys which is referred to as "[[bacha bazi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/ |title=The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the break up of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], thousands of eastern European women end up as prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel, and Turkey every year; some enter the profession willingly, but many are tricked, coerced, or kidnapped, and often experience captivity and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Margot (24 June 2001).

==Islam==
According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah]] (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]]) which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval Islamic Civilization: L-Z, index|url = https://books.google.com/?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA647&amp;dq=mutah+prostitution#v=onepage&amp;q=mutah%2520prostitution&amp;f=false|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1 January 2006|isbn = 9780415966924|language = en|first = Josef W.|last = Meri|first2 = Jere L.|last2 = Bacharach}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nikah misyar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Eye4ilLVkC&amp;pg=PA52 | title=Muslim World: Modern Muslim Societies | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=5 April 2013 | author=Pohl, Florian | pages=52–53| isbn=9780761479277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities.

"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

== Payments and salaries ==
Prostitutes' salaries and payments fluctuate according to the economic conditions of their respective countries. Prostitutes who usually have foreign clients, such as business travelers, depend on good foreign economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/redlight-district-hit-as-tourists-become-tightfisted-20090601-bsi8.html |title=Red-light district hit as tourists become tight-fisted |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payment may vary according to regulations made by pimps, brothel keepers, madams, and procurers, who usually take a slice out of a prostitute's income.&lt;ref&gt;Global Perspectives on Gender and Work: Readings and Interpretations, Jacqueline Goodman – 2000 p.373&lt;/ref&gt; Prices may further depend on demand; popular, high-end prostitutes can earn significant amounts of money (upwards of $5,000 per client),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/the-economics-of-high-end-prostitutes |title=The Economics Of High-End Prostitutes |publisher=More Intelligent Life |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virgins may receive even higher payments.

=== Attitudes ===
{{Further|Feminist views on prostitution}}

Roughly speaking, the possible attitudes are:
* "Prostitution should be tolerated by society":
** [[decriminalization]]: "prostitution is labor like any other. Sex industry premises should not be subject to any special regulation or laws", the current situation in New Zealand; the laws against operating a brothel, pimping and street prostitution are struck down, but prostitution is hardly regulated at all. Proponents of this view often cite instances of government regulation under legalization that they consider intrusive, demeaning, or violent, but feel that criminalization adversely affects sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexworkeurope.org/sites/default/files/userfiles/files/join/manbrussels2005.pdf Sex Workers in Europe Manifesto].

Amnesty International. Published 14 August 2015. Retrieved 23 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
** regulation: prostitution may be considered a legitimate business; prostitution and the employment of prostitutes are legal, but regulated; the current situation in the Netherlands, Germany, most of [[Prostitution in Australia|Australia]] and parts of [[Nevada]] (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]). The degree of regulation varies very much; for example, in the Netherlands, prostitutes are not required to undergo mandatory health checks (see [[Prostitution in the Netherlands]]), while in [[Nevada]], the regulations are very strict (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])
* "Prostitution should not be tolerated":
** [[Abolition of prostitution|abolitionism]] (prostitution itself is not prohibited, but most associated activities are illegal, in an attempt to make it more difficult to engage in prostitution, prostitution is heavily discouraged and seen as a social problem): prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal, but the surrounding activities such as public [[solicitation]], operating a [[brothel]] and other forms of [[pimp]]ing are prohibited, the current situation in Great Britain and Italy among others;
** [[Abolition of prostitution|neo-abolitionism]] ("prostitution is a form of [[violence against women]], it is a violation of human rights, the clients of the prostitutes exploit the prostitutes"): prostitutes are not prosecuted, but their clients and pimps are, which is the current situation in Sweden, France, Norway and Iceland (in Norway the law is even more strict, forbidding also having sex with a prostitute abroad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7806760.stm|title=New Norway law bans buying of sex|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[prohibitionism]] (both prostitutes and clients are criminalized and are seen as immoral, they are considered criminals): the prevailing attitude nearly everywhere in the United States, with a few exceptions in some rural [[Nevada]] counties (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])

In some countries, there is controversy regarding the laws applicable to [[sex work]]. For instance, the legal stance of punishing pimping while keeping sex work legal but "underground" and risky is often denounced as hypocritical; opponents suggest either going the full abolition route and criminalize clients or making sex work a regulated business.

Many countries have sex worker advocacy groups which lobby against criminalization and discrimination of prostitutes.
These groups generally oppose Nevada-style regulation and oversight, stating that prostitution should be treated like other professions. In the United States of America, one such group is [[COYOTE]] (an abbreviation for "Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics") and another is the North American Task Force on Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayswan.org/NTFP.html |title=Prostitution: North American Task Force On Prostitution |publisher=Bayswan.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia the lead sex worker rights organisation is [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/ |title=Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex Workers Association is the national peak sex worker organisation in Australia |publisher=Scarletalliance.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[Sex workers' rights|prostitutes' rights]] organizations include the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]] and the Network of Sex Work Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswp.org/ |title=Global Network of Sex Work Projects &amp;#124; Promoting Health and Human Rights |publisher=Nswp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups, often with religious backgrounds, focus on offering women a way out of the world of prostitution while not taking a position on the legal question.

Prostitution is a significant issue in feminist thought and activism. Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution can be a valid choice for the women who choose to engage in it; in this view, prostitution must be differentiated from [[forced prostitution]], and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.

In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute|title=Punish the client, not the prostitute|website=European Parliament|date=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution law|Prostitution by country}}

The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions on victimhood and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]], [[gender role]]s, [[gender equality]], ethics and [[morality]], [[free will|freedom of choice]], historical [[social norm]]s, and [[sociology|social costs and benefits]].

Legal themes tend to address four types of issue: victimhood (including potential victimhood), ethics and morality, freedom of choice, and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).

Prostitution may be considered a form of exploitation (e.g., Sweden, Norway, Iceland, where it is illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them — the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute), a legitimate occupation (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, where prostitution is regulated as a profession) or a crime (e.g., many [[Muslim]] countries, where the prostitutes face severe penalties).

The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being legal and considered a [[profession]] to being [[punishable by death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |title=Iran – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions outlaw the act of prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money); other countries do not prohibit prostitution itself, but ban the activities typically associated with it (soliciting in a public place, operating a brothel, pimping etc.), making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law; and in a few countries prostitution is legal and [[regulated prostitution|regulated]].

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|convention]] stating that "prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508080409/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring all signing parties to punish pimps and brothel owners and operators and to abolish all special treatment or registration of prostitutes. As of January 2009, the convention was ratified by 95 member nations including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and not ratified by another 97 member nations including Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

=== Advertising ===

In countries where prostitution is legal, advertising it may be legal (as in the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]) or illegal (as in [[Prostitution in India|India]]).
Covert advertising for prostitution can take a number of forms:
* by cards in newsagents' windows
* by cards placed in public telephone enclosures: so-called [[tart card]]s
* by euphemistic advertisements in regular magazines and newspapers (for instance, talking of "massages" or "relaxation")
* in specialist [[contact magazine]]s
* via the [[World Wide Web|Internet]]

In the United States, [[massage parlor]]s serving as a cover for prostitution may advertise "full service", a euphemism for coitus.{{sfn|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|2002| }}

In [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], prostitution is often promoted overtly on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] by third party workers distributing risque flyers with the pictures and phone numbers of escorts (despite the fact that prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).

The way in which prostitutes advertise their presence varies widely. Some remain in apartments which have hints or clues outside such as posters with "model" written on them to lure potential customers inside. Others advertise by putting numbers or location in [[phonebox]]es or in online or newspaper ads. In more sexually permissive societies, prostitutes can advertise in public view, such as through display windows. In sexually restrictive societies it may occur through word-of-mouth and other means.{{sfn|Scambler|Scambler|1997|p=1920}}

== Socio-economic issues ==

=== Illegal immigration ===
{{Main|Illegal immigration}}
A difficulty facing migrant prostitutes in many developed countries is the illegal residence status of some of these women. They face potential deportation, and so do not have recourse to the law. Hence there are brothels that may not adhere to the usual legal standards intended to safeguard public health and the safety of the workers.

The immigration status of the persons who sell sexual services is – particularly in Western Europe – a controversial and highly debated political issue. Currently, in most of these countries most prostitutes are immigrants, mainly from Eastern and Central Europe; in Spain and Italy 90% of prostitutes are estimated to be migrants, in Austria 78%, in Switzerland 75%, in Greece 73%, in Norway 70% (according to a 2009 [[TAMPEP]] report, ''Sex Work in Europe-A mapping of the prostitution scene in 25 European countries'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sex work in Europe |publisher=Tampep.eu |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714160224/http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An article in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' in 1997 stated that 80% of prostitutes in [[Amsterdam]] were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Netherlands – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survival sex ===
{{Main|Survival sex}}
Survival sex is when the prostitute is driven to prostitution by a need for basic necessities such as food or shelter. This type of prostitution is common among the [[homeless]] and in [[refugee camp]]s. The term is used in the sex trade and by [[aid workers]], although some practitioners do not regard the act as exploitative.

=== Use of children ===
{{Main|Prostitution of children}}
Regarding the [[prostitution of children]] the laws on prostitution as well as those on sex with a child apply. If prostitution in general is legal there is usually a minimum age requirement for legal prostitution that is higher than the general [[age of consent]] (see above for some examples). Although some countries do not single out patronage of child prostitution as a separate crime, the same act is punishable as sex with an underage person.

In India, the federal police say that around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/11/india.prostitution.children/index.html | work=CNN | title=Official: More than 1M child prostitutes in India – CNN.com | accessdate=22 May 2010 | date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimated that about 40% of all India's prostitutes are children.&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt;

In Bangladesh, child prostitutes are known to take the drug Oradexon, also known as [[dexamethasone]]. This over-the-counter [[steroid]], usually used by farmers to fatten cattle, makes child prostitutes look larger and older. Charities say that 90% of prostitutes in the country's legalized brothels use the drug. According to social activists, the steroid can cause [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]] and is highly addictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-bangladesh-prostitution-idUSBRE82I02A20120319 |title=Bangladesh's teenage brothels hold dark steroid secret|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/05/sex-workers-bangladesh-steroid|title=A new danger for sex workers in Bangladesh|publisher=guardian.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=5 April 2010|location=London|first=Joanna|last=Moorhead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10173115|title=Bangladesh's dark brothel steroid secret|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand's Health System Research Institute reported that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf |title=Desk Review: Trafficking in Minors for Commercial Sexual Exploitation; Thailand |format=PDF |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606235116/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among the elderly===
Prostitution among the elderly is a phenomenon reported in [[South Korea]] where [[elderly]] people turn to prostitution to pay their bills. This problem comes about because the state does not provide enough income for necessities. Clients in Korea tend also to be elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Desmond (January 29, 2017) [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/granny-prostitutes-reflect-south-korea-s-problem-of-elderly/3475610.html "Granny prostitutes reflect South Korea's problem of elderly poverty"] ''Channel NewsAsia''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence ===

Prostitution may sometimes be associated with illegal, abusive, and dangerous activities.

=== Human trafficking ===
{{Main|Human trafficking}}

Sex trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/20/trafficking-numbers-women-exaggerated |title=Prostitution and trafficking – the anatomy of a moral panic |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2012 |location=London |date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations stated in 2009 that [[sex trafficking]] is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution (although the study notes that this may be the result of statistical bias and that sex trafficking tends to receive the most attention and be the most visible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2009 UN Report on TIP|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/Global_Report_on_TIP.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex trafficking has been described by Kul Gautum, Deputy Executive Director of [[UNICEF]], as "the largest [[history of slavery|slave trade]] in history."&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2783655.stm |title=Asia's sex trade is 'slavery' |publisher=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the fastest growing [[organized crime|criminal industry]], predicted to outgrow drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human+rights+and+law |title=Experts encourage action against sex trafficking |publisher=Voice of America |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501101647/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human%2Brights%2Band%2Blaw |date=15 May 2009 |archivedate=1 May 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ncpc.typepad.com/prevention_works_blog/2006/10/human_trafficki.html|title= Responding to Modern-Day Slavery|accessdate= |website= |date=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2056662.stm|title=Human smuggling eclipses drug trade|publisher=bbcnews.com|date=20 June 2002 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be a higher number of people involved in [[slavery]] today than at any time in history, the proportion of the population is probably the smallest in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0901/p16s01-wogi.html |title=Slavery is not dead, just less recognizable |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=1 September 2004 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|author=E.

“Annually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80 percent of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors," estimated the US Department of State in a 2008 study, in reference to the number of people estimated to be victims of all forms of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/12/05/lostdaughternepal808/ "Lost Daughters – An Ongoing Tragedy in Nepal"], Women News Network – WNN, 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the illegal and underground nature of sex trafficking, the actual extent of women and children forced into prostitution is unknown. A statistical analysis of various measures of trafficking found that the legal status of prostitution did not have a significant impact on trafficking.&lt;ref name="Cho1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Seo-Young |date=2015 |title=Modeling for Determinants of Human Trafficking: An Empirical Analysis |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/viewFile/125/pdf_12 |journal=Social Inclusion |volume=3 |issue=1 |access-date=2018-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children are sold into the global sex trade every year. Often they are kidnapped or orphaned, and sometimes they are sold by their own families. According to the International Labour Organization, the occurrence is especially common in places such as Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecpatusa.org/ |title=End Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes |publisher=Ecpat Usa |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forced labour generates an estimated $31 billion, about half of it in the industrialised world and around one tenth in transitional countries, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] in a report on forced labour ("A global alliance against forced labour", ILO, 11 May 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc93/pdf/rep-i-b.pdf |title=A global alliance against forced labour |publisher=International Labour Office |accessdate=26 June 2012 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trafficking in people has been facilitated by factors such as porous borders and advanced communication technologies, and has become increasingly transnational in scope and highly financially lucrative.

The most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the US, according to a report by the UNODC ([[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]]).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

===Illicit uses===
{{see also|Extortion|Blackmail}}
Prostitution, often when it is illegal, is used in [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]], which always involves extortion, where the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. The subject of the extortion may be manipulated into or voluntarily solicit the use of prostitution which is then later used to extort money or for profit otherwise. The film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' famously depicts the role of Senator Geary who is implicated in the use of prostitution in order to gain his compliance on political issues.

== Types ==
[[File:10.3010 Torino-nightlife.v2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A street prostitute talking to a potential customer in [[Torino]], Italy, 2005]]

=== Street ===
{{Main|Street prostitution}}
In street prostitution, the prostitute solicits customers while waiting at street corners, sometimes called "the track" by [[pimp]]s and prostitutes alike.  They usually dress in skimpy, provocative clothing, regardless of the weather.  Street prostitutes are often called "streetwalkers" while their customers are referred to as "tricks" or "johns." Servicing the customers is described as "turning tricks." The sex is usually performed in the customer's car, in a nearby alley, or in a rented room.  Motels and hotels that accommodate prostitutes commonly rent rooms by the half or full hour.

In Russia and other countries of the [[Soviet Union|former USSR]], prostitution takes the form of an open-air market. One prostitute stands by a roadside, and directs cars to a so-called "tochka" (usually located in alleyways or carparks), where lines of women are paraded for customers in front of their car headlights. The client selects a prostitute, whom he takes away in his car. Prevalent in the late 1990s, this type of service has been steadily declining in recent years.

A "lot lizard" is a commonly encountered special case of street prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://traffickingresourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/Sex%20Trafficking%20at%20Truck%20Stops%20AAG.pdf |title=Sex Trafficking At Truck Stops |format=PDF |publisher=[[Polaris Project]] |website=[[National Human Trafficking Resource Center]] |access-date=12 August 2018 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lot lizards mainly serve those in the [[Semi-trailer truck|trucking industry]] at [[truck stop]]s and stopping centers. Prostitutes will often proposition [[trucker]]s using a [[CB radio]] from a vehicle parked in the non-commercial section of a truck stop parking lot, communicating through codes based on commercial driving slang, then join the driver in his truck.

[[File:Soi Cowboy night.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Soi Cowboy]], a [[red-light district]] in [[Bangkok]]]]

=== Brothels ===
{{Main|Brothel|Red-light district}}

[[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution, often confined to special [[red-light district]]s in big cities. Other names for brothels include ''bordello'', ''whorehouse'', ''cathouse'', ''knocking shop'', and ''general houses''. Prostitution also occurs in some [[massage]] [[Massage parlor|parlours]], and in Asian countries in some [[barber]] shops where sexual services may be offered as a secondary function of the premises.

=== Escorts ===
[[File:Phone box prostitute calling cards 1 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tart card]]s in a British [[telephone booth|phone box]] advertising the services of [[call girl]]s]]
{{Main|Call girl|Escort agency}}

Escort services may be distinguished from prostitution or other forms of prostitution in that sexual activities are often not explicitly advertised as necessarily included in these services; rather, payment is often noted as being for an escort's time and companionship only, although there is often an implicit assumption that sexual activities are expected.

In escort prostitution, the act takes place at the customer's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or in a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (called in-call). The prostitute may be independent or working under the auspices of an [[escort agency]]. Services may be advertised over the Internet, in regional publications, or in local telephone listings.

Use of the Internet by prostitutes and customers is common.{{sfn|Siegel|2007| }} A prostitute may use adult boards or create a website of their own with contact details, such as email addresses. Adult contact sites, chats and on-line communities are also used. This, in turn, has brought increased scrutiny from law enforcement, public officials, and activist groups toward online prostitution. In 2009, [[Craigslist]] came under fire for its role in facilitating online prostitution, and was sued by some 40 US state attorneys general, local prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.

Reviews of the services of individual prostitutes can often be found at various escort review boards worldwide. These [[online forum]]s are used to trade information between potential clients, and also by prostitutes to advertise the various services available. Sex workers, in turn, often use online forums of their own to exchange information on clients, particularly to warn others about dangerous clients.

=== Sex tourism ===
{{Main|Sex tourism|Child sex tourism}}
[[Sex tourism]] is travel for [[sexual intercourse]] with prostitutes or to engage in other sexual activity. The [[World Tourism Organization]], a specialized agency of the United Nations defines sex tourism as "trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside this sector but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with residents at the destination".&lt;ref name="WTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010061925/http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|title=WTO Statement on the Prevention of Organised Sex Tourism|archive-date=10 October 2006|date=22 October 1995|publisher=World Tourism Organization|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to regular sex tourism, which is often legal, a tourist who has sex with a [[Prostitution of children|child prostitute]] will usually be committing a crime in the host country, under the laws of his own country (notwithstanding him being outside of it) and against international law. Child sex tourism (CST) is defined as a travel to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=deptstate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/fs/08/112090.htm|title=The Facts About Child Sex Tourism|website=Fact Sheet|publisher= US Dept of State, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil, and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation – IPS |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual sex ===
[[Virtual sex]], that is, sexual acts conveyed by messages rather than physically, is also the subject of commercial transactions. Commercial [[phone sex]] services have been available for decades. The advent of the Internet has made other forms of virtual sex available for money, including computer-mediated [[cybersex]], in which sexual services are provided in text form by way of [[chat room]]s or [[instant messaging]], or audiovisually through a [[webcam]] (see [[camgirl]]).

According to the paper "Estimating the prevalence and career longevity of prostitute women",{{sfn|Potterat|Woodhouse|Muth|Muth|1990| }} the number of full-time equivalent prostitutes in a typical area in the United States (Colorado Springs, CO, during 1970–1988) is estimated at 23 per 100,000 population (0.023%), of which some 4% were under 18. The length of these prostitutes' working careers was estimated at a mean of 5 years. According to a 2012 report by ''Fondation Scelles'' there are between 40 and 42 million prostitutes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Are 42 Million Prostitutes In The World, And Here's Where They Live|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1?IR=T|author=Gus Lubin|date=17 January 2012|newspaper=Business Insider|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, it was estimated that in [[Amsterdam]], one woman in 35 was working as a prostitute, compared to one in 300 in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/Window_ban_for_Zurich_s_prostitutes.html?siteSect=107&amp;sid=1853267&amp;cKey=1052980380000&amp;ty=st |title=Window ban for Zurich's prostitutes |publisher=swissinfo |date=15 May 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a 2004 TNS poll reported 15% of all men admitted to having paid for sex at least once in their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/News/story?id=156921&amp;page=1|author=Gary Langer, with Cheryl Arnedt and Dalia Sussman|title=Primetime Live Poll: American Sex Survey|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a paper entitled "Prostitution and the sex discrepancy in reported number of sexual partners" concluded that men's self-reporting of prostitutes as sexual partners provides a serious underestimate.{{sfn|Brewer|Potterat|Garrett|2000|pp=12385–12388}}

In Australia, a survey conducted in the early 2000s showed that 15.6% of men aged 16–59 reported paying for sex at least once in their life, and 1.9% had done so in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.2003.tb00807.x|title=Sex in Australia: Experiences of commercial sex in a representative sample of adults|first5=Anthony M.A.|last5=Smith|first4=Richard O.|last4=Visser|first3=Andrew E.|last3=Grulich|first2=Juliet|year=2003|last2=Richters|last1=Rissel|first1=Chris E.|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=27|ref=harv|pmid=14696710|issue=2|pages=191–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports disagree on whether prostitution levels are growing or declining in [[developed countries]]. Some studies indicate that the percentage of men engaging in commercial sex in the United States has declined significantly in recent decades: in 1964, an estimated 69–80% of men had paid for sex at least once.&lt;ref name=ProCon /&gt; Some have suggested that prostitution levels have fallen in sexually liberal countries, most likely because of the increased availability of non-commercial, non-marital sex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edlund |first1=Lena |last2=Korn |first2=Evelyn |title=A Theory of Prostitution |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 2002 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=181–214 |doi=10.1086/324390 |url=http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526010007/http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, for example in Sweden, because of stricter legal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skarhead|first=Anna|title=Evaluating the Swedish Ban on the Purchase of Sexual Services: The Anna Skarhed Report|url=http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|publisher=Nordic Prostitution Policy Reform|accessdate=26 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709082031/http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|archivedate=9 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggest a growth in prostitution levels, for example in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|title=The John Next Door|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/07/17/the-growing-demand-for-prostitution.html|website=2011|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where again, sexual liberalisation is suggested as the cause. As Norma Ramos, Executive Director of the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] says "The more the commercial [[sex industry]] normalizes this behavior, the more of this behavior you get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CATW submission to the OCHR Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/CoalitionagainstTraffickinginWomen.pdf|publisher=[[CATW]]|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes have long plied their trades to the military in many cultures.  For example, the British naval port of [[Portsmouth]] had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large [[red-light district]]s near American military bases in the Philippines. The notorious [[Patpong]] entertainment district in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, started as an [[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]] location for US troops serving in the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1970s. Washington D.C. itself had [[Murder Bay]] which attracted the military of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The village of [[Vadia (Banaskantha)|Vadia]], India is known locally as the ''village of prostitutes'', where unmarried women are involved in prostitution. Mass weddings for children of prostitutes in the village are held to protect them from being pushed into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In pictures: Mass wedding in India 'prostitute village'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17336512|work=BBC|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical situation ==
In some places, prostitution may be associated with the spread of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). Lack of condom use among prostitutes and their clients has been cited as a factor in the spread of HIV in Asia: "One of the main reasons for the rapid spread of HIV in Asian countries is the massive transmission among sex workers and clients".&lt;ref name=Rojanap /&gt;  As a result, prevention campaigns aimed at increasing condom use by sex workers have been attributed to play a major role in restricting the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=AVERTHIVSexWorkers&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avert.org/sex-workers.htm | title = HIV Prevention and Sex Workers | accessdate= 15 September 2009| date = 2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Côté AM, Sobela F, Dzokoto A |title=Transactional sex is the driving force in the dynamics of HIV in Accra, Ghana |journal=AIDS |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=917–25 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15060439 |doi= 10.1097/00002030-200404090-00009|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0269-9370&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=917 |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shabbir I, Larson CP |title=Urban to rural routes of HIV infection spread in Ethiopia |journal=J Trop Med Hyg |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=338–42 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7563263 |doi= |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Costa LJ, Plummer FA, Bowmer I |title=Prostitutes are a major reservoir of sexually transmitted diseases in Nairobi, Kenya |journal=Sex Transm Dis |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=64–7 |year=1985 |pmid=4002094 |doi= 10.1097/00007435-198504000-00002|url= |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical responses to the problem are:
* banning prostitution completely
* introducing a system of [[Licensure|registration]] for prostitutes that mandates health checks and other public health measures
* educating prostitutes and their clients to encourage the use of [[barrier contraception]] and greater interaction with health care

Some think that the first two measures are counter-productive. Banning prostitution tends to drive it underground, making safe sex promotion, treatment and monitoring more difficult. Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Both of the last two measures can be viewed as [[harm reduction]] policies.

In countries and areas where safer sex precautions are either unavailable or not practiced for cultural reasons, prostitution is an active disease vector for all STDs, including [[HIV]]/AIDS, but the encouragement of [[safer sex]] practices, combined with regular testing for sexually transmitted diseases, has been very successful when applied consistently. As an example, Thailand's condom program has been largely responsible for the country's progress against the HIV epidemic.&lt;ref name=Rojanap&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rojanapithayakorn W |title=The 100% condom use programme in Asia |journal=Reprod Health Matters |volume=14 |issue=28 |pages=41–52 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17101421 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28270-3 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that successful implementation of safe sex practices in India "would drive the [HIV] epidemic to extinction" while similar measures could achieve a 50% reduction in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagelkerke NJ, Jha P, de Vlas SJ |title=Modelling HIV/AIDS epidemics in Botswana and India: impact of interventions to prevent transmission |journal=Bull.

'''Renaissance studies''' (also ''Renaissance and Early Modern Studies'') is the interdisciplinary study of [[the Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]]. The field of study often incorporates knowledge from history, art history, literature, music, architecture, history of science, philosophy, classics, and medieval studies.

==Centers and Universities with Renaissance studies==
Renaissance studies programs exist at several universities, ether an independent field of study or as a subset of [[medieval studies]].

The '''renewable-energy industry''' is the part of the [[energy industry]] focusing on new and appropriate [[renewable energy]] technologies. [[Investors]] worldwide have paid greater attention to this emerging industry in recent years. In many cases, this has translated into rapid [[renewable energy commercialization]] and considerable industry expansion. The [[wind power]] and solar [[photovoltaics]] ([[Photovoltaic system|PV]]) industries provide good examples of this.

Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, and by August 2008, there were at least 160 publicly traded renewable energy companies with a [[market capitalization]] greater than $100 million. An estimated $120 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2008. 
[[File:GlobalREPowerCapacity-exHydro-Eng.png|thumb|400px|Renewable energy power growth in GW (2004-2011)]]

==Overview==
During 2006/2007, several renewable energy companies went through high profile [[Initial Public Offerings]] (IPOs), resulting in market capitalization near or above $1 billion. These corporations included the solar PV companies [[First Solar]] (USA), [[Trina Solar]] (USA), [[Centrosolar]] (Germany), and [[Renesola]] (U.K.), wind power company [[Iberdrola]] (Spain), and U.S. biofuels producers [[VeraSun Energy]], [[Aventine Renewable Energy|Aventine]], and [[Pacific Ethanol]].&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;

Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, with large increases in manufacturing capacity, diversification of manufacturing locations, and shifts in leadership.&lt;ref name=re/&gt; By August 2008, there were at least 160 publicly traded renewable energy companies with a market capitalization greater than $100 million. The number of companies in this category has expanded from around 60 in 2005.&lt;ref name=ren21-2009&gt;Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update. REN21. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|15}}

Some $150 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2009, including new capacity (asset finance and projects) and biofuels refineries. This is more than double the 2006 investment figure of $63 billion. Almost all of the increase was due to greater investment in wind power, solar PV, and biofuels.&lt;ref name=ren21-2010&gt;Renewables Global Status Report: 2010. REN21. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 27}}

In 2000, [[venture capital]] (VC) investment in [[renewable energy]] was about 1% of total VC investment. In 2007 that figure was closer to 10%, with solar power alone making up about 3% of the entire Venture Capital asset class of ~$33B. More than 60 start-ups have been funded by
VCs in the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greentechmedia.com/assets/pdfs/executivesummaries/VC-Investment-in-Solar-Update-Executive-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Venture capital and [[private equity investments]] in renewable energy companies increased by 167 percent in 2006, according to investment analysts at [[New Energy Finance]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=10528 EERE News: Clean Energy Investments More Than Double in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

New investment into the sector jumped US$148 billion in 2007, up 60 per cent over 2006, noted a report by the [[Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative]] (SEFI). Wind energy attracted one-third of the new capital and solar one-fifth. But interest in solar is growing rapidly on the back of major technological advances which saw solar investment increase 254 per cent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.financialstandard.com.au/news/view/23561/ Financial Standard - Energy investments surge]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] predicts US$20 trillion will be invested into alternative energy projects over the next 22 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Image:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|right|thumb|The 11MW [[PS10 solar power tower]] near Seville in Spain.]]

Since 2004 there has been renewed interest in [[concentrating solar power]] (CSP) and three plants were completed during 2006/2007: the 64 MW [[Nevada Solar One]], a 1 MW trough plant in Arizona, and the 11 MW [[PS10 solar power tower]] in Spain. [[Andasol 1 solar power station|Three 50 MW trough plants]] were under construction in Spain at the end of 2007 with ten additional 50 MW plants planned. In the United States, utilities in California and Florida have announced plans (or contracted for) at least eight new projects totaling more than 2,000 MW. Companies involved in new projects include [[Abengoa|Abengoa Solar]], [[Acciona]], [[Ausra (company)|Ausra]], [[BrightSource Energy]], [[Iberdrola]], [[Solar Euromed]], [[Solar Millennium]] and [[Stirling Energy Systems]].&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|12 and 19}}&lt;ref name=emerging&gt;[http://www.emerging-energy.com/uploadDocs/GlobalConcentratedSolarPowerMarketsandStrategies2010.pdf Global Concentrated Solar Power Markets and Strategies 2010-2025.

==Biofuels==
[[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil continued its ethanol expansion]] plans which began in the 70's and now has the largest ethanol distribution and the largest fleet of cars run by any mix of ethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp| 19}}
[[Image:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California.]]
In the [[ethanol fuel]] industry, the United States dominated, with 130 operating ethanol plants in 2007, and production capacity of 26 billion liters/year (6.87 billion gallons/year), a 60 percent increase over 2005. Another 84 plants were under construction or undergoing expansion, and this will result in a doubled production capacity.
The [[biodiesel]] industry opened many new production facilities during 2006/2007 and continued expansion plans in several countries. New biodiesel capacity appeared throughout Europe, including in
Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|19}}

[[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|Commercial investment in second-generation biofuels]] began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|19}}

==Employment==

Renewable energy use tends to be more labor-intensive than fossil fuels, and so a transition toward renewables promises employment gains. Globally, about 2.3 million people work either directly in renewables or indirectly in supplier industries. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the PV sector accounts for an estimated 170,000 jobs, and the solar thermal industry accounts for about 624,000.  More than 1 million jobs are located in the biomass and biofuels sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5821 Jobs in Renewable Energy Expanding]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Pioneer Corps''' was a [[British Army]] combatant corps used for light engineering tasks. It was formed in 1939 and amalgamated into the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] in 1993. Pioneer units performed a wide variety of tasks in all theatres of war, including stretcher-bearing, handling all types of stores, laying prefabricated track on beaches, and effecting various logistical operations. Under [[Royal Engineers]] supervision, they constructed airfields and roads and erected bridges; they constructed the [[Mulberry Harbour]] and laid the [[Operation Pluto|Pipe Line Under the Ocean]] (PLUTO).

==History==
The first record of [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s in a British army goes back to 1346 at [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] where the pay and muster rolls of the English Garrison show pay records for pioneers.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main1.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=1|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, there was a designated pioneer for each [[Company (military unit)|company]] in a [[regiment]], when, about 1750, it was proposed that a Corps of Pioneers be formed. Nothing came of this for nearly one hundred years, until the '''Army Works Corps''' was established during the [[Crimean War]] in 1854.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The '''Labour Corps''' was formed in 1917 during [[World War I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|title=The Labour Corps of 1917-1918|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-labour-corps-of-1917-1918/|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employed 325,000 British troops, 98,000 Chinese, 10,000 Africans and at least 300,000 other labourers.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In September 1939, a number of infantry and cavalry reservists were formed into Works Labour Companies, which were soon made the '''Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps''' (AMPC); a Labour Directorate was created to control all labour force matters. A large number of Pioneers served in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (WWII)|British Expeditionary Force]]. During the [[Battle of France]], an infantry [[brigade]] was improvised from several AMPC Companies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. H. Diggle. Known as "Digforce", the brigade became part of [[Beauman Division]] and fought in defence of the [[Andelle]] and [[Béthune (river)|Béthune]] rivers on 8 June 1940 against the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th]] and [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]]s. Digforce brigade and thousands of other BEF Pioneers were evacuated to England in [[Operation Ariel]].&lt;ref&gt;*Ellis, L. F. (1954) [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/index.html#contents The War in France and Flanders 1939–1940]. J. R. M. Butler (ed.). HMSO. London p.280-282&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of AMPC troops were killed when the [[HMT Lancastria|HMT ''Lancastria'']] was sunk off [[St Nazaire]] on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_lancastria.htm|title=The Pioneer: The Lancastria Story|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1940, the name AMPC was changed to '''Pioneer Corps'''.&lt;ref name=history2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main2.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=2|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1941, [[James Scully (GC)|James Scully]] became the only member of the Pioneer Corps to be awarded the [[George Cross]]. Corps members have won some 13 [[George Medal]]s and many other lesser awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_awards.htm|title=The Pioneer: Honours and awards|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 23 pioneer companies took part in the [[Normandy landings]].&lt;ref name=history3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main3.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=3|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Alexander Baron]] served in one of these Beach Groups and later included some of his experiences in his novels ''From the City From the Plough'' and ''The Human Kind''. He also wrote a radio play about the experience of being stranded on a craft attempting to land supplies on the beaches of [[Normandy]]. Nos. 85 and 149 Companies, Pioneer Corps served with the [[6th Beach Group]] assisting the units landing on [[Sword Beach]] on D Day, 6 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/invisible-ink-no-83--alexander-baron-2302756.html|title=Invisible Ink: No 83 - Alexander Baron|publisher=The Independent|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1946, in recognition of their performance during the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[King George VI]] decreed that the Pioneer Corps should have the distinction "Royal" added to its title.&lt;ref name=history3/&gt;

In April 1993, following the [[Options for Change]] review, the Royal Pioneer Corps was joined with the [[Royal Corps of Transport]], the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], the [[Army Catering Corps]], and the Postal and Courier Service of the [[Royal Engineers]] to form the [[Royal Logistic Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Royal Logistic Corps and Forming Corps|url=http://www.rlcmuseum.co.uk/docs/history.html|publisher=[[The Royal Logistic Corps Museum]]|accessdate=13 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814155505/http://rlcmuseum.co.uk/docs/history.html|archivedate=14 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
In the early part of World War II, the Pioneer Corps was apparently the only British military unit in which [[enemy alien]]s could serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/22/aliens-in-the-pioneer-corps|title=House of Lords Questions - Aliens in the Pioneer Corps|website=Hansard|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=22 July 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of German and Austrian nationals joined the Pioneer Corps to assist Allied war efforts and the liberation of their home countries. They typically were Jews and political opponents of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Regime]] who had fled to Britain, including film production designer [[Ken Adam]], writer [[George Clare (writer)|George Clare]], and publisher [[Robert Maxwell]].

Later, some members of Pioneer Corps—often dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens"—transferred to serve in various fighting units. Some were recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to serve as secret agents and were parachuted behind enemy lines.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Colin MacGregor Stevens with Major George Bryant (aka George Breuer)&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as a German or Austrian national in the British forces was especially dangerous because, in case of being taken captive, there was a high probability of being executed as a traitor by the Germans. Still, the number of German-born Jews joining the British forces was exceptionally high; by the end of the war, one in seven Jewish refugees from Germany had joined the British forces. Their knowledge of the German language and customs proved particularly useful; many served in the administration of the British occupation army in Germany and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natgeotv.com/ca/churchills-german-army National Geographic documentary ''Churchill's German Army'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It has wrongly been claimed at various times and in various places that British [[conscientious objector]]s were sometimes ordered into the Pioneer Corps by Conscientious Objection Tribunals in the [[Second World War]]; the error may have arisen from a misunderstanding of a misleadingly drafted question in the House of Lords on 22 July 1941 and a reply by Lord Croft, Joint Under-Secretary of State for War, that was not expressed with the clarity that might have been expected. The War Office was asked about "British conscientious objectors who have been ordered by the Tribunals to undertake service with the Pioneer Corps", whereas the Tribunals had no power to make such an order; the only power they had relating to conscientious objectors in the armed forces was to order non-combatant military service, meaning call-up in most cases to the [[Non-Combatant Corps]], or occasionally to the Royal Army Medical Corps; the Pioneer Corps, as a combatant unit, was by definition excluded. In his reply, Lord Croft referred to "conscientious objectors ordered for attachment to the Pioneer Corps", only obliquely correcting the language of the question. To spell it out in full, what Lord Croft meant was "conscientious objectors ordered by the Tribunals to serve in the Non-Combatant Corps and then, as members of the NCC, attached at certain times and for certain purposes to the Pioneer Corps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Lords question: conscientious objectors|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/22/conscientious-objectors|website=Hansard|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=22 July 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been coined in 1981&lt;ref&gt;Rolls BJ, Rolls ET, Rowe EA, Sweeney K. Sensory specific satiety in man. ''Physiol Behav.'' 1981;27(1):137-42.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Barbara J. Rolls]] and [[Edmund T. Rolls]]. Its concept illustrates the role of physical stimuli in generating appetite and, more specifically, explains the significance of [[taste]] in relation to [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray P. 2007. Psychology. Fifth Edition. Worth Publishers. [http://www.worthpublishers.com/gray6epreview/ table of contents]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[conditioned satiety]] and [[alliesthesia|alimentary alliesthesia]], it is one of the three major phenomena of satiation.

[[File:Chinese buffet2.jpg|thumb|Diners at a buffet eat a larger quantity of food than those eating a single dish]]
This process is most commonly illustrated by a standard [[buffet]]. People are more likely to eat a larger amount of food at a buffet because the variety of foods and [[flavor]]s presented renews a sense of appetite in the individual. A study conducted by Rolls and van Duijvenvoorde in 1984 verified this process by simulating a buffet-style meal. They fed participants four meals that included sausages, bread and butter, chocolate dessert, and bananas. They then fed the participants four courses of one of these foods. The results revealed a 44% increase in overall food consumption when exposed to the meals with a variety of foods.&lt;ref name="Raynor 2001"/&gt;

Postingestive feedback factors such as [[energy density]] and [[nutrient density|nutrient composition]] could affect the [[palatability]] of a food which in turn would inhibit or facilitate ''sensory-specific satiety''. Studies done by Birch &amp; Deysher (1986) and B.J. Rolls ''et al.'', summarized in a paper by Raynor and Epstein, show that postingesitive feedback does not influence ''sensory-specific satiety'' very much. Since postingestive feedback seems to have little effect of sensory-specific satiety, it is probable that sensory-specific satiety is more driven by external factors, such as the sensory properties of the food, than internal factors.&lt;ref name="Raynor 2001"/&gt;

== Obesity in relation to sensory-specific satiety ==

Studies have shown that eating monotonous meals (limited variety in food) results in long-term sensory-specific satiety.&lt;ref&gt;* Raynor HA, Niemeier HM, Wing RR. Effect of limiting snack food variety on long-term sensory-specific satiety and monotony during obesity treatment. ''Eating Behaviors'' 2006; 7(1):1-14. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2005.05.005 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; By continuing to eat similar meals, a [[Dieting|dieter]] can reduce their overall [[food intake]] and use sensory-specific satiety as a tool for [[weight loss]]. On the contrary, sensory-specific satiety can also cause [[obesity]] because of the stimulation of hunger for foods of different variety.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The higher energy content the food has, the less likely sensory-specific satiety will become activated.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls BJ, Van Duijvenvoorde PM, Rowe EA. Variety in the diet enhances intake in a meal and contributes to the development of obesity in the rat. ''Physiology &amp; Behavior'' 1983; 31(1):21-7. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-9384(83)90091-4 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age in relation to sensory-specific satiety ==

Sensory-specific satiety varies depending on age, with the elderly experiencing  decreased sensory-specific satiety and adolescents experiencing more.&lt;ref name="Rolls 1991"&gt;Rolls BJ, McDermott TM. Effect of age on sensory-specific satiety. ''Am J Clin Nutr'' 1991; 54(6): 988-996. [http://www.ajcn.org/content/54/6/988.short abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In a study focusing on age in sensory-specific satiety, it was hypothesized that the degree of sensory-specific satiety is affected by age due to the slow sensory loss that accompanies elderly people.&lt;ref name="Rolls 1991"/&gt; By hypothesis, due to the [[Sensory deprivation|sensory impairment]], a natural, more monotonous diet would occur just due to lack of pleasantness from variety of foods. However, it was proven that sensory impairment did not greatly affect the decline in sensory-specific satiety; instead, there is an unclear [[cognitive]] process that relates to decline in sensory-specific satiety that just may be the decreased desire for overall change in the elderly as compared to adolescents.&lt;ref name="Rolls 1991"/&gt;

'''Sodium fluoroacetate''' is the [[organofluorine chemistry| organofluorine]] [[chemical compound]] with the formula FCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na. This colourless [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] has a taste similar to that of [[sodium chloride]] and is used as a [[poison#Metabolic poisons (energy)|metabolic poison]]. Potassium fluoroacetate occurs naturally as an anti-[[herbivore]] [[metabolite]] in various [[plant]]s, but can also be produced synthetically. It is a derivative of [[fluoroacetic acid]], a [[carboxylic acid]]. The more common fluorinated acetic acid ([[trifluoroacetic acid]]) and its derivatives are far less toxic.

== History and production ==

The effectiveness of sodium fluoroacetate as a rodenticide was reported in 1942.&lt;ref name=kalmbach&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kalmbach, E. R. |title= Ten-Eighty, a War-Produced Rodenticide |journal= Science |year= 1945 |volume= 102 |issue= 2644 |pages= 232–233 |doi= 10.1126/science.102.2644.232 |pmid= 17778513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "1080" refers to the catalogue number of the poison, which became its brand name.&lt;ref name="Proudfoot"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Proudfoot, A. T. |author2=Bradberry, S. M. |author3=Vale, J. A. |title= Sodium fluoroacetate poisoning |journal= Toxicology Reviews |year= 2006 |volume= 25 |issue= 4 |pages= 213–219 |doi= 10.2165/00139709-200625040-00002 |pmid= 17288493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salt is synthesized by treating sodium chloroacetate with [[potassium fluoride]].&lt;ref name=Aigueperse&gt;{{Ullmann |vauthors= Aigueperse J, Mollard P, Devilliers D, Chemla M, Faron R, Romano R, Cuer JP |title= Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic |doi= 10.1002/14356007.a11_307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
[[File:Gifblaar.jpg|thumb|240px|left|''Dichapetalum cymosum'']] Potassium fluoroacetate (as opposed to the commercially manufactured sodium salt) occurs [[plant defense against herbivory|naturally]] in at least 40 plant species in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], and [[Africa]]. It was first identified in ''[[Dichapetalum cymosum]]'', commonly known as gifblaar (Afrikaans) or poison leaf, by Marais in 1944.&lt;ref name="maraisa"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Marais, J. C. S. |title= The isolation of the toxic principle "K cymonate" from "Gifblaar", ''Dichapetalum cymosum'' |journal= Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Industry |year= 1943 |volume= 18 |page= 203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maraisb"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Marais, J.

=== Potassium fluoroacetate occurrence in ''Gastrolobium'' species ===
''[[Gastrolobium]]'' is a genus of flowering plants in the family [[Fabaceae]]. There are over 100 species in this genus, and all but two are native to the south west region of Western Australia, where they are known as "poison peas". ''Gastrolobium'' growing in south western Australia are unique in their ability to concentrate fluoroacetate from low fluorine soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lee, J. |title= Deadly plants face threat of extinction |journal= ANU Reporter |year= 1998 |volume= 29 |issue= 6 |publisher= Australian National University |url=http://info.anu.edu.au/mac/Newsletters_and_Journals/ANU_Reporter/_pdf/vol_29_no_06/extinction.html |accessdate= 2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brush-tailed possums, bush rats, and western grey kangaroos native to this region are capable of safely eating plants containing fluoroacetate, but livestock and introduced species from elsewhere in Australia are highly susceptible to the poison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= McKenzie, R. |title= Australian Native Poisonous Plants |publisher= Australian Native Plants Society |work= Australian Plants Online |year= 1997 |url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL7/sep97-4.html |accessdate= 2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are species introduced from outside Australia, such as the [[red fox]]. The fact that many ''Gastrolobium'' species also have high secondary toxicity to non-native carnivores is thought to have limited the ability of cats to establish populations in locations where the plants form a major part of the understorey vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Short, J. |author2=Atkins, L. |author3=Turner, B. |year= 2005 |title= Diagnosis of Mammal Decline in Western Australia, with Particular Emphasis on the Possible Role of Feral Cats and Poison Peas |url=http://www.wildliferesearchmanagement.com.au/Report_NGS.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Wildlife Research and Management Pty |location= Australia |accessdate= 2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of ''Gastrolobium'' species in the fields of farmers in [[Western Australia]] has often forced these farmers to 'scalp' their land — that is, remove the top soil and any poison pea seed which it may contain, and replace it with a new poison pea-free top soil sourced from elsewhere in which to sow crops. Similarly, following bushfires in north-western [[Queensland]] cattlemen have to move livestock before the poisonous ''[[Gastrolobium grandiflorum]]'' emerges from the ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Death lurks in the ashes on western farms |publisher=Townsville Bulletin|date=September 2011 |url=http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/09/22/268601_news.html |accessdate= 2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicology ==
Sodium fluoroacetate is toxic to all [[obligate aerobic]] organisms, and highly toxic to mammals and insects.&lt;ref name="Proudfoot" /&gt; The oral dose of sodium fluoroacetate sufficient to be lethal in humans is 2–10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{cite web |last= Beasley |first= Michael |title= Guidelines for the Safe Use of Sodium Fluoroacetate (1080) |publisher= New Zealand Occupational Safety &amp; Health Service |date= August 2002 |url= http://www.business.govt.nz/worksafe/information-guidance/all-guidance-items/sodium-fluoroacetate-1080-guidelines-for-the-safe-use-of |format= PDF |accessdate= 2015-10-31 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151017012513/http://www.business.govt.nz/worksafe/information-guidance/all-guidance-items/sodium-fluoroacetate-1080-guidelines-for-the-safe-use-of |archivedate= 2015-10-17 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toxicity varies with species. The [[New Zealand Food Safety Authority]] established lethal doses for a number of species. Dogs, cats, and pigs appear to be most susceptible to poisoning.&lt;ref name="ACVM"&gt;{{cite web |title= Controlled Pesticides: Sodium Fluoroacetate (1080) in Pest Control |publisher= Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Group |date= |url=http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/acvm/publications/notes/1080-study-notes.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[enzyme]] [[fluoroacetate dehalogenase]] has been discovered in a soil [[bacterium]], which can detoxify fluoroacetate in the surrounding medium. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Mechanism of action ===
Fluoroacetate is similar to acetate, which has a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. Fluoroacetate disrupts the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle) by combining with [[coenzyme A]] to form fluoroacetyl CoA, which reacts with [[citrate synthase]] to produce [[fluorocitric acid|fluorocitrate]] which binds very tightly to [[aconitase]], thereby halting the citric acid cycle. This inhibition results in an accumulation of citrate in the blood. Citrate and fluorocitrate are allosteric inhibitors of [[phosphofructokinase-1]] (PFK-1), a key enzyme in [[glycolysis]]. When PFK-1 is inhibited, cells are no longer able to metabolize carbohydrates, depriving them of energy.&lt;ref name="Proudfoot" /&gt;

=== Symptoms ===
In [[human]]s, the [[symptoms]] of poisoning normally appear between 30 minutes and three hours after exposure. Initial symptoms typically include nausea, [[vomiting]], and abdominal pain; sweating, confusion, and agitation follow. In significant poisoning, cardiac abnormalities including [[tachycardia]] or [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], and [[ECG]] changes develop. Neurological effects include muscle twitching and seizures; [[consciousness]] becomes progressively impaired after a few hours leading to [[coma]]. Death is normally due to [[ventricular arrhythmia]]s, progressive hypotension unresponsive to treatment, and secondary lung infections.&lt;ref name="Proudfoot" /&gt;

Symptoms in domestic animals vary: dogs tend to show nervous system signs such as convulsions, vocalization, and uncontrollable running, whilst large herbivores such as cattle and sheep more predominantly show cardiac signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgMX__L3q40C&amp;pg=PA556 |author= Gupta, R. |title= Veterinary Toxicology: Basic and Clinical Principles |publisher= Elsevier |location= Amsterdam |year= 2007 |page= 556 |isbn= 0-12-370467-7 |accessdate= 2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-lethal doses of sodium fluoroacetate may cause damage to tissues with high energy needs — in particular, the [[brain]], [[gonad]]s, [[heart]], [[lungs]], and [[fetus]]. Sub-lethal doses are typically completely metabolised and excreted within four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eason, C. T. |author2=Frampton, C. M. |author3=Henderson, R. |author4=Thomas, M.

=== Treatment ===
Effective [[antidote]]s are unknown. [[Animal testing|Research]] in [[monkey]]s has shown that the use of [[glyceryl monoacetate]] can prevent problems if given after ingestion of sodium fluoroacetate, and this therapy has been tested in domestic animals with some positive results. In theory, glyceryl monoacetate supplies acetate ions to allow continuation of cellular respiration which the sodium fluoroacetate had disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Brent, J. |title= Critical Care Toxicology |publisher= Mosby |location= St. Louis |year= 2005 |page= 970 |isbn= 0-8151-4387-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuA4LsWXXWEC&amp;pg=PA970 |quote= Glycerol monoacetate, 0.1 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mL/kg/h, as a Krebs cycle substrate replacement, has prolonged survival in a primate model, but it also may aggravate toxicity and seems to be effective only early in the course. |accessdate= 2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments of Dr. Goncharov and co-workers resulted in development of a successful therapeutic complex, containing a phenothiazine compound, a dioic acid compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another aspect the pharmaceutical composition can include a phenothiazine compound, a nitroester compound, ethanol, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Goncharov N.V., Kuznetsov A.V., Glashkina L.M., Radilov A.S.

Toxicology of fluoroacetate: a review, with possible directions for therapy research // J.Appl.Toxicol.(2006)26:148-161&lt;/ref&gt;

In clinical cases, use of [[muscle relaxant]]s, [[anti-convulsant]]s, [[mechanical ventilation]], and other supportive measures may all be required. Few animals or people have been treated successfully after significant sodium fluoroacetate ingestions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rippe, J. M. |author2=Irwin, R.

[[Activated charcoal]] should be administered in all suspected ingestions presenting within 1 to 2 hours after ingestion. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Hypocalcemia and prolonged QTc intervals may require calcium and magnesium supplementation. Various treatments have been tested in animals [149,161-163]. The most useful agent appears to be glyceryl monoacetate, which provides excess acetate as a substrate for the TCA cycle. The clinical use of glyceryl monoacetate remains unproven, however. |accessdate= 2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, sheep gut bacteria were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to contain the fluoroacetate dehalogenase enzyme that inactivates sodium fluoroacetate.

== Pesticide use ==
[[File:Brushtail possum.jpg|thumb|right|Common brushtail possum, an invasive pest in New Zealand whose population is controlled with sodium fluoroacetate]]
Sodium fluoroacetate is used as a [[pesticide]], especially for [[mammal]]ian [[pest (organism)|pest]] species. [[Farmer]]s and [[Pastoral farming|grazier]]s use the poison to protect pastures and crops from various herbivorous mammals. In [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] it is also used to control [[invasive species in Australia|invasive non-native mammals]] that prey on or compete with native wildlife and vegetation.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], sodium fluoroacetate was first used in rabbit control programmes in the early 1950s, where it is regarded as having "a long history of proven effectiveness and safety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher= Department of Agriculture, Department of Conservation and Land Management, Department of Health |year= 2002 |title= 1080 Summary information |work= Miscellaneous Publication No. 011/2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a critical component of the integrated pest-control programmes for [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es, wild dogs, and feral pigs. Since 1994, broad-scale fox control using 1080 meat baits in [[Western Australia]] has significantly improved the population numbers of several native species and led, for the first time, to three species of mammals being taken off the state's endangered species list. In Australia, minor direct mortality of native animal populations from 1080 baits is regarded as acceptable, compared to the predatory and competitive effects of those introduced species being managed using 1080.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The use of 1080 for pest control – 4.1 Key facts |publisher= NZ Department of Conservation |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/publications/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/the-use-of-1080-for-pest-control/4-information-about-1080/4_1-key-facts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western Shield]] is a project to boost populations of endangered mammals in south-west Australia conducted by the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|DEC]]. The project entails distributing fluoroacetate-baited meat from the air to kill [[predator]]s. Wild [[dog]]s and [[fox]]es will readily eat the baited meat.

{{Main|1080 usage in New Zealand}}
Worldwide, New Zealand is the largest user of sodium fluoroacetate.&lt;ref name="Beasley" /&gt; This high usage is attributable to the fact that, apart from two species of bat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/bats-pekapeka/ |title=Bats/pekapeka |publisher=Department of Conservation |date= |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand has no native land mammals, and some of those that have been introduced have had devastating effects on vegetation and native species.

In 1964 and again in 1971, the use of poisons to control predatory mammals were reviewed by selected committees. In 1972, EPA cancelled all registered predator control uses of sodium fluoroacetate, sodium cyanide, and strychnine. In 1977, the US Department of the Interior (USDI) applied for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) to investigate the potential risks and benefits associated with the use of sodium fluoroacetate in "toxic collars" which would be placed on the necks of sheep and goats. … In 1981, EPA was petitioned by the USDI and livestock interests to revisit the 1972 predacide cancellation decision with respect to sodium fluoroacetate. … In 1985, EPA granted a registration to USDI for a toxic collar product which was transferred in 1986 to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). … The rodenticide uses of sodium fluoroacetate were cancelled due to lack of supporting data. In 1989, all "special local needs" registrations issued under §&amp;nbsp;24(c) of FIFRA were cancelled, and all pending applications for Federal registration were denied by August 1990. |accessdate= 2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impacts ==
=== Water ===
Because 1080 is highly water-soluble, it will be dispersed and diluted in the environment by rain, stream water and ground water. Sodium fluoroacetate at the concentrations found in the environment after standard baiting operations will break down in natural water containing living organisms, such as aquatic plants or micro-organisms. Water-monitoring surveys, conducted during the 1990s, have confirmed that significant contamination of waterways following aerial application of 1080 bait is possible, but not unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Eason |first1= C.

In New Zealand, surface water is routinely monitored after aerial application of 1080, and water samples are collected immediately after application, when there is the highest possibility of detecting contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Eason |first1= C. T. |last2= Temple |first2= W. |journal= The NZWWA Journal |year= 2002 |volume= 32 |issue= 36 |title= Water sampling for sodium fluoroacetate (1080) – how much is enough? |isbn= 0-478-09346-2 |url= http://www.1080facts.co.nz/upload/download_files/water%20sampling.pdf |accessdate= 2011-09-30 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120402144948/http://www.1080facts.co.nz/upload/download_files/water%20sampling.pdf |archivedate= 2012-04-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 2442 water samples tested in New Zealand between 1990 and 2010, following aerial 1080 operations: 96.5% had no detectable 1080 at all and, of all the samples, only six were equal to, or above the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] level for drinking water, and none of these came from drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished data, Landcare Research New Zealand Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Of 592 samples taken from human or stock drinking supplies, only four contained detectable 1080 residues at 0.1ppb (1 sample) and 0.2 ppb (3 samples) – all well below the Ministry of Health level of 2 ppb.

In an experiment funded by the Animal Health Board and conducted by NIWA simulating the effects of rainfall on 1080 on a steep soil-covered hillside a few meters from a stream, it was found that 99.9% of the water containing 1080 leached straight into the soil (See 4.3 of &lt;ref name="tbfree.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbfree.org.nz/Portals/0/NIWA's%20Suren%20report%20into%201080%20leaching%20into%20soil%20and%20water%20.pdf |format=PDF |title=Investigations of 1080 leaching and transport in the environment |website=Tbfree.org.nz |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and did not flow over the ground to the stream as had been expected. The experiment also measured contamination of soil water, which was described as the water carried through the soil underground at short horizontal distances (0.5-3m), downhill towards the stream. The experiment did not measure contamination of deeper soil and ground water immediately beneath the site of application.&lt;ref name="tbfree.org.nz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAXaMFKFw9E|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil ===
The fate of 1080 in the soil has been established by research defining the degradation of naturally occurring fluoroacetate (Oliver, 1977). Sodium fluoroacetate is water-soluble, and residues from uneaten baits leach into the soil where they are degraded to non-toxic metabolites by soil microorganisms, including bacteria (''[[Pseudomonas]]'') and the common soil fungus (''[[Fusarium solani]]'') (David and Gardiner, 1966; Bong, Cole and Walker, 1979; Walker and Bong, 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eason, C.

=== Birds ===
Although it is now infrequent, individual aerial 1080 operations can still sometimes affect local [[bird]] populations if not carried out with sufficient care. In [[New Zealand]], individuals from 19 species of native birds and 13 species of introduced birds have been found dead after aerial 1080 drops. Most of these recorded bird deaths were associated with only four operations in the 1970s that used poor-quality carrot baits with many small fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Evaluating the use of 1080 – Predators, poisons, and silent forests |year= 2011 |publisher= Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |location= New Zealand |url=http://www.pce.parliament.nz/assets/Uploads/PCE-1080.pdf |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many native New Zealand bird populations have been successfully protected by reducing predator numbers through aerial 1080 operations.

=== Reptiles and amphibians ===
[[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s are susceptible to 1080, although much less sensitive than [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pce.parliament.nz/assets/Uploads/PCE-1080.pdf |format=PDF |title=Evaluating the use of 1080 : Predators, poisons and silent forests |website=Pce.parliament.nz |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibian and reptile species that have been tested in Australia are generally more tolerant to 1080 poison than are most other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR9850113.htm |title=The Sensitivity of Australian Animals to 1080 Poison VIII.

The chance of this occurring in the wild is ameliorated by a variety of factors, including frog ecology. Captive maintenance and contamination problems rendered parts of this study inconclusive.

=== Fish ===
Fish generally have very low sensitivity to 1080. Toxicity tests have been conducted in the US on [[bluegill]] sunfish, [[rainbow trout]], and the freshwater invertebrate ''[[Daphnia magna]]''. Tests at different 1080 concentrations on sunfish (for four days) and ''Daphnia'' (two days) showed that 1080 is "practically non-toxic" (a US EPA classification) to both these species. Rainbow trout were also tested over four days at four concentrations ranging from 39 to 170&amp;nbsp;mg 1080 per litre. From these results an [[LC50]] (the concentration of 1080 per litre of water which theoretically kills 50% of the test fish) can be calculated. The LC50 for rainbow trout was calculated to be 54&amp;nbsp;mg 1080/litre – far in excess of any known concentration of 1080 found in water samples following 1080 aerial operations. Thus 1080 is unlikely to cause mortality in freshwater fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/publications/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/the-use-of-1080-for-pest-control/4-information-about-1080/4_1-key-facts/ |title=Conservation publications: Science publications |website=Doc.govt.nz |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invertebrates ===

'''Spatial ability''' or visuo-spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = Spatial ability|date = |accessdate = |website = www.jhu.edu|publisher = Johns Hopkins University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual-spatial abilities are used for everyday use from navigation, understanding or fixing equipment, understanding or estimating distance and measurement, and performing on a job. Spatial abilities are also important for success in fields such as sports, technical aptitude, [[mathematics]], natural sciences, [[engineering]], economic forecasting, [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.jhu.edu/cty/STBguide.pdf|title = What is spatial ability?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Johns Hopkins University|author = Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women in Science and Mathematics|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK23762/|date = 2006-01-01|first = National Academy of Sciences|last = (us)|first2 = National Academy of Engineering|last2 = (us)|first3 = and Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and|last3 = Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do spatial abilities involve understanding the outside world, but they also involve processing outside information and reasoning with it through visual representation in the mind.

== Definition and types ==
Spatial ability is the capacity to understand, reason and remember the spatial relations among objects or space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are four common types of spatial abilities which include spatial or visuo-spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding and [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of cognitive imaging and sex differences on the development of laparoscopic suturing skills|journal = Canadian Journal of Surgery|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0008-428X|pmc = 3211902|pmid = 16248138|pages = 387–393|volume = 48|issue = 5|first = Tyrone|last = Donnon|first2 = Jean-Gaston|last2 = DesCôteaux|first3 = Claudio|last3 = Violato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these abilities have unique properties and importance to many types of tasks whether in certain jobs or everyday life. For example, spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emergence and Characterization of Sex Differences in Spatial Ability: A Meta-Analysis|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19086027_Emergence_and_Characterization_of_Sex_Differences_in_Spatial_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis|journal = Child Development|pages = 1479–1498|volume = 56|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00213.x|first = Marcia C.|last = Linn|first2 = Anne C.|last2 = Petersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental rotation]] on the other hand is the mental ability to manipulate and rotate 2D or 3D objects in space quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lastly, spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These three abilities are mediated and supported by a fourth spatial cognitive factor known as spatial working memory.

Drew|last5 = Gouvier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities such as mental rotation.

=== Spatial perception ===
[[File:Видеоскриншот из игры S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Mobile.gif|thumb|Action shooting game: Use of spatial perceptual skills]]
Spatial perception is defined as the ability to perceive spatial relationships in respect to the orientation of one's body despite distracting information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of being able to perceive and visually understand outside spatial information such as features, properties, measurement, shapes, position and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~asimmons/pdfs/PT%20Spatial%20Perception.pdf|title = Spatial Perception from a Cartesian Point of View|last = Simmons|first = Alison|date = 2003|journal = Philosophical Topics |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when one is navigating through a dense forest they are using spatial perception and awareness. Another example is when trying to understand the relations and mechanics inside of a car, he or she is relying on their spatial perception to understand its visual framework. Tests that measure spatial perception include the [[rod and frame test]], where subjects must place a rod vertically while viewing a frame orientation of 22 degrees in angle, or the [[water-level task]], where subjects have to draw or identify a horizontal line in a tilted bottle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Spatial perception is also very relevant in sports. For example, a study found that [[cricket]] players who were faster at picking up information from briefly presented visual displays were significantly better batsmen in an actual game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inspection time and high-speed ball games|journal = Perception|date = 1989-01-01|issn = 0301-0066|pmid = 2628929|pages = 789–792|volume = 18|issue = 6|first = I. J.|last = Deary|first2 = H.|last2 = Mitchell|doi=10.1068/p180789}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vision]]'' found that soccer players had higher perceptual ability for body kinematics such as processing multitasking crowd scenes which involve pedestrians crossing a street or complex dynamic visual scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of sport specific and non-specific biological motion perception in soccer athletes shows a fundamental perceptual ability advantage over non-athletes for recognizing body kinematics|journal = Journal of Vision|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1534-7362|pmid = &lt;!--none--&gt;|pages = 504|volume = 15|issue = 12|doi = 10.1167/15.12.504|first = Thomas|last = Romeas|first2 = Jocelyn|last2 = Faubert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published in the ''Journal of Human Kinetics'' on fencing athletes found that achievement level was highly correlated with spatial perceptual skills such as visual discrimination, visual-spatial relationships, visual sequential memory, narrow attentional focus and visual information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Attention, Visual Perception and their Relationship to Sport Performance in Fencing|journal = Journal of Human Kinetics|date = 2013-12-31|issn = 1640-5544|pmc = 3916930|pmid = 24511355|pages = 195–201|volume = 39|doi = 10.2478/hukin-2013-0082|first = Mona Mohamed Kamal|last = Hijazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review published in the journal of ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that spatial perception involves attributing meaning to an object or space, so that their sensory processing is actually part of semantic processing of the incoming visual information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual cognition: a new look at the two-visual systems model|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 0028-3932|pmid = 15707914|pages = 301–312|volume = 43|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.016|first = M.|last = Jeannerod|first2 = P.|last2 = Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that spatial perception involves the [[Visual system|human visual system]] in the brain and the [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobule]] which is responsible for visuomotor processing and visually goal-directed action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Studies have also found that individuals who played first person shooting games had better spatial perceptual skills like faster and more accurate performance in a peripheral and identification task while simultaneously performing a central search.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Playing shooter and driving videogames improves top-down guidance in visual search|journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1943-393X|pmid = 23460295|pages = 673–686|volume = 75|issue = 4|doi = 10.3758/s13414-013-0440-2|first = Sijing|last = Wu|first2 = Ian|last2 = Spence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggested that, in addition to enhancing the ability to divide attention, playing  action games significantly enhances perceptual skills like top-down guidance of attention to possible target locations.&lt;ref name="Wu 673–686" /&gt;

=== Mental rotation ===
[[File:Rubik's cube 2.svg|thumb|[[Rubik's cube]]: a popular puzzle that involves 3D mental rotation]][[Mental rotation]] is the ability to mentally represent and ''rotate'' 2D and 3D objects in space quickly and accurately, while the object's features remain unchanged. Mental representations of physical objects can help utilize problem solving and understanding. For example, Hegarty (2004) showed that people manipulate mental representations for reasoning about mechanical problems, such as how gears or pulleys work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Psychology Laboratory - About Mental Rotation|url = http://opl.apa.org/Experiments/About/AboutMentalRotation.aspx|website = opl.apa.org|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Schwartz and Black (1999) found that doing such mental simulations such as pouring water improves people's skill to find the solution to questions about the amount of tilt required for containers of different heights and widths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the field of sports psychology, coaches for a variety of sports (e.g. basketball, gymnastics, soccer or golf) have promoted players to use mental imagery and manipulation as one technique for performance in their game. (Jones &amp; Stuth, 1997)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Recent research (e.g., Cherney, 2008) has also demonstrated evidence that playing video games with consistent practice can improve mental rotation skills, for example improvements in women's scores  after practice with a game that involved a race within a 3-D environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Same effects have been seen playing action video games such as [[Unreal Tournament]] as well as the popular mainstream game [[Tetris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The virtual brain: 30 years of video-game play and cognitive abilities|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2013-09-13|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 3772618|pmid = 24062712|volume = 4|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00629|first = Andrew J.|last = Latham|first2 = Lucy L. M.|last2 = Patston|first3 = Lynette J.|last3 = Tippett}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] puzzles and [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's cube]] are also activities that involve higher level of mental rotation and can be practiced to improve spatial abilities over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Early Puzzle Play: A predictor of preschoolers’ spatial transformation skill|journal = Developmental Psychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 0012-1649|pmc = 3289766|pmid = 22040312|pages = 530–542|volume = 48|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0025913|first = S.C.|last = Levine|first2 = K.R.|last2 = Ratliff|first3 = J.|last3 = Huttenlocher|first4 = J.|last4 = Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-05-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2677592|pmid = 19528020|pages = 1377–1383|volume = 364|issue = 1522|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0337|first = Simon|last = Baron-Cohen|first2 = Emma|last2 = Ashwin|first3 = Chris|last3 = Ashwin|first4 = Teresa|last4 = Tavassoli|first5 = Bhismadev|last5 = Chakrabarti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adolescence: The Transitional Years|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sz20BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2014-05-10|isbn = 9781483265650|first = J. Roy|last = Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental rotation is also unique and distinct from the other spatial abilities because it also involves areas associated with [[Motor skill|motor simulation]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of mental rotation: a meta-analysis and review|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 0898-929X|pmid = 17919082|pages = 1–19|volume = 20|issue = 1|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20013|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Zacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial visualization ===
Spatial visualization is characterized as complicated multi-step manipulations of spatially presented information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It involves [[Mental image|visual imagery]] which is the ability to mentally represent visual appearances of an object, and [[Mental image|spatial imagery]] which consists of mentally representing spatial relations between the parts or locations of the objects or movements.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ideal-group.org/visualization-research/Spatial-Visualization-Visual-Imagery-and-Mathematical-Problem-Solving-of-Students-with-Varying-Abilities.pdf|title = Spatial Visualization, Visual Imagery, and Mathematical Problem Solving of Students With Varying Abilities|last = Van Garderen|first = Delinda|date = 2006|journal = JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES VOLUME 39, NUMBER 6|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in the domains of science and technology. For example, an astronomer must mentally visualize the structures of a solar system and the motions of the objects within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer mentally visualizes the interactions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to design or work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which can be viewed as abstract models of molecules with most of the spatial information deleted; spatial skills are important in restoring that information when more detailed mental models of the molecules are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Spatial visualization also involves imagining and working with visual details of measurement, shapes, motion, features and properties through mental imagery and using this spatial relations to derive at an understanding to a problem. Whereas spatial perception involves understanding externally via the senses, spatial visualization is the understanding internally through mental imagery in one's mind.

Another critical spatial visualization ability is '''mental animation'''.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation in the visuospatial sketchpad: evidence from dual-task studies|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|date = 1997-05-01|issn = 0090-502X|pmid = 9184484|pages = 321–332|volume = 25|issue = 3|first = V. K.|last = Sims|first2 = M.|last2 = Hegarty|doi=10.3758/bf03211288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental animation is mentally visualizing the motion and movement of components within any form of system or in general.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is an ability highly crucial in mechanical reasoning and understanding, for example mental animation in mechanical tasks can involve deconstructing a pulley system mentally into smaller units and animating them in the corresponding sequence or laws in the mechanical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental animation: inferring motion from static displays of mechanical systems|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date = 1992-09-01|issn = 0278-7393|pmid = 1402712|pages = 1084–1102|volume = 18|issue = 5|first = M.|last = Hegarty|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.5.1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, mental animation is mental imagining how mechanical objects work by analyzing the motion of their smaller parts.

'''Mental folding''' is a complex spatial visualization that involves the ''folding'' of 2D pattern or material into 3D objects and representations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Paper Folding Performance Following Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury in Combat Veterans: A Lesion Mapping Study|journal = Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1047-3211|pmc = 3673178|pmid = 22669970|pages = 1663–1672|volume = 23|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs153|first = Leila|last = Glass|first2 = Frank|last2 = Krueger|first3 = Jeffrey|last3 = Solomon|first4 = Vanessa|last4 = Raymont|first5 = Jordan|last5 = Grafman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other studies, mental folding has had relatively little research and study. In comparison to mental rotation, mental folding is a non-rigid spatial transformation ability which means features of the manipulated object end up changing unlike mental rotation. In rigid manipulations, the object itself is not changed but rather its spatial position or orientation is, whereas in non-rigid transformations like mental folding the object and shapes are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Understanding spatial transformations: similarities and differences between mental rotation and mental folding|journal = Cognitive Processing|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1612-4790|pmid = 23397105|pages = 105–115|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s10339-013-0544-6|first = Justin|last = Harris|first2 = Kathy|last2 = Hirsh-Pasek|first3 = Nora S.|last3 = Newcombe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental folding in tasks usually require a series of mental rotations to sequentially fold the object into a new one. Classic mental folding tests are the Paper folding task which is similar to [[Origami]]. Origami also requires mental folding by assessing folding a 2D paper enough times to create a 3D figure.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

'''Visual penetrative ability''' is least common spatial visualization task which involves ability to imagine what is inside an object based on the features outside.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Spatial working memory ==
[[Spatial memory|Spatial working memory]] is the ability to temporarily store visual-spatial memories under [[attentional control]], in order to complete a task.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities, such as mental rotation. Spatial working memory involves storing large amounts of short-term spatial memories in relation to visuo-spatial sketchpad. It is used in the temporary storage and manipulation of visual-spatial information such as memorizing shapes, colours, location or motion of objects in space. It is also involved in tasks which consist of planning of spatial movements, like planning one's route through a complex building. The visuospatial sketchpad can be split  into separate visual, spatial and possibly kin-aesthetic (movement) components. Its neurobiological function also correlates within the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2|last1 = Baddeley|first1 = A.D.|year = 2000|title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory?|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 4|issue = 11|pages = 417–423|pmid = 11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found that spatial ability plays an important role in advanced educational credentials in the science, technology, engineering or math (STEM).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Wai2009SpatialAbility.pdf|title = Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of cumulative psychological Knowledge solidifies Its importance|last = Wai|first = Jonathan|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Educational Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0016127|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why do spatial abilities predict mathematical performance?|journal = Developmental Science|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1363-755X|pmc = 3997754|pmid = 24410830|pages = 462–470|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/desc.12138|first = Maria Grazia|last = Tosto|first2 = Ken B.|last2 = Hanscombe|first3 = Claire M.A.|last3 = Haworth|first4 = Oliver S.P.|last4 = Davis|first5 = Stephen A.|last5 = Petrill|first6 = Philip S.|last6 = Dale|first7 = Sergey|last7 = Malykh|first8 = Robert|last8 = Plomin|first9 = Yulia|last9 = Kovas}}&lt;/ref&gt; From studies, it has been indicated that the probability of getting an advanced degree in STEM increases in positive relation to the level of one's spatial ability. For example, a 2009 study published in the [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] found that 45% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were within top percentage of high spatial ability in a group of 400,000 participants who were analyzed for 11 years since they were in the 12th grade.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only less than 10% of those with [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] PhDs were below the top quarter in spatial ability during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The researchers then concluded how important spatial ability is for [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] and as a factor in achieving advanced educational success in that field.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Spatial visualization is especially important in [[science]] and [[technology]]. For example, an [[astronomer]] must visually imagine the structures of a solar system, and the path of the bodies within it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An engineer must visually imagine the motions of the parts of a machine or building that he or she is assigned to work with.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Chemists must be able to understand formulas which are essentially abstract models supposed to represent spatial dynamics of molecules, and thus spatial skills are important in visualizing the molecule models that are needed in the formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Spatial manipulation ability is also important in the field of structural geology, when visually imagining how rocks change through time, such as migration of a magma body through crust or progressive folding of a strati-graphic succession. Another spatial visualization skill known as ''visual penetrative ability'' is important in geology as it requires geologists to visualize what is inside of a solid object based on past knowledge.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nagt-jge.org/doi/pdf/10.5408/1.3559671|title = Characterizing and Improving Spatial Visualization Skills|last = Titus|first = Sarah|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Geoscience Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current literature also indicates that mathematics involves visuo-spatial processing. Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than non-gifted students.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2008 review published in the journal of ''Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews'' found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many aspects of processing numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities|journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0149-7634|pmid = 18584868|pages = 1361–1372|volume = 32|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.05.015|first = Maria Dolores|last = de Hevia|first2 = Giuseppe|last2 = Vallar|first3 = Luisa|last3 = Girelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of visual information in numerosity estimation|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3355123|pmid = 22616007|pages = e37426|volume = 7|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0037426|first = Titia|last = Gebuis|first2 = Bert|last2 = Reynvoet}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Doing arithmetic by hand: hand movements during exact arithmetic reveal systematic, dynamic spatial processing|journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1747-0226|pmid = 25051274|pages = 1579–1596|volume = 67|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17470218.2014.897359|first = Tyler|last = Marghetis|first2 = Rafael|last2 = Núñez|first3 = Benjamin K.|last3 = Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 study published in the journal of ''[[Frontiers in Psychology]]'' also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Visual perception can account for the close relation between numerosity processing and computational fluency|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1664-1078|pmc = 4563146|pmid = 26441740|pages = 1364|volume = 6|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01364|first = Xinlin|last = Zhou|first2 = Wei|last2 = Wei|first3 = Yiyun|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Jiaxin|last4 = Cui|first5 = Chuansheng|last5 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study published in the journal of [[Cognitive science|''Cognitive Science'']] also found that spatial visualization ability is crucial for solving [[Kinematics|kinematic]] problems in physics. Nonetheless, current literature indicates that spatial abilities specifically mental rotation, is crucial for achieving success in various fields of chemistry, engineering and physics.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spatial Ability in Learning Engineering Mechanics: Critical Review|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282853648_Spatial_Ability_in_Learning_Engineering_Mechanics_Critical_Review|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-15|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31182">The term “sustainable communities” has various definitions, but in essence refers to communities planned, built, or modified to promote [[sustainable living]]. Sustainable communities tend to focus on environmental and economic [[sustainability]], urban infrastructure, social equity, and municipal government. The term is sometimes used synonymously with “green cities,” “eco-communities,” “livable cities” and “[[sustainable cities]].”
 
Different organizations have various understandings of sustainable communities; the term’s definition is contested and still under construction. For example, [[Burlington, Vermont]]’s Principles of Sustainable Community Development &lt;ref name="clinton2.nara.gov"&gt;"Appendix A: Definitions and Principles of Sustainable Communities" Sustainable Communities Task Force Report. Fall 1997. http://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/suscomm/suscoa.html&lt;/ref&gt;
stress the importance of local control of natural resources and a thriving non-profit sector to a sustainable community. The [[Institute for Sustainable Communities]] outlines how political empowerment and social well-being are also part of the definition&lt;ref name="clinton2.nara.gov"/&gt; Additionally, referring to communities in Shanghai and Singapore, geographer Lily Kong has paired concepts of [[cultural sustainability]] and [[social sustainability]] alongside environmental sustainability as aspects of sustainable communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Kong  | first = Lily | title =  Making Sustainable Creative/Cultural Space in Shanghai and Singapore| journal =  Geographical Review | volume =  99| issue = 1 | pages = 1–22  | date =  21 April 2010 | doi =10.1111/j.1931-0846.2009.tb00415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the UK’s 2003 [[Sustainable Communities Plan]] often abbreviates its definition of sustainable communities as “places where people want to live and work, now and in the future” &lt;ref name="webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk"&gt;"What is a Sustainable Community?" The National Archives. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1139866&lt;/ref&gt;
. Addressing the scale of sustainable communities, political scientist Kent Portney points out that the term sustainable communities has been used to refer to a broad variety of places, ranging from neighborhoods to watersheds to cities to multi-state regions.&lt;ref name=P1&gt;{{cite book|last=Portney|first=Kent E.|title=Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously:  A Comparative Analysis of Twenty-Three U.S. Cities|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/portney-taking-sustainability-seriously-in-cities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Etymologically, the term “sustainable community” grew out of the related discourses of “sustainability” and “[[sustainable development]]” that gained widespread use among local, national, and international politicians and policymakers in NGOs starting in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Agyeman"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Agyeman | first = Julian | title = Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice| place =  New York| publisher = NYU Press| year =  2005| isbn = 9780814707111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally referred to environmental concerns and was later applied to cities.&lt;ref name=Maliene &gt;{{cite journal  | last1 =Maliene  | first1 = V | last2 = Howe  | first2 = J | last3 =Malys | first3 = N |title =  Sustainable Communities: Affordable Housing and Socio-Economic Relations. | journal =  Local Economy | volume =  23| issue = 4 | pages = 267–276  | date =  21 April 2010 | doi = 10.1080/02690940802407989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Sustainable Community initiatives==

The best example of a real Sustainable Community is Saint Michael's Sustainable Community in Costa Rica. The community produces far more food and water then it needs.  It uses regenerative agriculture as a base to live in harmony with nature. 

Sustainable community initiatives have emerged in neighborhoods, cities, counties, [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] planning districts, and watershed districts at different scales pertaining to community needs. These initiatives are driven by various actor groups that have different methods of effectively planning out ways to create sustainable communities. Most often they are implemented by [[governments]] and [[non-profit organizations]], but they also involve community members, academics, and create partnerships and [[coalitions]].
 
Nonprofit organizations help to cultivate local talents and skills, [[Empowerment|empowering]] people to become more powerful and more involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the [[sustainability]] of various practices, such as land use and community design, [[transportation]], energy efficiency, [[waste reduction]], and climate friendly purchasing.
 
Some government groups will create partnerships where departments will work together using [[grants]] to provide resources to communities like clean air and water, [[community planning]], [[economic development]], equity and [[environmental justice]], as well as [[housing]] and transportation choices.
 
[[Social movements]] have gathered momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, not only through example, but also by offering classes and training on [[sustainable living]], [[permaculture]], and [[local economics]].

== International initiatives==

===United Kingdom===

The [[Sustainable Communities Plan]] was launched in 2003 through the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]. Lacking an official national spatial development plan, the UK employed the Sustainable Communities Plan as a regional development plan targeted at the South East of England.&lt;ref name="Raco"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = A growth agenda without growth: English spatial policy, sustainable communities, and the death of the neo-liberal project | journal =  Geojournal | volume =  77| issue = 2 | pages = 153–165 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1007/s10708-009-9327-0 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the plan created the [[Academy for Sustainable Communities]]. The £38 billion plan identifies four key growth areas for development and regeneration: the [[Thames Gateway]], [[Ashford, Kent]], [[London]]-Stansted-[[Cambridge]]-[[Peterborough]] (LSCP) and [[Milton Keynes]]/[[South Midlands]] (MKSM) &lt;ref name="webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk"/&gt;
.  Designed during a period that projected sustained economic growth into the future, the plan’s implementation has been slowed and disjointed, particularly since the [[2008 economic recession]] &lt;ref name="Raco"/&gt;
An [[affordable housing]] shortage in the UK has also challenged the Plan’s implementation.&lt;ref name= Maliene /&gt;

== National initiatives ==
The '''Partnership for Sustainable Communities''' is an interagency partnership between the [[Department of Transportation]], [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. These departments work together with a mission to “improve access to affordable housing, increase transportation options, and lower transportation costs while protecting the environment”.&lt;ref name="sustainablecommunities.gov"&gt;"About Us" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.  Retrieved 10 March 2014 http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/aboutUs.html&lt;/ref&gt; All three bureaus offer funding opportunities to support communities in areas of clean air and water, community planning, economic development, energy efficiency, equity and environmental justice, as well as housing and transportation choices. The partnership incorporates six principles of livability into its grant-making and program development.:&lt;ref name="sustainablecommunities.gov"/&gt;
*Provide more transportation choices
*Promote equitable, affordable housing
*Enhance economic competitiveness
*Support existing communities
*Coordinate policies and leverage investment
*Value communities and neighborhoods

Along with working collaboratively, these government agencies also have their own initiatives. 
The Department of Housing and Development has an ''Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities'' which features a Sustainable Housing Initiative, aiming at “supporting the construction and rehabilitation of [[green affordable housing]]”&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Housing Initiative" U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/sustainable_housing_communities/sustainable_housing_initiative&lt;/ref&gt;  and does this through programs that retrofit or construct energy efficient homes. They also work to standardize energy efficiency standards across federal agencies, as well as expand the availability of financing for home energy improvements and multifamily housing.

The Environmental Protection Agency has a ''Smart Growth Program'' which conducts research, publishes reports, showcases outstanding communities, and works with communities through grants and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Smart Growth" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  They also have a Green Communities Program which provides communities with a tool kit of information to help them reach sustainable goals. The tool kit is arranged in a five-step program which allows communities to:&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Information" Green Communities, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.epa.gov/greenkit/basicinformation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Develop '''community assessments''' of their current conditions
*Formulate '''trend analyses''' that answers the question “Where are we going?” in the face of no intervention 
*Create '''vision statements''' of where the community sees itself in the future
*Establish '''action plans''' about what programs and initiatives will help the community reach its goals
*Access tools to '''implement''' action plans

The Department of Transportation has a ''Livability Initiative'' which issues “grants to eligible recipients for planning, vehicle purchases, facility construction, operations, and other purposes”,&lt;ref&gt;"Grants and Programs" U.S. Department of Transportation. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://www.dot.gov/livability/grants-programs&lt;/ref&gt; with numerous goals, including the improvement of surface transportation, providing public transit on Indian reservations, providing access to disadvantaged communities, etc.

===Case Studies from the Partnership for Sustainable Communities===

'''The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland'''

Once a thriving place of business and home to the wealthy and elite, Euclid Avenue in [[Cleveland]] had seen a decline in commerce following the [[Great Depression]]. During this economic downturn, Cleveland became a [[shrinking city]] as many of its residents moved and homes were turned into boarding houses or abandoned altogether.. After decades of work by city leaders and residents to revitalize this part of the city, the bus line [[HealthLine]] debuted in 2008. This bus line increased ridership and helped The Euclid Corridor begin to see the redevelopment of abandoned properties as well as investment in development of commerce, to the tune of $4.3 billion. This created thousands of square feet of retail space and thousands of jobs. The success of the revitalization of the Euclid Corridor is due in large part to engaged community leaders, community members, and NGO's like MidTown Cleveland who worked on ensuring that there was a variety of housing investments. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through their brownfield assessment grants and HUD provided mortgage insurance on properties to aid in the development of Euclid Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;"Transit as Transformation - The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland" Partnership for Sustainable Communities. June 2012. Retrieved 10 March 2014" http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/pdf/studies/cleveland-euclid-corridor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenville, South Carolina’s Westside'''

Following a shift from the cotton production that once thrived in the west end of [[Greenville, South Carolina]], this part of the city began to see a flight of its residents and with it the abandonment and decay of its buildings and facilities, higher crime rates, and more low-income households. In 2010, HUD and DOT awarded the city $1.8 million to support a three-year planning initiative which sought to improve affordable housing, transportation, and increase economic development. The HUD provided a loan to encourage economic growth, specifically through the conversion of an old cotton warehouse into an area of retail shops, offices, and restaurants known as West End Market. The success of West End Market led to 230 building permits being issued around the area in a three-year period, resulting in a successful arts district that created jobs as well as drew tourists and locals. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through $200,000 in brownfield assessment grants which allowed for the city to facilitate clean up, or initiate redevelopment. The city also worked with the [[Federal Highway Administration]] in demolishing an unnecessary bridge which allowed for the development of a recreational area with a cross bridge, waterfalls, and walking paths, known as [[Falls Park on the Reedy]]. In 2005, a mixed-use development was constructed across from Falls Park with a hotel, apartments, restaurants, and retail and office spaces to help further spark economic growth in the area.&lt;ref&gt;"Revitalizing Greenville's Westside" Partnership for Sustainable Communities. December 2012. Retrieved 10 March 2014 http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/pdf/studies/greenville_sc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seattle’s South Lake Union Neighborhood'''

With investments in transportation, affordable housing, and green space, Seattle’s South Lake Union has transformed from a place of freeway traffic, abandoned warehouses, and parking lots to an economically flourishing neighborhood. An integral part to this transformation was the creation of a street car service, partially funded by the [[Federal Transit Administration]]. The streetcar encouraged both Amazon.com and Microsoft to locate campuses in the South Lake Union neighborhood, bringing with it jobs and investment in residential space. The City of Seattle is proposing a zoning change to promote affordable housing and attract market rate development. HUD provided grants to fund building and support services for the chronically homeless, adults and veterans recovering from addiction, and homeless with mental health issues and substance abuse problems. HUD also supplied $5.7 million towards the construction of a senior housing facility. To address the problems with the neighborhoods freeways and lack of sidewalks and crosswalks, a $30 million grant was issued by the DOT to help build crosswalks over 12 intersections, widen sidewalks, add bicycle lanes, as well as beautify the space through the addition of landscaping and trees.&lt;ref&gt;"Seattle's South Lake Union Neighborhood" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.

== State initiatives ==

===Maryland===

The state of Maryland passed a Sustainable Communities Act in 2010 with the goal of revitalizing and promoting reinvestment in Maryland’s older communities as well working to promote “equitable, affordable housing by expanding energy-efficient housing choices for people of all ages, incomes, races, and ethnicity to increase mobility and lower the combined cost of housing and transportation”.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Communities" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 11 March 2014. [http://planning.maryland.gov/yourpart/sustainablecommunities.shtml ]&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program which promotes private investment in the restoration and development of historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;"Maryland Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program" Maryland Department of Planning, Maryland Historical Trust. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://mht.maryland.gov/taxCredits.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program, the neighborhood of [[Remington, Baltimore]] was able to refurbish an old tin factory into a space for offices and residences, which led to the development of other properties as well as homes, which increased use and population for the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Neighborhood Revitalization" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://planning.maryland.gov/OurWork/spotlightComm_Remington.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Maryland General Assembly passed the Sustainable Communities Tax Increment Financing Designation and Financing Law. This law allows for Maryland counties and municipalities to use funds generated from increased property tax values to fund improvement projects in sustainable communities. Sample projects include expanding sidewalks, the development of tree planting on streets and parks, as well as improvements to water and sewer infrastructure to help encourage economic growth and improve quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Communities" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://planning.maryland.gov/yourpart/sustainablecommunities.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

The state of California passed the [[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008]], also known as SB 375. The law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through transportation, housing, and land use planning. Under the SB 375, the state is broken up into Metropolitan Planning Organizations which are each responsible for developing Sustainable Community Strategies that will help the state reach its goal of reduced emissions. These strategies are then evaluated by the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Air Resources Board.&lt;ref name= "nrdc.org"&gt;"Sustainable Communities" California Environmental Protection Agency - Air Resources Board. Retrieved 8 March 2014. http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/sb375.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Sustainable Community Strategy, the city of [[Sacramento]] plans to double transit service and increase bike lanes, offering more transportation choices and reducing vehicle emissions.&lt;ref name="Eaken, Amanda 2012"&gt;Eaken, Amanda.

Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/sb375/implementation-report/files/implementation-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[San Diego]] also plans to increase funding towards more transportation choices as well as promote more multi-family housing near high transit areas.&lt;ref name="Eaken, Amanda 2012"/&gt; The Southern California Strategies include transit expansion, developing housing closer to public transportation, increasing funding for biking and pedestrians, and the creation of jobs, with most being near public transit.&lt;ref name="Eaken, Amanda 2012"/&gt;

==City government initiatives==

Cities are defined as [[jurisdictional]] units that have small divisions of government within them. These divisions of government have the authority to affect environmental and [[ecological]] results.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt;  Cities are especially important in initiating sustainable communities because they have [[local authorities]] that “have political power and credibility to take initiatives to access and deploy [[resources]] in ways reflecting local conditions that allows them the capacity to manage and lead [[urban development]] for the good of the environment.” &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;  It is also necessary to implement sustainable communities in countries that are [[industrialized]] because cities are where most environmental and [[social problems]] dwell.
 
When looking at and comparing sustainable cities certain indicators may be used:
 
*Does the city have any [[smart growth]] programs that are designed to “help manage growth and avoid and eliminate [[urban sprawl]]” and minimize impacts on [[physical environment]]? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Does the city have [[zoning]] plans that demonstrate goals for the city in a way that create [[Environmentally Sensitive Area|environmentally-sensitive]] areas and maintain them? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Does the city follow any legal [[policies]] that allow [[advocates]] and [[activists]] to create programs that would help the city become [[sustainable]]? &lt;ref name=A1&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How involved in the environmental and [[Social justice|social justice movement]] are programs within the city? &lt;ref name=A2&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is the [[transportation]] system of the city set up to encourage [[public transportation]] and not private to reduce [[pollution]]? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Are there pollution remediation programs in the city? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*How [[Politically|politically involved]] are citizens where their voices are equally heard in order to create social justice and a [[just community]]? &lt;ref name=A2 /&gt;
 
The 34 elements inside “Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously" can also be used to determine whether a city is considered sustainable or not.&lt;ref name=P34&gt;{{cite book|last=Portney|first=Kent E.|title=Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously:  A Comparative Analysis of Twenty-Three U.S. Cities|page=34|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/portney-taking-sustainability-seriously-in-cities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City examples===

The city of [[San Francisco]] uses the [[Precautionary principal|Precautionary Principal]] as a framework to develop laws for a healthier and more just city.&lt;ref name=A3&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precautionary principal gives more power to community members by allowing them to stand up against [[corporations]] in their neighborhoods and leaves the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] to corporations instead of community members. Companies must prove that their endeavors are harmless to the community instead of the community having to prove they have been harmed by company endeavors.&lt;ref name=A2 /&gt; This allows for a sustainable community as [[environmental justice]] and social justice are created.
 
The city of [[Quebec]] to create a sustainable community through political involvement has dedicated studies to discovering why citizens are or are not politically active. Studies from Quebec have shown that citizens’ [[Political efficacy|internal and external efficacy]] is a large part in determining [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in politics. When citizens lack the internal belief that one can make change in government and the external belief that the government will make changes according to citizen concerns, political participation dwindles as citizens believe no change will occur. When becoming politically active, a citizen takes into account the history of the city government, the government’s actions, and government interactions with other citizens.&lt;ref name=KC1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornberg and Clarke|first=Allan and Harold|title=Citizens and Community: Political Support in a Representative Democracy|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After noting the city’s sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are being used to try to create and transform sustainable communities.

==Non-Profit and NGO sector==

The [[Institute for Sustainable Communities]] created by former Vermont Governor, Madeleine M. Kunin, leads community based projects around the globe that address environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a Sustainable Community?" Institute for Sustainable Communities. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://www.iscvt.org/what_we_do/sustainable_community/&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups help to cultivate local talents and skills, empowering people to become more powerful and involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the sustainability of various practices, such as land use and community design, green transportation, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and climate friendly purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;"About Sustainable Communities" Sustainable Communities Online. Retrieved 11 March 2014. http://www.sustainable.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Integrity]] Project is focused on bringing together top scientists and thinkers from around the world in order to analyze the problems of inequality among humankind. These thinkers examine economic and ethical issues faced in protecting and enhancing our environments and make recommendations on restoration techniques that aid in promoting social justice. They also call for a major and imperative paradigm shift in order to ensure good quality of life for many future generations.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite book|last=Pimentel|first=David|title=Ecological Integrity: Integrating Environment, Conservation, and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable Seattle]]  is a non-profit organization which has created regional indicators for sustainability through grassroots activism and has become a world leader in these sustainability indicators. Sustainable Seattle has printed newsletters on a wide range of sustainale community topics, from building to recycling and more, and they are believed to be the first “sustainable community” organization, founded in 1991. There are now hundreds of “sustainable community” organizations across the USA &lt;ref&gt;"Who we are" Sustainable Seattle. Retrieved 5 May 2014. http://www.sustainableseattle.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movement initiatives==

The Take Back Your Time Movement, led by John de Graaf, focuses on the concept of working fewer hours and devoting more time to living a healthy lifestyle. The movement suggests that allowing shorter work days and longer vacations would in turn help better distribute work, while also reducing stress and making for healthier living. Additionally, people would have more free time to make more rewarding and sustainable choices for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Assadourian, Erik. "The Power of Social Movements" Worldwatch Institute. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://blogs.worldwatch.org/transformingcultures/contents/social-movements&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voluntary Simplicity Movement or [[Simple Living]] movement emphasizes reducing one’s material possessions and desires and increasing self-sufficiency through skills such as gardening and [[DIY]]. The Voluntary Simplicity Movement suggests that one should focus on cultivating their own best inner being rather than focus on making material gains and wealth. It also promotes activism within the community to create engaged, educated citizens.

The [[Degrowth]] movement is based on [[anti-consumerist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] ideas, focusing on reducing consumption and promoting happy, healthy lifestyles in non-consumptive fashions. Main aspects of Degrowth include more equal distribution of workload and sharing work, consuming less, and setting aside time for personal and cultural growth through the arts and creativity &lt;ref&gt;"About Us: Description" Degrowth.org Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements such as [[ecovillage]]s are gathering momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, teaching through example and also offering classes and training on sustainable living, [[permaculture]], and local economics. Ecovillages seek to integrate themselves harmlessly into the ecosystem surrounding them, so as to live and interact in a way that is sustainable and supportive of the natural world &lt;ref&gt;"About Us" Ecovillage Farm Learning Center. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://ecovillagefarm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges and critiques==

Sustainable communities, both as individual projects and as a whole, have faced challenges impeding their development and have been met with criticism.
 
Sustainable communities projects have struggled to take hold for:
 
* poor economic conditions and inaccessible housing markets: in the UK’s Sustainable Communities Plan, the economic downturn of 2008 has led to a general shortage of housing and affordable housing in particular, which run contrary to the plan’s premises of  livable communities.&lt;ref name= Maliene/&gt;
 
Projects have been critiqued for:
* lacking a well-developed [[environmental justice]] framework: urban and environmental policy planner [[Julian Agyeman]] has written about the "narrow focus" of civic environmentalism that does not take "social justice" into account, and the need for sustainable communities to be democratic and collaborate with the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref name=Agyeman /&gt;
* promoting a securitization agenda: British geographer Mike Raco argues that the UK's Sustainable Communities Plan employs the discourse of sustainability as "a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = Securing Sustainable Communities: Citizenship, Safety, and Sustainability in the New Urban Planning | journal =  European Urban and Regional Studies | volume =  14| issue = 4 | pages = 305–320 | year = 2014| doi = 10.1177/0969776407081164 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* accommodating to [[neoliberal]] economic systems instead of confronting them: while some rationales for sustainable communities conflict with market-driven agendas, economic growth characterizes the means and ends of some initiatives. Additionally, sustainable communities reject the notion that development itself is fundamentally socially divisive or environmentally destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = Sustainable Development, Rolled-Out Neoliberalism and Sustainable Communities | journal =  Antipode | volume =  37| issue = 2 | pages = 324–347 | year = 2005| doi = 10.1111/j.0066-4812.2005.00495.x }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
While there are a variety of graduate degrees at universities that touch on sustainability as it related to urban planning and environmental resources, only a few degree program programs exist that train students in the theory and practice of sustainable communities. The most notable examples are:

* [[Binghamton University]] offers a [https://www.binghamton.edu/sustainable-communities/ Masters of Arts (MA) and Masters of Science (MS) in Sustainable Communities]. 
* [[Green Mountain College]] has a graduate program leading to a [http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/graduate/mrsc/ Masters of Science (MS) in Resilient and Sustainable Communities].
* [[Northern Arizona University]] offers a [https://in.nau.edu/sustainable-communities/program/ Masters of Arts (MA) in Sustainable Communities].

{{Reading}}
 
"[[Phonics]]" emphasizes the [[alphabetic principle]] – the idea that letters represent the sounds of speech, and that there are systematic and predictable relationships between written letters and spoken words, which is specific to the [[alphabetic]] [[writing system]] Children learn letter sounds (b = the first sound in "bat" and "ball") first and then blend them (bl = the first two sounds in "blue") to form words.  Children also learn how to segment and chunk letter sounds together in order to blend them to form words (trap = /t/, /r/, /a/, /p/ or /tr/, /ap/).  

"[[Whole language]]" is a [[Reading education|method of teaching reading]] that emphasizes literature and text comprehension. Students are taught to use critical thinking strategies and to use context to "guess" words that they do not recognize. In the younger grades, children use invented spelling to write their own stories. 

Both instructional methods use elements that are emphasized in the other; the differences between the methods are largely related to what is emphasized and the sequence of skill instruction.

==Phonics==
{{Main|Phonics}}

Phonics is seen to be an improvement  used method of learning the approximate [[phoneme|sounds]] represented by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s (b=buh) first and then blending them with other sounds (bl=bluh) to decode and encode words in written form. This newer method attempts to eliminate the extraneous "uh" sounds which were unavoidable in the older method. Children also learn strategies to figure out words they don't know. 

Phonics is considered an "analytical" approach where students analyze the letters, letter combinations and syllables in a word; in an effort to "decode" (1) the speech-sounds represented by the letters and (2) the meaning of the text. The advantage of phonics is that, especially for students who come to schools with large English vocabularies, it enables students to decode or "sound-out" a word they have in their speaking vocabulary. 

Phonics proponents led by [[Rudolf Flesch]] in his book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' attacked the whole word approach because (1) it did not get students into reading children's stories that did not have carefully controlled vocabularies and (2) it theoretically required the students to memorize every word as a whole. 

Phonics advocates focus their efforts on the primary grades and emphasize the importance of students having [[phonemic awareness]], that is an understanding of the alphabetic principle that the spelling of words relates to how they sound when spoken. 

A problem with teaching the reading of English with this analytical approach is that English words do not have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier.  In general, with a few common exceptions, the [[consonant]]s do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the [[vowel]]s do not. For instance the letter "a" represents one sound in the word "s'''a'''y", a second sound in "'''a'''t", a third sound in "'''a'''ny", a fourth sound in "'''a'''re", a fifth sound in "'''a'''ll", a sixth sound in "'''a'''bout", a seventh sound in "f'''a'''ther", an eighth sound in "or'''a'''nge", and a ninth sound (silence) in "bre'''a'''d". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter. 

Almost any combination of three letters with a central "a" can reasonably be pronounced in a number of different ways. For instance the "a" in "pag" could be pronounced as in "page" (long "a"), "pageant" (short "a"), creepage (short "i") or decoupage (short "o" as in "dot"). It therefore follows that beginning students will have a difficult time picking the appropriate sound when sounding-out words which are not in their speaking vocabularies.

Fortunately, most readers quickly develop a subconscious word sense which helps them fluently pick the right sound based on the structure of the word and how that structure is related to other similar words they know.

Some very common words do not fully follow common phonic patterns, so those words have to be memorized. Some books refer to these words as "[[sight word]]s", but it is probably better to refer to them as "memory words" because some books refer to sight words as those words which are so common they do not have to be analyzed or "sounded-out". It does not seem like a good idea to have "sight-words" mean two different things when "memory-words" is available.

The many [[homonym]]s in English such as ''to'', ''too'', and ''two'' create difficulties for students, even at the university level in regard to spelling. 

'''Drawbacks''': 
*For those who learn to speak by learning the whole sound of a word, phonics is not an ideal form of reading instruction, because these learners do not naturally break words into separate sounds.
*Some phonics programs use low-interest reading material and too many boring worksheets. Those "drawbacks", of course, are not unique to a phonics program.

==Whole language==
{{Main|Whole language}}

'''Whole language''' is a currently controversial approach to teaching reading that is based on constructivist learning theory and ethnographic studies of students in classrooms. With whole language, teachers are expected to provide a literacy rich environment for their students and to combine [[Speech communication|speaking]], [[listening]], [[reading (activity)|reading]], and [[writing]]. Whole language teachers emphasize the meaning of texts over the sounds of letters, and phonics instruction becomes just one component of the whole language classroom. 
Whole language is considered a "[[wikt:top-down|top down]]" approach where the reader constructs a personal meaning for a text based on using their prior knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they are reading.

'''Drawbacks''': 
*Some whole language programs place too little emphasis on word analysis. When that is left out, young readers may guess or skip over words they don't know and some children may not learn how to read.
*Some scholars have estimated that a whole-word memorization approach puts severe limitations on the number of words that children can learn to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diane McGuinness|McGuinness, Diane]]. [http://www.rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 A Prototype for Teaching the English Alphabet Code] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624011617/http://rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 |date=2008-06-24 }} Reading Reform Foundation Newsletter (49) &lt;!--accessed August 5, 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who come from "high literacy" households—where young children are read bedtime stories on a regular basis, there are lots of children's books, and adults read regularly—tend to learn to read well regardless of the teaching approach used. These students tend to enter school with large vocabularies and reading readiness skills (and sometimes they already can read). 

Students from "low literacy" households are not exposed much to reading in their homes and tend to have smaller vocabularies. They may speak non-standard dialects of English such as [[African American Vernacular English]] and can be unmotivated students, especially if they see teachers as enemies trying to change how they speak and act, in other words their language and culture. It can be argued that a standard phonics approach might be unsuccessful for these students. Whole language approaches encourage teachers to find reading material that reflects these students' language and culture. Using culturally relevant material within classrooms may assist to engage these students in their reading. In addition, knowing students and how they learn will assist as topics of interest can be incorporated into their reading material for added motivation.

Publishing basal reading textbooks is a multimillion dollar industry that responds to the demands of purchasers. Two populous states, California and Texas, do statewide adoptions of textbooks, and whatever they want in their textbooks, publishers tend to supply. Currently publishers are including systematic phonics instruction (see [[synthetic phonics]]), more classic and popular children's literature, and whole language activities. This compromise generally goes under the rubric of a "balanced approach" to teaching reading. Advocates of balanced reading instruction should supplement a school's adopted reading program with materials that reflect the experiential background and interests of their students. 

Various approaches to reading presume that students learn differently. The phonics emphasis in reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning theory that is associated with the work of the Harvard psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] while the whole language emphasis draws from cognitivist learning theory and the work of the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. 

Behaviorist learning theory is based on studies of animal behaviors where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that were not rewarded or were punished. Most of us can point to things we continue to do because we are rewarded for doing them. Rewards can be the pay we get for jobs we do, desired recognition like "A" grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends when they like what we are doing. Likewise, we can point to things we stopped doing because we were not rewarded or were punished for them. Behaviorist learning theory tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades, and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully accomplishing a difficult task. 

Cognitivist learning theory is based on the idea that children learn by connecting new knowledge to previously learned knowledge. The term is a building metaphor that includes students using scaffolding to organize new information. If children cannot connect new knowledge to old knowledge in a meaningful way, they may with difficulty memorize it ([[rote learning]]), but they will not have a real understanding of what they are learning. 

Vygotsky identified a '''"[[zone of proximal development]]"''' where children can learn new things that are a little above their current understanding with the help of more knowledgeable peers or adults. This new knowledge is incorporated into their existing knowledge base.

'''Tide pools''' or '''rock pools''' are shallow pools of [[seawater]] that form on the rocky [[intertidal]] shore. Many of these pools exist as separate bodies of water only at [[low tide]].

Many tide pools are [[habitat]]s of especially adaptable animals that have engaged the attention of naturalists and [[marine biology|marine biologists]], as well as philosophical essayists: [[John Steinbeck]] wrote in ''[[The Log from the Sea of Cortez]]'', "It is advisable to look from the tide pool to the stars and then back to the tide pool."&lt;ref name="NPCA Tide pools"&gt;{{cite news |title=NPCA Tide pools |publisher=npca.org |date=September 5, 2008 |url=http://www.npca.org/marine_and_coastal/beaches/tide_pools.html |accessdate=2008-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924061051/http://www.npca.org/marine_and_coastal/beaches/tide_pools.html |archivedate=2008-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zones from shallow to deep==
{{Main|Intertidal zone}}
[[File:Tide pools in Santa Cruz from Spray-splash zone to low tide zone.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Tide pools in Santa Cruz, California from spray/splash zone to low tide zone]]

Tidal pools exist in the [[intertidal zone]]s. These zones are submerged by the sea at high tides and during storms, and may receive spray from wave action. At other times the rocks may undergo other extreme conditions, baking in the sun or exposed to cold winds. Few organisms can survive such harsh conditions. [[Lichen]]s and [[barnacle]]s live in this region.&lt;ref name="NPCA Tide pools"/&gt; In this zone, different [[barnacle]] species live at very tightly constrained elevations. Tidal conditions precisely determine the exact height of an assemblage relative to sea level.

The [[intertidal zone]] is periodically exposed to sun and wind, which [[desiccate]] barnacles, which need to be well adapted to water loss. Their [[calcite]] shells are impermeable, and they possess two plates which they slide across their mouth opening when not feeding. These plates also protect against predation.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Joseph H. "Community interactions on marine rocky intertidal shores." ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics''3.1 (1972): 169-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High tide zone===
The high tide zone is flooded during each high tide. Organisms must survive [[wave action]], [[Ocean current|currents]], and exposure to the [[sun]]. This zone is predominantly inhabited by seaweed and [[invertebrates]], such as [[sea anemone]]s, [[starfish]], [[chiton]]s, [[crab]]s, green [[algae]], and [[mussels]]. Marine [[algae]] provide shelter for [[nudibranch]]es and [[hermit crab]]s. The same [[wave]]s and currents that make life in the high tide zone difficult bring food to [[filter feeder]]s and other intertidal organisms.

[[File:Pteropurpura trialata is laying the eggs 1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo of dozens of palm-tree shaped seaweed plants exposed to the air|&lt;center&gt;Low tide zone in a tide pool&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Low tide zone===
Also called the lower littoral zone. This area is mostly submerged and is exposed only during unusually low tide. Often it teems with life and has much more marine vegetation, especially seaweeds. There is also greater biodiversity. Organisms in this zone do not have to be as well adapted to drying out and temperature extremes. Low tide zone organisms include abalone, anemones, brown seaweed, chitons, crabs, green algae, hydroids, isopods, limpets, mussels, and sometimes even small vertebrates such as fish. These creatures can grow to larger sizes because there is more available energy and better water coverage: the water is shallow enough to allow more sunlight for photosynthetic activity, and the salinity is at almost normal levels. This area is also relatively protected from large predators because of the wave action and shallow water.

==Life==
Tide pools provide a home for hardy organisms such as starfish, mussels and clams. Inhabitants must be able to deal with a frequently changing [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] — fluctuations in water [[temperature]], [[salinity]], and [[oxygen]] content. Hazards include [[Ocean surface wave|wave]]s, strong [[Ocean current|current]]s, exposure to midday sun and [[Predation|predators]].

Waves can dislodge [[mussels]] and draw them out to sea. [[Gull]]s pick up and drop [[sea urchin]]s to break them open. [[Starfish]] prey on mussels and are eaten by gulls themselves. Even [[American Black Bear|black bear]]s sometimes feast on intertidal creatures at low tide.&lt;ref name="Botanical Beach"&gt;{{cite news

===Flora===
[[Postelsia|Sea palm]]s look similar to [[Palm tree|palm]] trees. They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in areas with greater wave action. High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the [[thallus]], allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize. In addition, the constant wave action removes competitors, such as the mussel species ''[[Mytilus californianus]]''.

Recent studies have shown that ''Postelsia'' grows in greater numbers when such competition exists &amp;mdash; a control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing [[gametophytes]].&lt;ref name="seasonalpatterns"&gt;

==History==
On May 13, 1960 the presidium of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] issued a decision to establish the Kharkiv Physics and Technical Institute for Low Temperatures on the initiative of several scientists from the [[Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology]]. 

The institute was created by nine laboratories involved in low temperature physics. Four math departments were also established. In 1987 they were organized into the ILTPE [[Mathematical Division of B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering|Mathematics Department]].

In 1991 ILTPE was named after its founder&amp;nbsp;— B. Verkin.

The [[consortium]] operates two [[telescope]]s of 3.5 m and 0.9 m diameters.

The universities financed the construction of the [[WIYN Observatory]] at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] (KPNO) in 1994.

In 2001, the WIYN Consortium took over control of the KPNO {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope, built in 1960, and [[christen|rechristened]] it as the ''WIYN 0.9 m Telescope''.  This small but popular telescope was in danger of being [[mothball]]ed for budgetary reasons.
