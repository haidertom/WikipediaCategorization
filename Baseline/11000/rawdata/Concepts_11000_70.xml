{{Mindfulness}}
'''Acceptance and commitment therapy''' ('''ACT''', typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of counseling and a branch of [[clinical behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="Plumb"&gt;{{cite journal | title=In Search of Meaning: Values in Modern Clinical Behavior Analysis |author1=Jennifer C Plumb |author2=Ian Stewart |author3=Galway JoAnne Dahl |author4=Tobias Lundgren | journal=Behav Anal. |date=Spring 2009 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=85–103 | pmc=2686995 | pmid=22478515 | doi=10.1007/bf03392177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[empirical]]ly-based [[psychological]] [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] that uses [[acceptance]] and [[mindfulness]] strategies mixed in different ways&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayes |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven C. Hayes |title=Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT) |publisher=ContextualPsychology.org |url= http://www.contextualpsychology.org/act}}&lt;/ref&gt; with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase [[psychological flexibility]]. The approach was originally called ''comprehensive distancing''.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zettle |first1=Robert D. |year=2005 |title=The Evolution of a Contextual Approach to Therapy: From Comprehensive Distancing to ACT |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77–89 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ844315&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ844315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven C. Hayes]] developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in 1982 in order to create a mixed approach which integrates both cognitive and behavioral therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive and Behavioral Theories in Clinical Practice|last=Freeman|first=Arthur|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60623-342-9|location=Newyork, NY|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of protocols for ACT, depending on the target behavior or setting. For example, in behavioral health areas a [[Brief psychotherapy|brief]] version of ACT is called ''focused acceptance and commitment therapy'' (FACT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Focused Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (FACT): Mastering The Basics |url=https://contextualscience.org/wc12_strosahl_robinson_gustavsson |publisher=[[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] |website=contextualscience.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407201937/https://contextualscience.org/wc12_strosahl_robinson_gustavsson |archivedate=2016-04-07 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of ACT is not elimination of difficult feelings; rather, it is to be present with what life brings us and to "move toward valued behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayes, Steven C. |author2=Strosahl, Kirk D. |author3=Wilson, Kelly G.|title=Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: The Process and Practice of Mindful Change|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60918-962-4|edition=2|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance and commitment therapy invites people to open up to unpleasant feelings, and learn not to overreact to them, and not avoid situations where they are invoked. Its therapeutic effect is a positive spiral where feeling better leads to a better understanding of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shpancer |first= Noam |date= September 8, 2010 |title= Emotional Acceptance: Why Feeling Bad is Good |journal=Psychology Today |URL= http://m.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201009/emotional-acceptance-why-feeling-bad-is-good}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ACT, 'truth' is measured through the concept of 'workability', or what works to take another step toward what matters (e.g. values, meaning).

==Technique==
===Basics===
ACT is developed within a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosophy called [[functional contextualism]]. ACT is based on [[relational frame theory]] (RFT), a comprehensive theory of language and cognition that is an offshoot of [[behavior analysis]]. Both ACT and RFT are based on [[B. F. Skinner|B. F. Skinner's]] philosophy of [[Radical behaviorism|Radical Behaviorism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohlenberg|first=Robert|last2=Hayes|first2=Steven|last3=Tsai|first3=Mavis|year=1993|title=Radical Behavioral Psychotherapy: Two Contemporary Examples|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.542.4819&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=13|pages=579–592|via=|doi=10.1016/0272-7358(93)90047-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACT differs from traditional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) in that rather than trying to teach people to better control their thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories and other private events, ACT teaches them to "just notice," accept, and embrace their private events, especially previously unwanted ones. ACT helps the individual get in contact with a [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] sense of self known as "self-as-context"—the you who is always there observing and experiencing and yet distinct from one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories. ACT aims to help the individual clarify their personal values and to take action on them, bringing more vitality and meaning to their life in the process, increasing their [[psychological flexibility]].&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

While Western psychology has typically operated under the "healthy normality" assumption which states that by their nature, humans are psychologically healthy, ACT assumes, rather, that psychological processes of a normal human mind are often destructive.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by [[experiential avoidance]], cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym, '''FEAR''':{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}[[File:Cards used as a therapeutic activity in ACT treatment.jpg|thumb|Cards used as a therapeutic activity in ACT treatment.]]
* '''F'''usion with your thoughts
* '''E'''valuation of experience
* '''A'''voidance of your experience
* '''R'''eason-giving for your behavior

And the healthy alternative is to '''ACT''':
* '''A'''ccept your reactions and be present
* '''C'''hoose a valued direction
* '''T'''ake action

===Core principles===
ACT commonly employs six core principles to help clients develop [[psychological flexibility]]:&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Russ |date=August 2006 |title=Embracing your demons: an overview of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy |journal=Psychotherapy in Australia |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=2–8 |url=http://actmindfully.com.au/upimages/Dr_Russ_Harris_-_A_Non-technical_Overview_of_ACT.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cognitive defusion: Learning methods to reduce the tendency to [[Reification (fallacy)|reify]] thoughts, images, emotions, and memories.
# Acceptance: Allowing unwanted private experiences (thoughts, feelings and urges) to come and go without struggling with them.
# Contact with the present moment: Awareness of the here and now, experienced with openness, interest, and receptiveness. (e.g., mindfulness)
# The observing self: Accessing a transcendent sense of self, a continuity of consciousness which is unchanging.
# Values: Discovering what is most important to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hank |last1=Robb |year=2007 |title=Values as Leading Principles in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=118–23 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ801192&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ801192 |doi=10.1037/h0100170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Committed action: Setting goals according to values and carrying them out responsibly, in the service of a meaningful life.

Correlational evidence has found that absence of psychological flexibility predicts many forms of psychopathology. A 2005 [[meta-analysis]] showed that the six ACT principles, on average, account for 16–29% of the variance in psychopathology (general mental health, depression, anxiety) at baseline, depending on the measure, using correlational methods.&lt;ref name=hayes06 /&gt;{{rp|12–13}} A 2012 meta-analysis of 68 laboratory-based studies on ACT components has also provided support for the link between psychological flexibility concepts and specific components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2012.05.003 |title=The Impact of Treatment Components Suggested by the Psychological Flexibility Model: A Meta-Analysis of Laboratory-Based Component Studies |year=2012 |last1=Levin |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hildebrandt |first2=Mikaela J. |last3=Lillis |first3=Jason |last4=Hayes |first4=Steven C. |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=741–56 |pmid=23046777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A 2008 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence was still too limited for ACT to be considered a supported treatment, and raised methodological concerns about the research base.&lt;ref name="Ost2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2007.12.005 |title=Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: A systematic review and meta-analysis |year=2008 |last=Öst |first=Lars-Göran |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=296–321 |pmid=18258216}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 meta-analysis found that ACT was more effective than placebo and "treatment as usual" for most problems (with the exception of anxiety and depression), but not more effective than CBT and other traditional therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Powers MB, Zum Vörde Sive Vörding MB, Emmelkamp PM | year = 2009 | title = Acceptance and commitment therapy: A meta-analytic review. | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 78 | pages = 73–80 | doi=10.1159/000190790}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 meta-analysis was more positive and reported that ACT outperformed CBT, except for treating depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruiz, F. J. | year = 2012 | title = Acceptance and commitment therapy versus traditional cognitive behavioral therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current empirical evidence | journal = International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 review found that ACT was better than placebo and typical treatment for [[anxiety disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="davis2015"/&gt; Its effectiveness was similar to traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&lt;ref name="davis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A-Tjak|first1=JG|last2=Davis|first2=ML|last3=Morina|first3=N|last4=Powers|first4=MB|last5=Smits|first5=JA|last6=Emmelkamp|first6=PM|title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for clinically relevant mental and physical health problems.|journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics|date=2015|volume=84|issue=1|pages=30–6|pmid=25547522|doi=10.1159/000365764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggested that the CBT comparison of the previous 2012 meta-analysis may have been compromised by the inclusion of [[Randomized controlled trial|nonrandomized trials]] with small sample sizes. They also noted that research methodologies had improved since the studies described in the 2008 meta-analysis.&lt;ref name="davis2015" /&gt;

The number of [[randomized clinical trial]]s and controlled time series evaluating ACT for a variety of problems is growing. In 2006, only about 30 such studies were known,&lt;ref name=hayes06&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.06.006 |title=Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: Model, processes and outcomes |year=2006 |last1=Hayes |first1=Steven C. |last2=Luoma |first2=Jason B. |last3=Bond |first3=Frank W. |last4=Masuda |first4=Akihiko |last5=Lillis |first5=Jason |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=44 |pages=1–25 |pmid=16300724 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 the number had approximately doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruiz |first=F. J. |year=2010 |title=A review of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) empirical evidence: Correlational, experimental psychopathology, component and outcome studies |journal=International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=125–62 |url=http://www.ijpsy.com/volumen10/num1/256.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website of the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] states that there were 171 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ACT published as of December 2016,&lt;ref name="ACBS evidence"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayes |first=Steven C. |authorlink=Steven C. Hayes |url=https://contextualscience.org/state_of_the_act_evidence |title=State of the ACT Evidence |website=contextualscience.org |publisher=[[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] |accessdate=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 20 meta-analyses and 45 mediational studies of the ACT literature as of Spring 2016.&lt;ref name="ACBS evidence"/&gt; Most studies of ACT so far have been conducted on adults and therefore the knowledge of its effectiveness when applied to children and adolescents is limited.

==Similarities==
ACT, [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] (FAP), [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) and other acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches are commonly grouped under the name "the third wave of cognitive behavior therapy".&lt;ref name="Ost2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Christopher R. |last=Martell |author2=Michael E. Addis|author3=Neil S. Jacobson |year=2001 |title=Depression in Context: Strategies for Guided Action |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-70350-9 |location=New York |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave, [[behaviour therapy]], commenced in the 1920s based on Pavlov's [[Classical conditioning|classical (respondent) conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]] that was correlated to reinforcing consequences. The second wave emerged in the 1970s and included cognition in the form of irrational beliefs, dysfunctional attitudes or depressogenic attributions.&lt;ref name="Leahy, R. L. 2004"&gt;Leahy, R. L. (2004). Contemporary cognitive therapy: Theory, research, and practice. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s empirical limitations and philosophical misgivings of the second wave gave rise to Steven Hayes' ACT theory which modified the focus of abnormal behaviour away from the content or form towards the context in which it occurs.&lt;ref name="Leahy, R. L. 2004"/&gt; ACT research has suggested that many of the [[Defence mechanisms|emotional defenses]] individuals use with conviction to try to solve their problems actually entangle humans into greater suffering. Rigid ideas about themselves, lack of focus on what is important in their life and struggling to change sensations, feelings or thoughts that are troublesome only serve to create greater distress.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S. C., &amp; Smith, S. (2005). Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Santa Rosa, CA: New Harbinger Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven C. Hayes]] described this group in his [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|ABCT]] President Address as follows:

{{quote|Grounded in an empirical, principle-focused approach, the third wave of behavioral and cognitive therapy is particularly sensitive to the context and functions of psychological phenomena, not just their form, and thus tends to emphasize contextual and experiential change strategies in addition to more direct and didactic ones. These treatments tend to seek the construction of broad, flexible and effective repertoires over an eliminative approach to narrowly defined problems, and to emphasize the relevance of the issues they examine for clinicians as well as clients. The third wave reformulates and synthesizes previous generations of behavioral and cognitive therapy and carries them forward into questions, issues, and domains previously addressed primarily by other traditions, in hopes of improving both understanding and outcomes.}}

ACT has also been adapted to create a non-therapy version of the same processes called ''Acceptance and Commitment Training''. This training process, oriented towards the development of mindfulness, acceptance, and valued skills in non-clinical settings such as businesses or schools, has also been investigated in a handful of research studies with good preliminary results.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Bond, F.W.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Austin, J. (2007). Acceptance And Mindfulness at Work: Applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy And Relational Frame Theory to Organizational Behavior Management. Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is somewhat similar to the awareness–management movement in business training programs, where [[mindfulness]] and [[cognitive-shifting]] techniques are employed.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The emphasis of ACT on ongoing present moment [[awareness]], valued directions and committed action is similar to other psycho-therapeutic approaches that, unlike ACT, are not as focused on outcome research or consciously linked to a basic behavioral science program, including approaches such as [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Morita therapy]] and Voice Dialogue, [[Internal Family Systems Model|IFS]] and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Wilson, Hayes &amp; Byrd explore at length the compatibilities between ACT and the [[12-step]] treatment of addictions and argue that, unlike most other psychotherapies, both approaches can be implicitly or explicitly integrated due to their broad commonalities. Both approaches endorse acceptance as an alternative to unproductive control. ACT emphasizes the hopelessness of relying on ineffectual strategies to control private experience, similarly the 12-step approach emphasizes the acceptance of powerlessness over addiction. Both approaches encourage a broad life-reorientation, rather than a narrow focus on the elimination of substance use, and both place great value on the long-term project of building of a meaningful life aligned with the clients' values. ACT and 12-step both encourage the pragmatic utility of cultivating a transcendent sense of self ([[higher power]]) within an unconventional, individualized spirituality. Finally they both openly accept the paradox that acceptance is a necessary condition for change and both encourage a playful awareness of the limitations of human thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exploring Compatibilities Between Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and 12-Step Treatment for Substance Abuse|doi=10.1023/A:1007835106007 |year=2000 |last1=Wilson |first1=Kelly G. |last2=Hayes |first2=Steven C. |last3=Byrd |first3=Michelle R. |journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive and Cognitive-Behavior Therapy |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=209–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Some published empirical studies in clinical psychology have argued that ACT is not different from other interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.09.003 |title=Acceptance and mindfulness-based therapy: New wave or old hat? |year=2008 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Asmundson |first2=Gordon J.G. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=28 |pages=1–16 |pmid=17904260 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00137.x |title=Acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: Different treatments, similar mechanisms? |year=2008 |last1=Arch |first1=Joanna J. |last2=Craske |first2=Michelle G. |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=263–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stefan Hofmann]] argued that ACT is similar to the much older [[Morita therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofmann |first=Stefan G. |date=December 2008 |title=Acceptance and commitment therapy: new wave or Morita therapy? |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=280–285 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00138.x |quote=the criticism offered by ACT against CBT is based on a misrepresentation of the empirical evidence. Moreover, the strategies of ACT are not specific to the theory and philosophy underlying ACT. There are considerable similarities between ACT and Eastern holistic approaches, such as Morita therapy, which was developed 80 years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis by Öst in 2008 concluded that ACT did not yet qualify as an "empirically supported treatment", that the research methodology for ACT was less stringent than cognitive behavioral therapy, and that the mean effect size was moderate.&lt;ref name="Ost2008"/&gt; Supporters of ACT have challenged those conclusions by showing that the quality difference in Öst's review was accounted for by the larger number of funded trials in the CBT comparison group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.07.020 |title=Öst's (2008) methodological comparison of clinical trials of acceptance and commitment therapy versus cognitive behavior therapy: Matching apples with oranges? |year=2009 |last1=Gaudiano |first1=Brandon A. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=47 |issue=12 |pages=1066–70 |pmid=19679300 |pmc=2786237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several concerns, both theoretical and empirical, have arisen in response to the ascendancy of ACT. One major theoretical concern is that the primary authors of ACT and of the corresponding theories of human behavior, relational frame theory (RFT) and functional contextualism (FC), recommend their approach as the proverbial holy grail of psychological therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Routier |first=Cédric P. |date=2007 |title=Relational frame theory (RFT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): Emperor's tailors or knights of the holy grail? |journal=Acta Comportamentalia |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=45–69 |url=http://pepsic.bvsalud.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0188-81452007000400004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[James C. Coyne]], in a discussion of "disappointments and embarrassments in the branding of psychotherapies as evidence supported", said: "Whether or not ACT is more efficacious than other therapies, as its proponents sometimes claim, or whether it is efficacious for psychosis, is debatable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyne |first=James C. |authorlink=James C.

Psychologist Jonathan W. Kanter said that Hayes and colleagues "argue that empirical clinical psychology is hampered in its efforts to alleviate human suffering and present ''contextual behavioral science'' (CBS) to address the basic philosophical, theoretical and methodological shortcomings of the field. CBS represents a host of good ideas but at times the promise of CBS is obscured by excessive promotion of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and demotion of earlier cognitive and behavior change techniques in the absence of clear logic and empirical support."&lt;ref name="Kanter"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kanter |first=Jonathan W. |date=June 2013 |title=The vision of a progressive clinical science to guide clinical practice |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=228–233 |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2010.07.006 |pmid=23611073 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Kanter2/publication/236275068_The_vision_of_a_progressive_clinical_science_to_guide_clinical_practice/links/00b7d5214dc7c2fe16000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kanter concluded that "the ideas of CBS, RFT, and ACT deserve serious consideration by the mainstream community and have great potential to shape a truly progressive clinical science to guide clinical practice."&lt;ref name="Kanter"/&gt;

ACT currently appears to be about as effective as standard CBT, with some meta-analyses showing small differences in favor of ACT and others not. For example, a meta-analysis published by Francisco Ruiz in 2012 looked at 16 studies comparing ACT to standard CBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruiz Jiménez |first=Francisco José |date=2012 |title=Acceptance and commitment therapy versus traditional cognitive behavioral therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current empirical evidence |journal=International Journal of Psychology and Psychological Therapy |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=333–358 |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4019738}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACT failed to separate from CBT on effect sizes for depression, anxiety or quality of life. The author did find separation between ACT and CBT on the "primary outcome"&amp;nbsp;– a heterogeneous class of 14 separate outcome measures that were aggregated into the effect size analysis. This analysis however is limited by the highly heterogeneous nature of the outcome variables used in the analysis, which has the tendency to increase the number needed to treat (NNT) to replicate the effect size reported. More limited measures, such as depression, anxiety and quality of life decrease the NNT, making the analysis more clinically relevant, and on these measures ACT did not outperform CBT.

A 2013 paper comparing ACT to [[cognitive therapy]] (CT) concluded that "like CT, ACT cannot yet make strong claims that its unique and theory-driven intervention components are active ingredients in its effects."&lt;ref name="HerbertForman2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbert |first1=James D. |last2=Forman |first2=Evan M. |date=June 2013 |title=Caution: the differences between CT and ACT may be larger (and smaller) than they appear |journal=[[Behavior Therapy (journal)|Behavior Therapy]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=218–223 |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2009.09.005 |pmid=23611071}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the paper suggested that many of the assumptions of ACT and CT "are pre-analytical, and cannot be directly pitted against one another in experimental tests."&lt;ref name="HerbertForman2013"/&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]] is committed to research and development in the area of ACT, RFT, and contextual behavioral science more generally. As of 2017 it had over 7,600 members worldwide, about half outside of the United States. It holds annual "world conference" meetings: The 16th will be held in Montreal, in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contextualscience.org/conferences|title=Conferences|publisher=[[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International (ABAI) has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis ABA:I.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} ABAI has larger special interest groups for [[autism]] and [[behavioral medicine]]. ABAI serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twyman |first1=J.S. |year=2007 |title=A new era of science and practice in behavior analysis |journal=Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hassert |first1=Derrick L. |last2=Kelly |first2=Amanda N. |last3=Pritchard |first3=Joshua K. |last4=Cautilli |first4=Joseph D. |title=The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the Profession and the Public |journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=8–19 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ829086&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ829086 |doi=10.1037/h0100415 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABAI sponsors three conferences/year—one multi-track in the U.S., one specific to Autism and one international.

The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. ACT work is commonly presented at ABCT and other mainstream CBT organizations.

The [[British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies]] (BABCP) has a large special interest group in ACT, with over 1,200 members.

Doctoral-level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s (APA) Division 25—[[Behavior analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Behavior Analysis Division |url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-25/about/ |website=apadivisions.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACT has been called a "commonly used treatment with empirical support" within the APA-recognized specialty of behavioral and cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behavioral and Cognitive Psychology Public Description |url=https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/behav.aspx |website=apa.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18665">In psychology, agents are goal-directed entities that are able to monitor their environment to select and perform efficient means-ends actions that are available in a given situation to achieve an intended goal. Agency, therefore, implies the ability to [[Perception|perceive]] and to change the environment of the agent (similarly to an [[intelligent agent]] designed by humans), but crucially, it also entails intentionality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The intentional stance|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|date=1987|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262040938|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=15793656}}&lt;/ref&gt; to represent the goal-state in the future, equifinal variability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|last=Fritz.|first=Heider|date=2015|publisher=Martino Publ|isbn=9781614277958|location=Mansfield|oclc=1033711840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Csibra|first=Gergely|date=2008|title=Goal attribution to inanimate agents by 6.5-month-old infants|journal=Cognition|volume=107|issue=2|pages=705–717|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.001|pmid=17869235|issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be able to achieve the intended goal-state with different actions in different contexts, and rationality of actions in relation to their goal&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Nádasdy|first2=Zoltán|last3=Csibra|first3=Gergely|last4=Bíró|first4=Szilvia|date=1995|title=Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age|journal=Cognition|volume=56|issue=2|pages=165–193|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(95)00661-h|issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Y.|last2=Baillargeon|first2=R.|date=2005|title=Can a Self-Propelled Box Have a Goal?: Psychological Reasoning in 5-Month-Old Infants|url=|journal=Psychological Science|volume=16|issue=8|pages=601–608|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01582.x|pmid=16102062|pmc=3351378|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce the most efficient action available. [[Cognitive science|Cognitive]] scientists and psychologists thoroughly investigated agency attribution in humans and non-human animals, since social cognitive mechanisms as [[communication]], [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]], [[imitation]] or [[theory of mind]] presupposes the ability to identify agents and differentiate them from inanimate objects. This ability has also assumed to have a major effect on inferential and predictive processes of the observers of agents, because agentive entities are expected to perform [[Autonomy|autonomous]] behavior based on their current and previous knowledge and intentions, while inanimate objects are supposed to react to external [[Force|physical forces]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Leslie|first=Alan M.|date=1994|volume=|pages=119–148|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511752902.006|isbn=9780511752902|title=Mapping the mind|chapter=ToMM, ToBY, and Agency: Core architecture and domain specificity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is often confused, sensitivity to agency and the sense of agency are different concepts as the sensitivity to agency can be explained as a cognitive ability to identify agentive entities in the environment, while the [[sense of agency]] refers to the sense of control and sometimes to [[self-efficacy]], which is a learnt belief of an individual about his or her own ability to succeed in specific situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1982|title=Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1982-25814-001|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=122–147|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.2.122|issn=0003-066X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches of agency ==
According to Carey and Spelke&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=Domain-specific knowledge and conceptual change|date=1994|work=Mapping the mind|volume=|pages=169–200|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511752902.008|isbn=9780511752902|last2=Spelke|first2=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cognitive models explaining specific [[Perception|perceptual]] and representational abilities, for instance the models of agency recognition, can be separated into two different classes. The ''feature-based models'' of agency assume that the perceptual input of an observer consist of featural and behavioral cues that help to identify agents. Previous studies show that even very young human observers are sensitive to

However, neither of these cues are necessary and sufficient to identify an agent&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, since unfamiliar, novel entities like animated figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6015048|pmid=29934630}}&lt;/ref&gt; or robots without human features&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; can elicit agency attribution in humans. Therefore, cognitive models belonging to the ''principle-based approaches''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; were designed to describe how humans perceive agency assuming that the detection of agency is not a precondition, but a consequence of inferential processes about potentially agentive objects.

The theory of teleological stance&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|date=2003|title=Teleological reasoning in infancy: the naı̈ve theory of rational action|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303001281|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=287–292|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00128-1|pmid=12860186|issn=1364-6613|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.331.5767}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that from 12-month of age humans can apply the principle of rational action to determine, whether the observed entity is an agent or an inanimate object expecting that an agent behaves rationally in order to achieve its goal in a given situation. The theory assumes that the rationality principle makes observers able to relate the action, the represented goal-state and the current situational constraints to decide whether an object is an agent. For instance, if infants had learnt that an abstract, unfamiliar agent (an animated circle on a display) approaches another entity by jumping over an obstacle, when the obstacle had been removed, they expected a new, but highly rational behavior from the agent to approach the other entity via a straight pathway. In contrast, when infants were shown that the unfamiliar entity always made a detour when approaching its goal-object exhibiting non-justifiable behavior of jumping in the absence of an obstacle, they did not expect a rational of choice of behavior when the situational constraints changed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These results and later empirical studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biro|first=Szilvia|title=The role of behavioral cues in understanding goal-directed actions in infancy|volume=164|date=2007|journal=Progress in Brain Research|pages=303–322|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)64017-5|pmid=17920439|isbn=9780444530165|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|last3=Gergely|first3=György}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Csibra|first=Gergely|date=2008|title=Goal attribution to inanimate agents by 6.5-month-old infants|journal=Cognition|volume=107|issue=2|pages=705–717|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.001|pmid=17869235|issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Yuyan|date=2010-09-06|title=Three-month-old infants attribute goals to a non-human agent|journal=Developmental Science|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=453–460|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00995.x|issn=1363-755X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Laura|last2=Carey|first2=Susan|date=2005-01-01|title=12-Month-Old Infants Represent Probable Endings of Motion Events|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0701_6|issn=1525-0008|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.2588}}&lt;/ref&gt; underpinned that agency recognition in humans can be explained by principle-based models rather than simple perceptual cues. As Gergely and Csibra concluded&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; from 12-month of age humans “can take the teleological stance to interpret actions as means to goals, can evaluate the relative efficiency of means by applying the principle of rational action, and can generate systematic inferences to identify relevant aspects of the situation to justify the action as an efficient means even when these aspects are not directly visible to them".

== Types of agents ==
It was proposed&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=Gergely|first=György|date=2010-07-15|pages=76–105|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444325485.ch3|isbn=9781444325485|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Childhood Cognitive Development|chapter=Kinds of Agents: The Origins of Understanding Instrumental and Communicative Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the concept of agency involves different kinds of agents represented by independent cognitive systems in humans and perhaps in non-human species as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Csík|first2=Andor|last3=Lovas|first3=Kata|last4=Gergely|first4=György|last5=Topál|first5=József|date=2017|title=The attribution of navigational- and goal-directed agency in dogs (Canis familiaris) and human toddlers (Homo sapiens).|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=131|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1037/com0000053|pmid=28182482|issn=1939-2087|url=http://real.mtak.hu/79227/1/2017_Tauzin_etal_JoCP_accepted_manuscript_u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the species-specific social environment allows to identify agents either based on non-communicative observation of their rational, goal-directed actions or by relying on their communicative behavior which they exchange with other agents. In non-human species, however, none of these types of input information are necessary, since unfamiliar agents can be recognized simply on the basis of their perceptual abilities, which has context-dependent effect on their behavior even in the absence a visible goal-object that may be required to assess the efficiency of goal-approach.

=== Instrumental agency ===
According to Gergely&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; instrumental agents are intentional agents that exhibit actions in order to realize their goal states in the environment. The recognition of instrumental agents is investigated by numerous experiments in human infants&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biro|first=Szilvia|title=The role of behavioral cues in understanding goal-directed actions in infancy|volume=164|date=2007|journal=Progress in Brain Research|pages=303–322|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)64017-5|pmid=17920439|isbn=9780444530165|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|last3=Gergely|first3=György}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Csibra|first=Gergely|last2=Bíró|first2=Szilvia|last3=Koós|first3=Orsolya|last4=Gergely|first4=György|date=2003|title=One-year-old infants use teleological representations of actions productively|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=111–133|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2701_4|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and also in non-human apes.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochat|first=Magali J.|last2=Serra|first2=Elisabetta|last3=Fadiga|first3=Luciano|last4=Gallese|first4=Vittorio|date=2008|title=The Evolution of Social Cognition: Goal Familiarity Shapes Monkeys' Action Understanding|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=227–232|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.12.021|pmid=18221878|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uller|first=Claudia|date=2003-12-18|title=Disposition to recognize goals in infant chimpanzees|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=154–61|doi=10.1007/s10071-003-0204-9|pmid=14685823|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Justin N.|last2=Glynn|first2=David D.|last3=Phillips|first3=Brenda C.|last4=Hauser|first4=Marc D.|date=2007-09-07|title=The Perception of Rational, Goal-Directed Action in Nonhuman Primates|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1402|journal=Science|language=en|volume=317|issue=5843|pages=1402–1405|doi=10.1126/science.1144663|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17823353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communicative agency ===
In contrast to instrumental agents, communicative agents&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gergely|first=György|title=Reasoning about Instrumental and Communicative Agency in Human Infancy|date=2012|work=Rational Constructivism in Cognitive Development|pages=59–94|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-397919-3.00003-4|isbn=9780123979193|last2=Jacob|first2=Pierre|url=https://jeannicod.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ijn_00756294/file/Gergely_Jacob_2012_in_Rational_Constructivism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are intentional agents whose actions are performed to bring about a specific change in the mental representations of the addressee, for instance by providing new and relevant information. The recognition of communicative agency may allow for the observer to predict that communicative information transfer can have a relevant effect on the behavior of the agent, even if the interacting agents and their communicative signals are unfamiliar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6015048|pmid=29934630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navigational agency ===
The [[Construals|construal]] of navigational agency is based on the assumption that Leslie’s theory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; on agency implies two different types of distal sensitivity; distal sensitivity in space and distal sensitivity in time. While goal-directed instrumental agents need both of these abilities to represent a goal-state in the future and achieve it in a rational and efficient manner, navigational agents are supposed to have only perceptual abilities, that is a distal sensitivity in space to avoid collision with objects in their environments. A study&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; contrasting the ability of dogs and human infants to attribute agency to unfamiliar self-propelled object showed that dogs – unlike human infants – may lack the capability to recognize instrumental agents, however they can identify navigational agents.

== Agency recognition in non-human animals ==
The ability to represent the efficiency of goal-directed actions of an instrumental agent may be a phylogenetically ancient core cognitive mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origin of concepts|last=Susan.|first=Carey|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195367638|location=Oxford|oclc=233697385}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be found in non-human primates as well. Previous research provided evidence for this assumption showing that this sensitivity affects the expectations of cotton-top tamarins, rhesus macaques, and chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Non-human apes are able to make inferences about the goal of an instrumental agent by taking the environmental constraints that can guide the agents’ actions into account. Moreover, it seems that non-human species like dogs can recognize contingent reactivity as an abstract of cue of agency, and respond to contingent agent significantly different in contrast to inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Kovács|first2=Krisztina|last3=Topál|first3=József|date=2016-07-19|title=Dogs Identify Agents in Third-Party Interactions on the Basis of the Observed Degree of Contingency|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1061–1068|doi=10.1177/0956797616647518|pmid=27268590|issn=0956-7976|url=http://real.mtak.hu/79227/1/2017_Tauzin_etal_JoCP_accepted_manuscript_u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=Anna|last2=Petró|first2=Eszter|last3=Topál|first3=József|last4=Miklósi|first4=Ádám|date=2013-08-28|title=What Are You or Who Are You?

'''''Always Becoming''''' is an artwork created in 2007 by [[Nora Naranjo-Morse]] (born 1953), a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Pottery|Potter]] and [[poet]]. She currently resides in [[Española, New Mexico|Española]], [[New Mexico]], just north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and is a member of the [[Santa Clara Pueblo]].

==Description==

The sculpture consists of five separate sculptures, that make up a family.

Grounded in figures from [[Santa Clara Pueblo]] oral tradition the sculptures are named:
* Father
* Mother
* Little one
* Moon Woman
* Mountain Bird

The sculptures were built in-situ over the summer of 2007, Nora Naranjo-Morse worked with her niece Athena Swentzell Steen and her husband Bill Steen who are experts at building structures with natural material, and the family of Don Juan Morales ([[Tepehuan]]) from the Mexican state of  [[Durango]], as well as many volunteers including museum staff and visitors.

{{quote|Being strangers at the beginning of this journey, we came from distant places with the intent to build sculptures, and in the process built a family as well.|Nora Naranajo-Morse, 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/alwaysbecoming/AlwaysBecoming.html|title=NMAI: NORA NARANJO-MORSE-ALWAYS BECOMING MALL SCULPTURE PROJECT|website=www.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Materials==

The Sculptures are made entirely of natural materials: dirt, sand, straw, clay, stone, black locust wood, bamboo, grass, and yam vines. These natural elements were selected to take on a life of their own and thus affect the sculptures over time. In this way the materials ensure the forms are 'always becoming'.

==Dimensions==

The five sculptures range in size from seven and a half to sixteen feet tall.

==History and Location==

On May 24, 2006, the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] announced that Naranjo-Morse had won its outdoor sculpture design competition. "Always Becoming" was selected unanimously from more than 55 entries submitted by Native artists from throughout the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/press/releases/2006-05-24_outdoor_sculpture_release_final_1.pdf|title=Press {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|website=www.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2007, on the grounds of the National Museum of the American Indian, [[Washington, DC]], Naranjo-Morse built a family of clay sculptures. The commissioned work is located on the 'Native landscape' at the museum's south entrance on Maryland Avenue S.W. near 4th Street and Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C.

A public dedication, officially opening these public works of art, took place on September 1, 2007.

The sculptures are intended to disintegrate over time, and the lives of sculptures from the initial idea through the continued process of [[stewardship]] are being documented by Filmmaker Dax Thomas ([[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]/[[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]]). As the sculptures disintegrate the films of their life will form a more permanent record of their existence and are therefore an essential part of the artistic process, and the work of art itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/quatica|title=quatica|website=Vimeo|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Native culture and the environment served as the inspiration for the sculpture design.  'Always Becoming' will reflect themes of growth and adaptation and represent indigenous peoples' unique relationship to the environment, ...

The sculpture's metaphor of home and family not only conveys a universal theme to all peoples, but also enhances the visitors' experience that they have entered a Native place when they {{sic|step foot}} on the museum grounds.|Nora Naranajo-Morse, 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caneloproject.com/pages/currrent%20projects/smithsonian.html|title=always becoming|website=www.caneloproject.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

'''Asemic writing''' is a [[word]]less open [[Semantics|semantic]] form of [[writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postasemicpress.blogspot.com/2017/04/works-interviews-by-michael-jacobson-is.html|author=Michael Jacobson|title=Works &amp; Interviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asemic.net/|title=Tim Gaze. Asemic Magazine|work=Asemic Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/11/tim-gaze/|title=Full Of Crow Tim Gaze interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''asemic'' means "having no specific semantic content", or "without the smallest unit of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;From [[Greek language|Greek]]: asemos (αόεμoβ) = without sign, unmarked, obscure, or ignoble.&lt;/ref&gt; With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of this is similar to the way one would deduce meaning from an [[abstract art|abstract work of art]]. Where asemic writing differs from abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that fuses [[Writing|text]] and [[image]] into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to [[free writing]] or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across [[linguistic]] understanding; an asemic text may be "read" in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/satu-kaikkonen-1-1.php|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|title=Satu Kaikkonen interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple meanings for the same [[symbol]]ism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have [[zero]] meaning, [[infinity|infinite]] meanings, or its meaning can [[Evolution (term)|evolve]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samplekanon.com/?p=1946/|title=Samplekannon interview with Michael Jacobson|work=Samplekannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to [[translate]] and [[Exploration|explore]] an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.

In 1997 [[Visual poetry|visual poets]] Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first applied the word ''asemic'' to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galatearesurrects2018.blogspot.com/2018/02/featured-essay-by-jim-leftwich.html|title=Galatea Resurrects: The Nearness Of Asemic Writing by Jim Leftwich}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then began to distribute them to [[poetry]] [[magazines]] both [[online]] and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual [[asemia]] as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has blossomed into a worldwide literary/[[art movement]]. It has especially grown in the early part of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. He has begun to use the term "pansemic" to describe this type of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slowforward.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/jim-leftwich-asemic-writing-definitions-and-contexts-1998-2016/|title=Jim Leftwich: “asemic writing definitions and contexts, 1998-2016”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as author [[Travis Jeppesen]] have found the term ''asemic'' to be problematic because "it seems to infer writing with no meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleek-mag.com/2016/12/02/hans-ulrich-obrist-zhang-jeppesen-miralda/|title=Hans Ulrich Obrist in Conversation About Inventing New Languages|work=Sleek Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of asemic writing==
[[File:Crazyzhangxu.jpg|thumb|An example of Zhang Xu's calligraphy]]

Asemic writing exists in many different forms. It is often created with a [[pen]] or [[brush]], but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by [[photography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/arts-and-entertainment/2018-04-03-cape-town-artist-andrew-van-der-merwe-carves-out-beach-calligraphy-niche/|title=Cape Town artist Andrew van der Merwe carves out beach calligraphy niche|work=BusinessDay|author=Thelma Mort}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to works on [[canvas]], [[paper]], [[computer]] images, and [[animations]]. The key to asemic writing is that even though it is traditionally "unreadable" it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's [[eye]]. Various asemic writing includes [[pictograms]], or [[ideograms]] the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an [[abstract expressionist]] scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehandstand.org/archive//january2006/articles/nonismacemicart.htm|author=Jaime Morrison|title=Nonism: Asemic Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2005/11/varieties-of-visual-poetry.html|title=Varieties of Visual Poetry|work=dbqp|author=Geof Huth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often [[calligraphic]] in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2005/11/varieties-of-visual-poetry.html|title=Varieties of Visual Poetry|work=dbqp|author=Geof Huth}}&lt;/ref&gt; or can be understood through aesthetic intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postasemicpress.blogspot.com/2017/04/works-interviews-by-michael-jacobson-is.html|author=Michael Jacobson|title=Works &amp; Interviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. [[ciphers]], [[wildstyle]], etc.). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/08/michael-jacobson/|title=PRATE, Michael Jacobson interview|publisher=Fullofcrow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influences on asemic writing are illegible, [[Constructed language|invented]], or primal [[manuscript|script]]s ([[cave painting]]s, [[doodle]]s, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global [[Postliterate society|postliterate]] style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are [[alien language in science fiction|alien languages in science fiction]], [[artistic languages]], [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] (magick), [[undeciphered scripts]], and [[graffiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/special-sections/cryptotexts/michael-jacobson-interview#.VBCXA2Nrucs|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|title=Michael Jacobson interview| accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uses for asemic writing include mental and [[Creativity|creative]] [[idea]] stimulation, [[non-verbal communication]], [[hoaxes]], and general authorial self-expression.

===History===

Offset printing, 440 copies.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Asemic writing occurs in [[avant-garde]] literature and art with strong roots in the [[Proto-writing|earliest forms of writing]]. The history of today's asemic movement stems from two [[China|Chinese]] calligraphers: "crazy" [[Zhang Xu]], a [[Tang Dynasty]] (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger "drunk" [[monk]] [[Huaisu]] who also excelled at illegible [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforbookarts.blogspot.com/2014/07/making-sense-of-asemic-writing.html|title=Center for Book Arts: Making Sense of Asemic Writing|author=Sarah Nicholls|publisher=Centerforbookarts.blogspot.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese people|Japanese]] calligraphers subsequently expanded upon Chinese abstract calligraphic expression by [[Hitsuzendō]] (the way of [[Zen]] through brush), allowing their works to move past formal presentation and "breathe with the vitality of eternal experience". During the 18th century the [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Laurence Sterne]] included asemic lines in his novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759), adding the graphic device to help tell the [[Narrative|story]] "in a tolerably straight line". In the 1920s [[Man Ray]], who was influenced by [[Dada]], created an early work of wordless writing with his poem ''[[Paris]], Mai 1924'', which is nothing more than dashes on a page. Later in the 1920s, [[Henri Michaux]], who was influenced by Asian calligraphy, [[Surrealism]], and [[Automatic writing]], began to create wordless works such as ''Alphabet'' (1925) and ''Narration'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natalieferrisdotcom.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/leaking-the-squalls-the-art-and-letters-of-henri-michaux/|title=‘Leaking the Squalls': The Art and Letters of Henri Michaux|work=natalie ferris|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as "interior Gestures". The writer and artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]] was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece ''Indian Story'' (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is [[Brion Gysin]] (whose calligraphy was influenced by [[Arabic]] and Japanese calligraphy), [[Isidore Isou]] (who founded [[Lettrisme]]), [[Cy Twombly]] (a former US Army [[Cryptologist]]), and [[Morita Shiryū]]/[[Bokujin-kai]] Group (Ink Human Society)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vermillionmedia.blogspot.com/2013/08/calligraphy-bokujin-kai-group-and.html|title= Calligraphy The Bokujin-Kai Group and Shiryu Morita|publisher=infinity of utterances kathryn simon phd}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom expanded writing into illegible, abstract, and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. [[Mira Schendel]] was an artist from [[Brazil]] who created many illegible works over the course of her life, for example her piece ''Archaic Writing'' (1964). [[Mirtha Dermisache]] is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/witness-mirtha-dermisache|title=Witness Mirtha Dermisache|publisher=Jacket2.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when [[:fr:Alain Satié|Alain Satié]] released his work ''Écrit en prose ou L'Œuvre hypergraphique'' which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Satie, Écrit en Prose, Éditions PSI, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[León Ferrari]] was another artist/poet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as ''Escritura'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printmag.com/illustration/the-writing-of-art-the-art-of-writing/|author=Buzz Poole|title=The Writing of Art, The Art of Writing|publisher=Printmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1974 saw the release of [[Max Ernst]]'s work ''Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage à Dorothea Tanning''; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and [[Derek Beaulieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullofcrow.com/prate/2009/08/michael-jacobson/|title=PRATE|publisher=Fullofcrow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roland Barthes]] was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-écritures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/12/05/vispo/|title=Vispo|author=Tierra Innovation|publisher=Theparisreview.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drawingsonwriting.org/page25.htm|title=Drawings on Writing|publisher=Drawingsonwriting.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of asemic writing is [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]]'s ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'' (1981). Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the [[Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles]] held on May 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Stanley|date=2010|title=To Read Images Not Words: Computer-Aided Analysis of the Handwriting in the Codex Seraphinianus (MSc dissertation)|publisher=North Carolina State University at Raleigh|pages=8–9|accessdate=9 April 2012|url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6460/1/etd.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s [[Chinese people|Chinese]] artist [[Xu Bing]] created ''Tiānshū'', or ''[[A Book from the Sky]]'' which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crab.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/free-writing/|title=Free writing|work=stalker|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw artist [[Gu Wenda]] begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in [[Xi'an]] in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lacon4.wordpress.com/tag/asemic-writing-2/|title=asemic writing - Donna Tull|publisher=Lacon4.wordpress.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as "Calligraphy-ism" came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims to
develop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In [[Vietnam]] during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared. To this group of young artists, “Wordless” means that which cannot be said, that which is both before and beyond the specificity of naming. To be without words is saying nothing and saying everything.

===Specialized publications===
2013 saw the release of ''An Anthology of Asemic Handwriting'' (Uitgeverij), which has over a hundred artists represented from many corners of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverij.cc/product/an-anthology-of-asemic-handwriting/ |title=An Anthology Of Asemic Handwriting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asemic writing has also received mention and space in ''The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008'' ([[Fantagraphics]], 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/lastvispoanthology/ |title=The Last Vispo Anthology|work= Crag Hill &amp; Nico Vassilakis (editors)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a full issue of [[William Allegrezza]]'s poetry journal ''Moria'' was focused on the participants and theory of asemic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moriapoetry.com/i134v141.html|title=moria|publisher=Moriapoetry.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, John Moore Williams published an asemic issue of his journal ''The Bleed.''

Satu Kaikkonen, a contemporary asemic artist/writer from [[Finland]], had this to say about asemic writing:

{{Quotation|As a creator of asemics, I consider myself an explorer and a global storyteller. Asemic art, after all, represents a kind of language that's universal and lodged deep within our unconscious minds. Regardless of language identity, each human's initial attempts to create written language look very similar and, often, quite asemic. In this way, asemic art can serve as a sort of common language—albeit an abstract, post-literate one—that we can use to understand one another regardless of background or nationality. For all its limping-functionality, semantic language all too often divides and asymmetrically empowers while asemic texts can't help but put people of all literacy-levels and identities on equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/satu-kaikkonen-1-1.php|title=SCRIPTjr.nl|work=SCRIPTjr.nl|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Bruce Sterling]] comments about asemic writing on his [[Wired magazine]] blog ''Beyond the Beyond'': {{Quotation|Writing that doesn’t have any actual writing in it whatsoever. You would think that this must be some kind of ultimate literary frontier, a frozen [[Antarctica]] of writing entirely devoid of literary content, but I wonder.

What is “beyond asemic writing”? Maybe a neural brain-scan of an author *thinking about* asemic writing. Maybe *generative asemic writing*. Maybe “asemic biomimicry”. Maybe nanoasemic writing inscribed with atomic force microscopes by Artificial Intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/ |title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing |date=July 13, 2009 |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |work=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==False writing systems==
'''False writing systems''' are artificially constructed [[alphabet]]s or scripts used (sometimes within the context of a [[false document]]) to convey a degree of [[wikt:verisimilitude|verisimilitude]]. Examples of this include alien dialogue in comic strips, [[animated cartoons]], and [[graphic novel]]s (such as [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', and the ''[[Valérian and Laureline]]'' series).
The script in [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]]'s 1981 ''[[Codex Seraphinianus]]'' was confirmed by the author to have no occult meaning. The [[Voynich manuscript]], a mysterious work on which the ''Codex Seraphinianus'' was likely based, uses an [[undeciphered writing system]] that some speculated to be false.

[[File:Cartesian Product qtl1.svg|thumb|Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \times B&lt;/math&gt; of the sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A=\{x,y,z\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B=\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[set theory]] (and, usually, in other parts of [[mathematics]]), a '''Cartesian product''' is a [[mathematical operation]] that returns a [[set (mathematics)|set]] (or '''product set''' or simply '''product''') from multiple sets. That is, for sets ''A'' and ''B'', the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is the set of all [[ordered pair]]s {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} where {{nowrap|''a'' ∈ ''A''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ∈ ''B''}}. Products can be specified using [[set-builder notation]], e.g.
: &lt;math&gt;A\times B = \{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A \ \mbox{ and } \ b\in B\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=S.|title=Modern Algebra|page=6|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''rows'' × ''columns''}} is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form {{nowrap|(row value, column value)}}.

More generally, a Cartesian product of ''n'' sets, also known as an '''''n''-fold Cartesian product''', can be represented by an array of ''n'' dimensions, where each element is an ''n''-[[tuple]]. An ordered pair is a [[Tuple#Names for tuples of specific lengths|2-tuple or couple]].

The Cartesian product is named after [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartesian|date=2009|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=December 1, 2009|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cartesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose formulation of [[analytic geometry]] gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of [[direct product]].

== Examples ==

=== A deck of cards ===
[[File:Piatnikcards.jpg|thumb|Standard 52-card deck]]

An illustrative example is the [[standard 52-card deck]]. The [[Playing cards#Anglo-American|standard playing card]] ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {{nowrap|{♠, {{color|#c00000|♥}}, {{color|#c00000|♦}}, ♣} }} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 [[ordered pairs]], which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. 

{{nowrap|''Ranks'' × ''Suits''}} returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, {{color|#c00000|♥}}), (A, {{color|#c00000|♦}}), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, {{color|#c00000|♥}}), (2, {{color|#c00000|♦}}), (2, ♣)}.

{{nowrap|''Suits'' × ''Ranks''}} returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 6), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 5), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 4), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 3), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 2)}.

Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.

=== A two-dimensional coordinate system ===
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|Cartesian coordinates of example points]]

The main historical example is the [[Cartesian plane]] in [[analytic geometry]]. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, [[René Descartes]] assigned to each point in the plane a pair of [[real number]]s, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates, respectively (see picture). The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product {{nowrap|ℝ×ℝ}} with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.

== Most common implementation (set theory) ==
{{Main article|Implementation of mathematics in set theory}}

A formal definition of the Cartesian product from [[set theory|set-theoretical]] principles follows from a definition of [[ordered pair]]. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the [[Ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski definition]], is &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = \{\{x\},\{x, y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Under this definition, &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(X \cup Y))&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of that set, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[power set]] operator. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in [[ZFC]] follows from the axioms of [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], [[axiom of power set|power set]], and [[axiom schema of specification|specification]]. Since [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are usually defined as a special case of [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.

=== Non-commutativity and non-associativity ===
Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' be sets.

The Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is not [[commutative]],
: &lt;math&gt;A \times B \neq B \times A,&lt;/math&gt;
because the [[ordered pair]]s are reversed unless at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:&lt;ref name="cnx"/&gt;
* ''A'' is equal to ''B'', or
* ''A'' or ''B'' is the [[empty set]].

For example:
: ''A'' = {1,2}; ''B'' = {3,4}
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
:: ''B'' × ''A'' = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}

: ''A'' = ''B'' = {1,2}
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = ''B'' × ''A'' = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}

: ''A'' = {1,2}; ''B'' = ∅
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
:: ''B'' × ''A'' = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅


Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not [[associative]] (unless one of the involved sets is empty).
: &lt;math&gt;(A\times B)\times C \neq A \times (B \times C)&lt;/math&gt;
If for example ''A'' = {1}, then (''A'' × ''A'') × ''A'' = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = ''A'' × (''A'' × ''A'').

=== Intersections, unions, and subsets ===

The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] (see leftmost picture).
: &lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \times (C \cap D) = (A \times C) \cap (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="planetmath"&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=359|title=CartesianProduct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with [[Union (set theory)|union]] (see middle picture).
: &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \times (C \cup D) \neq (A \times C) \cup (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we have that:
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times C) \cup (B \times D) = [(A \setminus B) \times C] \cup [(A \cap B) \times (C \cup D)] \cup [(B \setminus A) \times D]&lt;/math&gt;

For the set difference we also have the following identity:
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times C) \setminus (B \times D) = [A \times (C \setminus D)] \cup [(A \setminus B) \times C] &lt;/math&gt;

Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (see rightmost picture):&lt;ref name="cnx"&gt;Singh, S. (August 27, 2009). ''Cartesian product''. Retrieved from the Connexions Web site: http://cnx.org/content/m15207/1.5/&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A \times (B \setminus C) = (A \times B) \setminus (A \times C),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times B)^\complement = (A^\complement \times B^\complement) \cup (A^\complement \times B) \cup (A \times B^\complement),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="planetmath"/&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A^\complement&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[absolute complement]] of ''A''.

Other properties related with [[subset]]s are:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{if } A \subseteq B \text{ then } A \times C \subseteq B \times C,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{if both } A,B \neq \emptyset \text{ then } A \times B \subseteq C \times D \iff A \subseteq C\text{ and } B \subseteq D.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartesian Product of Subsets. (February 15, 2011). ''ProofWiki''. Retrieved 05:06, August 1, 2011 from https://proofwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_Product_of_Subsets&amp;oldid=45868&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardinality ===
{{See also|Cardinal arithmetic}}

The [[cardinality]] of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: {{nowrap|1=''A'' = {a, b}}} and {{nowrap|1=''B'' = {5, 6}.}} Both set ''A'' and set ''B'' consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}}, results in a new set which has the following elements:
: ''A'' × ''B'' = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of ''A'' is paired with each element of ''B''. Each pair makes up one element of the output set.
The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case.
The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,
: |''A'' × ''B''| = |''A''| · |''B''|.
In this case, |''A'' × ''B''| = 4

Similarly
: |''A'' × ''B'' × ''C''| = |''A''| · |''B''| · |''C''|
and so on.

The set {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is [[infinite set|infinite]] if either ''A'' or ''B'' is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. (1998). A Crash Course in the Mathematics of Infinite Sets. ''St. John's Review, 44''(2), 35–59. Retrieved August 1, 2011, from http://www.mathpath.org/concepts/infinity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartesian products of several sets ==

=== &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-ary Cartesian product ===
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the '''''n''-ary Cartesian product''' over ''n'' sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the set

: &lt;math&gt;X_1\times\cdots\times X_n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_i \in X_i \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

of [[tuple|''n''-tuple]]s. If tuples are defined as [[Tuple#Tuples_as_nested_ordered_pairs|nested ordered pairs]], it can be identified with {{nowrap|(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''X&lt;sub&gt;n−1&lt;/sub&gt;'') × ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If a tuple is defined as a function on {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''n''} }} that takes its value at ''i'' to be the ''i''th element of the tuple, then the Cartesian product ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×...×''X''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of functions

: &lt;math&gt;\{ x:\{1,\ldots,n\}\to X_1\cup\ldots\cup X_n \ | \ x(i)\in X_i \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-ary Cartesian power ===
The '''Cartesian square''' of a set ''X'' is the Cartesian product {{nowrap|1=''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X'' × ''X''}}.
An example is the 2-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R'''}} where '''R''' is the set of [[real number]]s: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}} where ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers (see the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]).

The ''' ''n''-ary Cartesian power''' of a set ''X'' can be defined as

: &lt;math&gt; X^n = \underbrace{ X \times X \times \cdots \times X }_{n}= \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \ | \ x_i \in X \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

An example of this is {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R''' × '''R'''}}, with '''R''' again the set of real numbers, and more generally '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The ''n''-ary cartesian power of a set ''X'' is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the space of functions from an ''n''-element set to ''X''.  As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of ''X'' may be taken to be a [[singleton set]], corresponding to the [[empty function]] with [[codomain]] ''X''.

=== Infinite Cartesian products ===
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly [[Infinity|infinite]]) [[indexed family]] of sets. If ''I'' is any [[index set]], and &lt;math&gt;\{X_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of sets indexed by ''I'', then the Cartesian product of the sets in ''X'' is defined to be 

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \left\{\left. f: I \to \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i) \in X_i)\right\},&lt;/math&gt; 

that is, the set of all functions defined on the [[index set]] such that the value of the function at a particular index ''i'' is an element of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Even if each of the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the [[axiom of choice]] (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.

For each ''j'' in ''I'', the function 
: &lt;math&gt;  \pi_{j}: \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_{j},&lt;/math&gt;
defined by &lt;math&gt;\pi_{j}(f) = f(j)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''j''th [[Projection (mathematics)|projection map]]'''.

'''Cartesian power''' is a Cartesian product where all the factors ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the same set ''X''. In this case, 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \prod_{i \in I} X&lt;/math&gt; 
is the set of all functions from ''I'' to ''X'', and is frequently denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;''. This case is important in the study of [[cardinal exponentiation]]. An important special case is when the index set is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[natural numbers]]: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ''i''th term in its corresponding set ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. For example, each element of 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{n = 1}^\infty \mathbb R = \mathbb R \times \mathbb R \times \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
can be visualized as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\omega&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Other forms ==

=== Abbreviated form ===
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, then some authors&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, M., and Rubinstein, A., 1994. ''A Course in Game Theory''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply &lt;big&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/big&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Cartesian product of functions ===
If ''f'' is a function from ''A'' to ''B'' and ''g'' is a function from ''X'' to ''Y'', their Cartesian product {{nowrap|''f'' × ''g''}} is a function from {{nowrap|''A'' × ''X''}} to {{nowrap|''B'' × ''Y''}} with
: &lt;math&gt;(f\times g)(a, x) = (f(a), g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be extended to [[tuple]]s and infinite collections of functions.
This is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.

=== Cylinder ===
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''cylinder'' of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;B \times A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

Normally, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then the cylinder of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definitions outside set theory ==

===Category theory===
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, [[category theory]] provides a more general interpretation of the [[product (category theory)|product]] of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] in category theory, which is a generalization of the [[fiber product]].

[[Exponential object|Exponentiation]] is the [[right adjoint]] of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a [[final object]]) is a [[Cartesian closed category]].

===Graph theory===
In [[graph theory]] the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product of two graphs]] ''G'' and ''H'' is the graph denoted by {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product {{nowrap|''V''(''G'') × ''V''(''H'')}} and such that two vertices (''u'',''v'') and (''u''′,''v''′) are adjacent in {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''u'' = ''u''′}} and ''v'' is adjacent with ''v''′ in ''H'', ''or'' {{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''v''′}} and ''u'' is adjacent with ''u''′ in ''G''.  The Cartesian product of graphs is not a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the sense of category theory.  Instead, the categorical product is known as the [[tensor product of graphs]].

{{Immanuel Kant}}

The '''categorical imperative''' ({{lang-de|kategorischer Imperativ}}) is the central [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept in the [[deontological]] [[Moral philosophy#Deontology|moral philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Introduced in Kant's 1785 ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'', it may be defined as a way of evaluating [[motivation]]s for action.

According to Kant, sentient beings occupy a special place in creation, and morality can be summed up in an imperative, or ultimate commandment of reason, from which all duties and obligations derive.  He defined an imperative as any proposition declaring a certain action (or inaction) to be necessary.

[[Hypothetical imperative]]s apply to someone who wishes to attain certain ends. For example:
* If I wish to quench my thirst, I must drink something.

A categorical imperative, on the other hand, denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself.  It is best known in its first formulation:

:'''Act only according to that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.'''&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Ellington |orig-year=1785 |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett |year=1993 |pages=30 |isbn=0-87220-166-X |ref=harv}}.

Kant expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the popular moral philosophy of his day, believing that it could never surpass the level of hypothetical imperatives: a [[utilitarian]] says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for those involved, but this is irrelevant to people who are concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for themselves.  Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgments against others, because the imperatives on which they are based rely too heavily on subjective considerations.  He presented a [[deontological]] moral system, based on the demands of the categorical imperative, as an alternative.

== Nature of the concept ==

The capacity that underlies deciding what is moral is called [[pure practical reason]], which is contrasted with [[pure reason]] (the capacity to know without having been shown) and mere [[practical reason]] (which allows us to interact with the world in experience).  [[Hypothetical imperative]]s tell us which means best achieve our ends.  They do not, however, tell us which ends we should choose.  The typical dichotomy in choosing ends is between ends that are "right" (e.g., helping someone) and those that are "good" (e.g., enriching oneself).  Kant considered the "right" superior to the "good"; to him, the "good" was morally irrelevant.  In Kant's view, a person cannot decide whether conduct is "right," or moral, through empirical means.  Such judgments must be reached [[a priori knowledge|''a priori'']], using pure practical reason.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Reason, separate from all empirical experience, can determine the principle according to which all ends can be determined as moral.  It is this fundamental principle of moral reason that is known as the categorical imperative.  Pure practical reason is the process of determining what ought to be done without reference to empirical contingent factors.  Moral questions are determined independent of reference to the particular subject posing them.  It is because morality is determined by pure practical reason, rather than particular empirical or sensuous factors, that morality is universally valid.  This [[moral universalism]] has come to be seen as the distinctive aspect of Kant's moral philosophy and has had wide social impact in the legal and political concepts of [[human rights]] and [[social equality|equality]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Freedom and autonomy ===
Kant viewed the human individual as a rationally self-conscious being with "impure" freedom of choice:

{{quote|text=The faculty of desire in accordance with concepts, in-so-far as the ground determining it to action lies within itself and not in its object, is called a faculty to "do or to refrain from doing as one pleases".  Insofar as it is joined with one's consciousness of the ability to bring about its object by one's action it is called ''choice'' (Willkür); if it is not joined with this consciousness its act is called a ''wish''.  The faculty of desire whose inner determining ground, hence even what pleases it, lies within the subject's reason is called the ''will'' (Wille).  The will is therefore the faculty of desire considered not so much in relation to action (as choice is) but rather in relation to the ground determining choice in action.  The will itself, strictly speaking, has no determining ground; insofar as it can determine choice, it is instead practical reason itself.

Insofar as reason can determine the faculty of desire as such, not only ''choice'' but also mere ''wish'' can be included under the will.  That choice which can be determined by ''pure reason'' is called free choice.  That which can be determined only by ''inclination'' (sensible impulse, ''stimulus'') would be animal choice (''arbitrium brutum'').  Human choice, however, is a choice that can indeed be ''affected'' but not ''determined'' by impulses, and is therefore of itself (apart from an acquired proficiency of reason) not pure but can still be determined to actions by pure will. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=Metaphysics of Morals, 6:213-4}}

For a will to be considered "free", we must understand it as capable of affecting causal power without being caused to do so. But the idea of lawless [[free will]], that is, a will acting without any causal structure, is incomprehensible. Therefore, a free will must be acting under laws that it gives to ''itself''.

Although Kant conceded that there could be no conceivable example of free will, because any example would only show us a will as it ''appears'' to us — as a subject of natural laws — he nevertheless argued against [[determinism]]. He proposed that determinism is logically inconsistent: the determinist claims that because ''A'' caused ''B'', and ''B'' caused ''C'', that ''A'' is the true cause of ''C''. Applied to a case of the human will, a determinist would argue that the will does not have causal power and that something outside the will causes the will to act as it does. But this argument merely assumes what it sets out to prove: viz. that the human will is part of the causal chain.

Secondly, Kant remarks that free will is ''inherently unknowable''. Since even a free person could not possibly have knowledge of their own freedom, we cannot use our failure to find a proof for freedom as evidence for a lack of it. The observable world could never contain an example of freedom because it would never show us a will as it appears to ''itself'', but only a will that is subject to natural laws imposed on it. But we do appear to ourselves as free.  Therefore, he argued for the idea of transcendental freedom &amp;mdash; that is, freedom as a presupposition of the question "what ''ought'' I to do?" This is what gives us sufficient basis for ascribing moral responsibility: the rational and self-actualizing power of a person, which he calls moral [[autonomy]]: "the property the will has of being a law unto itself."

==The First Formulation: Formula of Universality and  the Law of Nature==
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref name="Ellington"/&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;
From this step, Kant concludes that a moral proposition that is true must be one that is not tied to any particular conditions, including the identity and desires of the person making the moral deliberation. A moral maxim must imply absolute necessity, which is to say that it must be disconnected from the particular physical details surrounding the proposition, and could be applied to any rational being. This leads to the first formulation of the categorical imperative, sometimes called the "universalizability principle":&lt;ref&gt;e.g. T. N. Pelegrinis, ''Kant's Conceptions of the Categorical Imperative and the Will'' (1980), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"/&gt;

Closely connected with this formulation is the law of nature formulation. Because laws of nature are by definition universal, Kant claims we may also express the categorical imperative as:

*"Act as if the maxims of your action were to become through your will a '''universal law of nature'''." &lt;ref name="4:421"&gt;4:421&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant divides the duties imposed by this formulation into two sets of two subsets. The first division is between duties we have to ourselves versus duties we have to others.&lt;ref name="4:421"/&gt; For example, we have an obligation not to kill ourselves as well as an obligation not to kill others. Kant also, however, introduces a distinction between "perfect" and "imperfect" duties,&lt;ref name="4:421"/&gt; which requires more explanation:

===Perfect duty===
According to his reasoning, we first have a perfect duty not to act by maxims that result in logical contradictions when we attempt to universalize them. The moral proposition ''A'': "It is permissible to steal" would result in a contradiction upon universalisation. The notion of stealing presupposes the existence of private property, but were ''A'' universalized, then there could be no private property, and so the proposition has logically negated itself.

In general, perfect duties are those that are blameworthy if not met, as they are a basic required duty for a human being.

===Imperfect duty===
Second, we have imperfect duties, which are still based on pure reason, but which allow for desires in how they are carried out in practice. Because these depend somewhat on the subjective preferences of humankind, this duty is not as strong as a perfect duty, but it is still morally binding. As such, unlike perfect duties, you do not attract blame should you not complete an imperfect duty but you shall receive praise for it should you complete it, as you have gone beyond the basic duties and taken duty upon yourself.
Imperfect duties are circumstantial, meaning simply that you could not reasonably exist in a constant state of performing that duty.  This is what truly differentiates between perfect and imperfect duties, because imperfect duties are those duties that are never truly completed.  A particular example provided by Kant is the imperfect duty to cultivate one's own talents.&lt;ref&gt;4:423&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second Formulation: The Formula of Humanity==
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=36}}. 4:429.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

Every rational action must set before itself not only a principle, but also an end. Most ends are of a subjective kind, because they need only be pursued if they are in line with some particular hypothetical imperative that a person may choose to adopt. For an end to be objective, it would be necessary that we categorically pursue it.

The free will is the source of all rational action. But to treat it as a subjective end is to deny the possibility of freedom in general. Because the autonomous will is the one and only source of moral action, it would contradict the first formulation to claim that a person is merely a means to some other end, rather than always an end in themselves.

On this basis, Kant derives the second formulation of the categorical imperative from the first.

By combining this formulation with the first, we learn that a person has ''perfect duty'' not to use the humanity of themselves or others merely as a means to some other end. As a [[slavery|slave owner]] would be effectively asserting a moral right to own a person as a slave, they would be asserting a property right in another person. But this would violate the categorical imperative because it denies the basis for there to be free rational action at all; it denies the status of a person as an end in themselves. One cannot, on Kant's account, ever suppose a right to treat another person as a mere means to an end. In the case of a slave owner, the slaves are being used to cultivate the owner's fields (the slaves acting as the means) to ensure a sufficient harvest (the end goal of the owner).

The second formulation also leads to the ''imperfect duty'' to further the ends of ourselves and others. If any person desires perfection in themselves or others, it would be their moral duty to seek that end for all people equally, so long as that end does not contradict perfect duty.

==The Third Formulation: The Formula of Autonomy==
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Thus the third practical principle follows [from the first two] as the ultimate condition of their harmony with practical reason: the idea of ''the will of every rational being as a universally legislating will''.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=43}}. 4:431&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

Kant claims that the first formulation lays out the ''objective'' conditions on the categorical imperative: that it be universal in form and thus capable of becoming a law of nature. Likewise, the second formulation lays out ''subjective'' conditions: that there be certain ends in themselves, namely rational beings as such.&lt;ref&gt;4:431&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these two considerations is that we must will maxims that can be at the same time universal, but which do not impinge on the freedom of ourselves nor of others. A universal maxim, however, could only have this form if it were a maxim that each subject by himself endorsed. Because it cannot be something which externally constrains each subject's activity, it must be a constraint that each subject has set for himself. This leads to the concept of ''self''-legislation. Each subject must through his own use of reason will maxims which have the form of universality, but do not impinge on the freedom of others: thus each subject must will maxims that could be universally self-legislated.

The result, of course, is a formulation of the categorical imperative that contains much of the same as the first two. We must will something that we could at the same time freely will of ourselves. After introducing this third formulation, Kant introduces a distinction between ''[[autonomy]]'' (literally: self-law-giving) and ''[[heteronomy]]'' (literally: other-law-giving). This third formulation makes it clear that the categorical imperative requires autonomy. It is not enough that the right conduct be followed, but that one also demands that conduct of oneself.

==Other Formulations of the Categorical Imperative==

In the ''Groundwork'', Kant goes on to formulate the categorical imperative in a number of different ways following the first three; however, because Kant himself claims that there are only three principles,&lt;ref&gt;4:431-2; 4:435-6&lt;/ref&gt; little attention has been given to these other formulations. Moreover, they are often easily assimilated to the first three formulations, as Kant takes himself to be explicitly summarizing these earlier principles.&lt;ref&gt;These additional formulations, of which there are at least eight, can be seen at: 4:434 (1),4:436-7 (1), 4:437 (4), 4:438 (1), 4:438-9 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, one additional formulation that has received a lot of additional attention because it appears to introduce a social dimension into Kant's thought. This is the formulation of the "Kingdom of Ends":

===The Kingdom of Ends Formulation===
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref name=Kant43&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=44}}. 4:439&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

Because a truly autonomous will would not be subjugated to any interest, it would only be subject to those laws it makes for itself &amp;mdash; but it must also regard those laws as if they would be bound to others, or they would not be universalizable, and hence they would not be laws of conduct at all. Thus Kant presents the notion of the hypothetical [[Kingdom of Ends]] of which he suggests all people should consider themselves never solely as means but always as ends.

We ought to act only by maxims that would harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends. We have ''perfect duty'' not to act by maxims that create incoherent or impossible states of natural affairs when we attempt to universalize them, and we have ''imperfect duty'' not to act by maxims that lead to unstable or greatly undesirable states of affairs.

==Application==

Although Kant was intensely critical of the use of examples as moral yardsticks, because they tend to rely on our moral intuitions (feelings) rather than our rational powers, this section will explore some applications of the categorical imperative  for illustrative purposes.

===Deception===
{{Further|Doctrine of mental reservation}}
Kant asserted that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In the ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back.  The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).  With lying, it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it were universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies.  The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in itself. The theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences.

===Theft===
Kant argued that any action taken against another person to which he or she ''could not possibly'' consent is a violation of perfect duty interpreted through the second formulation. If a thief were to steal a book from an unknowing victim, it may have been that the victim would have agreed, had the thief simply asked. However, no person can consent to theft, because the presence of consent would mean that the transfer was not a theft. Because the victim could not have consented to the action, it could not be instituted as a universal law of nature, and theft contradicts perfect duty.

===Suicide===
Kant applied his categorical imperative to the issue of suicide motivated by a sickness of life in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'',{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30-31}} writing that:

{{quote |text=A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels sick of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether taking his own life would not be contrary to his duty to himself. Now he asks whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature. But his maxim is this:  from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction. There only remains the question as to whether this principle of self-love can become a universal law of nature.  One sees at once that a contradiction in a system of nature whose law would destroy life by means of the very same feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life, and hence there could be no existence as a system of nature. Therefore, such a maxim cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is, consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30-31}} }}

How the Categorical Imperative would apply to suicide from other motivations is unclear.

===Laziness===
Kant also applies the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' on the subject of "failing to cultivate one's talents." He proposes a man who if he cultivated his talents could bring many goods, but he has everything he wants and would prefer to enjoy the pleasures of life instead.  The man asks himself how the universality of such a thing works.  While Kant agrees that a society could subsist if everyone did nothing, he notes that the man would have no pleasures to enjoy, for if everyone let their talents go to waste, there would be no one to create luxuries that created this theoretical situation in the first place.  Not only that, but cultivating one's talents is a duty to oneself.  Thus, it is not willed to make laziness universal, and a rational being has imperfect duty to cultivate its talents.  Kant concludes in The Groundwork:

{{quote |text=...he cannot possibly will that this should become a universal law of nature or be implanted in us as such a law by a natural instinct.  For as a rational being he necessarily wills that all his faculties should be developed, inasmuch as they are given him for all sorts of possible purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Charity===
Kant's last application of the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' is of charity. He proposes a fourth man who finds his own life fine but sees other people struggling with life and who ponders the outcome of doing nothing to help those in need (while not envying them or accepting anything from them). While Kant admits that humanity could subsist (and admits it could possibly perform better) if this were universal, he states in ''Grounding'':

{{quote |text=But even though it is possible that a universal law of nature could subsist in accordance with that maxim, still it is impossible to will that such a principle should hold everywhere as a law of nature.  For a will that resolved in this way would contradict itself, inasmuch as cases might often arise in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others and in which he would deprive himself, by such a law of nature springing from his own will, of all hope of the aid he wants for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cruelty to animals===
Kant derived a prohibition against [[cruelty to animals]] by arguing that such cruelty is a violation of a duty in relation to oneself. According to Kant, man has the imperfect duty to strengthen the feeling of compassion, since this feeling promotes morality in relation to other human beings. However, cruelty to animals deadens the feeling of compassion in man. Therefore, man is obliged not to treat animals brutally (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, § 17).

== Criticisms ==

===The Golden Rule===

The first formulation of the Categorical Imperative appears similar to [[Ethic of reciprocity|The Golden Rule]].

The 'Golden Rule' (in its negative form) says: "Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself."&lt;ref&gt;Confucius: The Golden Rule by Russel Freedman&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Golden Rule' (in its positive form) says:  "Treat others how you wish to be treated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]]   | year = 1979   | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's first formulation of his Categorical Imperative says: "Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."

Due to this similarity, some have thought the two are identical.&lt;ref&gt;"This is indeed the well-known “Golden Rule” that we find in the teachings of Moses, and Confucius, and Jesus, and many others. I think, however, that all three of them would say that the most universal moral rule is even more universal than this one: something like "Do good and not evil." Kreeft, Peter (2009-09-16). Socrates Meets Kant (p. 234). Ignatius Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Corning]] suggests that, "Kant's objection to the Golden Rule is especially suspect because the categorical imperative (CI) sounds a lot like a paraphrase, or perhaps a close cousin, of the same fundamental idea. In effect, it says that you should act toward others in ways that you would want everyone else to act toward others, yourself included (presumably). Calling it a universal law does not materially improve on the basic concept."&lt;ref&gt;"The Fair Society"&lt;/ref&gt; Corning claims that Ken Binmore thought so as well.

Kant himself did not think so in the ''[[Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]].'' Rather, the categorical imperative is an attempt to identify ''a purely formal'' and necessarily universally binding rule on all rational agents. The Golden Rule, on the other hand, is neither purely formal nor necessarily universally binding. It is "empirical" in the sense that applying it depends on providing content, like "If you don't want others to hit you, then don't hit them." Also, it is a hypothetical imperative in the sense that it can be formulated, "If you want X done to you, then do X to others." Kant feared that the hypothetical clause, "if you want X done to you," remains open to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, Peter (2009-09-16). Socrates Meets Kant (p. 236). Ignatius&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lying to a murderer===
One of the first major challenges to Kant's reasoning came from the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Benjamin Constant]], who asserted that since truth telling must be universal, according to Kant's theories, one must (if asked) tell a known murderer the location of his prey. This challenge occurred while Kant was still alive, and his response was the essay ''On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives'' (sometimes translated ''On a Supposed Right to Lie because of Philanthropic Concerns''). In this reply, Kant agreed with Constant's inference, that from Kant's premises one must infer a moral duty not to lie to a murderer.

Kant denied that such an inference indicates any weakness in his premises: not lying to the murderer is required because moral actions do not derive their worth from the expected consequences. He claimed that because lying to the murderer would treat him as a mere means to another end, the lie denies the rationality of another person, and therefore denies the possibility of there being free rational action at all. This lie results in a contradiction in conception and therefore the lie is in conflict with duty.

Constant and Kant agree that refusing to answer the murderer's question is consistent with the categorical imperative, but assume for the purposes of argument that refusing to answer would not be an option.

===Questioning autonomy===
[[Schopenhauer's criticism of Kantian philosophy#Categorical Imperative|Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy]] expresses doubt concerning the absence of [[egoism]] in the Categorical Imperative. [[Schopenhauer]] claimed that the Categorical Imperative is actually [[hypothetical]] and egotistical, not categorical.

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] believed Kantian autonomy was insufficient and that, if unchecked, people tend to be lenient in their own case, either by not exercising the full rigor of the moral law or by not properly disciplining themselves of moral transgressions:

{{quote |text=Kant was of the opinion that man is his own law (autonomy) - that is, he binds himself under the law which he himself gives himself. Actually, in a profounder sense, this is how lawlessness or experimentation are established. This is not being rigorously earnest any more than [[Sancho Panza]]'s self-administered blows to his own bottom were vigorous. ... Now if a man is never even once willing in his lifetime to act so decisively that [a lawgiver] can get hold of him, well, then it happens, then the man is allowed to live on in self-complacent illusion and make-believe and experimentation, but this also means: utterly without grace. |source=''Papers and Journals''&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Ronald | title=Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1992 |page=90-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Application of the categorical imperative ==

=== The trial of Adolf Eichmann ===
In 1961, discussion of Kant's categorical imperative was even included in the trial of the infamous [[SS]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].

As [[Hannah Arendt]] wrote in her book on the trial, Eichmann declared "with great emphasis that he had lived his whole life ... according to a Kantian definition of duty". Arendt considered this so "incomprehensible on the face of it" that it confirmed her sense that he wasn't really thinking at all, just mouthing accepted formulae, thereby establishing his banality.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;{{cite book
 |last   = Arendt
 |first  = Hannah
 |authorlink = Hannah Arendt

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Judge Raveh indeed had asked Eichmann whether he thought he had really lived according to the categorical imperative during the war.  Eichmann acknowledged he did not "live entirely according to it, although I would like to do so." &lt;ref name="Arendt" /&gt;

[[Deborah Lipstadt]], in her book on the trial, takes this as evidence that evil is not ''banal'', but is in fact ''self-aware''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. &lt;!--  "Eichmann had acknowledged that he understood the implications of what he was doing but continued to obey his orders [not his Kantian duty] nonetheless."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} --&gt;

=== Application of the universalizability principle to the ethics of consumption ===

[[Pope Francis]], in [[Laudato si|his 2015 encyclical]], applies the first formulation of the universalizability principle to the issue of consumption:
::Instead of resolving the problems of the poor and thinking of how the world can be different, some can only propose a reduction in the birth rate. ... To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Francis]], ''Encyclical Letter ''Laudato Si'' of the Holy Father Francis on Care for Our Common Home'', § 50, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html May 24, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Game theory ===
One form of the categorical imperative is [[superrationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reviews |first=Paul J. |last=Campbell |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=57 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages=51–55 |jstor=2690298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volunteer's Dilemma |first=Andreas |last=Diekmann |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |date=December 1985 |pages=605–610 |doi=10.1177/0022002785029004003 |jstor=174243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was elucidated by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] as a new approach to [[game theory]]. Unlike in conventional game theory, a superrational player will act as if all other players are superrational too and that a superrational agent will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational agent when facing the same problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11532">British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] formulated three [[adage]]s that are known as '''Clarke's three laws''', of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited. They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception|last=Beech|first=Martin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9781461406150|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws include:

#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}} When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}} The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}} Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's "laws" were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2006|isbn=9780312340049|location=New York|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'" in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as "Clarke's Law" in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths|last=Shermer|first=Michael|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|year=2011|isbn=9780805091250|location=New York|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: "As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there".

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the "Hazards of Prophecy" essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Popular Library|year=1973|isbn=9780330236195|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: "Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned".&lt;ref&gt;"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon", ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: "...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic," and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood."

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he "would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic", referring to his memory of "seeing and hearing [[Lynotype|Linotype]] machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’".&lt;ref name="Gooden2015"/&gt;

== Proposed fourth law ==
A fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws. [[Geoff Holder]] quotes: "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,"&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2009). ''101 Things to Do with a Stone Circle''. The History Press, 2009. Holder offers as his source Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' (Millennium Edition, 1999, paperback edition page 143, {{ISBN|0-575-40277-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of American economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert, but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact", from his 1995 book ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[ Massimo Pigliucci]], ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk'', 2010, {{ISBN|0226667871}}; an epigraph to Chapter 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;pg=PA279 p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants of the third law ==

The third law has inspired many [[snowclone]]s and other variations:

[[File:Commutativity of binary operations (without question mark).svg|thumb|An operation &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is commutative [[If and only if|iff]] &lt;math&gt;x\circ y = y \circ x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This image illustrates this property with the concept of an operation as a "calculation machine". It doesn't matter for the output &lt;math&gt;x\circ y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y \circ x&lt;/math&gt; respectively which order the arguments &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have – the final outcome is the same.]]
In [[mathematics]], a [[binary operation]] is '''commutative''' if changing the order of the [[operand]]s does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many [[binary operations]], and many [[mathematical proof]]s depend on it. Most familiar as the name of the property that says {{nowrap|1="3 + 4 = 4 + 3"}} or {{nowrap|1="2 × 5 = 5 × 2"}}, the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as  [[division (mathematics)|division]] and [[subtraction]], that do not have it (for example, {{nowrap|"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3"}}); such operations are ''not'' commutative, and so are referred to as ''noncommutative operations''. The idea that simple operations such as the [[multiplication (mathematics)|multiplication]] and [[addition]] of numbers are commutative, was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A corresponding property exists for [[binary relation]]s; a binary relation is said to be [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|id=SymmetricRelation|title=Symmetric Relation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common uses==
The ''commutative property'' (or ''commutative law'') is a property generally associated with binary operations and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  If the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to ''commute'' under that operation.

==Mathematical definitions==
{{Further|Symmetric function}}
The term "commutative" is used in several related senses.&lt;ref name="Krowne, p.1"&gt;Krowne, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, ''Commute'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|1=
A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called ''commutative'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;x * y = y * x\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y\in S&lt;/math&gt;

An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called ''non-commutative''.
|2=
One says that ''x commutes'' with ''y'' under &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; if:
:&lt;math&gt; x * y = y * x &lt;/math&gt;
|3=
A [[binary function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \times A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is called ''commutative'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = f(y, x)\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y\in A&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Examples ==

===Commutative operations in everyday life===
[[File:Commutative Addition.svg|thumb|The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative.]]
*Putting on socks resembles a commutative operation since which sock is put on first is unimportant. Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and trousers is not commutative.
*The commutativity of addition is observed when paying for an item with cash.  Regardless of the order the bills are handed over in, they always give the same total.

===Commutative operations in mathematics===
[[File:Vector Addition.svg|thumb|The addition of vectors is commutative, because &lt;math&gt;\vec a+\vec b=\vec b+ \vec a&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Two well-known examples of commutative binary operations:&lt;ref name="Krowne, p.1"/&gt;
* The [[addition]] of [[real number]]s is commutative, since
::&lt;math&gt;y + z = z + y \qquad\mbox{for all }y,z\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:For example 4 + 5 = 5 + 4, since both [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]s equal 9.
* The [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s is commutative, since
::&lt;math&gt;y z = z y \qquad\mbox{for all }y,z\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:For example, 3 × 5 = 5 × 3, since both expressions equal 15.
* Some binary [[truth function]]s are also commutative, since the [[truth table]]s for the functions are the same when one changes the order of the operands. 
:For example, the [[logical biconditional]] function p ↔ q is equivalent to q ↔ p. This function is also written as p [[If and only if|IFF]] q, or as p ≡ q, or as E''pq''. 
:The last form is an example of the most concise notation in the article on truth functions, which lists the sixteen possible binary truth functions of which eight are commutative: V''pq'' = V''qp''; A''pq'' (OR) = A''qp''; D''pq'' (NAND) = D''qp''; E''pq'' (IFF) = E''qp''; J''pq'' = J''qp''; K''pq'' (AND) = K''qp''; X''pq'' (NOR) = X''qp''; O''pq'' = O''qp''.
* Further examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s, addition and [[scalar product|scalar multiplication]] of [[vector space|vectors]], and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].

===Noncommutative operations in daily life===

*[[Concatenation]], the act of joining character strings together, is a noncommutative operation. For example,
:{{nowrap|1=EA + T = EAT &amp;ne; TEA = T + EA}}
*Washing and drying clothes resembles a noncommutative operation; washing and then drying produces a markedly different result to drying and then washing.
*Rotating a book 90° around a vertical axis then 90° around a horizontal axis produces a different orientation than when the rotations are performed in the opposite order.
*The twists of the [[Rubik's Cube]] are noncommutative. This can be studied using [[group theory]].
*Thought processes are noncommutative: A person asked a question (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.
*The act of dressing is either commutative or non-commutative, depending on the items. Putting on underwear and normal clothing is noncommutative. Putting on left and right socks is commutative.

===Noncommutative operations in mathematics===
Some noncommutative binary operations:&lt;ref&gt;Yark, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtraction and division====

[[Subtraction]] is noncommutative, since &lt;math&gt;0 - 1 \neq 1 - 0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is noncommutative, since &lt;math&gt;1 \div 2 \neq 2 \div 1&lt;/math&gt;.

====Truth functions====

Some [[truth function]]s are noncommutative, since the [[truth table]]s for the functions are different when one changes the order of the operands. For example, the truth tables for ''f'' (A, B) {{=}} A Λ ¬B (A AND NOT B) and ''f'' (B, A) {{=}} B Λ ¬A are
:{{aligned table
 | class=wikitable
 | style=text-align:center; width:20%;
 | cols=4
 | col3style=width:30%;
 | col4style=width:30%;
 | row1header=yes
 | A | B | ''f''&amp;nbsp;(A, B) | ''f''&amp;nbsp;(B, A)
 | F | F | F | F
 | F | T | F | T
 | T | F | T | F
 | T | T | F | F
 }}

For the eight noncommutative functions, B''qp'' = C''pq''; M''qp'' = L''pq''; C''qp'' = B''pq''; L''qp'' = M''pq''; F''qp'' = G''pq''; I''qp'' = H''pq''; G''qp'' = F''pq''; H''qp'' = I''pq''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jozef Maria Bochenski]] (1959), ''Precis of [[Mathematical Logic]]'', rev., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, New York:  Gordon and Breach, Part II, Sec. 3.32, "16 dyadic truth functors", ([[truth tables]]), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Matrix multiplication====

[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix]] multiplication is almost always noncommutative, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 2 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \neq
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Vector product====

The vector product (or [[cross product]]) of two vectors in three dimensions is [[anticommutativity|anti-commutative]]; i.e., ''b'' × ''a'' =  −(''a'' × ''b'').

==History and etymology==
[[File:Commutative Word Origin.PNG|right|thumb|250px|The first known use of the term was in a French Journal published in 1814]]

Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times.  The [[Egypt]]ians used the commutative property of [[multiplication]] to simplify computing [[Product (mathematics)|products]].&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Shute, p.?&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid]] is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']].&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner and Robertson, ''Real Numbers''&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions.  Today the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics.

The first recorded use of the term ''commutative'' was in a memoir by [[François-Joseph Servois|François Servois]] in 1814,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cabillón and Miller, ''Commutative and Distributive''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner and Robertson, ''Servois''&lt;/ref&gt; which used the word ''commutatives'' when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property.  The word is a combination of the French word ''commuter'' meaning "to substitute or switch" and the suffix ''-ative'' meaning "tending to" so the word literally means "tending to substitute or switch."  The term then appeared in English in 1838&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|editor1-first=Raymond|editor1-last=Flood|editor2-first=Adrian|editor2-last=Rice|editor3-first=Robin|editor3-last=Wilson|editor3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YruifIx88AQC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Duncan Farquharson Gregory]]'s article entitled "On the real nature of symbolical algebra" published in 1840 in the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=D. F. Gregory|title=On the real nature of symbolical algebra|periodical=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=14|pages=208–216|year=1840|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro14royal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Propositional logic ==
{{Transformation rules}}

=== Rule of replacement ===
In truth-functional propositional logic, ''commutation'',&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''commutativity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick  |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to two [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]]. The rules allow one to transpose [[propositional variable]]s within [[well-formed formula|logical expressions]] in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. The rules are:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \lor Q) \Leftrightarrow (Q \lor P)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \Leftrightarrow (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;" is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing "can be replaced in a [[Formal proof|proof]] with."

=== Truth functional connectives ===

''Commutativity'' is a property of some [[logical connective]]s of truth functional [[propositional logic]]. The following [[logical equivalence]]s demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

;Commutativity of conjunction:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of disjunction:&lt;math&gt;(P \lor Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \lor P)&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of implication (also called the law of permutation):&lt;math&gt;(P \to (Q \to R)) \leftrightarrow (Q \to (P \to R))&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of equivalence (also called the complete commutative law of equivalence):&lt;math&gt;(P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;

== Set theory ==
In [[group theory|group]] and [[set theory]], many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property.  In higher branches of mathematics, such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[linear algebra]] the commutativity of well-known operations (such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Axler, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallian, p.34"&gt;Gallian, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 26,87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical structures and commutativity==
* A [[commutative semigroup]] is a set endowed with a total, [[associativity|associative]] and commutative operation.
* If the operation additionally has an [[identity element]], we have a [[commutative monoid]]
* An [[abelian group]], or ''commutative group'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose group operation is commutative.&lt;ref name="Gallian, p.34"/&gt;
* A [[commutative ring]] is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] whose [[multiplication]] is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.)&lt;ref&gt;Gallian p.236&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] both addition and multiplication are commutative.&lt;ref&gt;Gallian p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related properties==

===Associativity===
{{Main|Associative property}}

The associative property is closely related to the commutative property.  The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms doesn't change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.

Most commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

which is clearly commutative (interchanging ''x'' and ''y'' does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, &lt;math&gt;f(-4, f(0, +4)) = -1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f(f(-4, 0), +4) = +1&lt;/math&gt;).
More such examples may be found in [[commutative non-associative magmas]].

===Distributive===
{{Main|Distributive property}}

===Symmetry===
[[File:Symmetry Of Addition.svg|right|thumb|200px|Graph showing the symmetry of the addition function]]
{{Main|Symmetry in mathematics}}

Some forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity.  When a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line ''y = x''.  As an example, if we let a function ''f'' represent addition (a commutative operation) so that ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' + ''y'' then ''f'' is a symmetric function, which can be seen in the adjacent image.

For relations, a [[symmetric relation]] is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation ''R'' is symmetric, then &lt;math&gt;a R b \Leftrightarrow b R a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics==
{{Main|Canonical commutation relation}}

In [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] as formulated by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], physical variables are represented by [[linear operators]] such as ''x'' (meaning multiply by ''x''), and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their [[Function composition|compositions]] &lt;math&gt;x \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x&lt;/math&gt; (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt; x\cdot {\mathrm{d}\over \mathrm{d}x}\psi = x\cdot \psi' \ \neq \ \psi + x\cdot \psi' = {\mathrm{d}\over \mathrm{d}x}\left( x\cdot \psi \right) &lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]], which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear [[momentum]] in the ''x''-direction of a particle are represented by the operators &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively (where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]). This is the same example except for the constant &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.

'''''Contemptus mundi''''', the "contempt of the [[world (theology)|world]]" and worldly concerns, is a theme in the intellectual life of both [[Classical Antiquity]] and of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi]&lt;/ref&gt; both in its mystical vein and its ambivalence towards secular life, that figures largely in the Western world's [[history of ideas]]. In inculcating a turn of mind that would lead to a state of serenity untrammeled by distracting material appetites and feverish emotional connections, which the Greek philosophers called ''[[ataraxia]]'', it drew upon the assumptions of [[Stoicism]] and a [[neoplatonism]] that was distrustful of deceptive and spurious appearances. In the familiar rhetorical polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and the contemplative life, which Christians, who expressly rejected "the World, [[Flesh (theology)|the Flesh]] and the Devil",&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is late (the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' but the triad draws on "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt; might exemplify as the way of [[Martha]] and the way of [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]], ''contemptus mundi'' assumed that only the contemplative life was of lasting value and the world an empty shell, a [[vanity]].

==In classical antiquity==
In the classical canon, [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', essays on achieving [[Stoicism|Stoic]] stability of emotions, with rhetorical subjects such as "Contempt of death", was taken up definitively by [[Boethius]] in his ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|Consolations of Philosophy]]'', during the troubled closing phase of [[Late Antiquity]]. The Latin tradition of dispraise of the public world adapted by Christian moralists, focused especially on the [[Fortuna|fickleness of Fortune]], and the evils exposed in the Latin [[satire]] became a mainstay of Christian penitential literature.

==In the Patristic tradition==
Among early Christians, [[Eucherius of Lyon]], an aristocratic and high-ranking ecclesiastic in the fifth-century Christian Church of Gaul, wrote to his kinsman a widely read letter ''de contemptu mundi'', an expression of the despair for the present and future of the world in [[End time|its last throes]]. Contempt for the world provided intellectual underpinnings for the retreat into [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]]: when [[Saint Florentina]], of the prominent Christian family of Hispania, founded her convent, her rule written by her brother [[Leander of Seville]] explicitly cited contempt for the world: ''Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem''.

==Medieval ''contemptus mundi''==
The medieval ''[[Trope (literature)|trope]]'' of ''contemptus mundi'', drawing upon these converging traditions, pagan philosophy and Christian [[Asceticism|ascetic theology]],&lt;ref&gt;Noted by John V. Fleming, "The best line in Ovid and the woest", in Robert G. Benson, Susan Janet Ridyard, eds. ''New Readings of Chaucer's Poetry'', 2003:56.&lt;/ref&gt; was fundamental to a medieval education.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bultot, "La Cartula et l'enseignement du mépris du monde dans les écoles et les universités médiévale", ''Studi Medievali'' ser. iii '''8''' (1967:787-834); Bultot's full-length study ''La doctrine du mépris du monde: Christianisme et valeur humaine: I.  [[Peter Damian|Pierre Damien]]'' (1963) was criticised in Francesco Lazzari, "S. Pierre Damien]et le 'contemptus mundi' à propos d'un livre récent", ''Revue d'ascétique et de mystique'' '''40''' (1964:185-96).&lt;/ref&gt; A classic Christian expression is [[Bernard of Cluny]]'s bitter 12th-century satire ''[[De contemptu mundi]]'', founded in a deep sense of the transitory nature of secular joys and the abiding  permanency of the spiritual life. His text made one of the ''[[Auctores octo morales]]'', the "eight moral authors" that formed the central texts of medieval pedagogy.

In the early 12th century, when [[Adelard of Bath]] (c. 1080 - 1152) allegorized two contrasting figures to dispute ''De eodem et diverso''; they were ''Philosophia'' and ''Philocosmia'', "love of wisdom" and the "love of the world".&lt;ref&gt;It is noteworthy that while Fleming's interpretation comes from his view that ''contemptus mundi'' was an embedded practice in the study of medieval literature, Bridget K. Balint in her ''Ordering Chaos: The Self and the Cosmos in Twelfth-Century Latin Prosimetrum'' (2009) argues that Adelard in fact does not despise the world per se, see p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Adelard's contemporary, [[Henry of Huntington]], in the dedicatory letter to his ''Historia Anglorum'' referred in passing to "those who taught the contempt of the world in schools".&lt;ref&gt;Adelard ("very elegant but also commonplace") and Henry of Huntinton are both noted in Fleming 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An aspect of contempt for this world reflects upon the ephemerality of all life, expressed in the literary rhetorical question of ''[[ubi sunt]]''. Even as worldly a pope as [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] could write an essay "On the Misery of the Human Condition",  ''De miseria humanae conditionis'', which [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is reputed to have rendered in English, in a translation now lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Companion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme had political ramifications within the Roman Church, as it was inextricably bound up with questions of  [[apostolic poverty]]&lt;ref&gt;Jan G. J. van den Eijnden discusses the controversial wealth of the Church in [[Thomas Aquinas]]' day, ''Poverty on the Way to God: Thomas Aquinas on evangelical poverty'' 1994:8 ff ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was roundly condemned, in the instance of the [[Humiliati]], as [[Heresy|heretical]].

The waning of the dominant attitude of ''contemptus mundi'' that had informed elite culture, a development that gathered impetus during the second half of the 14th century, was a precursor to the emergence of the modern secular ethos, encouraging men to study material things with greater lucidity than before, as [[Georges Duby]] has observed, noting the turn taken in painting and sculpture toward the [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] delineation of aspects of material life.&lt;ref&gt;Duby, "Preface" in ''A History of Private Life: II.Revelations of the Medieval World'' (1988:x).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern culture==
The theme of ''contemptus mundi'' continued to inform European poetry into the [[Early Modern]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Facts on File Companion to British Poetry before 1600'', Volume 1 (2008) ''s.v.'' "Contemptus mundi"; the theme is the subject of Mary Evelina McSorley, ''The 'Contemptus mundi' motif in Elizabethan Poetry'', 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contemptus mundi'' is a running theme in the poetry of [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref&gt;William L. Furstenburg, ''Contemptus mundi in William Drummond of Hawthornden'', 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and Burton's ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' and the devotional verse of [[Jeremy Taylor]] would serve as further examples. The recurrence of [[bubonic plague]] offered a concrete visitation of the frailty of this life for devotional texts, as early as [[John Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest B. Gilman, ''Plague Writing in Early Modern England'', 2009:201&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times ''contemptus mundi'' has been criticized as a ''pastoral of fear'' by the historian [[Jean Delumeau]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions]&lt;/ref&gt; and M. B. Pranger found the ''trope'' "Speaking of God after Auschwitz" to function as a "modern form of ''contemptus mundi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pranger, ''The Artificiality of Christianity: Essays on the Poetics of Monasticism'' 2003:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2529">'''Correlative''' ("corelative," UK spelling) is the term adopted by [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]] to describe the philosophical relationships between fundamental legal concepts in [[jurisprudence]].

== Hohfeldian analysis ==

Hohfeld was concerned that there was some ambiguity in the explanation of the similarities and differences between concepts in law. Hence, with the focus on the nature of ''rights'', he proposed a system of analysis based on "jural correlatives" and "jural opposites". A correlative is where two concepts are [[logically consistent]] and the one necessarily implies the other. When two concepts are Hohfeldian opposites (technically, logical contradictions), they are mutually exclusive.

Thus, if A has a right with regard to B, an analysis of their relationship from B's point of view must imply that B has a duty to A. An owner of land may hold four distinct entitlements: rights, privileges, powers, and immunities. Hohfeld linked each entitlement to a corelative and its opposite:

{| style="width:250px; height:200px" border="1"
|- 
| '''Elements'''
| '''Correlatives'''
| '''Opposites'''
|- style="height:100px" 
| Right
| style="width:250px" |Duty
| No Right

| Privilege or Liberty
| No Right

| style="width:250px" |Liability
| Disability
|- style="height:100px" 
| Immunity
| style="width:250px" |Disability
| Liability
|-
|-
|}

==In practice==
Jurists such as [[Mickey Dias]] and [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld#Hohfeldian analysis|Hohfeld]] have declared that rights and duties are ''jural corelatives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dias |title=Jurisprudence |year=1976 |first=Reginald Walter Michael |oclc=2668655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that if someone has a right, ''someone else'' owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC|Murphy v Brentwood District Council]]'' (1991) to disapprove  [[Alfred Denning|Lord Denning]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]'s judgment in ''[[Dutton v Bognor Regis UDC|Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Denning had argued, wrongly, that when a local council has a right to inspect a building under construction, the council has a corresponding duty of care to "inspect properly".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28149">In philosophy, specifically in the area of modal [[metaphysics]], '''counterpart theory''' is an alternative to standard ([[Saul Kripke|Kripkean]]) possible-worlds semantics for interpreting quantified [[modal logic]]. Counterpart theory still presupposes [[possible world]]s, but differs in certain important respects from the Kripkean view. The form of the theory most commonly cited was developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], first in a paper and later in his book ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''.

==Differences from the Kripkean view==
Counterpart theory (hereafter "CT"), as formulated by Lewis, requires that individuals exist in only one world. The standard account of possible worlds assumes that a modal statement about an individual (e.g., "it is possible that x is y") means that there is a possible world, W, where the individual x has the property y; in this case there is only one individual, x, at issue. On the contrary, counterpart theory supposes that this statement is really saying that there is a possible world, W, wherein exists an individual that is not x itself, but rather a distinct individual 'x' different from but nonetheless similar to x.  So, when I state that I might have been a banker (rather than a philosopher) according to counterpart theory I am saying not that I exist in another possible world where I am a banker, but rather my counterpart does. Nevertheless, this statement about my counterpart is still held to ground the truth of the statement that I might have been a banker.  The requirement that any individual exist in only one world is to avoid what Lewis termed the "problem of accidental intrinsics" which (he held) would require a single individual to both have and simultaneously not have particular properties.

In its formalization, counterpart theoretic formalization of modal discourse also departs from the standard formulation by eschewing use of modality operators (Necessarily, Possibly) in favor of quantifiers that range over worlds and 'counterparts' of individuals in those worlds.  Lewis put forth a set of primitive predicates and a number of axioms governing CT and a scheme for translating standard modal claims in the language of quantified modal logic into his CT.

In addition to interpreting modal claims about objects and possible worlds, CT can also be applied to the identity of a single object at different points in time. The view that an object can retain its identity over time is often called [[endurantism]], and it claims that objects are ‘wholly present’ at different moments (see [[#The counterpart relation|the counterpart relation]], below). An opposing view is that any object in time is made up of temporal parts or is [[Perdurantism|perduring]].

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]' view on possible worlds is sometimes called [[modal realism]].

=== The basics ===

The possibilities that CT is supposed to describe are “ways a world might be” (Lewis 1986:86) or more exactly:

: (1) absolutely every way that a world could possibly be is a way that some world is, and

: (2) absolutely every way that a part of a world could possibly be is a way that some part of some world is. (Lewis 1986:86.)

Add also the following “principle of recombination,” which Lewis describes this way: “patching together parts of different possible worlds yields another possible world […].  [A]nything can coexist with anything else, […] provided they occupy distinct spatiotemporal positions.” (Lewis 1986:87-88). But these possibilities should be restricted by CT.

==The counterpart relation==

The counterpart relation (hereafter C-relation) differs from the notion of identity. Identity is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], and [[transitive relation|transitive]] relation. The counterpart relation is only a [[similarity relation]]; it needn’t  be transitive or symmetric.  The C-relation is also known as [[genidentity]] (Carnap 1967), [[I-relation]] (Lewis 1983), and the [[unity relation]] (Perry 1975).

If identity is shared between objects in different possible worlds then the same object can be said to exist in different possible worlds (a ''trans-world'' object, that is, a series of objects sharing a single identity).

=== Parthood relation ===

An important part of the way Lewis’s worlds deliver possibilities is the use of the parthood relation.   This gives some neat formal machinery, [[mereology]]. This is an axiomatic system that uses formal logic to describe the relationship between parts and wholes, and between parts within a whole. Especially important, and most reasonable, according to Lewis, is the strongest form that accepts the existence of mereological sums or the thesis of [[unrestricted mereological composition]] (Lewis 1986:211-213).

== The formal theory ==

As a formal theory, counterpart theory can be used to translate sentences into modal quantificational logic. Sentences that seem to be quantifying over possible individuals&lt;!-- what does this mean? --&gt; should be translated into CT. (Explicit primitives and axioms have not yet been stated for the temporal or spatial use of CT.) Let CT be stated in quantificational logic and contain the following primitives:

: Wx (x is a possible world)
: Ixy (x is in possible world y)
: Ax (x is actual)
: Cxy (x is a counterpart of y)

We have the following axioms (taken from Lewis 1968):

: A1.  Ixy → Wy
: (Nothing is in anything except a world)

: A2. Ixy ∧ Ixz → y=z
: (Nothing is in two worlds)

: A3. Cxy → ∃zIxz
: (Whatever is a counterpart is in a world)

: A4. Cxy → ∃zIyz
: (Whatever has a counterpart is in a world)

: A5. Ixy ∧ Izy ∧ Cxz → x=z
: (Nothing is a counterpart of anything else in its world)

: A6. Ixy → Cxx
: (Anything in a world is a counterpart of itself)

: A7. ∃x (Wx ∧ ∀y (Iyx ↔ Ay))
: (Some world contains all and only actual things)

: A8. ∃xAx
: (Something is actual)

It is an uncontroversial assumption to assume that the primitives and the axioms A1 through A8 make the standard counterpart system.

=== Comments on the axioms ===

*A1 excludes individuals that exist in no world at all. The way an individual is in a world is by being a part of that world, so the basic relation is mereological.
*A2 excludes individuals that exist in more than one possible world. But because David Lewis accepts the existence of arbitrary mereological sums there are individuals that exist in several possible worlds, but they are not possible individuals because none of them have the property of being actual. And that is because it is not possible for such a whole to be actual.
*A3 and A4 make counterparts worldbound, excluding an individual that has a non-worldbound counterpart.
*A5 and A6 restrict the use of the CT-relation so that it is used within a possible world when and only when it is stood in by an entity to itself.
*A7 and A8 make one possible world the unique actual world.

=== Principles that are not accepted in normal CT ===

: R1 Cxy → Cyx
: (Symmetry of the counterpart relation)

: R2 Cxy ∧ Cyz → Cxz
: (Transitivity of the counterpart relation)

: R3 Cy&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x ∧ Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x ∧ Iy&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Iy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: (Nothing in any world has more than one counterpart in any other world)

: R4 Cyx&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Cyx&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ix&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ix&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w2 ∧ x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;≠w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: (No two things in any world have a common counterpart in any other world)

: R5 Ww&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ww&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ixw&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ∃y (Iyw&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Cxy)
: (For any two worlds, anything in one is a counterpart of something in the other)

: R6 Ww&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ww&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Ixw&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ∃y (Iyw&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ Cyx)
: (For any two worlds, anything in one has some counterpart in the other)

== Motivations for counterpart theory ==
CT can be applied to the relationship between identical objects in different worlds or at different times. Depending on the subject, there are different reasons for accepting CT as a description of the relation between different entities.

=== In possible worlds ===

David Lewis defended [[Modal realism]]. This is the view that a possible world is a concrete, maximal connected spatio-temporal region. The actual world is one of the possible worlds; it is also concrete. Because a single concrete object demands spatio-temporal connectedness, a possible concrete object can only exist in one possible world. Still, we say true things like: It is possible that [[Hubert Humphrey]] won the 1968 US presidential election. How is it true? Humphrey has a counterpart in another possible world that wins the 1968 election in that world.

Lewis also argues against three other alternatives that might be compatible with possibilism: overlapping individuals, trans-world individuals, and [[haecceity]].

Some philosophers, such as [[Peter van Inwagen]] (1985), see no problem with [[Identity (social science)|identity]] within a world &lt;!-- This quote doesn't imply Lewis' support for transworld identity  --&gt;. Lewis seems to share this attitude. He says:

:"… like the Holy Roman Empire, it is badly named. […]  In the first place we should bear in mind that Trans-World Airlines is an intercontinental, but not as yet an interplanetary carrier. More important,&lt;!-- The first part of this quote makes no sense without context --&gt; we should not suppose that we have here any problem with ''identity''.

:We never have. Identity is utterly simple and unproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever identical to anything else except itself. There is never any problem about what makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to be. And there is never any problem about what makes two things identical; two things never can be identical.

:There might be a problem about how to define identity to someone sufficiently lacking in conceptual resources — we note that it won't suffice to teach him certain rules of inference — but since such unfortunates are rare, even among philosophers, we needn't worry much if their condition is incurable.

:We ''do'' state plenty of genuine problems in terms of identity. But we ''needn't'' state them so.” (Lewis 1986:192-193)

====Overlapping individuals====

An overlapping individual has a part in the actual world and a part in another world. Because identity is not problematic, we get overlapping individuals by having overlapping worlds. Two worlds overlap if they share a common part. But some properties of overlapping objects are, for Lewis, troublesome (Lewis 1986:199-210).

The problem is with an object’s accidental intrinsic properties, such as shape and weight, which supervene on its parts. Humphrey could have the property of having six fingers on his left hand. How does he do that?  It can’t be true that Humphrey has both the property of having six fingers and five fingers on his left hand. What we might say is that he has five fingers ''at this'' world and six fingers ''at that'' world. But how should these [[modifiers]] be understood?

According to McDaniel (2004), if Lewis is right, the defender of overlapping individuals has to accept genuine contradictions or defend the view that every object has all its properties essentially.

How can you be one year older than you are? One way is to say that there is a possible world where you exist.   Another way is for you to have a counterpart in that possible world, who has the property of being one year older than you.

==== Trans-world individuals ====

Take Humphrey: if he is a trans-world individual he is the [[mereological sum]] of all of the possible Humphreys in the different worlds. He is like a road that goes through different regions. There are parts that overlap, but we can also say that there is a northern part that is connected to the southern part and that the road is the mereological sum of these parts. The same thing with Humphrey. One part of him is in one world, another part in another world.

:"It is possible for something to exist iff it is possible for the whole to exist. That is, iff there is a world at which the whole of it exists.  That is, iff there is a world such that quantifying only over parts of that world, the whole of it exists. That is, iff the whole of it is among the parts of some world. That is, iff it is part of some world – and hence not a trans-world individual. Parts of worlds are ''possible'' individuals; trans-world individuals are therefore ''impossible'' individuals."

==== Haecceity ====

A [[haecceity]] or [[individual essence]] is a property that only a single object instantiates. Ordinary properties, if one accepts the existence of [[universals]], can be exemplified by more than one object at a time. Another way to explain a haecceity is to distinguish between ''suchness'' and ''thisness'', where thisness has a more demonstrative character.

David Lewis gives the following definition of a haecceitistic difference: “two worlds differ in what they represent ''de re'' concerning some individual, but do not differ qualitatively in any way.” (Lewis 1986:221.)

CT does not require distinct worlds for distinct possibilities – “a single world may provide many possibilities, since many possible individuals inhabit it” (Lewis 1986:230). CT can satisfy multiple counterparts in one possible world.

===Temporal parts===
{{main|Temporal parts}}
[[Perdurantism]] is the view that material objects are not wholly present at any single instant of time; instead, some [[temporal parts]] is said to be present. Sometimes, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] as it is expressed by [[Minkowski]], the path traced by an object through spacetime. According to [[Ted Sider]], “Temporal parts theory is the claim that time is like space in one particular respect, namely, with respect to parts.”&lt;ref&gt;Sider, et al. (2008) ''Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics'', [http://tedsider.org/papers/temporal_parts.pdf "Temporal Parts"].&lt;/ref&gt; Sider associates endurantism with a C-relation between temporal parts.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} (''See also:'' [[Temporal Parts#The argument from temporary intrinsics|The argument from temporary intrinsics]]).

Sider defends a revised way of counting. Instead of counting individual objects, timeline slices or the temporal parts of an object are used. Sider discusses an example of counting road segments instead of roads simpliciter. (Sider 2001:188-192). (Compare with Lewis 1993.) Sider argues that, even if we knew that some material object would go through some [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and split into two, "we would not ''say''" that there are two objects located at the same [[spacetime]] region. (Sider 2001:189)

How can one predicate temporal properties of these momentary temporal parts? It is here that the C-relation comes in play. Sider proposed the sentence: "Ted was once a boy." The truth condition of this sentence is that "there exists some person stage x prior to the time of utterance, such that x is a boy, and x bears the temporal counterpart relation to Ted." (Sider 2001:193)

== Counterpart theory and the necessity of identity ==

Kripke's three lectures on proper names and identity, (1980), raised the issues of how we should interpret statements about identity. Take the statement that the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star.  Both are the [[planet]] [[Venus]].  This seems to be an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identity statement. We discover that the names designate the same thing. The traditional view, since [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], has been that statements or propositions that are [[logical truth|necessarily true]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. But in the end of the sixties Saul Kripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offered proof for the necessary truth of identity statements. Here is the Kripke's version (Kripke 1971):

: (1) ∀x &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = x)                [Necessity of self-identity]
: (2) ∀x∀y [x = y → ∀P(Px → Py)]                 [Leibniz law]
: (3) ∀x∀y [x = y → (&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = x) →  &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = y))]    [From (1) and (2)]
: (4) ∀x∀y [x = y → &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(x = y)]    [From the following principle A → B → C ⇒ A → C and (3)]

If the proof is correct the distinction between the a priori/a posteriori and necessary/contingent becomes less clear. The same applies if identity statements are necessarily true anyway.  (For some interesting comments on the proof, see Lowe 2002.) The statement that for instance “Water is identical to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O” is (then) a statement that is necessarily true but a posteriori. If CT is the correct account of modal properties we still can keep the intuition that identity statements are contingent and a priori because counterpart theory understands the modal operator in a different way than standard [[modal logic]].

The relationship between CT and essentialism is of interest. (Essentialism, the necessity of identity, and rigid designators form an important troika of mutual interdependence.) According to David Lewis, claims about an object's essential properties can be true or false depending on context (in Chapter 4.5 in 1986 he calls against constancy, because an absolute conception of essences is constant over the logical space of possibilities). He writes:

: But if I ask how things would be if Saul Kripke had come from no sperm and egg but had been brought by a [[stork#Childbirth|stork]], that makes equally good sense. I create a context that makes my question make sense, and to do so it has to be a context that makes origins not be essential. (Lewis 1986:252.)

== Counterpart theory and rigid designators ==

Kripke interpreted proper names as [[rigid designators]] where a rigid designator picks out the same object in every possible world (Kripke 1980). For someone who accepts contingent identity statements the following semantic problem occurs (semantic because we deal with de dicto necessity) (Rea 1997:xxxvii).

Take a scenario that is mentioned in the paradox of coincidence.  A statue (call it “Statue”) is made by melding two pieces of clay together.  Those two pieces are called “Clay”. Statue and Clay seem to be identical, they exist at the same time, and we could incinerate them at the same time. The following seems true:

:(7) Necessarily, if Statue exists then Statue is identical to Statue.

But,

:(8) Necessarily, if Statue exists then Statue is identical to Clay

is false, because it seems possible that Statue could have been made out of two different pieces of clay, and thus its identity to Clay is not necessary.

Counterpart theory, qua-identity, and individual concepts can offer solutions to this problem.

=== Arguments for inconstancy ===

Ted Sider gives roughly the following argument (Sider 2001:223).  There is inconstancy if a proposition about the essence of an object is true in one context and false in another. C-relation is a similarity relation. What is similar in one dimension is not similar in another dimension. Therefore, the C-relation can have the same difference and express inconstant judgements about essences.

David Lewis offers another argument. [[The paradox of coincidence]] can be solved if we accept inconstancy. We can then say that it is possible for a dishpan and a piece of plastic to coincide, in some context. That context can then be described using CT.

Sider makes the point that David Lewis feels he was forced to defend CT, due to [[modal realism]]. Sider uses CT as a solution to [[the paradox of material coincidence]].

=== Counterpart theory compared to qua-theory and individual concepts ===

We assume that contingent identity is real.  Then it is informative to compare CT with other theories about how to handle ''[[de re]]'' representations.

''Qua-theory''

Kit Fine (1982) and Alan Gibbard (1975) (according to Rea 1997) are defences of qua-theory. According to qua-theory we can talk about some of an object's modal properties. The theory is handy if we don't think it is possible for Socrates to be identical with a piece of bread or a stone. Socrates qua person is essentially a person.

''Individual concepts''

According to [[Rudolf Carnap]], in modal contexts variables refer to individual concepts instead of individuals. An individual concept is then defined as a function of individuals in different possible worlds. Basically, individual concepts deliver semantic objects or abstract functions instead of real concrete entities as in CT.

=== Counterpart theory and epistemic possibility ===

Kripke accepts the necessity of identity but agrees with the feeling that it still seems that it is possible that Phospherus (the Morning Star)  is not identical to Hespherus (the Evening Star). For all we know, it could be that they are different. He says:

: What, then, does the intuition that the table might have turned out to have been made of ice or of anything else, that it might even have turned out not to be made of molecules, amount to? I think that it means simply that there might have been a table looking and feeling just like this one and placed in this very position in the room, which was in fact made of ice, In other words, I (or some conscious being) could have been qualitatively in the same epistemic situation that in fact obtains, I could have the same sensory evidence that I in fact have, about a table which was made of ice. The situation is thus akin to the one which inspired the counterpart theorists; when I speak of the possibility of the table turning out to be made of various things, I am speaking loosely. This table itself could not have had an origin different form the one it in fact had, but in a situation qualitatively identical to this one with respect to all evidence I had in advance, the room could have contained a table made of ice in place of this one. Something like counterpart theory is thus applicable to the situation, but it applies only because we are not interested in what might not be true of a table given certain evidence. It is precisely because it is not true that this table might have been made of ice from the Thames that we must turn here to qualitative descriptions and counterparts. To apply these notions to genuine de re modalities, is from the present standpoint, perverse. (Kripke 1980:142.)

So to explain how the illusion of necessity is possible, according to Kripke, CT is an alternative. Therefore, CT forms an important part of our theory about the [[knowledge of modal intuitions]]. (For doubt about this strategy, see Della Roca, 2002. And for more about the knowledge of modal statements, see Gendler and Hawthorne, 2002.)

== Arguments against counterpart theory&lt;!--'Humphrey objection' redirects here--&gt; ==

The most famous is Kripke's '''Humphrey objection'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Because a counterpart is never identical to something in another possible world Kripke raised the following objection against CT:

: "Thus if we say "Humphrey might have won the election (if only he had done such-and-such), we are not talking about something that might have happened to ''Humphrey'' but to someone else, a "counterpart"." Probably, however, Humphrey could not care less whether someone ''else'', no matter how much resembling him, would have been victorious in another possible world. Thus, Lewis's view seems to me even more bizarre than the usual notions of transworld identification that it replaces. (Kripke 1980:45 note 13.)

One way to spell out the meaning of Kripke's claim is by the following imaginary dialogue: (Based on Sider MS)

:Against: Kripke means that Humphrey himself doesn’t have the property of possibly winning the election, because it is only the counterpart that wins.

:For: The property of possibly winning the election is the property of the counterpart.

:Against: But they can't be the same property because Humphrey has different attitudes to them: he cares about he himself having the property of possibly winning the election.  He doesn’t care about the counterpart having the property of possibly winning the election.

:For: But properties don't work the same way as objects, our attitudes towards them can be different, because we have different descriptions – they are still the same properties. That lesson is taught by the [[paradox of analysis]].

CT is inadequate if it can't translate all modal sentences or intuitions. Fred Feldman mentioned two sentences (Feldman 1971):
: (1) I could have been quite unlike what I in fact am.
: (2) I could have been more like what you in fact are than like what I in fact am. At the same time, you could have been more like what I in fact am than what you in fact are.

'''DAMP'''—deficits in [[attention]], [[motor control]] and [[perception]]—is a controversial psychiatric concept conceived by [[Christopher Gillberg]].

DAMP is similar to [[minimal brain dysfunction]] (MBD), a concept that was formulated in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Rydelius 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rydelius PA |title=DAMP and MBD versus AD/HD and hyperkinetic disorders |journal=Acta Paediatr. |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=266–8 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10772271 |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2000.tb01327.x |url=http://www.informath.org/apprise/a6400/b2067.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both concepts are related to certain psychiatric conditions, such as hyperactivity. The concept of MBD was strongly criticized by Sir [[Michael Rutter]] [Gillberg, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;904] and several other researchers, and this led to its abandonment in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Rydelius 2000"/&gt; At the same time, research showed that something similar was needed. One alternative concept was [[ADHD]] (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Gillberg proposed another alternative: DAMP. Gillberg's concept was formulated in the early 1980s, and the term itself was introduced in a paper that Gillberg published in 1986 (see Gillberg&amp;nbsp;[1986]). (DAMP is essentially MBD without the [[etiology (medicine)|etiological]] assumptions.&lt;ref name="Sonuga-Barke 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonuga-Barke|first1=Edmund J. S.|title=On the Intersection Between AD/HD and DCD: The DAMP Hypothesis|journal=[[Child and Adolescent Mental Health]]|volume=8|issue=3|year=2003| pages=114–116| issn=1475-357X|doi=10.1111/1475-3588.00055|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-3588.00055/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The concept of DAMP met with considerable criticism. For example, Sir [[Michael Rutter]] stated that the concept of DAMP (unlike ADHD) was "muddled" and "lacks both internal coherence and external discriminative validity ... it has no demonstrated treatment or prognostic implications"; he concluded that the concept should be abandoned.&lt;ref name= Gallup&gt;Gallup et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the criticism of Per-Anders Rydelius, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the [[Karolinska Institute]], who argued that the definition of DAMP was too vague: "the borderline between DAMP and conduct disorders [is] unclear ... the borderline between DAMP and ADHD [is] unclear"; he concluded that "the concept is in need of revision".&lt;ref name="Rydelius 2000"/&gt; And in 2000, Eva Kärfve, a sociologist at the [[Lund University|University of Lund]], published a book which argued that Gillberg's work on DAMP should be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Kärfve, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the strongest criticism of DAMP is that Gillberg and his co-workers in Gothenburg are almost the only people doing research on DAMP. Indeed, in a review of DAMP published by Gillberg in 2003, it was noted that there were only "about 50" research papers that had been published on DAMP and that the "vast majority of these have either originated in the author's own clinical and research setting or have been supervised and/or co-authored by him" [Gillberg, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;904]. This is in contrast to ADHD, on which "several thousand papers" had been published [Gillberg, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;905]. As far as clinical practice goes, DAMP has been primarily accepted only in Gillberg's native Sweden and in Denmark [Gillberg, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;904], and even in those countries acceptance is mixed.

In 2003, Gillberg revised his definition of DAMP. The new definition is as follows:
# ADHD as defined in [[DSM-IV]]; 
# [[Developmental coordination disorder|Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)]] as defined in DSM-IV; 
# condition not better accounted for by [[cerebral palsy]]; and 
# IQ should be higher than about 50 [Gillberg, 2003: box&amp;nbsp;1]. (In  the [[WHO]] [[ICD|system]], this would be a [[hyperkinetic disorder]] combined with a [[Developmental coordination disorder|developmental disorder of motor function]].) About half of children with ADHD are believed to also have DCD [Gillberg, 2003; Martin et&amp;nbsp;al., 2006&lt;ref&gt;Martin et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;].

Strong criticism of DAMP, however, has continued.&lt;ref name="Sonuga-Barke 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it has been observed that "the validity and utility of DAMP will remain unclear until stronger evidence of the special status of the overlap between its constituent disorders is provided".&lt;ref name="Sonuga-Barke 2003"/&gt;

In 2005, there was an hour-long television program broadcast on Swedish TV, questioning why Sweden, almost alone in the world, would accept the DAMP construct.&lt;ref&gt;Bagge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The program featured critical commentary from Sir Michael Rutter. It also considered some of the controversies over [[Gillberg's Gothenburg study]].

The concept of DAMP (deficits in attention, motor control, and perception) has been in clinical use in Scandinavia for about 20 years. DAMP is diagnosed on the basis of concomitant attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and developmental coordination disorder in children who do not have severe learning disability or cerebral palsy. In clinically severe form it affects about 1.5% of the general population of school age children; another few per cent are affected by more moderate variants. Boys are overrepresented; girls are currently probably underdiagnosed. There are many comorbid problems/overlapping conditions, including conduct disorder, depression/anxiety, and academic failure. There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and perinatal risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP. Outcome in early adult age was psychosocially poor in one study in almost 60% of unmedicated cases. There are effective interventions available for many of the problems encountered in DAMP.

'''Despeciation''' is the loss of a unique species of animal due to its combining with another previously distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despeciation|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=24093|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[Speciation]] and is much more rare.  It is similar to extinction in that there is a loss of a unique [[species]] but without the associated loss of a biological lineage.

[[Image:Gasterosteus aculeatus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[three-spined stickleback]] (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'')]]
For example, Taylor et al.'s genetic analysis of [[three-spined stickleback]]s across six lakes in southwestern [[British Columbia]] found two distinct species in 1977 and 1988 but only one combined species in data from 1997, 2000, and 2002.&lt;ref name=MolEcol&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor EB, Boughman JW, Groenenboom M, Sniatynski M, Schluter D, Gow JL|title=Speciation in reverse: morphological and genetic evidence of the collapse of a three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) species pair.|journal=Mol Ecol|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They concluded that external factors had imperiled the living conditions of the two species, thus eliminating the evolutionary specializations that had kept them unique.

{{Jainism}}
Jain texts assign a wide range of meaning to the [[Sanskrit]] '''''dharma''''' or [[Prakrit]] '''''dhamma'''''. It is often translated as “religion” and as such, [[Jainism]] is called ''Jain Dharma'' by its adherents. 

In Jainism, the word ''Dharma'' is used to refer the following:
#Religion
#Dharma as a [[dravya (Jainism)|dravya]] (substance or a reality) (the principle of motion)
#The true nature of a thing
#Ten virtues like forgiveness, etc. also called ten forms of Dharma

== Religion ==
Usage of the word ''dharma'' in reference to the religion.

===Ahimsa as Dharma===

{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}

According to Jain texts, Ahimsa is the greatest Dharma (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः [ahiṃsā paramo dharmaḥ]: "non-violence is the highest religion") and there is no religion equal to the religion of non-violence.

=== Dharma bhāvanā ===
Jain texts prescribe meditation on twelve forms of reflection (''bhāvanā'') for those who wish to stop the influx of ''karmas'' that extend transmigration.{{sfn|C.R. Jain|1929|p=52}} One such reflection is ''Dharma bhāvanā''-
{{quote|The faith promulgated by Jina is characterized by non- injury, based on truth, with humility as its root, forbearance as its strength, safeguarded by celibacy, dominated by quietism and characterized by restraint and non-attachment as its support. Without attaining it living beings have been wandering in the beginningless mundane existence, undergoing sufferings and misery owing to the rise of inauspicious karmas. If true faith is attained, one is bound to achieve emancipation, after enjoying several kinds of worldly prosperity and distinction. This is contemplating what is stressed in religion. This promotes constant devotion to religion. (12){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=154}}}}

=== Conduct ===

In Jainism, the ''dharma'' (conduct or path) of the householder ([[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]) is distinguished from the conduct of an ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} verse  296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Haribhadra, Dharmabindu&lt;/ref&gt; Sravaka-dharma is the religious path for the virtuous householders, where charity and worship are the primary duties. The dharma of a householders consists of observance of twelve vows i.e. five minor vows and seven disciplinary vows.
Sramana-dharma is the religious path of the virtuous ascetics, where mediatation and study of scriptures is their primary duty. The religion of monks consists of five ''[[Mahavrata]]s'' or great vows. They are endowed with right faith, right knowledge and right conduct and engaged in complete self-restraint and penances.

==The nature of a substance==
According to Jainism, Universe and its constituents are uncreated and everlasting. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is ''vatthu sahāvo dhammo'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true dharma."

==Dharma substance==
Dharma is one of the  six substances constituting the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} Verse 624&lt;/ref&gt; These substances are – Dharma  (medium of motion),  Adharma (medium of rest), Akasa (space), kala (time), Pudgala (matter) and Jiva (soul). Since Dharma as a substance extends and pervades entire universe, it is also known as Dharmastikaya. It helps the matter and souls in movement. It itself is not motion, but is a medium of motion. Adharma is opposite of Dharma i.e. it assists the substances like soul and matter to rest.

==Samyaktva - Rationality of perception, knowledge and conduct==
{{Main|Ratnatraya}}
According to Jainism, ''[[Samyak darsana]]'' (Rational Perception), ''Samyak jnana'' (Rational Knowledge) and ''Samyak caritra'' (Rational Conduct) collectively also known as ''Ratnatraya'' or the "Three Jewels of Jainism" constitute the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Kuhn  | first =Hermann  | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate  | publisher =Crosswind Publishing  | year =2001  | location =Wunstorf, Germany  | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samyak Darsana''' or rational perception is the rational faith in the true nature of every substances of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Samyak Jnana''' or rational knowledge is the right knowledge of true and relevant knowledge of the reality, the tattvas. It incorporates the two principles of  [[Anekantvada]] or non-absolutism and [[Syadvada]] or relativity of truth. Right knowledge must be free from three main defects: doubt, delusion, and indefiniteness. '''Samyak Caritra''' or rational conduct is the natural conduct of a (soul) living being. It consists in following austerities, engaging in right activities and observance of vows, carefulness and controls.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} Verse 262 - 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Virtues as Dharma==

According to the Jain text, [[Tattvarthsutra]], following are the ten virtues (''das-dharma'').{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=146}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} verse 84&lt;/ref&gt;-
#Supreme forgiveness
#Supreme humility
#Supreme straightforwardness
#Supreme truthfulness
#Supreme purity
#Supreme self-restraint
#Supreme penance
#Supreme renunciation
#Supreme non-possessiveness
#Supreme celibacy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''Enterprise liability''' is a [[legal doctrine]] under which individual entities (for example, otherwise legally unrelated corporations or people) can be held [[Joint and several liability|jointly liable]] for some action on the basis of being part of a shared enterprise. Enterprise liability is a form of [[secondary liability]].

==United States==
Suppose high-risk manufacturing activities are shunted into one corporation, while a second "marketing" corporation keeps all the profits.  In the case that someone was injured by the manufacturing activity, a court might apply the enterprise liability doctrine to allow recovery from the marketing corporation, which holds all the assets.

The doctrine emerged from litigation in the wake of the 1977 [[Beverly Hills Supper Club fire]].&lt;ref name="alexander2005"&gt;Alexander, Roberta Sue (2005). ''A place of recourse: a history of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, 1803-2003.'' Ohio University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8214-1602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhfire1982"&gt;''In Re: Beverly Hills Fire Litigation'', 695 F.2d 207 (6th Cir. 1982), cert, denied 461 US 929 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhfire1984"&gt;''In Re: Beverly Hills Fire Litigation'', 672 S.W.2d 922 (Ky.1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is examined in ''[[Walkovsky v. Carlton]]'', 223 N.E.2d 6 ([[New York Court of Appeals|N.Y.]] 1966).

Enterprise Liability has been used as alternative terminology for [[Industry-Wide Liability]].&lt;ref name="Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories 1980"&gt;Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, 607 P.2d 924 (Cal. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'', 607 P.2d 924 (Cal. 1980) cites ''[[Hall v. E.I Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., Inc.]]'', 345 F.Supp. 353 (E.D.N.Y. 1972) to explain Industry-Wide Liability, which was equated to Enterprise Liability:

{{Cquote|In ''Hall'', plaintiffs were 13 children injured by the explosion of blasting caps in 12 separate incidents which occurred in 10 different states between 1955 and 1959. The defendants were six blasting cap manufacturers, comprising virtually the entire blasting cap industry in the United States, and their trade association. There were, however, a number of Canadian blasting cap manufacturers which could have supplied the caps. The gravamen of the complaint was that the practice of the industry of omitting a warning on individual blasting caps and of failing to take other safety measures created an unreasonable risk of harm, resulting in the plaintiffs' injuries. 

The complaint did not identify a particular manufacturer of a cap which caused a particular injury. The court reasoned as follows: there was evidence that defendants, acting independently, had adhered to an industry-wide standard with regard to the safety features of blasting caps, that they had in effect delegated some functions of safety investigation and design, such as labeling, to their trade association, and that there was industry-wide cooperation in the manufacture and design of blasting caps. In these circumstances, the evidence supported a conclusion that all the defendants jointly controlled the risk. Thus, if plaintiffs could establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the caps were manufactured by one of the defendants, the burden of proof as to causation would shift to all the defendants. 

The court noted that this theory of liability applied to industries composed of a small number of units, and that what would be fair and reasonable with regard to an industry of five or ten producers might be manifestly unreasonable if applied to a decentralized industry composed of countless small producers.&lt;ref name="Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories 1980"/&gt;}}

The concept of Enterprise Liability is distinguished from [[Market share liability]], a legal doctrine introduced in ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories''.&lt;ref name="Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories 1980"/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|UK company law|English tort law}}
The idea of enterprise liability was supported by the Court of Appeal in ''[[DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council]]'', a case on [[piercing the corporate veil]].&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 1 WLR 852&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally in the law of [[English tort law|tort]], the principle has been argued to have been recognised, albeit indirectly, by cases such as ''[[Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2001] UKHL 22, critiqued by [[S Deakin]], '‘Enterprise‐Risk’: The Juridical Nature of the Firm Revisited' (2003) [http://ilj.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/2/97.short 32(2) ILJ 97]&lt;/ref&gt; A general principle of joint liability in tort between different contractors that work in a supply chain was also recognised in ''[[Viasystems Ltd v Thermal Transfer Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2005] EWCA Civ 1151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Excess Noise Ratio is primarily used in connection with noise diodes which are a common method of measuring the noise performance of an [[amplifier]]. The measurement technique is described in detail in application notes such as Keysight Application note 57-2 "Noise Figure Measurement Accuracy - The Y-Factor method." By using a noise diode, the output noise of the amplifier is measured using two input noise levels (the Excess Noise Ratio) and by measuring the output noise factor (referred to as Y) the noise figure of the amplifier can be determined without having to measure the amplifier gain.

== Background ==
Any amplifier generates noise. In a radio receiver the first stage dominates the overall noise of the receiver and in most cases thermal, or Johnson noise, determines the overall noise performance of a receiver. As radio signals decrease in size the noise at the input of the receiver will determine a lower threshold of what can be received. The level of noise is determined by calculating the noise in a 50 ohm resistor at the input of the receiver as follows:

P&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; = kTB

where:

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38 x 10-23 joule / k

T= Temperature (Kelvin)

B = Bandwidth (Hz)

Thus it can be see that receivers with a narrow bandwidth have a higher sensitivity than receivers with a large bandwidth and that input noise can be decreased by putting the receiver input stage at a cold temperature.

A noise diode is a device which has a defined Excess Noise Ratio.

When the diode is off (unpowered) the noise from it will be thermal noise defined by the above formula. The bandwidth to be used is the bandwidth of the receiver.

When the diode is on (powered) the noise from it will be increased from the thermal noise by a figure called the "Excess Noise Ratio". This figure could be 6&amp;nbsp;dB for testing an amplifier with 40&amp;nbsp;dB gain and could be 16&amp;nbsp;dB for an amplifier with less gain or higher noise.

To determine the noise figure of an amplifier we use a noise diode at the input to the amplifier and determine the output noise "Y" with the diode switched on and off.

With knowledge of Y and a knowledge of ENR we can then determine the amount of noise contributed by the amplifier and hence we can calculate the noise figure of the amplifier.

Other techniques exist for making this measurement but either require accurate measurements of impedance or are inaccurate.

The following formula relates Y-factor to ENR:

&lt;math&gt; NF=10\log_{10}\frac{10^{(ENR/10)}}{10^{(Y/10)} -1}     &lt;/math&gt;

== Measurements ==

Noise figure measurements can be made with a noise diode, a power supply for the noise diode, and a spectrum analyser. They can also be made with a specialist noise figure meter. The advantage of the noise figure meter is that it will automatically switch the noise diode on and off, giving a continuous reading of Y; it will also have the correct bandwidths in its receiver to average the received noise in an optimum fashion. However, accurate noise figure measurements are possible with the noise figure meter and a spectrum analyser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9756">{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Gavaevodata''' (''{{transl|ae|gav-aēvō.dātā}}'') is the [[Avestan language]] name of the primordial bovine of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] cosmogony and cosmology, one&lt;!-- see footnotes --&gt; of [[Ahura Mazda]]'s six&lt;!-- see footnotes --&gt; primordial material creations and  the mythological progenitor of all beneficent animal life.

The primordial beast is killed in the creation myth, but from its marrow, organs and ''cithra''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra"&gt;The precise meaning of this word in this context is unknown. It is traditionally translated as "seed", which in the sense of "prototype" carries the connotation of a particular physical form or appearance. But the word can also mean "seed" in the sense of a "race, stock", which Gavaevodata &amp;ndash; as the primordial animal &amp;ndash; is the apical ancestor of.&lt;/ref&gt; the world is repopulated with animal life. The soul of the primordial bovine &amp;ndash; ''geush urvan'' &amp;ndash; returned to the world as the soul of livestock. Although ''geush urvan'' is an aspect of the primordial bovine in Zoroastrian tradition, and may also be that in the Younger Avesta, the relationship between the two is unclear in the oldest texts.

==In scripture==
Although Avestan ''gav-'' "cow" is grammatically feminine, the word is also used as a singular for the collective "cattle". In English language translations Gavaevodata is often referred to in gender-neutral terms as "primordial ox". Other translations refer to Gavaevodata as a [[bull]] (''cf.'' {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=139}}). The ''-aevo.data'' of the name literally means "created as one" or "solely created" or "uniquely created".

Gavaevodata is only alluded to in the surviving texts of the [[Avesta]], referred to by name in only two hymns. In other instances, for example in ''Yasht''&amp;nbsp;13.85, the primordial beast is mentioned among the six&lt;!-- see  footnote --&gt; material creations, but not by name. Elsewhere, such as in the Gathic Avestan ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', prayers are offered on behalf of the soul of the cow (''geush urvan'', ''Y.''&amp;nbsp;35), or worship is offered to "the cow's soul, and to her created body" (''Y''.&amp;nbsp;39), but in neither case is Gavaevodata mentioned by name, nor is it clear (unlike in Zoroastrian tradition) whether the soul of the cow is the soul of Gavaevodata.

This is also the case for ''The Cow's Lament'' in ''Yasna''&amp;nbsp;29, which – as a ''Gatha'' – is attributed to Zoroaster himself, and is thus the subject of a great deal of interpretation. In this allegorical text, the soul of the cow (''geush urvan'') despairs over the wretched condition to which the forces of deceit (''[[druj]]'') have subjected her (see myth, [[#In tradition|below]]), and over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. The divinities hold council, and decide that Zoroaster is the only one who can alleviate her condition. At first she laments even more, holding Zoroaster to be incompetent, but finally accepts his assistance.

At least two levels of meaning have been inferred from this text ({{harvnb|Malandra|2001|p=577}}): The maltreated creature symbolizes the plight of Zoroaster's community, and the soul of the primordial beast is a metaphor for the message that Zoroaster has received from Mazda. In verse&amp;nbsp;3 of the litany to the moon (''Mah Niyayesh''&amp;nbsp;3), Gavaevodata is invoked as (or together with) the "bovine of many species" in the care of the moon [[Mah]], specifically ''måŋha- gaociθra-'' "the moon that keeps in it the ''cithra''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; of cattle," which is a stock epithet of ''Mah'' (''Yasht''&amp;nbsp;7.3, 7.5, 7.6, ''GBd''&amp;nbsp;VIe.2-3, VII.5-6 etc.)

In the 30&amp;nbsp;hymns to the divinities of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] month, Gavaevodata is again invoked in the verses nominally dedicated to the &lt;!-- caps --&gt;Moon. In both ''Siroza''&amp;nbsp;1.12 and 2.12, Mah is again referred to as "the &lt;!-- caps --&gt;Moon containing the ''cithra'' of cattle," and Gavaevodata is again referred to as (or in the company of) the "Bovine of many species."

==In tradition==
The mythology of the "uniquely created bovine" that is only alluded to in the extant Avesta appears fully developed in the 9th-11th century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. In these texts, Avestan Gavaevodata appears as [[Middle Persian]] ''gaw i ew-dad'' or ''ewazdad'' or ''ewagdad,'' and retains the same literal meaning as the Avestan language form.

As also for all other Zoroastrian cosmological beliefs, the primary source of information on the primordial ox is the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a 9th-century text.  In this text, the primordial ox is a [[hermaphrodite]], having both milk (''Ibd''&amp;nbsp;43.15) and semen (''Ibd''&amp;nbsp;94.4). It is "white, bright like the moon, and three measured poles in height" (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;Ia.12). The uniquely created ox lived its life on the river Veh. Daiti (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;Ia.12), and on the opposite bank lived Gayomart/d (Avestan ''Gayo maretan''), the mythical first human.

Gawi ewdad's role in the creation myth runs as follows: During the first three-thousand year period, [[Ahura Mazda]]'s (''Ormuzd'') fashioned the bovine as His fourth or fifth&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The primordial bovine is either the fifth or the fourth creation, depending on which enumeration is followed. The number of material creations varies as well, and is either six or seven, subject to whether fire is included as the seventh and last of the material creations. The Greater ''Bundahishn'' has Gawi ewdad as the fifth of seven creations.&lt;/ref&gt; of six&lt;!-- see footnote --&gt; primordial material creations. At the beginning of the second three-thousand year period, [[Angra Mainyu]] (''Ahriman'') attacked the world, and the Creator responded by placing the primordial plant, bovine, and human in the respective heavenly spheres of the stars, moon and sun (''IBd''&amp;nbsp;7). But Ahriman assaulted the sky and Ormuzd fed the bovine "medicinal ''mang''" (''mang bēšaz''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Middle Persian ''mang'' refers to either henbane (e.g. ''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'') or datura (''[[Datura stramonium]]'') or hemp (e.g. ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'').&lt;!-- i.e. not hashish, which is what NP bang refers to--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) to lessen its suffering (''GBd''&amp;nbsp;IV.20). The bull immediately became feeble, and then died.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite book |author=Henning |title=Zoroaster: Politician or witch doctor? |page=32}} suggests that the author meant a euthanasiac was administered. For contra, see {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=231, n. 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But as it lay dying its ''chihr''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; was rescued and carried to "the moon station."&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The "moon station" being referred to is the station of the moon known in Middle Persian as  ''pesh Parwez'' "before (in front of) Parwez," with Parwez being the Middle Persian equivalent of Avestan ''paoiryaeinyas'', the [[Pleiades]].&lt;!-- An allusion in  ''Dadestan-i Denig''&amp;nbsp;37.46 suggests that (the nebulae of) the Pleiades were once mythologically identified as the ''chihr'' of the primordial bovine. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the care of the moon, the ''chihr''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; of the beast was purified and became the male and female pairs of the animals "of many species." After the ox's death, fifty-five kinds of grain and twelve kinds of medicinal plants grew from its marrow (''Ibd'' 10). In another passage  (''Ibd'' 93.11, ''cf'' an equivalent passage in  ''Zadspram''), the ''Bundahishn'' speaks of sesame, lentils, leeks, grapes, mustard and marjoram issuing from various other parts of its body. For example, lentils from the liver and mustard from the lungs&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For the reconstruction of the Avestan word for mustard (identified in Zoroastrian tradition with healthy lungs), and its homophonic similarity to the Middle Persian word for lungs, see {{citation |last=Henning |first=Walter Bruno |title=A grain of mustard |journal=Annali dell' Istituto Orientale di Napoli |series=Sezione Linguistica |volume=6 |year=1965 |pages=29–31}} (''Selected Papers&amp;nbsp;II'', pp.&amp;nbsp;597-599).&lt;/ref&gt; (''Ibd'' 14.1, ''Gbd'' XIII.2&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In several translations (e.g. the Anklesaria or West ''Bundahishn''s) of Middle Persian texts, Middle Persian ''sipandan'' "mustard" is mis-translated as "(wild) rue." This is due to a confusion of mustard (Middle Persian ''sipandan'') with ''[[harmal|s(i)pand]]'', which is so-called &lt;!-- not rue at all --&gt;"Syrian rue."&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Goshorun (from Avestan ''[[geush urvan]]''), the soul of the primordial bovine, escaped to the star, moon, and sun stations where she lamented the destruction of the world. She was not placated until Ormuzd shows her the ''[[fravashi]]'' of the yet-unborn [[Zoroaster]] (whose  protection she would receive). Contented with the promise of protection, Goshorun then agreed to be "created back to the world in livestock." (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;IVa.2ff,  ''Ibd'''&amp;nbsp;46.3ff., ''[[Denkard]]''&amp;nbsp;p.9).

{{Contains special characters}}
{{nihongo|'''[[Gyaru]]-moji'''|ギャル文字||"gal's alphabet"}} or {{nihongo|'''Heta-moji'''|下手文字||"poor handwriting"}}, is a style of obfuscated ([[cant (language)|cant]]) [[Japanese writing system|Japanese writing]] popular amongst urban [[Japan]]ese youth.

Like the [[English language|English]] phenomenon of [[SMS language]], it is most often used for sending [[cell phone]] [[text messages]], but while text is used as a form of informal shorthand, a message typed in gyaru-moji usually requires more characters and effort than the same message typed in plain Japanese. Since writing in gyaru-moji requires extra effort, and due to the perception of [[confidentiality]], sending gyaru-moji messages to a peer is seen as a sign of informality or friendship. The origin of this style is unclear but it has been proposed that magazines targeted at teenage girls first made it popular, and the phenomenon started to gain wider attention in media around 2002.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The style has been met with increasing criticism, as its use continues to expand.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  Reported instances of girls using the writing in school work, [[Office lady|OL]]s (Office Ladies) adopting the style in the workplace, and gyaru-moji being used in [[karaoke]] subtitling, are examples of this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Laura Miller has analyzed gyaru moji as an example of gender resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Miller. 2011. “Subversive script and novel graphs in Japanese girls’ culture.” ''Language &amp; Communication'' Vol. 31, Issue 1: 16-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Like [[leet]], gyaru-moji replaces characters with visually similar characters or combinations of characters. [[Hiragana]] consisting of connected strokes are replaced by symbols or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters: for example, す (''su'') may be rendered as the [[section sign|section symbol]] &lt;code&gt;§&lt;/code&gt;. Hiragana consisting of detached elements are replaced by sequences of kana, Western letters, or symbols. For example, ほ (''ho'') may be typed as &lt;code&gt;|ま&lt;/code&gt; ([[vertical bar]] and hiragana ''ma'') or &lt;code&gt;(ま&lt;/code&gt; (open [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parenthesis]] and ''ma''), け (''ke'') may be typed as &lt;code&gt;レナ&lt;/code&gt; (katakana ''re na''), &lt;code&gt;Iナ&lt;/code&gt; (capital i, ''na''), or &lt;code&gt;(†&lt;/code&gt; (open parenthesis, [[dagger (typography)|dagger]]), and た (ta) may be typed as &lt;code&gt;ナ=&lt;/code&gt; (katakana ''na'', equals sign) or &lt;code&gt;†こ&lt;/code&gt; (dagger, hiragana ''ko'').  [[Katakana]] is frequently replaced by similar-looking [[kanji]], such as 世 for セ (se) or 干 for チ (chi), in a reversal of the process that turned [[man'yōgana]] into [[kana]]. Kana and [[romaji|rōmaji]] may be mixed freely, even within a word, and [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]] in rōmaji may be replaced with similar-looking [[Cyrillic]] letters, such as replacing N with И ([[I (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic I]]). Compound [[kanji]] are decomposed into left and right elements, which are written as individual kanji or kana. For example, the kanji 好 in 好き, meaning "like, enjoy" may be split into 女子 (the kanji for woman and child, respectively).

In addition to the basic obfuscation provided by character replacement, another technique used to disguise the content of the message is to use vocabulary and grammar that is uncharacteristic of standard usage.&lt;ref name="GalMojiDotCom"&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:『ギャル文字一括変換装置』|url=http://www.gal-moji.com/moji/gyaru_moji.asp
|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with character substitution, this can make the meaning of the message almost unintelligible to those not “in the know”. This is analogous to the use of leet’s specialized grammar. However, the flexible nature of the [[Japanese language]] means that although gyaru-moji phrases sound peculiar to someone expecting formal or even commonly [[colloquial]] Japanese, they are often technically still grammatically correct.

For example, the sentence {{Nihongo2|「私は今とても良い気分です。」}} (“Watashi wa ima totemo yoi kibun desu.”) is “Right now I am feeling very good.” in standard normal-polite Japanese.
By first rewording this as {{Nihongo2|「超気持ちいい！」}} or {{Nihongo2|「チョーキモチイイ！」}} (“Chōkimochi ii!”) – which roughly translates as “(I have a) Super good feeling!” – and then converting to gyaru-moji to get {{Nihongo2|「走召 氣 持 ち ぃ ぃ !」}} or {{Nihongo2|「于∋─≠モ于ｲｲ！」}}, the message could prove difficult for those not versed in the style to understand.

'''''[[In-situ]]'' conservation''' is the on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]] or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]], such as [[forest genetic resources]] in natural populations of Teagan species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC|title=Biodiversity and Its Conservation in India|last=Negi|first=Sharad Singh|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788185182889|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], either by protecting or restoring the habitat itself, or by defending the species from [[Predation|predators]]. It is applied to conservation of [[agricultural biodiversity]] in [[agro ecosystem]]s by farmers, especially those using unconventional farming practices.


==Methods==
About 4% of the total geographical area of the country is used for ''in situ'' conservation. The following methods are presently used for ''in situ'' conservation.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! In-situ conservation !! Number available
|-
| Biosphere reserves || 18
|-
| National parks || 104
|-
| Wild-life sanctuaries || 543
|-
| Biodiversity hotspots || 4
|-
|}

===Biosphere reserve===
Biosphere reserves cover very large areas, often more than 5000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They are used to protect species for a long time. Currently, there are 18 Biosphere Reserves in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State
|-
| Nanda Devi || Uttarakhand
|-
| Nokrek || Meghalaya
|-
| Manas || Assam
|-
|Sundarban || West Bengal
|
|}

===National parks===
A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about 100 to 500 square kilometers. Within biosphere reserves, one or more national parks may also exist. Currently, there are 103 national parks in India.

|-
| Ranthambore National Park || Rajasthan || Tiger
|}

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
A wildlife sanctuary is an area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only. Currently, there are 543 wild sanctuaries in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State !! Major wildlife
|-
| Hazaribagh sanctuary || Jharkhand || Tiger, leopard

|-
| Mudumalai Wild life Sanctuary || Tamil Nadu || Tiger, elephant, leopard
|-
| Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary || Tamil Nadu || Water birds
|}
{| class="wikitable"

===Biodiversity Hotspots===
According to Conservation international, to qualify as a hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria :
 
• it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (∆ 0.5% of the world's total) as endemics,

• it has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.

|}

===Gene sanctuary===
A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved.
It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks.
India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus. Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana, sugarcane, rice and mango.

===Community reserves===
It is the type of protected area introduced in Wildlife Protection Amendment Act 2002 to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary.

===Sacred groves===
They are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection.

==Benefits==
One benefit of ''in situ'' conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties. Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments. As a last resort, [[ex-situ conservation]] may be used on some or all of the population, when ''in situ'' conservation is too difficult, or impossible. The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought, floods, forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient.

==Reserves==
Wildlife and livestock conservation is mostly based on nothing. This involves the protection of wildlife habitats. Also, sufficiently large reserves are maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers. The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary [[genetic diversity]] to survive within the population, so that it has a good chance of continuing to [[Adaptation (biology)|adapt]] and [[evolution|evolve]] over time. This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations. The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man, and against other catastrophes.

==Agriculture==
In [[agriculture]], ''in situ conservation'' techniques are an effective way to improve, maintain, and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops. Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers' experience and field work.

First, the accessions of a variety stored at a [[germplasm]] bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] constraints. Or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;G. Avila, L. Guzmán, M. Céspedes 2004.

==Description==
Typically, a parent may take a sick child to a traditional healer, who will look in the child's mouth and attribute the illness to "[[tooth worms]]". The healer will point out the small, white, developing [[Tooth development#The developing tooth bud|tooth buds]] as being "tooth worms", and then dig the "worms" out of the gums without [[anaesthesia]] using a non-sterile tool such as a hot or sharpened nail, a bicycle spoke, or a knitting needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Harm==
This practice inflicts pain and suffering on a child who may already be sick (or who may be teething), and in some cases it is carried out on a healthy child in a bid to prevent illness. The procedure may lead to shock, and loss of blood may lead to [[anaemia]]. The unhygienic methods can cause [[blood infection]]s, [[tetanus]], pass on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and can on occasion be fatal.&lt;ref name="john"&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''instantiation principle''' or '''principle of instantiation''' or '''principle of exemplification''' is the [[concept]] in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]] (first put forward by [[David Malet Armstrong]]) that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified [[property (philosophy)|properties]] (or [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.

To make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The property of being red would exist even if all red things were to be destroyed, because it has been instantiated. This broadens the range of properties which exist if the principle is true. 

Those who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as ''in re'' (in thing or in reality) realists or '[[immanent realist]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{quantum field theory}}
A '''gauge theory''' is a type of [[Scientific theory|theory]] in [[physics]]. The word '''gauge''' means a [[Measurement|measurement]], a thickness, an in-between distance, (as in [[Track gauge|railroad tracks]]) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of [[Field (physics)|fields]], e.g., the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and fields that describe forces between the [[elementary particles]]. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the elemental mass of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a '''gauge transformation''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (2004) ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', p. 451. For an alternative formulation in terms of symmetries of the [[Lagrangian density]], see p. 489. Also see J. D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called '''gauge invariance'''. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of "color" would show '''gauge invariance'''. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], gauge invariance is sometimes called '''gauge symmetry'''. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.

For example, in electromagnetism the electric and magnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B''' are observable, while the potentials ''V'' ("voltage") and '''A''' (the [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]) are not.&lt;ref&gt;For an argument that ''V'' and '''A''' are more fundamental, see Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, '''The Feynman Lectures''', Addison Wesley Longman, 1970, II-15-7,8,12, but this is partly a matter of personal preference.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to ''V'', no observable change occurs in '''E''' or '''B'''.

With the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, and with successive advances in [[quantum field theory]], the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces ([[fundamental interaction]]s) arise from the constraints imposed by [[local symmetry|''local'' gauge symmetries]], in which case the transformations vary from point to point in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called [[gauge boson]]s. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the [[Standard Model]], a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except [[gravity]].

==History and importance==

The earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s formulation, in 1864–65, of [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]  ("[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]"). The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{when|date=September 2015}}  Later [[Hermann Weyl]], inspired by success in Einstein's [[general relativity]], conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in year 1919 that invariance under the change of [[scale (measurement)|scale]] or "gauge" (a term inspired by the various [[track gauge]]s of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Weyl]] (1919), "Eine neue Erweiterung der Relativitíatstheorie," ''Ann. der Physik'' '''59''', 101–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriyasu1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Moriyasu|title=An Elementary Primer for Gauge Theory|year=1983|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9971-950-83-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5, 12}}  Although Weyl's choice of the gauge was incorrect, the name "gauge" stuck to the approach.  After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], Weyl, [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and [[Fritz London|London]] modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave [[phase (waves)|phase]], and applying it successfully to electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;For a review and references, see [[Lochlainn O’Raifeartaigh]] and Norbert Straumann, "Gauge theory: Historical origins and some modern developments," ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 72 (2000), pp. 1–22, {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] in an attempt to describe the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]]. This idea, dubbed [[Yang–Mills theory]], later found application in the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[weak force]], and its unification with electromagnetism in the [[electroweak]] theory.

The importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the [[quantum field theory|quantum-mechanical behavior]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] and the [[strong force]]. This gauge theory, known as the [[Standard model|Standard Model]], accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.

==In classical physics==

===Electromagnetism===
{{Main|Gauge fixing}}
Historically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical [[electromagnetism]].{{clarify|post-text=Not for classical gravitational fields?|date=September 2015}} A static electric field can be described in terms of an [[electric potential]] (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or [[electrical ground|ground]]. But only ''differences'' in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a [[voltmeter]] must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Purcell (1963) ''Electricity and Magnetism''. McGraw-Hill: 38.&lt;/ref&gt; If the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.

Generalizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''', which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto ''V'', one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If '''A''' is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same '''E''' and '''B''' fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields '''E''' and '''B''' and the potentials ''V'' and '''A''' is given in the article [[Gauge fixing]], along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore [[Maxwell's equations]] are still satisfied.

Gauge symmetry is closely related to [[charge conservation]]. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge ''q'' at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and destroying it released ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which would seem natural since ''qV'' measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the energies of creation and destruction ''would'' allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge ''q'' at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V+C&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Perkins (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The Cartesian coordinate grid on this square has been distorted by a coordinate transformation, so that there is a nonlinear relationship between the old (x,y) coordinates and the new ones. Einstein's equations of general relativity are still valid in the new coordinate system. Such changes of coordinate system are the gauge transformations of general relativity.]]

===General relativity===
As discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) [[general relativity]] are arbitrary coordinate transformations.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"&gt;[[Robert M. Wald]] (1984) ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press: 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] an arbitrary number of times.

====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====
Some global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] introduced the notion of [[Galilean transformation|translation invariance]]{{when|date=September 2015}}, an advancement from the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.

Suppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.

Recalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was ''t'', the time of the modern experiment is ''t''+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the [[Big Bang]], and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.

In other words, if in the theory we change the time ''t'' to ''t''+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[John A. Wheeler]] (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein's field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====
In Einstein's [[general relativity]], coordinates like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are not only "relative" in the global sense of translations like &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+C&lt;/math&gt;, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+t^3/t_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; has units of time, and yet [[Einstein's equations]] will have the same form.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as [[general covariance]], and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.

Maxwell's equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein's field equation.

==In quantum mechanics==

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Until the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields '''E''' and '''B''' or the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.

===Aharonov–Bohm experiment===
[[Image:Double slit diffraction.svg|right|thumb|Double-slit diffraction and interference pattern]]

{{Main|Aharonov–Bohm effect}}
In quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the [[double-slit experiment]] is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in [[wave interference|constructive interference]]. The frequency of the electron ''wave'' is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron ''particle'' via the quantum-mechanical relation ''E'' = ''hf''. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.

But now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −''eV'' added to it, where −''e'' is the charge of the electron and ''V'' the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.

[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|left|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid, marked in blue on the diagram.]]

====Explanation with potentials====
It is even possible to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], shown in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1970) ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. Addison Wesley, vol. II, chpt. 15, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field '''B''' to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential '''A''' in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that are fundamental, and not the fields '''E''' and '''B''', we can see that the gauge transformations, which change '''V''' and '''A''', have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.

====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====
Note that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the ''difference'' in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman]] (1985) ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a ''fixed'' amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a ''varying'' amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's "clock" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

===Summary===
In summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., [[quantum electrodynamics]], gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_High_Energy_Physics.html?id=e63cNigcmOUC Introduction to High-Energy Physics]''. Addison-Wesley: 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a [[renormalization|renormalizable]] theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.

===Types of gauge symmetries===
The description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0≤θ&lt;360°, we force it to "wrap around" into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5° is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365°. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the "wrap-around" property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.

In mathematical terminology, electron phases form an [[Abelian group]] under addition, called the [[circle group]] or ''U''(1). "Abelian" means that addition  [[commutative law|commutes]], so that θ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;θ. [[group (mathematics)|Group]] means that addition [[associativity|associates]] and has an [[identity element]], namely "0". Also, for every phase there exists an [[inverse element|inverse]] such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.

[[Image:gauge.png|right|thumb|Gauge fixing of a ''twisted'' cylinder.]]
As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(''x''), where ''x'' measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.

In 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, [[general relativity]] states that gravitational fields have energy, and [[special relativity]] concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The [[nuclear forces]] also have this self-interacting property.

===Gauge bosons===
Surprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of [[superposition principle|superposition]], which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(''x''), where an angle θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum ''p'' of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ''. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by [[derivative|differentiation]]). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.

Again there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(''x''). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ'', which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of ''V'' and '''A'''.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.

Although the function θ(''x'') describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called [[gauge bosons]], where the term "boson" refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory, gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass, as is the case for the gauge bosons that transmit the nuclear decay forces.

[[File:Electric hanukkah menora van.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Local [[Chabad house]] drives around [[Paris]] to get Jewish people interested in [[Hanukka]] services]]

'''Jewish outreach''' is a term sometimes used to translate the [[Hebrew]] word '''''kiruv''''' or '''''keruv''''' (literally, "to draw close" or "in-reach"). Normative [[Judaism]] does not actively seek [[Conversion to Judaism|converts]], although all denominations do accept those with a sincere commitment. Outreach efforts are instead directed at [[Jews]] who have "gone astray", or who have been born Jewish in a non-observant family.&lt;ref name="eJewish Philanthropy"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Outreach, an Unorthodox Approach | website=eJewish Philanthropy | url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/jewish-outreach-an-unorthodox-approach/ | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and contemporary views==
The idea of "Jewish outreach" has mixed support among [[Jews]]; some are against the concept, while others share a vision of a more accessible and inclusive Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Jewish Outreach Institute"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jewish Federation of Greater St. Paul | website=Jewish Outreach Institute | url=https://jewishstpaul.org/community-directory/jewish-outreach-institute | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a country with a large [[Secular Jewish]] population and a 50% intermarriage rate, some Jewish federations and educational organizations provide an extensive range of offerings to the intermarried, to those who are marginally engaged with Jewish life, and to those who haven’t had any involvement in Judaism since attending Hebrew school or right after their [[bar mitzvah]].&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohen | first=Debra Nussbaum | title=Jewish Outreach | website=My Jewish Learning | date=September 30, 2002 | url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Jewish_World_Today/Continuity/Outreach.shtml | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Chabad Lubavitch]]" was the first [[Orthodox Jewish]] organization in the United States to promote outreach means of recruiting  unobservant Jews who commit to living an observant lifestyle. 

[[Rabbi]] Dr. [[Shmuly Yanklowitz]] wrote that "outreach should enrich lives and society by making the [[Torah]]’s wisdom more broadly available. Further, outreach is not only about “one’s own” and we must bring people of different religions together in mutual understanding and respect by engaging in deep interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yanklowitz|first1=Shmuly|title=The Need for Empowering and Ethical Jewish Outreach|url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/the-need-for-empowering-and-ethical-jewish-outreach/|website=ejewishphilanthropy|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Levi Brackman]] said, "with the high rate of assimilation and intermarriage in the West, I cannot imagine that there could be too many outreach workers in the field. The day that happens will be a blessed one. The battle against assimilation is far too important for its warriors to get embroiled in politics of this sort. Undoubtedly, all the outreach organizations, Chabad included, should put their differences aside and pool together all their resources and ideas to create an even brighter Jewish tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Ynetnews"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Jewish outreach absurdity | website=Ynetnews | url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3501215,00.html | access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Theosophy}}

The '''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''' are reputed to be [[Spiritual enlightenment|enlightened]] beings originally identified by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry S. Olcott]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], and others. These Theosophists claimed to have met some of the so-called ''Masters'' during their lifetimes in different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. page 249"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House--Diagram 5, Facing page 248, provides details about the "Great Ones" functioning on [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation levels five through nine]]. C.W. Leadbeater’s Spiritual Hierarchy Chart (The Bodhisattva=Maitreya)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are referred to by Theosophists as ''Elder Brothers of the Human Race'', ''Adepts'', [[Mahātmā|''Mahatmas'']], or simply as ''The Masters''.

Helena Blavatsky was the first person to introduce the concept of the Masters to the West. At first she talked about them privately, but she stated that after a few years two of these adepts, [[Kuthumi]] (K.H.) and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] (M.), agreed to maintain a correspondence with two British Theosophists – Alfred P. Sinnett and A. O. Hume. This communication took place from 1880 to 1885, and during those years the reputed existence and objectives of the Mahatmas became public. The original letters are currently kept in the [[British Library]] in [[London]] and have been published as the ''[[Mahatma Letters]]''.

==Skeptical view==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">'''Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal''' (born March 18, 1943)&lt;ref name="White"&gt;[[Evelyn C. White]], ''Alice Walker: A Life'' (2004), p. 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American attorney known primarily for his work as a community organizer and lawyer in the 1960s–1970s [[Civil Rights Movement]], and for being the husband of author [[Alice Walker]] for ten years, and part of the first legally married interracial couple in the history of Mississippi.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in [[Brooklyn, New York City]], Leventhal attended a yeshiva elementary school,&lt;ref name="White"/&gt; and Brooklyn Technical H.S. When he was nine years old, his parents divorced, and he and his siblings were split up, with the father taking Leventhal's older brother to live with him. Leventhal recalled that he rarely saw his father after that, and that on one occasion, when Leventhal was a teen-ager, he took a younger sibling to see their father who "slammed the door in our face".&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;  In Leventhal's formative years he was greatly influenced by Judaism's emphasis on community service and recalls in particular being "outraged and disgusted by the way white people treated [[Jackie Robinson]]".&lt;ref name="White"/&gt; He resolved to fight injustice, and in pursuit of this, after receiving his undergraduate degree from New York University's [[Washington Square College]] in 1964, he received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[New York University School of Law]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Red Book"&gt;State of New York, ''The New York Red Book'', p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and marriage==
As a young lawyer, Leventhal worked in Mississippi for the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]], and from this work he formed the first interracial law partnership in the history of the state, with [[Reuben V. Anderson]], [[Fred L. Banks Jr.]], and John A. Nichols. Anderson and Banks would go on to become the first two African American justices of the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;[http://courts.ms.gov/news/2001/9.28.01banks.htm Supreme Court Justice Fred L. Banks Jr. announces he is stepping down] (September 28, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through his work, Leventhal met [[Alice Walker]], who came to trust and admire him due to his willingness to endanger his own social status and well-being by standing up to bigotry. On March 17, 1967, Leventhal and Walker married in [[New York (state)|New York]], in a [[civil ceremony]] performed by Family Court Judge [[Justine W. Polier]].&lt;ref name="Byrd1"&gt;Rudolph P. Byrd, ''The World Has Changed: Conversations with Alice Walker'' (2011), p. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was at that time illegal in Walker's home state of Georgia.&lt;ref name="Byrd1" /&gt; When the couple returned to Mississippi in July 1967, they became "the first legally married interracial couple in the state".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth H. Oakes, ''American Writers'' (2004), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker and Leventhal had one child, [[Rebecca Walker]], and divorced in 1976.&lt;ref name="Byrd2"&gt;Rudolph P. Byrd, ''The World Has Changed: Conversations with Alice Walker'' (2011), p. xlvi-xlvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Law School, during spring, summer and winter recesses, Leventhal worked as a student volunteer at LDF's offices in Jackson, Mississippi under the supervision of [[Marian Wright Edelman]]. This included serving as LDF's liaison to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the June, 1966 Meredith March Against Fear, from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Aram Goudsouzian, "Down To The Crossroads," (2014), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1969 through 1974 Leventhal served as LDF's lead counsel in Mississippi.  He represented plaintiffs in approximately 75 lawsuits filed throughout the state to eliminate segregation and discrimination in public schools and to eliminate discrimination in employment, public accommodations, housing and in the provision of municipal services (e.g., street paving, street lighting and fire protection). After Leventhal moved back to New York in 1974, he was, until 1978, an LDF staff attorney litigating cases brought in Mississippi and throughout the United States. Leventhal’s ten-year career at the LDF was highlighted by three landmark cases:
*''[[Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education]]'', 396 U.S. 19 (1969), through which the Supreme Court of the United States brought to an end the era of "all deliberate speed" and ordered school districts to desegregate "at once".
*''[[Norwood v. Harrison]]'', 413 U.S. 455 (1973), through which the Supreme Court of the United States held unconstitutional state textbook assistance to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race.
*''[[Hawkins v. Town of Shaw]]'', 437 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), aff'd on rehearing en banc, 461 F. 2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1972), through which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], upheld lawsuits challenging racial discrimination in the provision of municipal services.

Leventhal also testified before the United States Senate's Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity (Chair: Hon. [[Walter Mondale]]) in 1970, on the progress of school desegregation in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, Part 3B, Desegregation Under Law, July 8, 1970, pp. 1495-1534.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later public service career==
Leventhal returned to live in New York in 1974, and eventually remarried.&lt;ref name="Byrd2"/&gt; Between 1979 and 1984, Leventhal served first as the Assistant Attorney General of New York, in charge of the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau &lt;ref name="Red Book"/&gt; and then as the Deputy First Assistant Attorney General of New York and Chief of the Litigation Bureau.  Leventhal has argued two cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], ''[[Norwood v. Harrison]]'', 413 U.S. 455 (1973) (argued in 1972) and ''[[Blum v. Stenson]]'', 465 U.S. 886 (1984) (argued in 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/advocates/melvyn_r_leventhal|title=Oyez page on Melvyn R.

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2732">In [[mathematics]], a '''nowhere commutative semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] ''S'' such that, for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S'', if ''ab'' = ''ba'' then ''a'' = ''b''.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;A H Clifford, G B Preston (1964). ''The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I'' (Second Edition). [[American Mathematical Society]] (p.26). {{ISBN|978-0-8218-0272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A semigroup ''S'' is nowhere commutative if and only if any two elements of ''S'' are [[inverse semigroup|inverse]]s of each other.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt;

==Characterization of nowhere commutative semigroups==

Nowhere commutative semigroups can be [[characterization (mathematics)|characterized]] in several different ways. If ''S'' is a semigroup then the following statements are [[logical equivalence|equivalent]]:&lt;ref name=Howie&gt;{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=LMS monographs|volume= 7|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''S'' is nowhere commutative.
*''S'' is a [[rectangular band]] (in the sense in which the term is used by Howie&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=LMS monographs|volume= 7|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*For all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S'',  ''aba'' = ''a''.
*For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a'' and ''abc'' = ''ac''.

Even though, by definition, the rectangular bands are concrete semigroups, they have the defect that their definition is formulated not in terms of the basic binary operation in the semigroup. The approach via the definition of  nowhere commutative semigroups rectifies the defect.&lt;ref name=Howie/&gt;

To see that a nowhere commutative semigroup is a rectangular band, let ''S'' be a nowhere commutative semigroup. Using the defining properties of a nowhere commutative semigroup, one can see that for every ''a'' in ''S'' the intersection of the [[Green's relations|Green classes]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; contains the unique element ''a''. Let ''S''/''L'' be the family of ''L''-classes in ''S'' and ''S''/''R'' be the family of ''R''-classes in ''S''. The mapping
:&amp;psi; : ''S '' &amp;rarr; (''S''/''R'') &amp;times; (''S''/''L'')
defined by 
:''a''&amp;psi; = ( ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; )
is a bijection. If the Cartesian product (''S''/''R'') &amp;times; (''S''/''L'') is made into a semigroup  by furnishing it with the rectangular band multiplication, the map ψ becomes an isomorphism. So ''S'' is isomorphic to a rectangular band.

Other claims of equivalences follow directly from the relevant definitions.

      <comment>/* Dirichlet function */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''nowhere continuous function''', also called an '''everywhere discontinuous function''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is not [[continuous function|continuous]] at any point of its [[domain of a function|domain]]. If ''f'' is a function from [[real number]]s to real numbers, then ''f'' is nowhere continuous if for each point ''x'' there is an {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}} such that for each {{nowrap|''δ'' &gt; 0}} we can find a point ''y'' such that {{nowrap|0 &lt; {{abs|''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''}} &lt; ''δ''}} and {{nowrap|{{abs|''f''(''x'') &amp;minus; ''f''(''y'')}} ≥ ''ε''}}. Therefore, no matter how close we get to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not-nearby values.

More general definitions of this kind of function can be obtained, by replacing the [[absolute value]] by the distance function in a [[metric space]], or by using the definition of continuity in a [[topological space]].

==Dirichlet function==
One example of such a function is the [[indicator function]] of the [[rational number]]s, also known as the '''Dirichlet function''', named after German mathematician [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].&lt;ref&gt;Lejeune Dirichlet, P. G. (1829) "Sur la convergence des séries trigonométriques qui servent à répresenter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites donées" [On the convergence of trigonometric series which serve to represent an arbitrary function between given limits], ''Journal für reine und angewandte Mathematik'' [Journal for pure and applied mathematics (also known as ''Crelle's Journal'')], vol. 4, pages 157–169.&lt;/ref&gt;  This function is denoted as ''I''&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt; and has [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] both equal to the [[real number]]s.  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') equals 1 if ''x'' is a [[rational number]] and 0 if ''x'' is not rational.  If we look at this function in the vicinity of some number ''y'', there are two cases: 
*If ''y'' is rational, then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}}. To show the function is not continuous at ''y'', we need to find an ''ε'' such that no matter how small we choose ''δ'', there will be points ''z'' within ''δ'' of ''y'' such that ''f''(''z'') is not within ''ε'' of {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}}.  In fact, 1/2 is such an ''ε''.  Because the [[irrational number]]s are [[dense set|dense]] in the reals, no matter what ''δ'' we choose we can always find an irrational ''z'' within ''δ'' of ''y'', and {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = 0}} is at least 1/2 away from 1. 
*If ''y'' is irrational, then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 0}}. Again, we can take {{nowrap|1=''ε'' = 1/2}}, and this time, because the rational numbers are dense in the reals, we can pick ''z'' to be a rational number as close to ''y'' as is required. Again, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = 1}} is more than 1/2 away from {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 0}}.
In less rigorous terms, between any two irrationals, there is a rational, and vice versa.

The Dirichlet function can be constructed as the double pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lim_{k\to\infty}\left(\lim_{j\to\infty}\left(\cos(k!\pi x)\right)^{2j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integer ''j'' and ''k''.

This shows that the Dirichlet function is a [[Baire function|Baire class]] 2 function. It cannot be a Baire class 1 function because a Baire class 1 function can only be discontinuous on a [[meagre set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In general, if ''E'' is any subset of a [[topological space]] ''X'' such that both ''E'' and the complement of ''E'' are dense in ''X'', then the real-valued function which takes the value 1 on ''E'' and 0 on the complement of ''E'' will be nowhere continuous. Functions of this type were originally investigated by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

==Hyperreal characterisation==
A real function ''f'' is nowhere continuous if its natural [[Hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension has the property that every ''x'' is infinitely close to a ''y'' such that the difference {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''y'')}} is appreciable (i.e., not [[infinitesimal]]).

(2009). Dynamic Performance. In S.W.J Kozlowski (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts ==
In the [[performing arts]], a performance generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more [[Work of art|works of art]] to an [[audience]]. In instrumental music (and in drama), performance is typically described as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Music as Play.'' In: Paulo de Assis (ed.), ''Virtual Works – Actual Things: Essays in Musical Ontology.'' Leuven University Press, Leuven 2018 (Orpheus Institute Series), pp. 115–133. [https://orpheusinstituut.be/nl/publicaties/virtual-works-actual-things/ pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the performers participate in [[rehearsal]]s beforehand. 

An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of the performer - level of skill and knowledge. Spencer and McClelland in 1994 defined competency as "a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts, attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge)" that helps a performer to differentiate themselves superior from average performers.&lt;ref name="ShippmannAsh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shippmann|first1=Jeffery S.|last2=Ash|first2=Ronald A.|last3=Batjtsta|first3=Mariangela|last4=Carr|first4=Linda|last5=Eyde|first5=Lorraine D.|last6=Hesketh|first6=Beryl|last7=Kehoe|first7=Jerry|last8=Pearlman|first8=Kenneth|last9=Prien|first9=Erich P.|last10=Sanchez|first10=Juan I.|title=THE PRACTICE OF COMPETENCY MODELING|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=53|issue=3|year=2000|pages=703–740|issn=0031-5826|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance may also describe the way in which an [[actor]] performs. In a solo capacity, it may also refer to a [[mime artist]], [[comedian]], [[Evocation|conjurer]], or other entertainer.

Williams and Krane found the following characteristics define an ideal performance state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haff , G. Gregory|author2=Triplett , N. Travis|title=Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfuXCgAAQBAJ|edition=4th|year=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-1-4925-0162-6|pages=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absence of [[fear]]
* Not thinking about the performance
* Adaptive focus on the activity
* A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or [[self-efficacy]]
* A sense of personal control
* A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity

Other related factors are motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task relevant attention, positive self-talk and cognitive regulation to achieve [[automaticity]]. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Landy|author2=Jeffrey M. Conte|title=Work in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K1rnp9uAscC&amp;pg=PA193|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9025-1|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance is not always a result of practice, it is about honing the skill, even over practice itself can result in failure due to [[ego depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. L., Hardy, T., &amp; Arkin, R. (2009). When practice doesn't make perfect: Effort expenditure as an active behavioral self-handicapping strategy.

Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer's heart rate above his or her baseline heart rate. This increase takes place in several stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation (one minute before the start of subject's speaking role), confrontation activation (during the subject's speaking role, at which point their heart rate peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject's speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|issue=1|pages=123–130|pmid=7367532|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other mediums, such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate (an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher's findings ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a negative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2|pmid=24477850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart rate shares a strong, positive correlation with the self reported [[anxiety]] of performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclntyre|first1=Valerie|title=Heart Rate Variability as a Predictor of Speaking Anxiety|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2010|volume=27|issue=4|pages=286–297|doi=10.1080/08824096.2010.496323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other physiological responses to public performance include [[perspiration]], secretion of the [[adrenal glands]], and increased blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brutten|first1=Eugene|title=A Palmer Sweat Investigation of the Effect of Audience Variation Upon Stage Fright.|journal=Speech Monographs|date=1963|volume=30|issue=2|pages=92–96|doi=10.1080/03637756309375363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[standardization]], a '''profile''' is a subset internal to a [[specification]]. Aspects of a complex technical specification may necessarily have more than one interpretation, and there are probably many optional features. These aspects constitute a profile of the standard. Two implementations engineered from the same description may not interoperate due to having a different profile of the standard.  Vendors can even ignore features that they view as unimportant, yet prevail in the long run.  

The use of profiles in these ways can force one interpretation, or create de facto standards from official standards. Engineers can design or procure by using a profile to ensure interoperability.  For example, the International Standard Profile, ISP, is used by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in their ISO ISP series of standards; in the context of [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI networking]], Britain uses the UK-GOSIP profile and the US uses US-[[Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile|GOSIP]]; there are also various mobile profiles adopted by the [[W3C]] for web standards. In particular, implementations of standards on mobile devices often have significant limitations compared to their traditional desktop implementations, even if the standard which governs both permits such limitations. 

In [[structural engineering]] a '''profile''' means a [[Hot rolling|hot rolled]] [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|structural steel]] shape like an [[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]].

In [[civil engineering]], a '''profile''' consists of a plotted line which indicates grades and distances (and typically depths of cut and/or elevations of fill) for excavation and grading work. Constructors of [[road]]ways, [[Rail transport|railways]] (and similar works) normally chart the profile along the centerline. A profile can also indicate the vertical slope(s) (changes in elevation) in a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] or similar structure. Civil engineers always depict profile as a side ([[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]) view (as opposed to an overhead ([[Plan view|plan]]) view).

== Material fabrication ==
In [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]], a '''profile''' consists of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or [[steel]] [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|plate]]. In modern practice, a drawing office determines the shape and dimensions required to fit the sheet into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a [[profile cutter]]. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a rotating cutter like that of a [[Wood router#Similar tools|spindle router]] or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns [[oxyacetylene|oxy-acetylene]] or other oxy-gas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1808">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''second-order predicate''' is a [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] that takes a [[first-order predicate]] as an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=	An Introduction to Logical Theory|first=Aladdin M.|last=Yaqub|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2013|isbn=9781551119939|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93Z1-MdIkVcC&amp;pg=PA288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Compare [[higher-order predicate]].

The idea of second order predication was introduced by the [[Germany|German]] mathematician and philosopher [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. It is based on his idea that a predicate such as "is a philosopher" designates a [[concept and object|concept, rather than an object]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ontological Arguments and Belief in God|first=Graham|last=Oppy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780521039000|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qg0spmMuC98C&amp;pg=PA145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a concept can itself be the subject of a proposition, such as in "There are no [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] philosophers". In this case, we are not saying anything of any Bosnian philosophers, but of the concept "is a Bosnian philosopher" that it is not satisfied. Thus the predicate "is not satisfied" attributes something to the concept "is a Bosnian philosopher", and is thus a second-level predicate.

This idea is the basis of Frege's theory of [[number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Self-acceptance''' is acceptance of self.

==Definition==
Self-acceptance can be defined as:
* the awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses,
* the realistic (yet subjective) appraisal of one's talents, capabilities, and general worth, and,
* feelings of satisfaction with one's self despite deficiencies and regardless of past behaviors and choices.&lt;ref name=Henriques&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henriques|first1=Gregg|title=Six Domains of Psychological Well-being|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201405/six-domains-psychological-well-being|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shepard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Lorrie A.|title=Self-Acceptance: The Evaluative Component of the Self-Concept Construct|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1978|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139|doi=10.2307/1162326}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vlahopoulos&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vlahopoulos|first1=Basil Alex|title=The Relationships between Psychological Well-being, Self-acceptance, Client Status, and Counselor Facilitative Behaviors|date=1985|publisher=University of Cincinnati|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=5 &amp; 28|accessdate=12 August 2015|chapter=Introduction and Review of the Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shepard (1979), self-acceptance is an individual's satisfaction or happiness with oneself, and is thought to be necessary for good [[mental health]]. Self-acceptance involves self-understanding, a realistic, albeit subjective, awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses. It results in an individual's feeling about oneself, that they are of "unique worth".

In [[clinical psychology]] and [[positive psychology]], self-acceptance is considered the prerequisite for change to occur. It can be achieved by stopping criticizing and solving the defects of one's self, and then accepting them to be existing within one's self. That is, tolerating oneself to be imperfect in some parts.

Some distinguish between ''conditional'' and ''unconditional'' self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="Bernard2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael E. Bernard|title=The Strength of Self-Acceptance: Theory, Practice and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPa6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15|date=8 July 2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6806-6|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-acceptance is one of the six factors in Carol D. Ryff's structure for eudaimonic well-being.

==Qualities==
A person who scores high on self-acceptance:
* has a positive self-attitude, 
* acknowledges and accepts all aspects of themselves (including the good and bad), 
* is not self-critical or confused about their identity, and,
* does not wish they were any different from who they already are.&lt;ref name=Henriques /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.|title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=5 October 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=13–39|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past and current views in psychology==

In the past, the practice of self-acceptance was reproved by the Greeks. However, the need to know about and understand “the self” eventually became an important, underlying point in several psychological theories, such as:
* [[Marie Jahoda|Jahoda]]'s work on mental health, 
* [[Carl Rogers]]' Theory of Personality, 
* [[Gordon Allport]]'s Eight Stages of Self (Proprium) Development, and,
* [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]]'s Hierarchy of Needs under the “self-actualization” category.&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

In addition to that, the life-span theories of [[Erik Erikson|Erikson]] and [[Bernice Neugarten|Neugarten]] mention the importance of self-acceptance including one's past life, and [[Carl Jung]]'s process of individuation also emphasizes coming to terms with the dark side of one's self, or "the shadow".&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

==Relation to positive psychology==

With respect to [[positive psychology]], self-acceptance, as a component of eudaimonic well-being (EWB), is an indicator and a measure of [[psychological well-being]].&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Richard M.|last2=Huta|first2=Veronika|last3=Deci|first3=Edward L.|title=Living well: a self-determination theory perspective on eudaimonia|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=29 September 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=139–170|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9023-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sin|first1=Nancy L.|last2=Lyubomirsky|first2=Sonja|title=Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=May 2009|volume=65|issue=5|pages=467–487|doi=10.1002/jclp.20593|pmid=19301241}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Alfred Adler]], founder of individual psychology, observed that people who thought of themselves as inferior also observed a depreciation of others.&lt;ref name=Vlahopoulos /&gt;

==Psychological benefits==

Some psychological benefits of self-acceptance include mood regulation, a decrease in depressive symptoms, and an increase in positive emotions.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jimenez|first1=Sherlyn S.|last2=Niles|first2=Barbara L.|last3=Park|first3=Crystal L.|title=A mindfulness model of affect regulation and depressive symptoms: Positive emotions, mood regulation expectancies, and self-acceptance as regulatory mechanisms|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=October 2010|volume=49|issue=6|pages=645–650|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.041}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example of this can be seen in a 2014 study that looked at affective profiles. The results yielded suggest that individuals categorized as self-fulfilling (as compared to the other profiles) tended to score higher on all the factors of Ryff's eudaimonic well-being dimensions (self-acceptance included).&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=Danilo|last2=Al Nima|first2=Ali|last3=Kjell|first3=Oscar N.E.|title=The affective profiles, psychological well-being, and harmony: environmental mastery and self-acceptance predict the sense of a harmonious life|journal=PeerJ|date=13 February 2014|volume=2|pages=e259|doi=10.7717/peerj.259|pmid=24688843|pmc=3933359}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to that, self-acceptance (and environmental mastery) specifically and significantly predicted harmony in life across all affective profiles.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt;

Other psychological benefits include:
* a heightened sense of freedom, 
* a decrease in fear of failure, 
* an increase in self-worth, 
* an increase in independence (autonomy),
* an increase in self-esteem, 
* less desire to win the approval of others,
* less self-critique and more self-kindness when mistakes occur, 
* more desire to live life for one's self (and not others), and,
* the ability to take more risks without worrying about the consequences.&lt;ref name=McQuillan&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuillan|first1=Susan|title=Radiate Self-Acceptance|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cravings/201409/radiate-self-acceptance|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-acceptance is also thought to be necessary for good mental health.&lt;ref name=Shepard /&gt;

==Physical benefits==

In addition to psychological benefits, self-acceptance may have physical benefits as well.&lt;ref name=Ryan /&gt; For example, the results of a 2008 study propose that older women with higher levels of environmental mastery, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance showed lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, which is a marker for glucose levels/insulin resistance.&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

A large subset of this effect, the '''moral credential effect''', is a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or African American person in one setting were more likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a Caucasian person.{{r|Monin2001}} Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.&lt;ref name="Kouchaki2011"/&gt;

Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.
{{Unreliable sources|date=August 2018}}

==Definitions==
Researchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows:&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt;

{{quote|The moral licensing effect is a non conscious effect that operates by providing a moral boost in the self-concept, which increases the preference for a relative immoral action subsequently by dampening the negative self attributions associated with such behavior.

Prior choices that activate and boost the self-concept, are likely to subsequently license more self-indulgent choices...Licensing can operate through an expression of the intent to be virtuous, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries.}}

Similarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues have explained that

{{quote|Past good deeds can liberate individuals to engage in behaviors that are immoral, unethical, or otherwise problematic, behaviors that they would otherwise avoid for fear of feeling or appearing immoral.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;}}

==Group membership==
It has been found that moral credentials can be obtained vicariously. That is, a person will behave as if they themselves have moral credentials when that person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.&lt;ref name="Kouchaki2011"/&gt; In research that draws on [[social identity theory]] it was also found that group membership moderates the effectiveness of moral credentials in mitigating perceptions of prejudice. Specifically, it was observed that displays of moral credentials have more effect between people who share [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] status.&lt;ref name=Krumm2008/&gt;

==Examples==
Research suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making, [[risky sexual behavior]], alcohol consumption, and [[dietary supplement]] use.&lt;ref name=Khan2&gt;{{cite journal|title=Licensing effect in consumer choice |journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=2006|volume=43|issue=2 |pages=259–266 |url=http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ravidhar/documents/LicensingEffectinConsumerChoice.pdf|doi=10.1509/jmkr.43.2.259|last1=Khan|first1=Uzma|last2=Dhar|first2=Ravi}} [http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/AMA%20Publications/AMA%20Journals/Journal%20of%20Marketing%20Research/TOCs/SUM_2006.2/Licensing_Effect.aspx Executive summary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuo|first=Iris|title='Licensing effect' seen in dieting, charity, hiring|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Knight Ridder/Tribune Information Services|date=February 1, 2006|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article24453595.html|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529093131/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article24453595.html|archivedate=May 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenwald|first=Michael S|title=Why going green won't make you better or save you money|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071606839.html|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chernev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chernev|first=Alexander|title=The Dieter's Paradox|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=178–183|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2010.08.002 |url=http://www.myscp.org/pdf/short%20articles/JCPS_10-00088_180.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiou&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ironic effects of dietary supplementation: illusory invulnerability created by taking dietary supplements licenses health-risk behaviors |journal=Psychological Science |year=2011 |volume=22 |issue=8 |pmid=21764996 |doi=10.1177/0956797611416253 |pages=1081–1086 |last1=Chiou |first1=W.

{{quote|We drink Diet Coke – with Quarter Pounders and fries at McDonald's. We go to the gym – and ride the elevator to the second floor. We install tankless water heaters – then take longer showers. We drive SUVs to see Al Gore's speeches on global warming.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;}}

===Dietary supplement use and unhealthy behavior===
A 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take [[multivitamin]] pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities.&lt;ref name=Chiou/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huget/&gt; Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given [[placebo]] pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in "hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. 
 
The study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthful living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users.&lt;ref name=Huget/&gt; The authors advised:

{{quote|Smokers who take dietary supplements can fool themselves into thinking they are protected against cancer and other diseases. Reminding health conscious smokers that multivitamins don't prevent cancer may help them control their smoking or even encourage them to stop.&lt;ref name=Healthdaily&gt;{{cite news|title='Licensing effect' negating the benefit of vitamins|url=http://www.healthdaily.co.uk/wellbeing/2011/08/04/licensing-effect-negating-the-benefit-of-vitamins|newspaper=Health Daily|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022152225/http://www.healthdaily.co.uk/wellbeing/2011/08/04/licensing-effect-negating-the-benefit-of-vitamins|archivedate=October 22, 2013|df=}} Cites {{harvtxt|Chiou|Yang|Wan|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on the implications of the study, [[Ben Goldacre]] said:

{{quote|Believing, incorrectly, that you've done something healthy by taking a vitamin pill makes you more likely to take genuine, concrete, real-world risks with your health. It's a chilling thought, but ideas aren't without impact, and every time we humour a harmless myth – that vitamin pills are healthy, that some fashionable berry prevents cancer – we might be doing more harm than we think.&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt;}}

===Consumer purchasing decisions===
Researchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of luxury goods. They reasoned that "relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people's prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept". Due to the self-licensing effect, "a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents' self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries". Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious.&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt; In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that "People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen…Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods."&lt;ref name=Kuo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;

A study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazar2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do Green Products Make Us Better People?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=4|pages=494–498|date=2010|doi=10.1177/0956797610363538|pmid=20424089|last1=Mazar|first1=N|last2=Zhong|first2=C. B.|url=http://www.chilleesys.com/scp/assets/mazar.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094546/http://www.chilleesys.com/scp/assets/mazar.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an [[eco-friendly]] or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the [[dictator game]], in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that "When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self-satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity". The authors added that "purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors", and concluded:

{{quote|We find that mere exposure to green products and the purchase of them lead to markedly different behavioral consequences. In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products; however, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products.}}

===Energy use===
Researchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|title=Durable goods and residential demand for energy and water: evidence from a field trial|journal=[[RAND]] Journal of Economics|year=2008|volume=39|issue=2|pages=530–46|doi=10.1111/j.0741-6261.2008.00026.x|jstor=25474381|last1=Davis|first1=Lucas W.|url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ldavis/Davis%20RAND%202008.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529122439/http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ldavis/Davis%20RAND%202008.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;

===Political opinions and racial bias===
{{main|Moral credential effect}}
The self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials.&lt;ref name=monin/&gt; Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse [[Barack Obama]] during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans.&lt;ref name=Effron&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endorsing Obama licenses favoring Whites|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=45|issue=3|pages=590–593 |url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/jesss/Effron,%20Cameron,%20&amp;%20Monin,%202009.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.001|last1=Effron|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Cameron|first2=Jessica S.|last3=Monin|first3=Benoît|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite news|title=Backing Obama gives some voters license to favor whites over blacks, study shows|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2009/pr-obamarac-030409.html|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Stanford University News Service|date=March 2, 2009}} Cites {{harvtxt|Effron|Cameron|Monin|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the endorsement made people feel like they had shown that they were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express racially prejudicial views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6927">'''Social polarization'''  is associated with the segregation within a [[society]] that may emerge from [[income inequality]], real-estate fluctuations, economic displacements etc. and result in such differentiation that would consist of various social groups, from high-income to low-income.

One of the earlier stimulating research works on social polarization is from R.E. Pahl on [[Isle of Sheppey]],&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Pahl, Divisions of Labour, Oxford: Blackwell, 1984, {{ISBN|0-631-13273-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he provides a comparison between the [[Pre-capitalist society]] and [[capitalist society]].

More recently, a number of research projects have been increasingly addressing the issues of social polarization within the developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Moulaert]], [[Erik Swyngedouw]] and Arantxa Rodriguez. ''The Globalized City: Economic Restructuring and Social Polarization in European Cities''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-19-926040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When social polarization occurs in addition to [[economic restructuring]], particularly in cities, economic inequality along social class and racial lines is exacerbated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Social Geography: An Introduction|last=Knox|first=Paul|last2=Pinch|first2=Steven|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|isbn=978-0-13-124944-8|location=Harlow, England|pages=284–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such separation can be best observed in the urban environment, “where [communities] of extreme wealth and social power are interspersed with places of deprivation, exclusion, and decline.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Globalized City: Economic Restructuring and Social Polarization in European Cities|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780191555527|editor-last=Moulaert|editor-first=Frank|location=Oxford|pages=12–14|quote=|editor-last2=Rodriguez|editor-first2=Arantxa|editor-last3=Swyngedouw|editor-first3=Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to how spatial compositions are managed in cities, the technologies used in regards to social relations can also contribute to social polarization&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (see ''Social Polarization &amp; The Media'').

Increased spatial segregation of socioeconomic groups correlates strongly with social polarization as well as [[social exclusion]] and societal fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social polarization and the creative class ==
Aspects of this concept can also be associated with the phenomena of the [[creative class]] and how these members have created their own dominant status within society.  [[Globalization]] and its associated ”[[creative destruction]]" has contributed to great prosperity and growth for elites in many cities.  Conversely, the process of creative destruction is intrinsically spatially uneven, so some urban neighborhoods “at the receiving end” of globalization are harmed by it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social polarization and urban poverty ==

Several theoretical models can be strung together to explain the basics that create social polarization, and the subsequent deprivation that occurs when there is extreme societal deprivation between those of high-wealth and low-wealth.  They are:
* a [[Culture of poverty|Culture of Poverty]]
* a [[Cycle of poverty|Cycle of Poverty]]
* [[Government failure|Government Failure]]—particularly when public policy institutions divided into departments (education, housing, etc.) are ineffective when it comes to dealing with the interdisciplinary problems of the poor
* an Inequitable Distribution of Resources/Opportunities
* [[Class conflict|Class Conflict]], and
* the concept of an "[[Underclass]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
When these phenomena are combined in urban areas, it can fuel social polarization.  Urban decay is a visual manifestation of social polarization, while riots, civil commotion and general social disintegration can be symptomatic of this concept as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it can also lead to an [[informal economy]] in many urban areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social polarization and the media ==
Digital media, and particularly [[social media]], could potentially play a role in encouraging social polarization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Marc|date=October 2015|title=How the Media Trashed the Transitions|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/595926|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=26| issue = 4|pages=90–99|doi=10.1353/jod.2015.0070|pmid=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because social media sites like [[Facebook]] can help cluster friends and acquaintances into [[Homophily|homophilous]] circles, and social news sites like [[Digg]] can facilitate a consumption of news that is biased by its user’s choices. In the extreme, a lack of “a common public sphere” could lead to isolated, polarized groups which could even be hostile towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=James G.|date=2011-02-01|title=The Duality of Media: A Structurational Theory of Public Attention|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2010.01375.x/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=43–66|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2010.01375.x|issn=1468-2885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, during the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, it was observed that social media furthered the social stratification already present in several Arab states.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, [[Cyberbalkanization|cyberbalkinization]], the phenomenon where media audiences fragment into "enclaves" where they only consume content they concur with—and thus theoretically promoting social polarization—may not have as much influence as believed.  Utilizing Nielsen television and Internet audience data, J.G. Webster found that ideological segmentation among media users was unlikely, as “even consumers of obscure niche media devoted most of their attention to more broadly appealing fare.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=James G.|last2=Ksiazek|first2=Thomas B.|date=2012-02-01|title=The Dynamics of Audience Fragmentation: Public Attention in an Age of Digital Media|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01616.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–56|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01616.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Webster does admit that his research does not measure the particular nature of the subject matter consumed , or how strongly it affected the media viewers’ perceptions of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''struggle session''' was a form of [[public humiliation]] and [[torture]] that was used by the [[Communist Party of China]] in the [[Mao era]], particularly during the [[Cultural Revolution]], to shape public opinion and humiliate, persecute, or execute political rivals and those deemed [[Class enemy|class enemies]].&lt;ref name="lipman-harrell"/&gt;

In general, the victim of a struggle session was forced to admit various crimes before a crowd of people who would verbally and physically abuse the victim until he or she confessed.  Struggle sessions were often held at the workplace of the accused, but they were sometimes conducted in sports stadiums where large crowds would gather if the target was well-known.&lt;ref name="lipman-harrell"&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==

According to [[Lin Yutang]], the expression comes from "批判" ({{zh|p=pīpàn|l=to judge}}) and "鬥爭" ({{zh|p=dòuzhēng|l=to fight}}), so the whole expression conveys the message of ''inciting the spirit of judgment and fighting''. Instead of saying the full phrase "批判鬥爭" ({{zh|p=pīpàn dòuzhēng}}), it was shortened to "批鬥" ({{zh|p=pīdòu}}).

==Origins and purpose==

Struggle sessions developed from similar ideas of criticism and [[Self-criticism#Communist states|self-criticism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] from the 1920s. The term refers to [[class struggle]];  the session is held to "benefit" the target, by eliminating all traces of counterrevolutionary, reactionary thinking. Chinese communists resisted this at first, because struggle sessions conflicted with the Chinese concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]], but struggle sessions became commonplace at [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] meetings during the 1930s due to public popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Red Flag: A History of Communism|first=David|last=Priestland|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8021-1924-7|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'…the [[Cultural Revolution]] began and I was transferred to another labor camp…  Two years after I had been in this new camp, I received a parcel from my family. Immediately, an inmate accused me of giving something out of it to another prisoner. I was dragged to the office. Without any investigation, the officer assembled the entire camp to start a struggle session against me. In the session the officer suddenly asked me whether I had committed my alleged original crime leading to my 8-year sentence. I was stunned. It then dawned on me that this session was in fact prearranged. The parcel was only a pretense. Their real motive was once again to force me to admit all my alleged crimes. "I did not commit any crimes," I asserted firmly. Immediately two people jumped on me and cut off half of my hair. The officer screamed again: "are you guilty?" I replied firmly again, "no." Two people then used a rope to tie my hands back tightly. It was connected to a loop around my shoulder and underneath my armpits. It was knotted in such a way that a slight movement of my hands would cause intense pain. This struggle session lasted for two hours. Afterwards, they untied me and handcuffed me instead. The handcuffs became a part of me for the next one hundred days and nights...'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindszenty.org/report/1998/nov98/mr_nov98.html |title=A Catholic Voice Out of Communist China - November 1998 Mindszenty Report |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2011-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313115857/http://www.mindszenty.org/report/1998/nov98/mr_nov98.html |archivedate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne F. Thurston, in ''Enemies of the People'', gave a description of an infamous struggle session for the professor You Xiaoli:

{{quote|'You Xiaoli was standing, precariously balanced, on a stool. Her body was bent over from the waist into a right angle, and her arms, elbows stiff and straight, were behind her back, one hand grasping the other at the wrist. It was the position known as "doing the airplane." Around her neck was a heavy chain, and attached to the chain was a blackboard, a real blackboard, one that had been removed from a classroom at the university where You Xiaoli, for more than ten years, had served as a full professor. On both sides of the blackboard were chalked her name and the myriad crimes she was alleged to have committed...'

The scene was taking place at the university, too, in a sports field at one of China's most prestigious institutions of higher learning. In the audience were You Xiaoli's students and colleagues and former friends. Workers from local factories and peasants from nearby communes had been bussed in for the spectacle. From the audience came repeated, rhythmic chants ... "down with You Xiaoli! Down with You Xiaoli!"

"I had many feelings at that struggle session," recalls You Xiaoli. "I thought there were some bad people in the audience. But I also thought there were many ignorant people, people who did not understand what was happening, so I pitied that kind of person. They brought workers and peasants into the meetings, and they could not understand what was happening. But I was also angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldandischool.com/public/1987/june/school-resource12592.asp |title= Enemies of the People |publisher= World and ischool |date= June 1987 |accessdate= 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lately, the term "struggle session" has come to be applied to any scene where victims are publicly badgered to confess imaginary crimes under the pretext of self-criticism and rehabilitation{{Citation needed |date= April 2010}}.

==Disuse after 1978==

Struggle sessions were disowned in China after 1978, when the reformers led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power. Deng Xiaoping prohibited struggle sessions and other kinds of Mao-era violent political campaigns.

In September 2013, [[Xi Jinping]] has taken his "criticism and self-criticism" campaign on the road, attending a series of meetings where Hebei provincial cadres were made to admit shortcomings and offer ideas for correcting their behaviour. Xi has instructed regional officials to "promote self-criticism and criticism" to implement his "mass line" campaign, which he said is necessary to eliminate formality, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance among rank-and-file cadres.&lt;ref name="hsu-shang-li"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130927000096|title= Xi Jinping promotes criticism, self-criticism campaign|author= Hsu Shang-li|date= 27 September 2013|website= Want China Times|access-date= 23 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1609">In [[category theory]] ([[mathematics]]) there exists an important collection of categories denoted &lt;math&gt; [n] &lt;/math&gt; for natural numbers &lt;math&gt; n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The objects of &lt;math&gt; [n]&lt;/math&gt; are the integers &lt;math&gt; 0,1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, and the morphism set &lt;math&gt; Hom(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; for objects &lt;math&gt; i,j\in[n]&lt;/math&gt; is empty if &lt;math&gt; j&lt;i &lt;/math&gt; and consists of a single element if &lt;math&gt; i\leq j &lt;/math&gt;.

Subdivided interval categories are very useful in defining [[simplicial set]]s.  The category whose objects are the subdivided interval categories and whose morphisms are functors is often written &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and is called the [[Simplex category|simplicial indexing category]].  A simplicial set is just a contravariant functor &lt;math&gt; X:\Delta^{op}\rightarrow Sets&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

The category &amp;#120792; is an empty interval, that is, an empty category, having no objects nor morphisms. It is an initial object in the category of all categories.

The category [0], also denoted as &amp;#120793;, is a one-object, one-morphism category. It is the terminal object in the category of all categories.

The category [1], also denoted as &amp;#120794; has two objects and a single (non-identity) morphism between them.  If &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is any category, then &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}^{[1]}&lt;/math&gt; is the category of morphisms and commutative squares in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

The category [2], also denoted as &amp;#120795; has three objects and three non-identity morphisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3936">[[File:Eugene Onegin illustration.jpg|thumb|250px|A superfluous man (''[[Eugene Onegin]]'') idly polishing his fingernails. Illustration by [[Elena Samokysh-Sudkovskaya]], 1908]]

The '''superfluous man''' ({{lang-ru|лишний человек}}, ''líshniy chelovék'') is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the [[Byronic hero]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{Harvnb|Chances|2001|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege.  Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], and [[Existentialism|existential]] [[boredom]]; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, romantic intrigues, and [[duel]]s.  He is often unmindful, indifferent or unempathetic with society's issues and can carelessly distress others with his actions, despite his position of power. He will often use his power for his own comfort and security and will have very little interest in being charitable or using it for the greater good. 

The superfluous man will often attempt to manipulate, control or enslave other individuals. Because he has no integrity or ambitions, he is often self-serving and sees little point to being a benefactor or helping others. He will often carelessly try to manipulate, degrade or pacify individuals within the society; in order to gain more comfort and security.

The character type originates in [[Alexander Pushkin|Alexander Pushkin's]] verse-novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' (1825&amp;ndash;32). This term was popularized by [[Ivan Turgenev|Ivan Turgenev's]] novella ''[[The Diary of a Superfluous Man]]'' (1850) and was thereafter applied to characters from earlier novels.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt; [[Mikhail Lermontov|Mikhail Lermontov's]] ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' (1840) depicts another Superfluous Man – Pechorin – as its protagonist. He can be seen as a [[nihilism|nihilist]] and [[fatalism|fatalist]]. Later examples include [[Alexander Herzen|Alexander Herzen's]] Beltov in ''[[Who is to Blame?]]'' (1845&amp;ndash;46), [[Ivan Turgenev|Ivan Turgenev's]] ''[[Rudin]]'' (1856), and the title character of [[Ivan Goncharov|Ivan Goncharov's]] ''[[Oblomov]]'' (1859).&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;

Russian critics such as [[Vissarion Belinsky]] viewed the superfluous man as a byproduct of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s reign, when the best educated men would not enter the discredited government service and, lacking other options for self-realization, doomed themselves to live out their life in passivity. Scholar David Patterson describes the superfluous man as "not just...another literary type but...a paradigm of a person who has lost a point, a place, a presence in life" before concluding that "the superfluous man is a homeless man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1995|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superfluous man is often in contrast politically with the [[Great man theory|great man]].

'''Sustainable redevelopment''' is the [[doctrine]] within which a state, organization, or individual can work to recreate a [[Socio-economic status|socio-economic position]] attained prior to a deconstructive event while upholding sustainable and environmental practices. The doctrine is based on [[economics]] within [[environmentalism]]. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run.&lt;ref name="DFD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd/dsd_index.shtml |title=Division for Sustainable Development :: About |author=[[United Nations]] |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By redeveloping sustainably, long term [[energy conservation|energy efficiencies]] can be realized, coupled with highly reduced [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Within the ideals of [[nation-building]], sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-[[disaster]] countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying [[infrastructure]] is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation.

==Background==
[[Sustainable development]] and [[redevelopment]] are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development.

While the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s 12th Article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php |title=Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.

==UN==
The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development "provides [[leadership]] and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development".&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt; The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as [[Agenda 21]], and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] declares that "Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits."&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

==World Bank==
The [[World Bank]] has been working on sustainable development projects through one of their internal groups, the Sustainable Development Network. These two groups work together to provide key sectors for sustainable development: "[[agriculture]] and [[rural development]], [[energy]], [[transport]], [[water]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[urban development]], [[social development]], [[oil]], [[gas]], [[mining]], and [[chemical]]s, [[Information technology|information]] and [[Communication technology|communication]] technologies, and sub-national activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSDNET /0,,contentMDK:22113416~menuPK:64885073~pagePK:64885161~piPK:64884432~theSitePK:5929282,00.html |title=Sustainable Development - About Sustainable Development |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Natural Hazards Institute==
The Natural Hazards Research and Application Information Center of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] produced a work catalyzing the process for post-disaster sustainable redevelopment. In their book, “Holistic Disaster Recovery”, is spelled out the “Six Principles of [[Sustainability]]”

==The Six Principles of Sustainability==
1. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, its residents [[quality of life]].
2. Enhance local economic vitality.
3. Ensure social and intergenerational equity.
4. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, environmental quality.
5. Incorporate disaster resilience and [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]].
6. Use a consensus-building, participatory process when making

The '''Syrian Nonviolence Movement''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] formed in 2011 by a group of [[Syrian]] activists. They believe in peaceful struggle and [[civil resistance]] as a way to achieve social, cultural and political change in the Syrian state and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alharak.org/about-snm.html | title=About SNM | publisher=Syrian Nonviolence Movement website | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Evolution of God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], in which the author explores the history of the concept of [[God]] in the three [[Abrahamic religions]] through a variety of means, including [[archeology]], history, [[theology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. The patterns which link [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] and the ways in which they have changed their concepts over time are explored as one of the central themes.

One of the conclusions of the book that Wright tries to make is a reconciliation [[Relationship between religion and science|between science and religion]].  He also speculates on the future of the concept of God.

==Evolutionary biology==
Among other things, Wright discusses the role of [[evolutionary biology]] in the development of religion. Geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] hypothesized that some people have a specific gene that makes them prone to religious belief, which he calls the [[God gene]], and that over time natural selection has favored these people because their spirituality leads to optimism. Wright, however, thinks the tendency towards religious belief is not an adaptive trait influenced by natural selection, but rather a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] - a trait that happens to be supported by adaptations originally selected for other purposes. Wright states that the human brain approaches religious belief based on how it adapted to survive and reproduce in early hunter-gatherer societies.

He points out four key traits of religion that align with the human brain's survival adaptations:
*Its claims can be surprising, strange, and even counterintuitive.
*It claims to show what causes good and bad things to happen.
*It tells people that they can control these causes and increase the ratio of good to bad results.
*It is hard to falsify or disprove.
Humans have adapted to pay attention to surprising and confusing information, because it could make the difference between life and death. (For instance, if a person left the campsite and mysteriously never returned, it would be wise for the others to be on guard for a predator or some other danger.) Understanding and controlling cause and effect also takes top priority in the human brain, since humans live in complex social groups where predicting and influencing the actions and thoughts of others gains them allies, status, and access to resources. As human cognitive abilities and curiosity expanded over the centuries, their investigation of cause and effect expanded from the strictly social context out into the world at large, opening the doors for religions to explain things like weather and disease.

Though some of these explanations were strange and perhaps dubious, the fact that they could not be completely disproven lent them credibility; it was better to be cautious than dead. Wright uses an example from the [[Haida people]], indigenous to the northwest coast of North America, who would try to appease killer whale deities to calm storms out at sea; they would pour fresh water into the ocean or tie tobacco or deer tallow to the end of a paddle. While some people certainly died despite these offerings, those who survived were a testament to the ritual's possible efficacy.

Mysterious and unproven beliefs can also persist in a culture because human brains have adapted to agree with the group consensus even if it goes against one's better judgment or personal beliefs, since a person alienated from the group loses protection, food, and mates. Wright cites the [[Asch conformity experiments]] and even posits that [[Stockholm syndrome]] is not so much a syndrome as a natural product of evolution, the brain's way of ensuring that a person accepts and is accepted by his or her new social group. In addition, beliefs can persist because once a person publicly announces a belief, social psychologists have found that he or she is inclined to focus on evidence supporting that belief while conveniently ignoring evidence contradicting it, a logical fallacy known as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]].

==Reviews==
Journalist and political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] gave the book a positive review in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', saying that the book "...gave me hope that we can avoid both the barrenness of a world without God and the horrible fusion of fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/05/the-evolution-of-god.html Andrew Sullivan's blog post linking to his review], from ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6255785.ece Sullivan's full review of the book] from ''[[The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' religion editor, [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]], described ''The Evolution of God'' as a reframing of the [[faith]] vs. reason debate. Drawing a contrast to such authors as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], Miller gives an overall positive review of the book's approach to the examination of the concept of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/199697 Let’s Talk About God] from ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Yale professor of psychology [[Paul Bloom (professor)|Paul Bloom]] said, "In his brilliant new book, “The Evolution of God,” Robert Wright tells the story of how God grew up."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=1 Review of ''The Evolution of God''] from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom sums up Wright's controversial stance as, "Wright’s tone is reasoned and careful, even hesitant, throughout, and it is nice to read about issues like the morality of Christ and the meaning of jihad without getting the feeling that you are being shouted at. His views, though, are provocative and controversial. There is something here to annoy almost everyone."

However, in a ''New York Times'' review that included a reply from Wright, [[Nicholas Wade]], a writer for the "Science Times" section, notes the book is "a disappointment from the Darwinian perspective", because evolution "provides a simpler explanation for moral progression than the deity Wright half invokes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/the-non-evolution-of-god/ The Non-Evolution of God], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Wright replied to Wade's comments, saying Wade had misunderstood Wright's argument and that "The deity (if there is one–and I’m agnostic on that point) would be realizing moral progress through evolution’s creation of the human moral sense (and through the subsequent development of that moral sense via cultural evolution, particularly technological evolution)."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/non-evolution-of-god-part-2/ Non-Evolution of God, Part 2], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt;  Wade replied that "evolution seems to me a sufficient explanation for the moral progress that Mr. Wright correctly discerns in the human condition, so there seemed no compelling need to invoke a deity."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"/&gt;

A '''token economy''' is a system of [[contingency management]] based on the systematic [[reinforcement]] of target behavior. The reinforcers are symbols or [[token money|tokens]] that can be exchanged for other reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/token-economy&lt;/ref&gt; A token economy is based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[behavioral economics]] and can be situated within [[applied behavior analysis]]. In applied settings token economies are used with children and adults; however, they have been successfully modeled with pigeons in lab settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut| K. Jackson and T.D. Hackenberg}} : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284552/pdf/8755699.pdf Token reinforcement, choice, and self-control in pigeons.] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior''. 1996 July; 66(1): 29–49. {{doi|10.1901/jeab.1996.66-29}} {{PMC|1284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic requirements ==
Three requirements are basic for a token economy.&lt;ref name="Kazdin"&gt;{{Aut|A.E. Kazdin}} : ''The Token Economy. A review and evaluation''. New York: Plenum Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-306-30962-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tokens ===
Tokens must be used as reinforcers to be effective. A token is an object or symbol that can be exchanged for material reinforcers, services, or privileges (back-up reinforcers). In applied settings, a wide range of tokens have been used: coins, checkmarks, images of small suns, points on a counter. These symbols and objects are comparably worthless outside of the patient-clinician relationship, but their value lies in the fact that they can be exchanged for other things. Technically speaking, tokens are not primary reinforcers, but secondary or learned reinforcers. Much research has been conducted on token reinforcement, including animal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|T.D. Hackenberg}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2648534/ Token reinforcement: a review and analysis.] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 2009, 91, 257-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Back-up reinforcers ===
Tokens have no intrinsic value, but can be exchanged for other valued reinforcing events: back-up reinforcers. Most token economies offer a choice of differing back-up reinforcers that can be virtually anything. Some possible reinforcers might be:
* Material reinforcers: sweets, cigarettes, journals, money (although money holds value outside of the patient-clinician relationship)
* Services: breakfast in bed, having your room cleaned, activities
* Privileges and other extras: passes for leaving the building or area, permission to stay in bed, phone calls, having your name or picture on the wall.

Back-up reinforcers are chosen in function of the individual or group for which the token economy is set up, or depending upon the possibilities available to the staff. Prior to starting the staff decides how many tokens have to be paid for each back-up reinforcer. Often, price lists are exposed or given to the clients. Some back-up reinforcers can be bought anytime, for other exchange times are limited (e.g. opening times of a token shop).

=== Specified target behaviors ===
There is a broad range of possible target behaviors: self-care, attending activities, academic behavior, disruptive behavior. A token economy is more than just using exchangeable tokens.&lt;ref name="Kazdin" /&gt; For a token economy to work, criteria have to be specified and clear. A staff member giving tokens to a client just because he judges he is behaving positively, is not part of a token economy because it is not done in a systematic way. Sometimes client manuals have specifications how many tokens can be earned by each target behavior. For instance, if making the bed is a target behavior, staff and clients have to know how a well-made bed looks like: do the sheets have to be put under the mattress, cushion on top? However, often these specifications are hard to make: behavior such as eating politely and positive cooperation are hard to specify. While planning how many tokens can be earned by each target behavior some factors have to be considered: on the one hand clients should be able to earn a minimal amount of tokens for a minimal effort, and on the other hand clients should not earn too much too soon, making more effort useless.&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes the possibility of punishment by token loss is included, technically called 'response cost':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ormrod|first=Jeanne Ellis|title=Essentials of Educational Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Merrill|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0-13-501657-2|pages=338|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; disruptive behavior can be fined with the loss of tokens. This also should be clearly specified before the application starts. Clients can be involved in the specifying of the contingencies.

== Other features of a token economy ==
Besides the 3 basic requirements, other features are often present.&lt;ref name="Glynn"&gt;{{Aut|S.M. Glynn}}: [http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/14/4/383.abstract Token economy approaches for psychiatric patients. Progress and pitfalls over 25 years.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222063442/http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/14/4/383.abstract |date=2011-12-22 }} ''Behavior Modification'', 1990, 14, 383-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social reinforcement ===
Token reinforcement is essential, but is always accompanied by [[social reinforcement]]. Tokens are intended to make reinforcement explicit and immediate, and to strengthen behavior, but in the end social reinforcement should be sufficient to maintain what’s been  learned.

=== Shaping ===
All principles of operant learning are applied within a token economy. [[Shaping (psychology)|Shaping]] implies clients aren’t expected to do everything perfectly at once; behavior can be acquired in steps. Initially clients can be reinforced for behavior that approaches the target. If the target behavior is keeping attention during a 30 minutes session, clients can initially already get (perhaps smaller) reinforcement for 5 minutes of attention.

=== Immediacy of reinforcement ===
Reinforcement will greater influence behavior if given shortly after the response is emitted. The longer people have to wait for a reward, the less effect and the less they will learn. This is the principle of [[delay discounting]]. Immediate token reinforcement can bridge later reinforcement.

=== Learning to plan ahead and save earnings ===
Sometimes clients can earn larger rewards like the permission to spend a weekend at home, going to a movie, or having a class excursion. When such rewards would be given at once for one instance of a target behavior, the scarce resources would soon be depleted and consequently the incentives would be lost. One advantage of tokens is they can be used to divide larger rewards into parts: clients can save tokens to buy more expensive rewards later. This implies they shouldn’t immediately spend all earned tokens on attractive smaller rewards, and instead learn to plan ahead. This way they can acquire self-control. (See [[Delayed gratification]].)

=== Individual and group contingencies ===
Mostly token economies are designed for groups. The system is running for a whole ward or class. Within this group contingency specific individual goals and reinforcers can be added. Though sometimes a token economy is designed for only one specific individual.

=== Consistent application ===
The power of a token economy largely depends on the consistency of its application. To achieve this thorough staff training is essential. Some token economies failed exactly on this point.&lt;ref name="Glynn" /&gt; Token economies imply rights and duties for clients as well as for staff. When, according to the system, a client deserves tokens, he should get them, even when a staff member judges he doesn’t deserve them because he has been impolite the day before.
Family education and involvement is very important. They can support the system or they can undermine it, for instance by secretly giving undeserved rewards.

=== Leveled system ===
Often, token economies are leveled programs. Clients can pass through different levels until they reach the highest level. At that point, behaviors are performed without token reinforcement. Higher levels require more complex behaviors. The incentive to progress from one level to the next is the availability of increasingly desirable reinforcers.

== History of the token economy ==
In the early 19th century, long before there was any knowledge about operant learning, there were some precursors of token economies in schools and prisons. In those systems points could be earned and exchanged for many different items and privileges. Only in the 1960s the first real token economies arose in [[psychiatric hospital]]s. [[Teodoro Ayllon]], [[Nathan Azrin]] and [[Leonard Krasner]] were important pioneers in these early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|R.P. Liberman}}: [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=174312 The token economy.] ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 2000, 157, 1398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|T. Ayllon &amp; N.H. Azrin}} : ''The Token Economy: a motivational system for therapy and rehabilitation''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1968. {{ISBN|0-390-04310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first token economy bearing that name was founded by Ayllon and Azrin in 1961 at Anna State Hospital in Illinois. In the 1970s the token economies came to a peak and became  widespread. In 1977 a major study (a [[randomized controlled trial]]), still considered a landmark, was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|G.L. Paul &amp; R.J. Lentz}} : ''Psychosocial treatment of chronic mental patients: milieu versus social-learning programs''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-674-72112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed the superiority of a token economy compared to standard treatment and specialized milieu therapy. Despite this success token economies declined from the 1980s on. It became fairly quiet on that front due to a variety of problems and criticism.

== Problems and controversy ==
Especially the application of token economies with adults became a matter of criticism. In addition some impediments and the evolution of mental health care caused troubles.

=== Changes in patient care ===
Token economies have proven their effectiveness and utility for chronic psychiatric patients, despite requiring months or even years to achieve optimal results. This causes problems when insurance and government policies increasingly require the shortest possible hospital stays. Because emphasis has shifted to community-based treatment, outpatient and home-based care is often the preferred choice over institutionalization. This decentralization of patient care methods makes it difficult to further study and develop token economies in a scientific, research-oriented method.

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
Token economies can present issues with concern to patient rights. The right to have their personal properties, basic comfort and freedom of choice of treatment constrained the possibilities for token economies. In addition, ethical and personal concerns of staff members arose: is it ethically justified to use cigarettes as secondary reinforcers; is it human to rely on ‘reward and punishment’ as means for treatment (behavior modification often is reduced to this by opponents); isn’t sincere human contact much more valuable and effective; and do token economies reduce human interaction to trade, therefore centering patients' attention (and behavior) upon materials?

=== Client resistance ===
Application of a token economy to adults sometimes triggers client resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|A.E. Kazdin}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1308287/pdf/jaba00041-0109.pdf The token economy: a decade later.] ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 1982, 15, 431-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response maintenance and generalization ===
Problems with maintaining what’s been learned and the generalization toward new situations have been signaled. When the token programs stops the acquired behavior might disappear again.

=== Extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation ===
Rewarding behavior could increase the extrinsic [[motivation]] and at the same time decrease the [[intrinsic motivation]] for activities. (Note, these terms are not part of ABA literature).

== Recent applications and findings ==
In the last 50 years much research has been conducted on token economy. The first 20 years were especially productive. Despite controversy and a lack of implementation token programs are alive and well in several settings.

=== Adults ===
In adult settings token economies are mostly applied in [[mental health]] care. The criticism that clients have no choice and are being forced, is countered by offering them the choice to enter the token program or not to enter, or to leave again once entered. The vast majority of clients in past studies voluntarily chose to stay in the program.
Research{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} shows the effects of token economies can more or less be divided into three categories:
* No effect: 5 to 20% of the clients do not (or minimally) respond to the token economy;
* Only effect while the token economy is active and no effect once stopped: in this case the token economy is functioning as a [[prosthesis]] (like a [[wheelchair]]); it does not permanently help the patient once terminated but is necessary to maintain normal functioning;
* Well established long-term effects (including community reintegration).

==== Schizophrenia ====
The first token economies were designed for chronic, treatment-resistant [[psychosis|psychotic]] inpatients. Even now token economies are applied to clients with [[schizophrenia]], who are often resistant to common behavioral treatment approaches. Sometimes the token economy is used as a lasting prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|C.M. Coelho}}, e.a.: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08952840801984816 Rehabilitation programs for elderly women inpatients with schizophrenia.] ''Journal of Woman &amp; Aging'', 2008, 3, 283-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it’s used to help such clients reach [[resocialization]]. A token economy (of course always in combination with other interventions) succeeded in the community reintegration of 78% of the clients within an average period of 110 days, after more than 7 years of uninterrupted hospital stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|S.M. Silverstein}}, e.a.: [http://michaelbfriedman.com/mbf/images/stories/Rehabilitationf_Treatment_Refractory_Schizophrenia_2006.pdf Behavioral rehabilitation of the "treatment-refractory" schizophrenia patient: conceptual foundations, interventions, and outcome data.] ''Psychological Services'', 2006, 3, 145-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows clients experience the token economy with positive reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|M.F. Lin}}, e.a.: [http://journals.lww.com/jnr-twna/Abstract/2006/12000/Significant_Experiences_of_Token_Therapy_From_the.9.aspx Significant experiences of token therapy from the perspective of psychotic patients.] ''Journal of Nursing Research'', 2006, 14, 315-323.&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent reviews of [[psychosocial]] treatment for schizophrenia explicitly mention token economy as an effective, [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|G.D. Shean}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070131 Evidence-based psychosocial practices and recovery from schizophrenia.] ''Psychiatry'', 2009, 72, 307-320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|L.B.

==== Acute units ====
The application of token economies has been extended from [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] services to acute psychiatric units. A token economy was successful in decreasing the aggression on a ward where clients on average stayed for less than three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|J.P. LePage}}, e.a.: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227645080_Reducing_assaults_on_an_acute_psychiatric_unit_using_a_token_economy_a_2year_followup Reducing assault on an acute psychiatric unit using a token economy: a 2-year follow-up.] ''Behavioral Interventions'', 2003, 18, 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Substance abuse ====
As a result of heavy ethical criticism, token economies developed a negative stigma and, as a result, systems were sometimes introduced with aliases. This was especially the case in [[substance abuse]] treatment settings (although some systems for smoking cessation continue to use the term token economy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|V. McLeod}}: How to quit smoking by using a token economy method. EzineArticles, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, systems derived from token economies were used under the name [[contingency management]]; initially this was more broadly defined and referred to any direct coupling of consequences (reinforcements or punishments) with behavior (for example staying clean &lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|N.M. Higgins &amp; N. Petry}}: [http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/122-127.pdf Contingency Management Incentives for sobriety.] ''Alcohol Research &amp; Health'', 1999, 23, 122-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|M.W.

'''Transformations of text''' are strategies to perform [[transformation (geometry)|geometric transformations]] on text (reversals, rotations, etc.), particularly in systems that do not natively support transformation, such as [[HTML]], [[seven-segment display]]s and [[plain text]].

==Implementation==

Many systems, such as HTML, seven-segment displays and plain text, do not support transformation of text.  In the case of HTML, this limitation in display may eventually be addressed through standard [[cascading style sheets]] (CSS), since proposed specifications for [[CSS3]] include rotation for block elements.&lt;ref name="w3.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#rotating |title=CSS basic box model |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=August 9, 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-19 |editor=Bert Bos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, several ways of producing the visual effects of text transformations have come into use.

The most common of these transformations are [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]] and [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]].

[[Unicode]] supports a variety of characters that resemble transformed characters, primarily for various forms of [[phonetic transcription]]. Each of these character names indicates what kind of transformation the characters have undergone:

*Reversed characters, those that have been reflected in a vertical line (i.e., flipped horizontally);
*Inverted characters, those that have been reflected on a horizontal line (i.e., flipped vertically, only one letter has been done this way);
*Turned characters, those that have been rotated 180 degrees and thus appear upside-down (this is the most common);
*Sideways characters, those that have been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise (generally the least supported, and used only for a handful of vowels in the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] system).

===Upside-down text===
{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}
Strategies can be used to render words upside down in languages such as [[HTML]] that do not permit [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]] of text; using Unicode characters (especially those in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]), a very close approximation of '''upside-down text''' (also called '''flip text''') can be achieved. The letters s, x, z and o are [[rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetrical]], while pairs such as b/q, d/p and n/u are rotations of each other. The rest of the letters have been encoded into the Unicode IPA section, generating a complete set of upside-down lowercase letters. With the addition of the [[Fraser alphabet]] to the Unicode standard in version 5.2, full (or at least near-full) support for upside-down capital letters is now available. Number support is incomplete; four numbers are universally [[strobogrammatic number|strobogrammatic]] (0, 8, and 6/9), and the upside-down versions of numbers 2 and 3 have been provisionally assigned Unicode points for use in [[duodecimal|dozenal notation]]; however, other numbers still are not supported. Punctuation (by use of such characters as the [[interpunct]] and the [[inverted question mark and exclamation point]]) is mostly covered. Several Internet utilities exist for the transformation of regular text to (and sometimes from) upside-down text; each has its own slightly different algorithm for letters not precisely or well covered. A list of converters and algorithms can be found at [[#Comparison of algorithms|the list below]].

A similar process is '''USD encoding''', which uses characters entirely within the [[ASCII]] character set. Because it is almost entirely alphanumeric, it is far more compatible with other programs that do not support Unicode, and more readily typed by hand. However, the text created by using USD encoding is far less legible, and in fact more closely resembles [[Leet]]. Another problem is that because not all letters fit well, the USD algorithms cannot be a complete [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] (i.e., completely convertible back and forth) and contain a complete set of letters at the same time. For instance, the Albartus USD algorithm example seen in the [[#Examples|"Examples" section below]] has k, T, t, and R still in their upright positions. Another issue with USD encoding is the use of [[italic type]]. The letter "a" will, in most typefaces using italic fonts, render it as a "one-story" [[Latin alpha]], thus causing problems with any word using that letter as a lowercase "e." [[Oblique type]] does not have this problem.

Below is a conversion table that can be used to transform lowercase, uppercase numeric and punctuation output. These characters require unicode version 8.0 minimum (in particular the ᘔ and Ɛ from the [[duodecimal]] block).

===Sideways text===

Sideways text presents a unique problem. Though it is likely the most practical (as opposed to artistic) form of text transformation, it is the least supported and is the most difficult to implement. Unlike rotating text 180 degrees, the number of sideways characters falls far short of what would be needed for most purposes, and because text is rendered horizontally, it would be very difficult to render beyond one line of vertical text in a well-aligned manner without columns, especially in proportional fonts (furthermore, each character would require a line break after it). The process of using alternate characters for sideways text is further complicated by the fact that most fonts space letters further apart vertically (to accommodate [[underline|underlining]] and [[overline|overlining]]) than horizontally, and that most fonts are taller than they are wider, making simulated sideways text look significantly more awkward.

[[Internet Explorer]] has a [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] property that will rotate normally entered text 90 degrees clockwise:

:&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div style="writing-mode:tb-rl;"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

However, no other major browsers ([[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] nor [[WebKit]] based browsers) support this writing-mode property.  However, all major standards-compliant browsers now support [[CSS3]] rotation for block elements, which makes the visual rotation of HTML text available.&lt;ref name="caniuse"&gt;[http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d Can I use... CSS3 transforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common way around these problems is to use [[image]]s of text, which can then be rotated and transformed in an image editor at will, and to represent the text in those images with the [[alt attribute]] so that search engines and text-only browsers can read it properly. The use of [[ANSI art]] and [[box-drawing character]]s to manually draw sideways text has the advantage of being copiable and pastable (whereas images are not in most plain text situations), but generally creates large characters.

===Reversed text===
{{main|Mirror writing}}

Though less widespread, text can also be reversed to be a mirror image of itself. Letters A, H, I, M, O/o, T, U, V/v, W/w, X/x, Y, and in some fonts i and l are symmetrical in the y-axis; the pairs of b/d and p/q transform to each other. The letters И, Я, and ''г'' from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], among other sources, are among the numerous characters that can be used to further generate this effect. Reversed text can use capital letters mixed with lowercase, as opposed to the strict lowercase used by upside-down transformation (upside-down lowercase and capital letters do not generally align as they would upright, though reversed letters do).

X-axis symmetry is visible in the letters B, C, D, E, H, I, K, O, X, and in some fonts &lt;span style="font-family:Century Gothic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; and l, as well as in the pairs of a/&lt;span style="font-family:Arial,sans-serif;"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;, b/p, d/q, e/G, and f/t. Expanding to Cyrillic and Greek produces more symmetries, such as Λ/V and Γ/L.

The [[Fixedsys Excelsior]] typeface includes a complete set of reversed characters like this in its Private Use Area. However, online utilities to create mirrored text are not readily available, and most sites that claim to "mirror text" or "reverse text" in fact only change the order of the letters and do not actually flip the letters themselves.

==Dilated text==
Through the use of Unicode's [[small capitals]] and [[subscript and superscript]] [[Phonetic symbols in Unicode|phonetic modifiers]], text can be created that is smaller than the inline text.  This is generally only necessary for applications that only support one-size plain text, since HTML and CSS support different text sizes.

==Examples==

*Artistry, such as representing the two end zones or player designations on an [[American football]] gridiron; e.g. "[[Pittsburgh Steelers|sɹəʅəəʇS ɥɓɹnqsʇʇɪƋ]]"&lt;sup&gt;[http://fullervision.net/superbowl43.html from this example]&lt;/sup&gt;  or "[[New York Giants|sʇuɐɪ''ŋ'' ʞɹoʎ ʍəN]] ƕ" (note the use of [[hwair]] as a [[dingbat]] of the team's logo).
*[[Emoticon]]s are traditionally drawn sideways in North America.
*Better fit; for instance, rotating column headers on a [[table (HTML)|table]] sideways would produce a more compact table, desirable particularly in tables that contain mostly abbreviations and numeric values.
*[[Faux Cyrillic|Evoking Russian stereotypes]], by flipping certain letters one at a time.
*Evoking simplicity, such as childlike confusion over the direction of a letter (e.g., "[[Toys R Us|Toys Я Us]]") or to indicate vulgarity (such as the wordmark for [[Korn|KoЯn]]).
*[[Symmetry]], such as in the wordmarks for [[Nine Inch Nails]] (NIИ), [[ABBA]] (ᗅᗺᗷᗅ), or ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' "EIB" slogan (εıз). The use of transformation in this fashion is known as an ''[[ambigram]]''.
*[[Calculator spelling]] on seven-segment displays, where numbers represent letters upside down (e.g. &lt;span style="font-family:OCR A Extended,OCR-A II;"&gt;07734&lt;/span&gt;, "hello").
*Emulating the [[boustrophedon]] style of writing, where alternating lines are written in opposite directions.
*[[Pentomino]]es and [[tetromino]]es resemble (and are traditionally named after) Latin letters, and the rotation of these letterlike objects forms the basis of several games, including [[Tetris]].
*Though not strict transformation, the substitution of a plural "s" with its near-reflection "z" is a fairly common [[trope (literature)|trope]] among some minor league [[team sport|sports teams]] in the United States, in order to make team names seem more modern.
*Basic [[encryption]], to "hide" the answer to a joke or puzzle, for instance:

:Question: How can you tell an introvert from an extrovert?
:Answer: &lt;span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande;"&gt;˙sǝoɥs s,ʎnƃ ɹǝɥʇo ǝɥʇ ʇɐ sʞool ʇɹǝʌoɹʇxǝ ǝɥʇ 'sɹoʇɐʌǝlǝ ǝɥʇ uı&lt;/span&gt; (Using the Revfad algorithm)
:Or: 'saoys s.hn6 R3HTO ayt te skool tJa^oJtxa ayt  `sJote^ala ayt uI (using the Albartus USD algorithm)

*In [[baseball scorekeeping]], a player who strikes out despite not swinging at the third strike is indicated in the official score book with a reversed or turned K. It has been added to Unicode in version 7.0 at U+A7B0 (Ʞ).
*On the [[Soundgarden]] album [[Superunknown]], all mention of the album or title track (except in the lyrics booklet) is shown as "Superиmoиʞи∩".
*The beverage [[7Up]] during the early 2000s had a spin-off counterpart, known as [[dnL]], with a significantly different color and flavor as well as caffeine.
*[[Facebook]] added "upside-down English" as a language choice in summer 2009.

Example of reversed text reflected along a y-axis:

:Example:&lt;span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande;"&gt;...иiɒəɒ иɘqo [[Parallel universe (fiction)|x иoiƨиɘмib]] oɟ lɒɟɿoq ɘнɟ ɟʇɘl γbodɘмoƧ&lt;/span&gt; (Somebody left the portal to Dimension X open again...)

Poet Darius Bacon has written two examples of [[palindrome|palindromic]] poetry that reads the same upside-down as it does upside right.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Darius. [http://wry.me/~darius/writings/a-poem.html a poem] and [http://wry.me/~darius/writings/deus-am.html deus am]. The Palindromist #4.&lt;/ref&gt;

This diagram is named after the [[mosquito coil]] ({{zh|c=[[:zh:蚊香|蚊香]]|p=wénxiāng}}), a coiled incense for repelling mosquitos, because of its similar shape.

Because the wenxiang diagram is generated by a conical projection of a helix onto a plane, with the start (N-terminus) of the helix at the edge and the end toward the center, the location of each residue in a helix is not only defined by an angle around the diagram’s center, but is also defined by its radius from the center of the diagram in number of turns, which corresponds to its distance along the helix, in number of turns. Therefore, in principle, the wenxiang diagram can be used to represent an [[alpha-helix]] of any length. The example shown is quite long, with 7 turns and sequence NIAEAVQQLNHTIVNAAHELHETLGL; its hydrophobic side is in red and its hydrophilic side in blue.

'''''Wren &amp; Martin''''' refers to a single book ''High School English Grammar and Composition'' or collectively, a series of English [[grammar]] textbooks written jointly by [[P. C. Wren]] and [[H. Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhatia|first=Sidharth|title=Looking for my copy of Wren &amp; Martin|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/opinion/column_looking-for-my-copy-of-wren-and-martin_1273151|newspaper=DNA|date=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written primarily for the children of [[British_Army|British officers]] residing in [[India]], these books were widely adopted by [[India|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] schools in the post-colonial era and missionary schools in [[Burma]]. The books were published in 1935, with a discussion on [[Composition (language)|composition]] added later. The content in the books is largely based on ''[[The Manual of English Grammar and Composition]]'' by [[J. C. Nesfield]].

Other books in this series are ''Elementary English Grammar'', ''A First Book of English Grammar and Composition'', ''High School English Grammar and Composition'' and ''A Final Course of Grammar &amp; Composition''. The series of textbooks is still in use at many Indian schools.  While [[semantic change]] has dated the original books, they continue to enjoy considerable popularity and updated versions are now in common use. Copies of the different versions of this series are available online.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Zero one or infinity (ZOI) rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] in [[software design]] proposed{{when|date=June 2017}} by early [[computing]] pioneer [[Willem van der Poel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WillemLouisVanDerPoel&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that arbitrary limits on the number of instances of a particular entity{{technical statement|date=June 2017}} should not be allowed. Specifically, an entity should either be forbidden entirely, only one should be allowed, or any number of them should be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zero-One-Infinity-Rule.html | title = Zero-One-Infinity Rule | work = [[Jargon File]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although various factors outside that particular [[software]] could limit this number in practice, it should not be the software itself that puts a hard limit on the number of instances of the entity.

'''''"Allow none of foo, one of foo, or any number of foo."'''
''

Examples of this rule may be found in the structure of many [[file system]]s' directories (also known as folders): 
* 0 – The topmost directory has zero [[parent directories]]; that is, there is no directory that contains the topmost directory.  
* 1 – Each subdirectory has exactly one parent directory (not including shortcuts to the directory's location; while such files may have similar icons to the icons of the destination directories, they are not directories at all).  
* [[Infinity|∞ (infinity)]] – Each directory, whether the topmost directory or any of its subdirectories, according to the file system's rules, may contain any number of files or subdirectories. Practical limits to this number are caused by other factors, such as space available on [[storage media]] and how well the computer's [[operating system]] is maintained.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
Note that violations of this rule of thumb do exist: for example, some file systems impose a limit of 65,536 (i.e. 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) files to a directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm| title = NTFS vs. FAT vs exFAT | work = NTFS.com | accessdate = 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
