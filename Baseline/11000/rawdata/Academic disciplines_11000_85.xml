      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15828">The '''Affect infusion model''' ('''AIM''') is a theoretical model in the field of human psychology. Developed by social psychologist [[Joseph Paul Forgas]] in the early 1990s, it attempts to explain how [[mood (psychology)|mood]] affects one's ability to process information. A key assertion of the AIM is that the effects of mood tend to be exacerbated in complex situations that demand substantial cognitive processing. In other words, as situations become more complicated and unanticipated, mood becomes more influential in driving evaluations and responses.

==Affect infusion==
Forgas defined the term ''affect infusion'' as "the process whereby affectively loaded information exerts an influence on and becomes incorporated into the judgmental process, entering into the judge's deliberations and eventually coloring the judgmental outcome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.39 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and judgment: The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1| pages = 39–66 | pmid = 7870863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a process that determines the degree to which mood can affect our judgement. According to the AIM, affect (mood and emotion) exerts a notable influence not only on information processing but on the resulting response behaviors as well. For example, if a person receives an inordinately large electric bill, they will respond differently if they have had a relaxing and stress-free day than they will if they have just been stuck in traffic for two hours. Under this latter circumstance, the person will experience high levels of affect infusion, as their agitated state will undoubtedly be made worse upon seeing the electric bill.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

An assumption of the AIM is that this effect will generally occur more strongly as the complexity of a situation increases. Highly complex situations can exhibit a number of qualities, such as the amount of effort needed to process the information, whether the situation is familiar or entirely new and how severely the situation affects the person. Some common activities that tend to produce high affect infusion include: choosing whether or not to drink or take drugs, selecting or getting to know a new partner, explaining a conflict or allocating rewards to a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.565 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1998 | title = On feeling good and getting your way: Mood effects on negotiator cognition and bargaining strategies | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 565–577 | pmid = 11407408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing strategies==
According to Forgas, the varying levels of affect infusion can be seen as a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], with four alternative processing strategies as markers along that continuum. These strategies represent the different degrees of severity in which mood exerts its influence. In identifying these strategies, two important differentiating factors are considered: 
* the information search strategies used to perform a task (open or restricted)
* the extent of the information considered in constructing a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.928 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J. P. | year = 1999 | title = On feeling good and being rude: Affective influences on language use and request formulations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 928–939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors related to the judgment target, context, and judger influence which processing strategy is selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.39 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and judgment: The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1| pages = 39–66 | pmid = 7870863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Familiarity - Familiar targets are more likely to elicit either direct access or motivated processing.
* Importance - Unimportant judgments are more likely to encourage direct access processing or motivated processing when a specific motive exists.
* Atypical - If a target is complex or unusual it is more likely to trigger substantive processing, otherwise heuristic processing may be used.
* Cognitive capacity - If the individual has cognitive capacity substantive processing may be more likely.
* Affective state - Positive affect is more closely linked to heuristic processing, while negative affect is more closely associated with substantive processing.
* Motivation for accuracy - An individual who is motivated to be accurate will be more likely to use substantive processing.

===Direct access processing===
The least intensive of the four, direct access processing, involves reproducing a stored reaction, that is, repeating a response that has been given before to a similar situation. According to the AIM, the influence of mood on cognition will be least severe during this type of processing.

===Motivated processing===
Motivated processing usually involves specific and targeted search strategies with a direct informational goal in mind. This strategy also involves little influence from mood, as the individual in question will have a fairly clear idea of what information he or she needs (although it is higher on the continuum than direct access processing).

===Heuristic processing===
[[Heuristic]] processing assumes that affective processing, or emotional processing, occurs outside our awareness, with people simply making sense of their emotional reactions as they happen. Thus, affective experience provides people with information about themselves, including their tendencies and implicit judgments. This process is also known as the "affect-as-information" mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.45.3.513 | last1 = Schwarz | first1 = N. | last2 = Clore | first2 = G. L. | year = 1983 | title = Mood, misattribution, and judgments of well-being: Informative and directive functions of affective states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 513–523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive processing===
Also called systematic processing, this strategy involves the most elaborate cognitive processing and appears highest on the continuum, as it is the most powerfully affected by mood. The reason substantive processing is most apt to be infused by affect is because mood can affect each stage in the cognition process: attention, encoding, retrieval, and association.

* Attention – To grapple with the amount of information that elicits substantive processing, people are likely to only focus on a subset of the entire information available. Mood-congruent information is more likely to be attended to than mood-incongruent information.
* Encoding – People spend more time encoding mood-congruent into a richer network of representations than mood incongruent information.
* Retrieval - Mood-congruent information is more likely to be retrieved from memory than other details.
* Association – Constructive social judgments require the interpretation of complex information. Affect can prime certain associations that influence subsequent interpretation.

Taken as a whole, Forgas has identified two overarching conditions under which mood is most likely to affect information processing: 
* situations that require cognition about difficult, peripheral subjects
* situations that require judgment of obscure, atypical subjects.

==Relationship to risk behavior==
Because mood itself is relatively complex, being the sum of many smaller emotional experiences with no single cause, pinpointing its real-world influence is no easy task. But scholars have used the AIM to examine a number of social phenomena with a variety of results. One area of research involving the AIM concerns the model's role in understanding an individual's propensity for risk taking. Since risky behavior can trigger a complex and varied set of emotional responses (elation, [[fear]], acceptance, etc.), a person's mood might be expected to play a substantial and unpredictable role in any choice to take heavy risks. If a person is in a good mood, he or she might be more likely to appraise the risk positively and be willing to accept any consequences in advance. But even if they are in a bad mood, they could be more likely to rebel against their cultural norms and take the risk anyway.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

This relationship has been examined in a particular experiment by attempting to manipulate a person's mood in order to produce infusion responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.22.2.310 | last1 = Chou | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Lee | first2 = T. M. C. | last3 = Ho | first3 = A. H. Y. | year = 2007 | title = Does mood state change risk taking tendency in older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 310–318 | pmid = 17563186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] is that the "risk taking tendency is greater for those individuals who are in a happy mood than for those who are in a sad mood".&lt;ref&gt;Chou, K. L., Lee, T. M. C., &amp; Ho, A. H. Y. (2007). p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this experiment were exposed to one of three priming movies (happy, sad, or neutral) and then measured on a risk-taking scale. The researchers divided the sample into two units of separation, one being age (old and young) and the other being mood valence (happy, neutral and sad). Not only did their data confirm their hypothesis for both younger and older participants, but it also confirmed the AIM as a legitimate instrument for studying the complexities of mood.

Another study examined how the AIM relates to a specific type of risk behavior: [[gambling]]. It investigated how mood affects an individual's sustained inclination to gamble, especially among non-regular gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.961116299.x | last1 = Hills | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Hill | first2 = S. | last3 = Mamone | first3 = N. | last4 = Dickerson | first4 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Induced mood and persistence at gaming | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 96 | issue = 11| pages = 1629–1638 | pmid = 11784459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers separated regular and non-regular gamblers and measured how their moods affected their experiences on the gaming floor. Specifically, they expected non-regular gamblers in a good mood to be more persistent than non-regular gamblers in a bad mood. This is because gambling, when it is a new and unfamiliar experience, complete with the bright lights and colors that are a feature of the average casino, requires a great deal of information processing, making it especially unattractive to someone in a bad mood. Their research confirmed this notion, but in addition, it was used to positively identify depression as a causal factor of addictive gambling, when the casino has become a familiar environment.

==Influence on interpersonal behavior==
In striving for a deeper understanding of the AIM, scholars have examined different types of behavior that can be expected when affect (mood and emotion) strongly influences information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1207/s15327965pli0903_2 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Vargas | first2 = P. | year = 1998 | title = Affect and behavior inhibition: The mediating role of cognitive processing strategies | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 205–210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is by no means an exact science, as the behavioral consequences of affect are usually indirect and varied, but they have been able to show that "affective states have a subtle and cognitively mediated influence on the ways people perform or inhibit complex strategic behaviors" (p.&amp;nbsp;206). In other words, emotion influences thinking and behavior in subtle ways. A person in a strongly positive mood may be more confident and use more direct interpersonal behaviors than they would if they were in a bad mood. They may feel 'untouchable' due to the many good things that have happened to them and approach complex situations with an increased level of assurance. As the research has shown, this effect becomes greater as a situation becomes more complex.

In this sense, the AIM is a potential instrument for propaganda campaigns that promote a link between positive affect and desired behavior. For example, many failed attempts to dissuade adolescents from smoking have involved morbid and gloomy advertisements that only serve to depress their viewers. According to the AIM, messages that establish a comfortable atmosphere and focus not on the consequences of smoking but on the benefits of not smoking would probably be more successful.

==The AIM as a research tool==
Along with a clearer understanding of the effect of mood on a person's information processing, the AIM also provides a guide by which researchers can design experiments to investigate the effect of sending persuasive messages to subjects. One important area of research involves the concept of 'mood congruence', or how the results of mood compare to the mood itself. It has been found that 'mood congruence' occurs when a person exhibits a positive relationship between his or her mood and a dependent variable; essentially, as the strength of the mood increases or decreases, so the performance measured by this variable increases or decreases correspondingly. Conversely, 'mood incongruence' occurs when a person exhibits a negative relationship between mood and the dependent variable; thus, as mood increases, performance decreases and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2007.00144.x | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Kirby | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = M. B. | year = 2007 | title = The influence of affect on goal choice and task performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 14–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction has been used to study the relationship between moods and personal goals. For those who are mood congruent, mood generally has a positive relationship with goal motivation, which presents a major opportunity to designers of public health information.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M., &amp; Brief, A. P. (1996). Motivational agendas in the workplace: The effects of feelings on focus of attention and work motivation. In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior'' (Vol. 18, pp. 75-109). Greenwich, CT: JAI.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this line of thought, establishing a positive mood state within the emotional feel of a message and then psychologically connecting that state to the desired behavior would be critical to the message's efficacy.

The AIM has also provided useful insights to other fields. In consumer research, the AIM has helped to explain how males and females differ in their processing of advertising under happy and sad mood states.

The '''Association of MBAs''' ('''AMBA''') is a global organisation founded in 1967 which focuses primarily on international business school accreditation and membership.

== Activities ==
Based in London, AMBA is one of the three main global accreditation bodies in business education (see '''[[Triple accreditation|Triple Accreditation]]''') and styles itself as the world's impartial authority on postgraduate management education. It differs from [[AACSB]] in the [[United States|US]] and [[EQUIS]] in [[Brussels]] as it accredits a school's portfolio of postgraduate management programmes but does not accredit undergraduate programmes. AMBA accredits approximately 2% of the world's business schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/business-schools/business-school-search/schools-a-to-z|title=Accredited Business Schools A-Z - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most international of the three organisations having accredited schools headquartered in 54 countries, compared with the 52 for AACSB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accredited-members|title=AACSB-Accredited Schools|website=www.aacsb.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38 for EQUIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools|title=EQUIS Accredited Schools|last=Pergoot|first=Nick|website=www.efmd.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business schools can become associated with AMBA in two ways: by applying for accreditation, or by applying for membership of the '''AMBA Development Network (ADN),''' which confers institutional membership similar to [[EFMD]] or AACSB membership. Schools that cannot meet all of the AMBA accreditation criteria usually join the ADN, which gives them time to prepare for accreditation with support from AMBA and mentoring from an AMBA-accredited school.

All MBA students and alumni of the [[List of institutions accredited by AMBA|257 accredited member schools]] join AMBA as individual members free of charge. AMBA also accredits generalist [[Master of Management|MBM]] programmes and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] programmes, and admits as members students and graduates thereof.

== History ==
The Association of MBAs was founded in 1967 as an MBA alumni club by eight [[UK]] graduates from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford]] and [[Columbia Business School|Columbia]], and two graduates from the first intake of [[London Business School]]. The founders saw a lack of awareness in [[Europe]] of the value of the MBA degree, which at that time was primarily an American qualification. They decided to form a lobby and membership group to promote the benefits of postgraduate business education, under the name of Business Graduates Association (BGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's development helped shape the growth of management education in Europe and the UK and coincided with the setting up and growth of [[London Business School]] and [[Manchester Business School]] in Britain.

The Association's first Director General was Vice-Admiral [[David Clutterbuck]] who assumed this position in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Association of MBAs fabulous at forty, Ambition, January 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045432/http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 BGA began to accredit the growing number of [[MBA]] programmes, while preserving its functions as a membership organization. BGA was renamed Association of MBAs in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbaworld.com/aboutus/ourhis1&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2017, AMBA's president was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], who helped establish one of the two business schools in Cambridge, UK.

== Activities ==
=== Accreditation ===
[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]The Association of MBAs accredits MBA, MBM and DBA degree programmes. When a school  applies for accreditation for its MBA programmes, AMBA requires that the entire portfolio of MBA programmes be put up for consideration and will award accreditation only if all programmes meet its criteria (though the school pays the same fee regardless of the number of programmes being reviewed).

The Association's process of accrediting a school's MBA programmes portfolio includes reviewing compliance AMBA's criteria, most of them qualitative rather than quantitative. The criteria fall into seven dimensions: history and development of the institution; facilities and libraries; teaching faculty, teaching standards and research track record; programme administration, career and alumni services; student admission standards, diversity and cohort size; curriculum content, programme mode and duration; and learning outcomes.

Some of the key AMBA criteria for the accreditation of an MBA programme include:
* all admitted students should have at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience upon the start of the MBA course (''a criterion which the vast majority of the top US business schools cannot meet as US MBA programmes sometimes admit applicants with only a bachelor's degree and no work experience'');
* a new school applying for accreditation should have a track record of at least three years of graduating MBA students before it can be accredited;
* an MBA programme should have a cohort size of at least 20 students;
* at least 50% of the faculty of an MBA programme (including visiting faculty as part of the total) are expected to have PhD degrees; and
* a full-time MBA curriculum should contain no less than 500 contact (scheduled faculty-mediated) hours and a distance-learning MBA programme should have no less than 120 synchronous contact hours.

===  Events ===
AMBA holds three annual conferences for business school deans and directors:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbaworld.com/bschoolevents Events for business schools - Association of MBAs]. Mbaworld.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; a Global Conference, an Asia Pacific Conference, and a Latin America Conference. Participation is open to both accredited and non-accredited schools. AMBA also hosts an annual Gala Dinner in London, which is open only to accredited schools.

AMBA organises two annual global forums with the purpose of development and training for specific functions within AMBA-accredited business schools such as accreditation managers; programme managers; marketing, admissions, alumni and development staff.

AMBA also organises webinars, lectures and networking events on a regular basis catering to MBA alumni, current MBA students, prospective MBA students and business school admissions departments. These on-campus events are held at accredited business schools and often feature distinguished speakers and practitioners in fields such as leadership, entrepreneurship and innovation.

The '''Blackstone Canal''' was a waterway linking [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] (and Narragansett Bay) through the Blackstone Valley via a series of locks and [[canal]]s during the early 19th century.

==History==

The initiative for the canal came from Providence, where a merchant community wished to profit from trade with the farming country of the Blackstone Valley and Worcester County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachushistory.org/detocqueville-visit-united-states/articles/blackstone-canal-artery-heart-commonwealth| Teachushistory.org|Blackstone Canal-artery-heart of the Commonwealth]&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Worcester and the Blackstone Valley, eager for transport that would enable them to get better prices for their produce, welcomed the plan.  However, since the trade of central Massachusetts was at that time going overland through the port of Boston, Massachusetts commercial interests succeeded in stalling the project for several years.  Finally, in 1823, the  Blackstone Canal Company was organized through an act of the Massachusetts legislature, with a Rhode Island company soon following.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112"&gt;Muir, Diana, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  The canal's construction may have been motivated by competition among rival industrialists to curtail "[[water rights]]".&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanely Woolen Mill, The Story |publisher=Deaneredevelopment.com |url=http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720070524/http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1825 and cost $750,000 (twice its initial estimate). The canal opened on October 7, 1828 when the [[packet boat]] ''Lady Carrington'' arrived in Worcester, the first vessel to make the trip. The canal brought immediate prosperity to Worcester and the Valley; farmers' profits increased and mills were built, especially in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112" /&gt; Using water to transport goods was a great improvement over the rough roads of the era. At the time of its construction, it represented the best available transportation technology.

It was a two-day trip for the canal boats from Worcester to Providence and another two-day trip to return to Worcester. The overnight stopping point was in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]]. Boston merchants moved to recapture the trade moving down the canal to Providence, opening a rail line to Worcester in 1835.  (Boston merchants opened three railroads in 1835, one to Lowell, one to Worcester, and one to Providence, RI. These were very new technology.) In 1847 the parallel [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] began operation, and the canal closed in 1848.

The canal was 35 feet or more in width. It ascended 451 feet, passing through an original 49 locks. The canal used "slack-water" to bypass narrow valley areas and intersected the Blackstone River 16 times over its 45-mile course. It ran in the river itself for 10% of its length. These portions proved troublesome since in summer, water was sometimes too low for navigation. In other periods, flooding was the problem. Winter added ice to the issues.

Each lock was 70 feet long by 10 feet wide and apparently 4–4.5 feet deep. All, except the wooden tide lock at Providence, were built of granite on a wooden foundation. The average lift of each lock was 9.2 feet, but there were variations.

The canal was engineered by [[Benjamin Wright]] (chief engineer of the [[Erie Canal]]) and Holmes Hutchinson (later Chief Engineer of New York's canals) as they were concluding work on the original Erie Canal. Its locks are therefore similar, although smaller, than the original Erie's.

The canal followed the course of Mill Creek from the center of Worcester, MA to the southern part of that community. It then followed the Blackstone River downstream to Ashton, RI. At Ashton, it paralleled the river's west bank, maintaining elevation until it entered Cranberry and Scotts Ponds on the divide of the watershed with the Moshassuck River. It then locked down into the Moshassuck Valley and followed that stream into Providence, RI.

==The canal today==
Since the canal's closure, parts of its watercourse were filled and other segments are now heavily overgrown with brush and trees. Other sections were converted to hydraulic canals for textile mills. Much of the lock masonry was sold for other purposes. Its remains, however, are still visible in many locations. About 85% of the canal remains. Two long sections of the canal exist in the [[Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park]] in Massachusetts and the [[Blackstone River State Park]] in Rhode Island. Other sections are also publicly owned.

The canal is the subject of several listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The southernmost portion of the canal, between Providence and the Ashton Dam in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island]], was listed in 1971; this list was expanded in 1991 to include the entire Rhode Island section.  A {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} section of the canal in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]] and [[Northbridge, Massachusetts]] was listed in 1973; this listing was expanded in 1995 to encompass the entire historic footprint of the canal in Massachusetts.

== Significance ==
The Blackstone Canal is historically significant as a transportation network arising from a canal-building frenzy of the early 19th-century. The canal played a key role in stimulating the industry between Providence and Worcester and the towns and villages along the Moshassuck
and Blackstone Rivers. Though its useful service life was just twenty years long, the canal and the parks incorporating the canal are "visible and tangible parts of the city's and the state's history of growth, planning, commercial ambition and prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/lincoln/linc_blackstone-canal_ronci-park.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places - Blackstone Canal | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''busy beaver game''' consists of designing a halting, binary-alphabet [[Turing machine]] which writes the most 1s on the tape, using only a limited set of states. The rules for the 2-state game are as follows:

#the machine must have two states in addition to the halting state, and 
#the tape starts with 0s only.

As the player, you should conceive each state aiming for the maximum output of 1s on the tape while making sure the machine will halt eventually.

The '''''n''th busy beaver''', '''BB-''n''''' or simply "busy beaver" is the Turing machine that wins the ''n''-state Busy Beaver Game. That is, it attains the maximum number of 1s among all other possible ''n''-state competing Turing Machines. The [[#Examples|BB-2 Turing machine]], for instance, achieves four 1s in six steps.

The Busy Beaver Game has implications in [[computability theory]], the [[halting problem]], and [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Tibor Radó]] in his 1962 paper, "On Non-Computable Functions".

==The game==
The '''''n''-state busy beaver game''' (or '''BB-''n'' game'''), introduced in [[Tibor Radó]]'s 1962 paper, involves a class of [[Turing machine#Formal definition|Turing machines]], each member of which is required to meet the following design specifications:

*The machine has ''n'' "operational" states plus a Halt state, where ''n'' is a positive integer, and one of the ''n'' states is distinguished as the starting state. (Typically, the states are labelled by 1, 2, ..., ''n'', with state 1 as the starting state, or by ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ..., with state ''A'' as the starting state.) 
*The machine uses a single two-way infinite (or unbounded) tape.
*The tape alphabet is {0, 1}, with 0 serving as the blank symbol.
*The machine's ''transition function'' takes two inputs:
:#the current non-Halt state, 
:#the symbol in the current tape cell,
:and produces three outputs:
:#a symbol to write over the symbol in the current tape cell (it may be the same symbol as the symbol overwritten),
:#a direction to move (left or right; that is, shift to the tape cell one place to the left or right of the current cell), and
:#a state to transition into (which may be the Halt state).
:There are thus (4''n'' + 4)&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''n''-state Turing machines meeting this definition.
:The transition function may be seen as a finite table of 5-tuples, each of the form 
:(current state, current symbol, symbol to write, direction of shift, next state). 
"Running" the machine consists of starting in the starting state, with the current tape cell being any cell of a blank (all-0) tape, and then iterating the transition function until the Halt state is entered (if ever).  If, and only if, the machine eventually halts, then the number of 1s finally remaining on the tape is called the machine's ''score''.

The ''n''-state busy beaver (BB-''n'') game is a contest to find such an ''n''-state Turing machine having the largest possible score — the largest number of 1s on its tape after halting.  A machine that attains the largest possible score among all ''n''-state Turing machines is called an ''n''-state busy beaver, and a machine whose score is merely the highest so far attained (perhaps not the largest possible) is called a ''champion'' ''n''-state machine.

Radó required that each machine entered in the contest be accompanied by a statement of the exact number of steps it takes to reach the Halt state, thus allowing the score of each entry to be verified (in principle) by running the machine for the stated number of steps.  (If entries were to consist only of machine descriptions, then the problem of verifying every potential entry is undecidable, because it is equivalent to the well-known [[halting problem]] — there would be no effective way to decide whether an arbitrary machine eventually halts.)

== Related functions ==

===The busy beaver function Σ===

The '''busy beaver function''' quantifies the maximum score attainable by a Busy Beaver on a given measure. This is a [[noncomputable function]].  Also, a busy beaver function can be shown to grow faster [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotically]] than does any computable function.

The busy beaver function, Σ: ''N'' → ''N'', is defined such that Σ(''n'') is the maximum attainable score (the maximum number of 1s finally on the tape) among all halting 2-symbol ''n''-state Turing machines of the above-described type, when started on a blank tape.

It is clear that Σ is a well-defined function: for every ''n'', there are at most finitely many ''n''-state Turing machines as above, [[up to]] isomorphism, hence at most finitely many possible running times.

This infinite sequence '''Σ''' is the '''busy beaver function''', and any ''n''-state 2-symbol Turing machine ''M'' for which ''σ''(''M'') = Σ(''n'') (i.e., which attains the maximum score) is called a '''busy beaver'''.  Note that for each ''n'', there exist at least four ''n''-state busy beavers (because, given any ''n''-state busy beaver, another is obtained by merely changing the shift direction in a halting transition, another by shifting all direction changes to their opposite (with neutrals kept neutral), and the final by shifting the halt direction of the all-swapped busy beaver).

====Non-computability====
Radó's 1962 paper proved that if ''f'': [[natural number|ℕ]] → [[natural number|ℕ]] is any [[computable function]], then Σ(''n'') &gt; ''f(n)'' for all sufficiently large ''n'', and hence that Σ is not a computable function.

Moreover, this implies that it is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] by a general [[algorithm]] whether an arbitrary Turing machine is a busy beaver.  (Such an algorithm cannot exist, because its existence would allow Σ to be computed, which is a proven impossibility.  In particular, such an algorithm could be used to construct another algorithm that would compute Σ as follows: for any given ''n'', each of the finitely many ''n''-state 2-symbol Turing machines would be tested until an ''n''-state busy beaver is found; this busy beaver machine would then be simulated to determine its score, which is by definition Σ(''n'').)

Even though Σ(''n'') is an uncomputable function, there are some small ''n'' for which it is possible to obtain its values and prove that they are correct. It is not hard to show that Σ(0) = 0, Σ(1) = 1, Σ(2) = 4, and with progressively more difficulty it can be shown that Σ(3) = 6 and Σ(4) = 13 {{OEIS|A028444}}. Σ(''n'') has not yet been determined for any instance of ''n'' &gt; 4, although lower bounds have been established (see the [[#Known values for Σ and S|Known values]] section below).

In 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson obtained the first (explicit) upper bound on the minimum ''n'' for which Σ(''n'') is unknowable. To do so they constructed a 7910-state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | arxiv=1605.04343 | author=Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson | title=A Relatively Small Turing Machine Whose Behavior  Is Independent of Set Theory | institution=MIT | type=Technical Report | number= | pages= | date=May 2016 | bibcode=2016arXiv160504343Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing machine whose behavior cannot be proven based on the usual axioms of set theory ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]]), under reasonable consistency hypotheses ([[Stationary Ramsey Property]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030734-300-turing-machine-should-run-forever-unless-maths-itself-is-wrong/|title=This Turing machine should run forever unless maths is wrong|last=Aron|first=Jacob|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Version from May 3rd contained 7918 states: {{cite news|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2725|title=The 8000th Busy Beaver number eludes ZF set theory|last=|first=|date=2016-05-03|work=Shtetl-Optimized blog|access-date=|via=|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later reduced to 1919 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2741|title=Three announcements|last=|first=|date=2016-05-03|work=Shtetl-Optimized blog|access-date=|via=|accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/sorear/metamath-turing-machines/blob/master/sample_out/zf.tm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complexity and unprovability of Σ====

A variant of [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is defined as follows [cf. Boolos, Burgess &amp; Jeffrey, 2007]:  The ''complexity'' of a number ''n'' is the smallest number of states needed for a BB-class Turing machine that halts with a single block of ''n'' consecutive 1s on an initially blank tape.  The corresponding variant of [[Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]] states that, in the context of a given [[axiomatic system]] for the natural numbers, there exists a number ''k'' such that no specific number can be proved to have complexity greater than ''k'', and hence that no specific upper bound can be proven for Σ(''k'') (the latter is because "the complexity of ''n'' is greater than ''k''" would be proved if "''n'' &gt; Σ(''k'')" were proved). As mentioned in the cited reference, for any axiomatic system of "ordinary mathematics" the least value ''k'' for which this is true is far less than [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|10↑↑10]]; consequently, in the context of ordinary mathematics, neither the value nor any upper-bound of Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) can be proven. ([[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]] is illustrated by this result: in an axiomatic system of ordinary mathematics, there is a true-but-unprovable sentence of the form "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) = ''n''", and there are infinitely many true-but-unprovable sentences of the form "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) &lt; ''n''".)

===Maximum shifts function ''S''===
In addition to the function Σ, Radó [1962] introduced another extreme function for the BB-class of Turing machines, the '''maximum shifts function''', ''S'', defined as follows:

* ''s''(''M'') = the number of shifts ''M'' makes before halting, for any ''M'' in ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',
* ''S''(''n'') = max{ ''s''(''M'') | ''M'' ∈ ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' } = the largest number of shifts made by any halting ''n''-state 2-symbol Turing machine.

Because these Turing machines are required to have a shift in each and every transition or "step" (including any transition to a Halt state), the max-shifts function is at the same time a max-steps function.

Radó showed that ''S'' is noncomputable for the same reason that Σ is noncomputable — it grows faster than any computable function.  He proved this simply by noting that for each ''n'', ''S''(''n'') ≥ Σ(''n''). Each shift may write a 0 or a 1 on the tape, while Σ counts a subset of the shifts that wrote a 1, namely the ones that hadn't been overwritten by the time the Turing machine halted; consequently, ''S'' grows at least as fast as Σ, which had already been proved to grow faster than any computable function.

The following connection between Σ and ''S'' was used by Lin &amp; Radó [''Computer Studies of Turing Machine Problems'', 1965] to prove that Σ(3) = 6:  For a given ''n'', if ''S''(''n'') is known then all ''n''-state Turing machines can (in principle) be run for up to ''S''(''n'') steps, at which point any machine that hasn't yet halted will never halt.  At that point, by observing which machines have halted with the most 1s on the tape (i.e., the busy beavers), one obtains from their tapes the value of Σ(''n'').  The approach used by Lin &amp; Radó for the case of ''n'' = 3 was to conjecture that ''S''(3) = 21, then to simulate all the essentially different 3-state machines for up to 21 steps. By analyzing the behavior of the machines that had not halted within 21 steps, they succeeded in showing that none of those machines would ever halt, thus proving the conjecture that ''S''(3) = 21, and determining that Σ(3) = 6 by the procedure just described.

Inequalities relating Σ and ''S'' include the following (from [Ben-Amram, et al., 1996]), which are valid for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}S(n) &amp;\ge \Sigma(n) \\ S(n) &amp;\le (2n-1)\Sigma(3n+3) \\ S(n) &amp;&lt; \Sigma(3n+6) ; \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotically]] improved bound (from [Ben-Amram, Petersen, 2002]): there exists a constant ''c'', such that for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2,

:&lt;math&gt;S(n) \le \Sigma\left(n + \left\lceil \frac{8n}{\log_2 n} \right\rceil + c\right). &lt;/math&gt;

===Known values for Σ and ''S''===
The function values for Σ(''n'') and ''S''(''n'') are only known exactly for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The current 5-state busy beaver champion produces {{val|4098}} 1s, using {{val|47176870}} steps (discovered by Heiner Marxen and Jürgen Buntrock in 1989), but there remain 28 machines with non-regular behavior which are believed to never halt, but which have not yet been proven to run infinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Skelet [http://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html lists 42 unproven machines, but 14 are already proven]. However, other busy beaver hunters have different sets of machines.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining machines have been simulated to 81.8 billion steps, but none halted. It is very likely that Σ(5) = 4098 and S(5) = 47176870, but this remains unproven. At the moment the record 6-state champion produces over {{val|3.515|e=18267|u=1s}} (exactly (25*4&lt;sup&gt;30341&lt;/sup&gt;+23)/9), using over {{val|7.412|e=36534|u=steps}} (found by Pavel Kropitz in 2010).  As noted above, these are 2-symbol Turing machines.

A simple extension of the 6-state machine leads to a 7-state machine which will write more than 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;{{val|18705353}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 1s to the tape, but there are undoubtedly much busier 7-state machines.

Milton Green, in his 1964 paper "A Lower Bound on Rado's Sigma Function for Binary Turing Machines",  constructed a set of Turing machines demonstrating that

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma(2k) &gt; 3 \uparrow^{k-2} 3 &gt; A(k-2,k-2) \qquad \mbox{for }k \ge 2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ↑ is [[Knuth up-arrow notation]] and ''A'' is [[Ackermann's function]].

Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma(10) &gt; 3 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3 = 3 \uparrow\uparrow 3^{3^3} = 3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.^3}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

(with 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|7625597484987}} terms in the exponential tower), and

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma(12) &gt; 3 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3 = g_1, &lt;/math&gt;

where [[Graham's number#Magnitude|the number ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the enormous starting value in the sequence that defines [[Graham's number]].

In 1964 Milton Green developed a lower bound for the Busy Beaver function that was published in the proceedings of the 1964 IEEE symposium on switching circuit theory and logical design. Heiner Marxen and Juergen Buntrock described it as "a non-trivial (not primitive recursive) lower bound". This lower bound can be calculated but is too complex to state as a single expression in terms of n. When n=8 the method gives
Σ(8) ≥ 3 × (7 × 3&lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt; - 1) / 2 ≈ 8.248×10&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;.

In contrast, the best current (as of 2018) lower bound on Σ(6) is {{val|e=18267}}, which is greater than the lower bound given by Green's formula, 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27 (which is tiny in comparison). In fact, it is much greater than the lower bound: 3 ↑↑ 3 = 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|7625597484987}}, which is Green's first lower bound for Σ(8), and also much greater than the second lower bound: 3*(7*3&lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;-1)/2.

===Proof for uncomputability of ''S''(''n'') and Σ(''n'')===

Suppose that ''S''(''n'') is a computable function and let ''EvalS'' denote a TM, evaluating ''S''(''n''). Given a tape with ''n'' 1s it will produce ''S''(''n'') 1s on the tape and then halt. Let ''Clean'' denote a Turing machine cleaning the sequence of 1s initially written on the tape. Let ''Double'' denote a Turing machine evaluating function ''n'' + ''n''. Given a tape with ''n'' 1s it will produce 2''n'' 1s on the tape and then halt. 
Let us create the composition ''Double'' | ''EvalS'' | ''Clean'' and let ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of states of this machine. Let ''Create_n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote a Turing machine creating ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 1s on an initially blank tape. This machine may be constructed in a trivial manner to have ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; states (the state ''i'' writes 1, moves the head right and switches to state ''i'' + 1, except the state ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which halts). Let ''N'' denote the sum ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Let ''BadS'' denote the composition ''Create_n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' | ''Double'' | ''EvalS'' | ''Clean''. Notice that this machine has ''N'' states. Starting with an initially blank tape it first creates a sequence of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 1s and then doubles it, producing a sequence of ''N'' 1s. Then ''BadS'' will produce ''S''(''N'') 1s on tape, and at last it will clear all 1s and then halt. But the phase of cleaning will continue at least ''S''(''N'') steps, so the time of working of ''BadS'' is strictly greater than ''S''(''N''), which contradicts to the definition of the function ''S''(''n'').

The uncomputability of Σ(''n'') may be proved in a similar way. In the above proof, one must exchange the machine ''EvalS'' with ''EvalΣ'' and ''Clean'' with ''Increment'' — a simple TM, searching for a first 0 on the tape and replacing it with 1.

The uncomputability of ''S''(''n'') can also be established by reference to the blank tape halting problem. The blank tape halting problem is the problem of deciding for any Turing machine whether or not it will halt when started on an empty tape.  The blank tape halting problem is equivalent to the standard [[halting problem]] and so it is also uncomputable.  If ''S''(''n'') was computable, then we could solve the blank tape halting problem simply by running any given Turing machine with ''n'' states for ''S''(''n'') steps;  if it has still not halted, it never will.  So, since the blank tape halting problem is not computable, it follows that ''S''(''n'') must likewise be uncomputable.

===Generalizations===
For any [[model of computation]] there exist simple analogs of the busy beaver. For example, the generalization to Turing machines with ''n'' states and ''m'' symbols defines the following '''generalized busy beaver functions''':

# Σ(''n'', ''m''): the largest number of non-zeros printable by an ''n''-state, ''m''-symbol machine started on an initially blank tape before halting, and
# ''S''(''n'', ''m''): the largest number of steps taken by an ''n''-state, ''m''-symbol machine started on an initially blank tape before halting.

For example, the longest-running 3-state 3-symbol machine found so far runs {{val|119112334170342540}} steps before halting&lt;!--[http://www.cse.unr.edu/~al/BusyBeaver.html]--&gt;. The longest running 6-state, 2-symbol machine which has the additional property of reversing the tape value at each step produces {{val|6147}} 1s after {{val|47339970}} steps. So ''S''&lt;sub&gt;RTM&lt;/sub&gt;(6) ≥ {{val|47339970}} and Σ&lt;sub&gt;RTM&lt;/sub&gt;(6) ≥ {{val|6147}}.

It is possible to further generalize the busy beaver function by extending to more than one dimension.

Likewise we could define an analog to the Σ function for [[register machine]]s as the largest number which can be present in any register on halting, for a given number of instructions.

===Exact values and lower bounds===
The following table lists the exact values and some known lower bounds for ''S''(''n'', ''m'') and Σ(''n'', ''m'') for the generalized busy beaver problems. Note: entries listed as "???" are bounded from below by the maximum of all entries to left and above.  These machines either haven't been investigated or were subsequently surpassed by a smaller machine.

The Turing machines that achieve these values are available on both [http://www.drb.insel.de/~heiner/BB/ Heiner Marxen's] and [http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/ha.html Pascal Michel's] webpages.  Each of these websites also contains some analysis of the Turing machines and references to the proofs of the exact values.

==Applications==
In addition to posing a rather challenging [[mathematical game]], the busy beaver functions offer an entirely new approach to solving pure mathematics problems. Many [[open problem in mathematics|open problems in mathematics]] could in theory, but not in practice, be solved in a systematic way given the value of ''S''(''n'') for a sufficiently large ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider any [[conjecture]] that could be [[mathematical proof|disproven]] via a [[counterexample]] among a [[countable]] number of cases (e.g. [[Goldbach's conjecture]]).  Write a computer program that sequentially tests this conjecture for increasing values. In the case of Goldbach's conjecture, we would consider every even number ≥ 4 sequentially and test whether or not it is the sum of two prime numbers. Suppose this program is simulated on an ''n''-state Turing machine. If it finds a counterexample (an even number ≥ 4 that is not the sum of 2 primes in our example), it halts and notifies us. However, if the conjecture is true, then our program will never halt. (This program halts ''only'' if it finds a counterexample.)

Now, this program is simulated by an ''n''-state Turing machine, so if we know ''S''(''n'') we can decide (in a finite amount of time) whether or not it will ever halt by simply running the machine that many steps.  And if, after ''S''(''n'') steps, the machine does not halt, we know that it never will and thus that there are no counterexamples to the given conjecture (i.e., no even numbers that are not the sum of two primes).  This would prove the conjecture to be true.

Thus specific values (or upper bounds) for ''S''(''n'') could be used to systematically solve many open problems in mathematics (in theory).  However, current results on the busy beaver problem suggest that this will not be practical for two reasons:
* It is extremely hard to prove values for the busy beaver function (and the max shift function).  It has only been proven for extremely small machines with fewer than 5 states, while one would presumably need at least 20-50 states to make a useful machine. Furthermore, every known exact value of ''S''(''n'') was proven by enumerating every ''n''-state Turing machine and proving whether or not each halts. One would have to calculate ''S''(''n'') by some less direct method for it to actually be useful.
* But even if one did find a better way to calculate ''S''(''n''), the values of the busy beaver function (and max shift function) get very large, very fast.  ''S''(6) &gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;{{val|36534}}&lt;/sup&gt; already requires special pattern-based acceleration to be able to simulate to completion. Likewise, we know that ''S''(10) &gt; Σ(10) &gt; 3 ↑↑↑ 3 is a gigantic number.  Thus, even if we knew, say, ''S''(30), it is completely unreasonable to run any machine that number of steps. There is not enough computational capacity in the known part of universe to have performed even ''S''(6) operations directly.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 2001. [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110141 Computational Capacity of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{for|an example of a 3-state busy beaver's state table and its "run"|Turing machine examples#3-state Busy Beaver|Turing machine examples}}

These are tables of rules for the Turing machines that generate Σ(1) and ''S''(1), Σ(2) and ''S''(2), Σ(3) (but not ''S''(3)), Σ(4) and ''S''(4), and the best known lower bound for Σ(5) and ''S''(5), and Σ(6) and ''S''(6).

In the tables, columns represent the current state and rows represent the current symbol read from the tape. Each table entry is a string of three characters, indicating the symbol to write onto the tape, the direction to move, and the new state (in that order). The halt state is shown as &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;'''H'''&lt;/span&gt;.

Each machine begins in state '''A''' with an infinite tape that contains all 0s. Thus, the initial symbol read from the tape is a 0.

*: The results of this paper had already appeared in part in Lin's 1963 doctoral dissertation, under Radó's guidance.  Lin &amp; Radó prove that Σ(3) = 6 and ''S''(3) = 21 by proving that all 3-state 2-symbol Turing Machines which don't halt within 21 steps will never halt. (Most are proven automatically by a computer program, however 40 are proven by human inspection.)

*: Brady proves that Σ(4) = 13 and ''S''(4) = 107. Brady defines two new categories for non-halting 3-state 2-symbol Turing Machines: Christmas Trees and Counters. He uses a computer program to prove that all but 27 machines which run over 107 steps are variants of Christmas Trees and Counters which can be proven to run infinitely. The last 27 machines (referred to as holdouts) are proven by personal inspection by Brady himself not to halt.

[[Image:Lactose.svg|thumb|right|310px|[[Lactose]] is a [[disaccharide]] found in animal milk. It consists of a molecule of [[galactose|D-galactose]] and a molecule of [[glucose|D-glucose]] bonded by beta-1-4 [[glycosidic linkage]]. ]]

A '''carbohydrate''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|b|oʊ|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|eɪ|t}}) is a [[biomolecule]] consisting of [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H) and [[oxygen]] (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen [[atom]] ratio of 2:1 (as in water) and thus with the [[empirical formula]] {{nowrap|C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (where ''m'' may be different from ''n''). This formula holds true for [[monosaccharide]]s. Some exceptions exist; for example, [[deoxyribose]], a sugar component of [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=itHVNZicPgwC&amp;pg=PT86&amp;lpg=PT86&amp;dq=C5H10O4+Deoxyribose | title =Biology | first1 = Eldra Pearl | last1 = Solomon | first2 = Linda R. | last2 = Berg | first3 = Diana W. | last3 = Martin | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 52 | isbn = 978-0534278281 | via =google.books.com | year =2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the empirical formula C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/inchi/InChI%3D1S/C5H10O4/c6-2-1-4(8)5(9)3-7/h2,4-5,7-9H,1,3H2 | title =Material Measurement Library D-erythro-Pentose, 2-deoxy- | author =''[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'' | publisher =nist.gov | year =2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are technically [[hydrate]]s of carbon; structurally it is more accurate to view them as [[aldose]]s and [[ketose]]s.

The term is most common in [[biochemistry]], where it is a synonym of 'saccharide', a group that includes [[sugar]]s, [[starch]], and [[cellulose]]. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, [[disaccharide]]s, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower [[molecular weight]]) carbohydrates, are  commonly referred to as sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flitsch SL, Ulijn RV | title = Sugars tied to the spot | journal = Nature | volume = 421 | issue = 6920 | pages = 219–20 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12529622 | doi = 10.1038/421219a | bibcode = 2003Natur.421..219F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''saccharide'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σάκχαρον'' (''sákkharon''), meaning "sugar".&lt;ref name="avenas"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Avenas P | year = 2012 | chapter = Etymology of main polysaccharide names | veditors = Navard P | title = The European Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE) | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Wien | url = https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783709104200-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1364512-p174060193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix [[-ose]], as in the monosaccharides [[fructose]] (fruit sugar) and [[glucose]] (starch sugar) and the disaccharides [[sucrose]] ([[Sugar cane|cane]] or [[Sugar beet|beet]] sugar) and [[lactose]] (milk sugar).

Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for the storage of [[energy]] (e.g. [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]) and as structural components (e.g. [[cellulose]] in plants and [[chitin]] in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide [[ribose]] is an important component of [[coenzyme]]s (e.g. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as [[RNA]]. The related [[deoxyribose]] is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important [[biomolecules]] that play key roles in the [[immune system]], [[fertilization]], preventing [[pathogenesis]], [[blood clotting]], and [[developmental biology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Maton | first1 = Anthea  | first2 = Jean | last2 = Hopkins | first3  = Charles William | last3 = McLaughlin | first4 = Susan | last4 = Johnson | first5 = Maryanna Quon | last5 = Warner | first6 = David | last6 = LaHart | first7 = Jill D. | last7 = Wright | name-list-format = vanc | title=Human Biology and Health|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1993|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=52–59|isbn=0-13-981176-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch and sugars are the most important carbohydrates in human diet. They are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide. It is abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal [[flour]], such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar (sucrose, extracted from [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]s), lactose (abundant in milk), glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in [[honey]], many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey are often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.

Cellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble [[dietary fiber]]. Although it is not digestible, insoluble dietary fiber helps to maintain a healthy digestive system&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; by easing [[defecation]]. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include [[resistant starch]] and [[inulin]], which feed some bacteria in the [[microbiota]] of the [[large intestine]], and are [[metabolism|metabolized]] by these bacteria to yield [[short-chain fatty acids]].&lt;ref name="CRC Handbook of Dietary Fiber in Human Nutrition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cummings|first1=John H.|title=The Effect of Dietary Fiber on Fecal Weight and Composition|date=2001| publisher=CRC Press| location=Boca Raton, Florida| isbn=0-8493-2387-8| pages=184| edition=3rd| url=https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Handbook-of-Dietary-Fiber-in-Human-Nutrition-Third-Edition/Spiller/p/book/9780849323874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Byrne CS, Chambers ES, Morrison DJ, Frost G | title = The role of short chain fatty acids in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 1331–8 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25971927 | pmc = 4564526 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In scientific literature, the term "carbohydrate" has many synonyms, like "sugar" (in the broad sense), "saccharide", "ose",&lt;ref name="avenas"/&gt; "glucide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fearon WF | year = 1949 | title = Introduction to Biochemistry | edition = 2nd | location = London | publisher = Heinemann | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YkOaBQAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; "hydrate of carbon" or "[[Hydroxy group|polyhydroxy]] compounds with [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]". Some of these terms, specially "carbohydrate" and "sugar", are also used with other meanings.

In [[food science]] and in many informal contexts, the term "carbohydrate" often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate [[starch]] (such as cereals, bread and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, [[jam]]s, and desserts).

Often in lists of [[nutritional information]], such as the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]], the term "carbohydrate" (or "carbohydrate by difference") is used for everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This includes chemical compounds such as [[acetic acid|acetic]] or [[lactic acid]], which are not normally considered carbohydrates. It also includes [[dietary fiber]] which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute much in the way of [[food energy]] ([[Calorie|kilocalories]]), even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as though it were a sugar.

In the strict sense, "[[sugar]]" is applied for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food.

== Structure ==
Formerly the name "carbohydrate" was used in [[chemistry]] for any compound with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Following this definition, some chemists considered [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to be the simplest carbohydrate,&lt;ref name="coulter"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = John Merle | last1 = Coulter | first2 = Charler Reid | last2 = Barnes | first3 = Henry Chandler | last3 = Cowles | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1930 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WyZnVpCiTHIC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=simplest+carbohydrate | title = A Textbook of Botany for Colleges and Universities }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed that title for [[glycolaldehyde]].&lt;ref name="tietz"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Carl A. | last1 = Burtis | first2 = Edward R. | last2 = Ashwood | first3 = Norbert W. | last3 = Tietz | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5hqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=simplest+carbohydrate | title = Tietz fundamentals of clinical chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula. For example, while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates, ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this. For example, carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as: ''N''-acetyl (e.g. chitin), sulphate (e.g. glycosaminoglycans), carboxylic acid (e.g. sialic acid) and deoxy modifications (e.g. fucose and sialic acid).

Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n'' is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H–(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(C=O)–(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;–H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many [[hydroxyl]] groups added, usually one on each [[carbon]] [[atom]] that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]]. Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]]s. However, some biological substances commonly called "monosaccharides" do not conform to this formula (e.g. [[uronic acid]]s and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]) and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g. formaldehyde CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[inositol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Matthews CE, Van Holde KE, Ahern KG | year = 1999 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | isbn = 0-8053-3066-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[open-chain]] form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a [[heterocyclic compound|closed ring form]] where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] [[carbonyl]] group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (–OH) react forming a [[hemiacetal]] with a new C–O–C bridge.

Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, [[deoxyribose]], a component of [[DNA]], is a modified version of [[ribose]]; [[chitin]] is composed of repeating units of [[N-acetyl glucosamine]], a [[nitrogen]]-containing form of glucose.

==Division==
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type. They may be classified according to their degree of polymerization, and may be divided initially into three principal groups, namely sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Carbohydrates in human nutrition | series = FAO Food and Nutrition Paper - 66 | chapter = Chapter 1 – The role of carbohydrates in nutrition | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w8079e/w8079e07.htm | publisher =Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red atoms highlight the [[aldehyde]] group and the blue atoms highlight the [[chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric center]] furthest from the aldehyde; because this -OH is on the right of the [[Fischer projection]], this is a D sugar.]]
Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general [[chemical formula]] of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, literally a "carbon hydrate". Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n=3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and L-glyceraldehydes.

Note the position of the hydroxyl group (red or green) on the anomeric carbon relative to the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group bound to carbon 5: they either have identical absolute configurations (R,R or S,S) (α), or opposite absolute configurations (R,S or S,R) (β).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1955/#_ch2_s4_ | chapter = Structural Basis of Glycan Diversity | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | edition = 3rd | publisher =  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Cold Spring Harbor (NY) | first1 = Carolyn R | last1 = Bertozzi | first2 = David | last2 = Rabuka | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-1-621821-32-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics: the placement of its [[carbonyl]] group, the number of [[carbon]] atoms it contains, and its [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] handedness. If the carbonyl group is an [[aldehyde]], the monosaccharide is an [[aldose]]; if the carbonyl group is a [[ketone]], the monosaccharide is a [[ketose]]. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called [[triose]]s, those with four are called [[tetrose]]s, five are called [[pentose]]s, six are [[hexose]]s, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Neil A.| first2 = Brad | last2 = Williamson | first3 = Robin J. | last3 = Heyden | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|isbn=0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, [[glucose]] is an [[aldohexose]] (a six-carbon aldehyde), [[ribose]] is an [[aldopentose]] (a five-carbon aldehyde), and [[fructose]] is a [[ketohexose]] (a six-carbon ketone).

Each carbon atom bearing a [[hydroxyl group]] (-OH), with the exception of the first and last carbons, are [[Chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric]], making them [[Stereogenic|stereo center]]s with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of [[isomer]]s may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using [[Le Bel-van't Hoff rule]], the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;=16 possible [[stereoisomer]]s. In the case of [[glyceraldehyde]]s, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are [[enantiomers]] and [[epimer]]s. [[Dihydroxyacetone|1, 3-dihydroxyacetone]], the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The "D-" and "L-" prefixes should not be confused with "d-" or "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar  [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] plane [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]]. This usage of "d-" and "l-" is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pigman | first1 = Ward | last2 = Horton | first2 = D. | name-list-format = vanc | title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=1–67|chapter=Chapter 1: Stereochemistry of the Monosaccharides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ring-straight chain isomerism===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[Glucose]] can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
The aldehyde or ketone group of a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]], forming a [[heterocyclic]] ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called [[furanose]] and [[pyranose]] forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.&lt;ref name=pigman&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pigman | first1 = Ward | last2 = Anet | first2 = E.F.L.J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=165–94|chapter=Chapter 4: Mutarotations and Actions of Acids and Bases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conversion from straight-chain form to the cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the [[anomeric carbon]], becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called [[anomer]]s. In the ''α anomer'', the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]) of the ring from the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the ''β anomer''.

===Use in living organisms===
Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for [[metabolism]], being used both as an energy source ([[glucose]] being the most important in nature) and in [[biosynthesis]]. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often [[polysaccharide]]s. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is [[glycogen]], especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, [[starch]] is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, [[cellulose]], is a structural component of the [[cell wall#plant cell walls|cell wall]] of plants and many forms of algae. [[Ribose]] is a component of [[RNA]]. [[Deoxyribose]] is a component of [[DNA]]. [[Lyxose]] is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lyxoflavin|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/lyxoflavin|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ribulose]] and [[xylulose]] occur in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. [[Galactose]], a component of milk sugar [[lactose]], is found in [[galactolipid]]s in [[cell membrane#lipids|plant cell membranes]] and in [[glycoprotein]]s in many [[biological tissue|tissues]]. [[Mannose]] occurs in human metabolism, especially in the [[glycosylation]] of certain proteins. [[Fructose]], or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during [[digestion]], and found in [[semen]]. [[Trehalose]], a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.

==Disaccharides==
[[Image:sucrose 3Dprojection.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Sucrose]], also known as table sugar, is a common disaccharide. It is composed of two monosaccharides: [[glucose|D-glucose]] (left) and [[fructose|D-fructose]] (right).]]
{{Main|Disaccharide}}
Two joined monosaccharides are called a [[disaccharide]] and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a [[covalent]] bond known as a [[glycosidic linkage]] formed via a [[dehydration reaction]], resulting in the loss of a [[hydrogen]] atom from one monosaccharide and a [[hydroxyl group]] from the other. The [[chemical formula|formula]] of unmodified disaccharides is C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.

[[Sucrose]], pictured to the right, is the most abundant disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants. It is composed of one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule and one [[fructose|D-fructose]] molecule. The [[systematic name]] for sucrose, ''O''-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things:
* Its monosaccharides: glucose and fructose
* Their ring types: glucose is a [[pyranose]] and fructose is a [[furanose]]
* How they are linked together: the oxygen on carbon number 1 (C1) of α-D-glucose is linked to the C2 of D-fructose.
* The ''-oside'' suffix indicates that the [[anomeric carbon]] of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond.

[[Lactose]], a disaccharide composed of one [[galactose|D-galactose]] molecule and one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The [[systematic name]] for lactose is ''O''-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include [[maltose]] (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides can be classified into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.

==Nutrition==
{{undue weight|date=June 2015}}
[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrate consumed in food yields 3.87 kilocalories of energy per [[gram]] for simple sugars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6202|title=Show Foods|work=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.57 to 4.12 kilocalories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e04.htm|title=Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods – Energy Conversion Factors|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants, including sweets, cookies and candy, table sugar, honey, soft drinks, breads and crackers, jams and fruit products, pastas and breakfast cereals. Lower amounts of carbohydrate are usually associated with unrefined foods, including beans, tubers, rice, and unrefined fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.diabetes.org.uk/upload/How%20we%20help/catalogue/carb-reference-list-0511.pdf |title=Carbohydrate reference list |website=www.diabetes.org.uk |date=  |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal-based foods generally have the lowest carbohydrate levels, although milk does contain a high proportion of [[lactose]].

Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy. Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy. Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other [[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s but glucose is often metabolized first. In ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', for example, the [[lac operon]] will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the ''lac'' operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first (see: [[Diauxie]]). [[Polysaccharide]]s are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose; most organisms, however, cannot metabolize [[cellulose]] or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process cellulose. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible, they represent an important dietary element for humans, called [[dietary fiber]]. Fiber enhances digestion, among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichon L, Huneau JF, Fromentin G, Tomé D | title = A high-protein, high-fat, carbohydrate-free diet reduces energy intake, hepatic lipogenesis, and adiposity in rats | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 1256–60 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16614413 | doi = 10.1093/jn/136.5.1256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geneva: [[World Health Organization]]. pp. 55–56. {{ISBN|92-4-120916-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 [[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|Cochrane Systematic Review]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that whole grain diets can affect cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="pmid28836672"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Kelly SA, Hartley L, Loveman E, Colquitt JL, Jones HM, Al-Khudairy L, Clar C, Germanò R, Lunn HR, Frost G, Rees K | title=Whole grain cereals for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease | journal= [[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]] | volume=8 | pages=CD005051 | year=2017 |url=https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/bitstream/10044/1/54579/2/Kelly_et_al-2017-.pdf | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3  | pmid = 28836672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===&lt;!-- This title is used as a redirect target --&gt;
[[Nutrition]]ists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex. However, the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous. The term ''complex carbohydrate'' was first used in the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] publication ''Dietary Goals for the United States'' (1977) where it was intended to distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates (which were perceived to be nutritionally superior).&lt;ref&gt;Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation (1998), ''Carbohydrates in human nutrition'', [http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e07.htm chapter 1]. {{ISBN|92-5-104114-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report put "fruit, vegetables and whole-grains" in the complex carbohydrate column, despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides. This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide energy but few other nutrients). The standard usage, however, is to classify carbohydrates chemically: simple if they are sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s) and complex if they are [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s).&lt;ref name=NutSource&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbohydrates|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|access-date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the simple vs. complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=NutSource /&gt; Some simple carbohydrates (e.g. [[fructose]]) raise blood glucose slowly, while some complex carbohydrates (starches), especially if processed, raise blood sugar rapidly. The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate, how the food is prepared, individual differences in metabolism, and the chemistry of the carbohydrate.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenkins DJ, Jenkins AL, Wolever TM, Thompson LH, Rao AV | title = Simple and complex carbohydrates | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 44–9 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 3703387 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1986.tb07585.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA's]] ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010'' call for moderate- to high-carbohydrate consumption from a balanced diet that includes six one-ounce servings of grain foods each day, at least half from [[whole grain]] sources and the rest from [[Enriched grain|enriched]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines.htm ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic index|glycemic index (GI)]] and [[glycemic load]] concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion. They rank carbohydrate-rich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on [[blood glucose]] levels. Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food [[glucose]] is absorbed, while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods. The [[insulin index]] is a similar, more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on [[insulin|blood insulin]] levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.

=== Effects of dietary carbohydrate restriction ===

{{See also|Low-carbohydrate diet}}

Carbohydrates are a common source of energy in living organisms; however, no single carbohydrate is an [[essential nutrient]] in humans.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westman EC | title = Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 951–3; author reply 953-4 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11976176 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/75.5.951a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are able to obtain all of their energy requirement from protein and fats, though the potential for some negative health effects of extreme carbohydrate restriction remains, as the issue has not been studied extensively yet.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt; However, in the case of [[dietary fiber]]&amp;nbsp;– indigestible carbohydrates which are not a source of energy&amp;nbsp;– inadequate intake can lead to significant increases in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park Y, Subar AF, Hollenbeck A, Schatzkin A | title = Dietary fiber intake and mortality in the NIH-AARP diet and health study | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = 12 | pages = 1061–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21321288 | pmc = 3513325 | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2011.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16685046"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston CS, Tjonn SL, Swan PD, White A, Hutchins H, Sears B | title = Ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets have no metabolic advantage over nonketogenic low-carbohydrate diets | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 1055–61 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16685046 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.5.1055 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/83/5/1055.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a diet consisting of very low amounts of daily carbohydrate for several days will usually result in higher levels of blood [[ketone bodies]] than an isocaloric diet with similar protein content. This relatively high level of ketone bodies is commonly known as [[ketosis]] and is very often confused with the potentially fatal condition often seen in [[Type 1 diabeties|type 1 diabetics]] known as diabetic [[ketoacidosis]]. Somebody suffering ketoacidosis will have much higher levels of blood ketone bodies along with high blood sugar, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], but the liver can break these down to produce ketones. However, the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain, which normally relies upon glucose for its energy.&lt;ref name="Ebert_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebert D, Haller RG, Walton ME | title = Energy contribution of octanoate to intact rat brain metabolism measured by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 13 | pages = 5928–35 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12843297 | doi =  | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/13/5928.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marin-Valencia I, Good LB, Ma Q, Malloy CR, Pascual JM | title = Heptanoate as a neural fuel: energetic and neurotransmitter precursors in normal and glucose transporter I-deficient (G1D) brain | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–82 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23072752 | pmc = 3564188 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2012.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medbio.info/Horn/IntMet/integration_of_metabolism%20v4.htm | title=Integration of Metabolism|work=medbio.info | first = Robert S. | last = Horn | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gluconeogenesis]] allows humans to synthesize some glucose from specific amino acids: from the [[glycerol]] backbone in [[triglyceride]]s and in some cases from fatty acids.

==Metabolism==
{{Main|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
Carbohydrate metabolism denotes the various [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes responsible for the [[anabolism|formation]], [[catabolism|breakdown]] and interconversion of carbohydrates in [[life|living]] [[organism]]s.

The most important carbohydrate is [[glucose]], a simple sugar ([[monosaccharide]]) that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms. Glucose and other carbohydrates are part of a wide variety of metabolic pathways across species: [[plants]] synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by [[photosynthesis]] storing the absorbed energy internally, often in the form of [[starch]] or [[lipid]]s. Plant components are consumed by animals and [[fungi]], and used as fuel for [[cellular respiration]]. Oxidation of one gram of carbohydrate yields approximately 9&amp;nbsp;kJ (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of [[Chemical energy|energy]], while the oxidation of one gram of lipids yields about 38&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal). The human body stores between 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrates depending on body weight, with the skeletal muscle contributing to a large portion of the storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_sciversesciencedirect_elsevierS0263-9319(13)00087-2&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=hc&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|title=Surgery Oxford|last=Maughan|first=Ron|date=June 2013|website=www.onesearch.cuny.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy obtained from metabolism (e.g., oxidation of glucose) is usually stored temporarily within cells in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name="energetics"&gt;{{cite web | title = Energetics of Cellular Respiration (Glucose Metabolism) | first = Sweety | last = Mehta | name-list-format = vanc | work = Biochemistry Notes, Notes | date = 9 October 2013 | url = http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/energetics-of-cellular-respiration-glucose-metabolism/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms capable of anaerobic and [[aerobic respiration]] that metabolizes glucose and [[oxygen]] (aerobic) to release energy with [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] as byproducts.

===Catabolism===
Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to break down larger molecules, extracting energy. There are two major [[metabolic pathway]]s of monosaccharide [[catabolism]]: [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].

In glycolysis, oligo- and polysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called [[glycoside hydrolase]]s. The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism. A 2&amp;nbsp;ATP investment is required in the early steps of glycolysis to phosphorylate Glucose to [[Glucose 6-phosphate|Glucose 6-Phosphate]] ([[Glucose 6-phosphate|G6P]]) and [[Fructose 6-phosphate|Fructose 6-Phosphate]] ([[Fructose 6-phosphate|F6P]]) to [[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate|Fructose 1,6-biphosphate]] ([[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate|FBP]]), thereby pushing the reaction forward irreversibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_sciversesciencedirect_elsevierS0263-9319(13)00087-2&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=hc&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|title=Surgery Oxford|last=Maughan|first=Ron|date=June 2013|website=www.onesearch.cuny.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.

The '''Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece''' (CHS GR&lt;ref&gt;initials used, for example, on Center's Web site&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[research Center]] based in [[Nafplio]], [[Greece]]. A twin institution to its counterpart [[Harvard University]]’s [[Center for Hellenic Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/collection.php?cpk=1631|title=Center for Hellenic Studies {{!}} Harvard University Press|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHS GR is housed in the Iatrou building, formerly home to the municipal town hall of Nafplio, at Philhellene and King Othon Street. A joint American and Greek Executive Board supervise the Center in Greece. The Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece is Professor Ioannis Petropoulos of the [[Democritus University of Thrace]].

== History ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece inaugurated in 2008 by way of a joint decision between the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] and the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. CHS GR utilizes the knowledge and expertise of [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Harvard]]'s faculty and [[Research Center|research centers]] and is a part of [[Harvard University|Harvard]]’s continuing effort to expand its international presence.&lt;ref name="summer.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.harvard.edu/search/all|title=Harvard Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|deadurl=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center serves as a nexus for the network of international Centers operated by Harvard in [[Europe]] and around the globe, and it was organized and developed by being accessible, and free of charge, to the general public.

From a geographical standpoint Nafplio's role in the shaping of modern Greece and its enduring cultural significance make it an opportune setting for Harvard students as well as for visitors from Greece and across the globe. Nafplio neighbors with many archaeological sites in Greece such as [[Mycenae]], [[Mystras]], [[Epidaurus]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Tiryns]], etc. Nafplio was the first capital of [[History of modern Greece|modern]] Greece after independence and a port during the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean period]].

== Digital Library ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies’s facility in Nafplio has been equipped with a [[Digital library|Digital Library]] which provides access to [[Harvard Library]]'s electronic resources and a number of additional databases. Access is open to all researchers and visitors of the Center, regardless of affiliation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/kentroellspoudonharvardmenu.html|title=The Center for Hellenic Studies (Greece), Harvard University|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nafplio.gr|language=en-gb|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The Center for Hellenic Studies provides training and professional development to students, visitors, and researchers in all fields of study through a wide variety of [[Educational program|programs]], which include internships, workshops and seminars, research initiatives, and study abroad:

*The CHS Cultural Internship Program in Greece&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; brings together a group of college students from different [[Academic institution|institutions]] throughout [[Greece]] and the [[United States]] for five weeks each summer in [[Nafplio]] to work and gain professional experience. Students develop their talents and skills while contributing to projects that directly support the goals and activities of the internship institutions, which are the Fougaro Cultural Complex, the Municipal Organization of Culture, Environment, Sports, and Tourism (DOPPAT), the [[Archaeological Museum of Nafplion|Nafplio Archaeological Museum]] and the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery, Nafplio Annex]].
*The five-week-long Comparative Cultural Studies Seminar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.summer.harvard.edu/study-abroad/greece|title=Harvard Summer Program in Greece|last=|first=|date=|work=Harvard Summer School|access-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCS) is the oldest [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study-abroad program of [[Harvard Summer School]]. Divided between [[Nafplio]] and [[Thessaloniki]], and led by Harvard Professor [[Gregory Nagy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.fas.harvard.edu/people/gregory-nagy-0|title=Gregory Nagy|last=|first=|date=|website=classics.fas.harvard.edu|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding team of Harvard-trained Senior Fellows, the program seeks to promote cross-cultural understanding by combining historical, literary, philosophical, and linguistic approaches to [[cultural exchange]].
*The CHS GR High School Summer Program (HSSP) is a sixteen-day summer program addressed to high school students from the [[Argolis]]. The students attend an intensive daily seminar led by Harvard faculty, and [[Teaching fellow|Teaching Fellows]] studying at Harvard. The Harvard undergraduate students acting as the Teaching Fellows support the daily program by assembling course material as well as preparing every other activity related to the program. The program is directed by Dr. Nicolas Prevelakis, Lecturer in Harvard's Committee on Degrees in Social Studies and Assistant Director of Curricular Development at [[Center for Hellenic Studies|Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C.]]
*CHS offers [[research]] opportunities to junior faculty members and individual researchers, aiming to build a network of fellows that will enhance learning and support the academic profile of Greece. The CHS-CCS Fellowships Program, addresses junior faculty—Adjunct Lecturers, Lecturers, Assistant Professors—of 100 Schools of [[Humanities]] and [[Social science|Social Sciences]] from [[List of universities in Greece|Greek Universities]]. The fellows participate in the CCS Program in Greece by presenting their research and interacting with colleagues and students from the U.S. and elsewhere. Their year-long appointment includes access to all Harvard electronic resources. CHS also offers in collaboration with the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], Faculty of Philosophy, School of Philology, Department of Classics, the CHS-AUTH joint research fellowships to young [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] holders from AUTH’s Department of Classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/affilliations|title=Agreements of Scientific Cooperation {{!}} ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI|last=|first=|date=|website=www.auth.gr|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowships include year-long access to Harvard University’s online databases and resources and to AUTH’s library system and also participation in a number of events and activities organized by both institutions.
*In cooperation with the Harvard Alumni Association, the Center for Hellenic Studies supports the organization of the “Greece Spring Break for Students and Alumni” Trip. Academic head of the program is Professor [[Gregory Nagy]]. Starting from [[Nafplio]] and [[Mycenae]] and proceeding through the [[Peloponnese]], [[Delphi]] and [[Athens]], the group supplements its explorations with selected readings in translation from [[Homer]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and some modern texts. The group consists of students, alumni, and participants and alumni from the Harvard [[Massive open online course|MOOC]] The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edx.org/course/ancient-greek-hero-24-hours-harvardx-hum2x-2|title=The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours|last=|first=|date=|work=edX|access-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and Activities ==
As part of its mission of outreach, the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece offers a regular program of activities that address not only Harvard and other academic institutions but also the local community, including the [[Argolis]] region and the [[Peloponnese]]. Such is the Events Series, which is organized with the support of Municipalities of the [[Argolis]], [[Nafplio]], [[Argos|Argos-Mycenae]], [[Ermionida]], [[Epidaurus]], as well as other institutions such as the Society for the Promotion of Education and Learning (SPEL), the [[University of Peloponnese]], the Harvard Club of Greece, the [[Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki]], etc. A number of other activities such as educational programs, exhibitions, events and workshops are organized in collaboration with institutions of the city such as the Municipal Organization of Culture, Environment, Sports, and Tourism (DOPPAT), Municipalities of the [[Argolis]] as well as the regional government of the [[Peloponnese]], the Athletic Federation of Greece (SEGAS), the Department of Theatre Studies, University of [[Peloponnese]], the Fougaro Cultural Complex, etc.

CHS in Greece has established long collaborations with institutions such as SPEL under the direction of [[Georgios Babiniotis|George Babiniotis]], the [[International Olympic Academy]], the [[Fulbright Foundation]] in Greece, the [[Michael Marks Awards for Poetry Pamphlets|Michael Marks]] Charitable Trust, the [[University of Peloponnese]], in order to provide a regular program of events and activities addressed to the local and global educational and research community.

CHS GR also hosts and supports a number of visiting study abroad programs and collaborates with a number of educational institutions. To name a few: the Summer Study Abroad Program of the [[University of Washington Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies|Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington]], Seattle; the Summer Program in Greece of [[Duke University]], Department of Philosophy and Education Office for Undergraduates; the Study Abroad Program in Greece “Food and Culture in Greece” of [[University of Louisiana System|Louisiana University]]; the Summer Program in Greece of the [[College of William &amp; Mary|College of William and Mary]], Department of Classical Studies.

All these activities constitute an offering back to the local community of the [[Peloponnese]] and the global community.

==Appearance==

Carcot-Leyden crystals are composed of an eosinophilic lysophospholipase binding protein called Galectin -10. They vary in size and may be as large as 50&amp;nbsp;µm in length. Charcot–Leyden crystals are slender and pointed at both ends, consisting of a pair of hexagonal pyramids joined at their bases. Normally colorless, they are [[staining (biology)|stained]] purplish-red by [[Masson's trichrome|trichrome]].

==Clinical significance==

They are indicative of a disease involving eosinophilic inflammation or proliferation, such as is found in allergic reactions and parasitic infections like Entamoeba histolytica.

Charcot–Leyden crystals are often seen pathologically in patients with bronchial asthma.

==History==

[[Friedrich Albert von Zenker]] was the first to notice these crystals, doing so in 1851, after which they were described jointly by [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and [[Charles-Philippe Robin]] in 1853,&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Charcot, C. P. Robin: ''Observation de leucocythémie.'' Comptes rendus de la Société de biologie, Paris, 1853, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1872 by [[Ernst Viktor von Leyden]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Victor von Leyden: ''Zur Kenntnis des Asthma bronchiale.'' [Virchows] Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie, und für klinische Medizin, Berlin, 1872, 54: 324-344; 346-352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Y.

'''Collaborative software''' or '''groupware''' is [[application software]] designed to help people involved in a common task to achieve their  goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is "intentional group processes plus software to support them".&lt;ref name="Johnson-Lenz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson-Lenz|first=Peter|title=Rhythms, Boundaries, and Containers|url=http://nexus.awakentech.com:8080/at/awaken1.nsf/UNIDs/CFB70C1957A686E98825654000699E1B?OpenDocument|publisher=Awakening Technology|date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the level of interaction it allows, collaborative software may be divided into: [[real-time collaborative editing]] (RTCE) platforms that allow multiple users to engage in live, simultaneous and reversible editing of a single file (usually a document),  and [[version control]] (also known as revision control and source control) platforms, which allow separate users to make parallel edits to a file, while preserving every saved edit by every user as multiple files (that are variants of the original file).

Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). According to Carstensen and Schmidt (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carstensen |first1=P.H.|last2= Schmidt|first2= K. |year=1999 |title= Computer supported cooperative work: new challenges to systems design |url= http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/carstensen99computer.html |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate= 2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; groupware is part of CSCW. The authors claim that CSCW, and thereby groupware, addresses "how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems." Software products such as email, calendaring, [[text chat]], [[wiki]], and [[Enterprise bookmarking|bookmarking]] belong to this category whenever used for group work,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} whereas the more general term [[social software]] applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, [[online dating service]]s and [[social networking site]]s like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].

The use of collaborative software in the work space creates a [[collaborative working environment]] (CWE).

Finally, collaborative software relates to the notion of [[collaborative work systems]], which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;Beyerlein, M; Freedman, S.; McGee, G.; Moran, L. (2002). [http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/39/07879637/0787963739.pdf Beyond Teams: Building the Collaborative Organization]. The Collaborative Work Systems series, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported cooperative work, collaborative work systems become a useful analytical tool to understand the behavioral and organizational variables that are associated to the broader concept of CSCW.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, P. (1991). Computer Supported Cooperative Work: An Introduction. Kluwer Academic Pub. {{ISBN|978-0792314462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aparicio, M and Costa, C. (2012) Collaborative systems: characteristics and features. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM international conference on Design of communication (SIGDOC '12).

[[Douglas Engelbart]] first envisioned collaborative computing in 1951 and documented his vision in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework], Douglas C. Engelbart, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; with [[NLS (computer system)|working prototypes]] in full operational use by his research team by the mid-1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3954.html A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect], Douglas C. Engelbart and William K. English, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and held the first public demonstration of his work in 1968 in what is now referred to as "[[The Mother of All Demos]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/dougs-1968-demo.html |title=1968 Demo Overview and Links to Video |publisher=Dougengelbart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Engelbart's lab was hooked into the [[ARPANET]], the first computer network, enabling them to extend services to a broader userbase. See also [[Intelligence amplification|Intelligence Amplification]] [[Intelligence amplification#Douglas Engelbart: Augmenting Human Intellect|Section 4: Douglas Engelbart]], [[Arpanet|ARPANET]] Section on [[ARPANET#ARPANET deployed|ARPANET Deployed]], and the Doug Engelbart Archive Collection.

Online collaborative gaming software began between early networked computer users. In 1975, [[Will Crowther]] created [[Colossal Cave Adventure]] on a [[DEC PDP-10]] computer. As internet connections grew, so did the numbers of users and multi-user games. In 1978 [[Roy Trubshaw]], a student at [[University of Essex]] in the United Kingdom, created the game MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).

The US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99362&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;CFID=107391064&amp;CFTOKEN=53017578 |title=Learning from user experience with groupware |doi=10.1145/99332.99362 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling, Planning and Simulation Strategy (COMPASS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cwid.js.mil/public/CWIDFctShtSuccesses21Mar08.doc Heritage of Delivering Successful Warfighting Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; The COMPASS system allowed up to 6 users to create point-to-point connections with one another; the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active, and would have to be recreated if all six logged out. MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server that each user logged into. Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation (CVW), this allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms, and left as a persistent session that could be joined later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Maybury/publication/220423771_Expert_Finding_for_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments/links/00b495295de7a430ec000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true Collaborative virtual environments for analysis and decision support], Mark Mayburry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Pavel Curtis]], who had built MUDs at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], created PlaceWare, a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium, with side chat between "seat-mates", and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak. In 1997, engineers at [[GTE]] used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW, calling it InfoWorkSpace (IWS). In 1998, IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/news/infoworkspace-saves-lives-in-iraq/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace saves lives in Iraq - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWS product was sold to [[General Dynamics]] and then later to Ezenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527023159/http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|archivedate = 2014-05-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative software was originally designated as ''groupware'' and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s, when Richman and Slovak (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Richman|first1= Louis S |last2= Slovak |first2=Julianne |date=June 8, 1987 |title= SOFTWARE CATCHES THE TEAM SPIRIT New computer programs may soon change the way groups of people work together -- and start delivering the long-awaited payoff from office automation.fouttoune |publisher=Money.cnn.com |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/06/08/69109/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

{{quote|"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together, the new ''groupware'' aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers, technicians, and anyone else who interacts in groups, revolutionizing the way they work."}}

Even further back, in 1978 Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware; their initial 1978  definition of groupware was, “intentional group processes plus software to support them.” Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as “computer-mediated culture... an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace." Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems, yet is simply a single system.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Lenz"/&gt;

In the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered, and big companies such as [[Boeing]] and [[IBM]] started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects. [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]] appeared as a major example of that product category, allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy. Kirkpatrick and Losee (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=D. |last2=Losee |first2=S. |date=March 23, 1992 |title= HERE COMES THE PAYOFF FROM PCs New network software lets brainstormers around a table all ''talk'' at once on their keyboards. The result: measurable productivity gains from desktop computing |url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1992/03/23/76204/index.htm |publisher=Money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote then:

{{quote|"If GROUPWARE really makes a difference in productivity long term, the very definition of an office may change. You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer. As computers become smaller and more powerful, that will mean anywhere."}}

===Design and implementation issues===
The complexity of groupware development is still an issue. One reason for this is the socio-technical dimension of groupware. Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues (as in traditional software development) but also consider the organizational aspects &lt;ref&gt;D'Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N. (2008). “Interdisciplinary Aspects of Information Systems Studies”, pp. 1-416, Physica-Verlag, Springer, Germany, Doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2010-2  {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2009-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application. Some examples for issues in groupware development are:

*Persistence is needed in some sessions. Chat and voice communications are routinely non-persistent and evaporate at the end of the session. Virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years. The designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly.
*Authentication has always been a problem with groupware. When connections are made point-to-point, or when log-in registration is enforced, it's clear who is engaged in the session. However, audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced 'lurkers' who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605033257/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/transfer.html A Case Study in Technology Transfer of Collaboration Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130912234901/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/second.html Collaborating securely - Can it be done?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Until recently, bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools. These are exacerbated with mobile devices.
*Multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications.
*Motivational issues are important, especially in settings where no pre-defined group process was in place.
*Closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity. [[Clarence Ellis (computer scientist)|Ellis]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clarence A. |last1=Ellis|first2= Simon J. |last2=Gibbs |first3= Gail |last3=Rein|year= 1991 |title=Groupware: some issues and experiences. |DOI=10.1145/99977.99987 |volume=34 |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=39–58|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~tar/DBC/groupware-ellis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the distribution of efforts and benefits has to be carefully balanced in order to ensure that all required group members really participate.
*Real-time communication via groupware can lead to a lot of noise, over-communication and information overload.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

One approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design.&lt;ref&gt;Till Schümmer and Stephan Lukosch. 2007. Patterns for Computer-Mediated Interaction (Wiley Software Patterns Series). John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process.

==Groupware and levels of collaboration==
Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of [[collaboration]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |title=Groupware - Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |publisher=Lotus Development Corporation |date= |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casalino N., Draoli M. (2009), “Governance and Organizational Aspects of an Experimental Groupware in the Italian Public Administration to Support Multi-Institutional Partnerships”, in Information Systems: People, Organizations, Institutions, and Trchnologies, D’Atri A., Saccà D. (Eds.), Physica-Verlag, Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 81-89, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2147-5}}, doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2148-2_11&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Communication''' can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information. A phone call or an [[Instant Messaging|IM]] Chat discussion are examples of this.
# '''Conferencing''' (or collaboration level, as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels) refers to interactive work toward a shared goal. Brainstorming or voting are examples of this.
# '''Co-ordination''' refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal. A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team; everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win. That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal: collaborative management.

===Collaborative management (coordination) tools===
Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:
* [[Electronic calendar]]s (also called [[time management]] software) &amp;mdash; schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members
* [[Project management]] systems &amp;mdash; schedule, track, and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed
* [[Online proofing]] &amp;mdash; share, review, approve, and reject web proofs, artwork, photos, or videos between designers, customers, and clients
* [[Workflow system]]s &amp;mdash; collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process
* [[Knowledge management software|Knowledge management systems]] &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage, and share various forms of information
* [[Enterprise bookmarking]] &amp;mdash; collaborative bookmarking engine to tag, organize, share, and search enterprise data
* [[Prediction market]]s &amp;mdash; let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events
* [[Extranet]] systems (sometimes also known as 'project extranets') &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project (e.g.: the construction of a building)
* [[Intranet]] systems &amp;mdash; quickly share company information to members within a company via Internet (e.g.: marketing and product info)&lt;ref name="Intranet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|title=Groupware, Workflow, and Intranets: Reengineering the Enterprise with Collaborative Software|date=1998|publisher=Digital Press|location=Boston|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social software]] systems &amp;mdash; organize social relations of groups
* [[Online spreadsheet]]s &amp;mdash; collaborate and share structured data and information
* [[Client portal]]s &amp;mdash; interact and share with your clients in a private online environment{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Collaborative software and human interaction==
The design intent of collaborative software (groupware) is to transform the way documents and [[rich media]] are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration.

Collaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.

There are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations.

''Conversational interaction'' is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints, generally focused on personal experiences.&lt;ref name="iSchool"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=R. I.|last2=Marriott|first2=A.|last3=Duncan|first3=N. D.|title=Human conversational behavior|journal=Human Nature : An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective|date=1997|volume=8|issue=3|pages=231–246|doi=10.1007/BF02912493|accessdate=3 December 2014|url=http://medisch-fitness.com/documents/75procentdagelijksegesprekkenbestedenweaanroddelen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication technology such as telephones, [[instant messaging]], and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions.

''Transactional interaction'' involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants.

In ''collaborative interactions'' the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity (i.e., the converse of transactional). When teams collaborate on projects it is called [[Collaborative project management]].

The '''comedy of humours''' is  a [[genre]] of [[drama]]tic [[comedy]] that focuses on a [[fictional character|character]] or range of characters, each of whom exhibits two or more overriding traits or '[[Humorism|humours]]' that dominates their personality, desires and conduct. This comic technique may be found in [[Aristophanes]], but the [[England|English]] [[playwright]]s [[Ben Jonson]] and [[George Chapman]] popularized the genre in the closing years of the sixteenth century. In the later half of the seventeenth century, it was combined with the [[comedy of manners]] in [[Restoration comedy]]. 

[[Image:Lavater1792.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The four '[[Humourism|humours]]' or temperaments (Clockwise from top right; [[choleric]]; [[Melancholia|melancholic]]; [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]]; [[phlegmatic]]).]]
In Jonson’s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (acted 1598), which made this type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular, all the words and acts of Kitely are controlled by an overpowering suspicion that his wife is unfaithful; George Downright, a country squire, must be "frank" above all things; the country gull in town determines his every decision by his desire to "catch on" to the manners of the city gallant. 

In his [[Induction (play)|Induction]] to ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'' (1599) Jonson explains his character-formula thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some one peculiar quality&lt;br /&gt;Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw&lt;br /&gt;All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,&lt;br /&gt;In their confluctions, all to run one way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy of humours owes something to earlier vernacular comedy but more to a desire to imitate the classical comedy of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]] and to combat the vogue of [[Shakespearean comedy|romantic comedy]], as developed by [[William Shakespeare]]. The satiric purpose of the comedy of humours and its realistic method lead to more serious character studies with Jonson’s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''. The humours each had been associated with physical and mental characteristics; the result was a system that was quite subtle in its capacity for describing types of personality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9128">'''Complementary holism''' is a [[social theory]] or conceptual framework proposed by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]], that sees all societies as consisting of a Human Center and Institutional Boundaries, and that all social relations in the political, economic, community/cultural and kinship "spheres" as mutually interacting to defining our social experiences. Complementary holism does not rest on an ''a priori'' assumption that a particular sphere is the base and all else is superstructure, as [[historical materialism]] does, but rather that we must take an empirical look at society's development and assess how it has been shaped by all social forces. Complementary holists agree with [[Marxists]] that economics is important to human and social development, just as they do with [[anarchists]] in regard to the [[State (polity)|State]] or with [[feminists]] in regard to [[gender inequality]], but they assert that Marxists see economics, or [[class conflict]], as the sole factor, and they don't believe that economics is always the most important factor.

In ''Liberating Theory'', Michael Albert, Robin Hahnel et al. write that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as Marx and Engels paid strict attention to "state of the art" science in their time, we should keep up with contemporary developments. Ironically, however, though most contemporary Marxists pride themselves on being "scientific," few bother to notice that "state of the art" science has changed dramatically in the last hundred years. While avoiding simplistic mimicry and misapplication of scientific principles, we should update our methods by seriously examining contemporary science for new ideas relevant to our theoretical efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Modern quantum physics, for example, teaches that reality is not a collection of separate entities but a vast and intricate "unbroken whole." Ilya Prigogine comments, "The new paradigms of science may be expected to develop into the new science of connectedness which means the recognition of unity in diversity." When thinking about phenomena, we inevitably conceptually abstract parts from the whole in which they reside, but they then exist as separate entities only in our perceptions. There are no isolated electrons, for example, only fields of force continually ebbing and flowing in a seamless web of activity which manifests events that we choose to call electrons because it suits our analytic purposes. For the physicist, each electron, quark, or whatever is a "process" and a "network." As a process it has a developmental trajectory--extending through all time. As a network, it is part of an interactive pattern--stretching throughout all space. Every part embodies and is subsumed in a larger whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Center and Institutional Boundary==
Each society has a human center where we find people, their consciousness, personalities, talents and needs. Each society also has an institutional boundary consisting of social institutions and their role structures. Just as our consciousnesses, needs and desires are shaped by the institutions we create to facilitate our social activities so are our institutions shaped by our cultural traditions. How we define our institutions and the roles we play in society has an important effect on what kind of people we become.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Society's center and boundary are ''complementary'' aspects of a single unbroken whole. Both center and boundary are complex dissipative systems. Whatever society's defining features may be, they will necessarily pervade both society's center and boundary. They will persist through evolutionary changes since such changes necessarily involve limited adaptations of both center and boundary. Revolution, however, will alter these defining features. Since we know that historically people universally engage in certain social activities, which in turn involve social relations contouring daily life and governing group interactions, as our next conceptual step it makes sense to subdivide society along lines highlighting these activities, social relations, and social groups. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spheres==
Complementary holism carves out the Human Center and Institutional Boundary into four separate but interconnecting social spheres: the Economic Sphere, the Kinship Sphere, the Community Sphere and the Political Sphere.

# The [[Economic]] Sphere is where the production, consumption, and allocation of material means of life occur. The key institutions for the economy are workplaces, allocation mechanisms, property relations, and remuneration schemes.
# The [[Kinship]] Sphere is where child rearing, nurturing future generations, socializing and care giving occur. Key institutions are the family, with parental and child rearing roles, where gender and sexuality, and other relations form for boys and girls, men and women, fathers and mothers, adults, children and the elderly.
# The [[Political]] Sphere is where adjudication, policy regulation and law making occur with courts, a legislature and police.
# The [[Community]] Sphere is where identity, religion, and spirituality occur with race, ethnicity, places of worship, beliefs about life and death, celebration of cultural traditions, etc.

Like the human center and institutional boundary, these four spheres interconnect with one another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People aren't economically-affected in one part of their lives and gender-affected in another; state-influenced one day of the week and community-influenced some other day. Instead, they simultaneously experience economic, kinship, governance, and community involvements, and this guarantees that spheres interact. At a particular time class may have more influence on molding a person's consciousness and behavior than gender, or vice-versa. But these influences must co-exist. ''(Liberating Theory)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accommodation==
Accommodation describes a particular way in which the four spheres interact with each other. The assigned roles that are a feature of one sphere may be accommodated in another. How our roles are divided in the workplace may accommodate with sexist and racist divisions found as central features in our Kinship and Community Spheres so that economic activity subjugates women and non-whites to lower pay and positions of power than men and whites.

==Co-Definition==
Another way the four spheres can interact is by co-defining each other. For example, workplace roles are often determined by more than "class divisions."

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing inherent in capitalist economic relations that requires the activity of coffee-making to be assigned to the role of secretary. There is no purely economic reason why in the U.S., women are ghettoized into so-called "pink collar" jobs: clerical work, nursing, domestic work, restaurant and food service, retail sales, elementary school teaching, etc. There is nothing about economics that requires that in addition to different levels of compensation, women's and men's activities must or even should involve different degrees of oversight and mobility. Purely economic dynamics cannot explain such profound gender differentiations. In this sense, then, not only do economic relations accommodate kinship hierarchies, by placing women in the lowest "economicallydefined" positions, but patriarchy "co-defines" basic economic relations. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social Change==
Proponents of complementary holism feel the social theory is not only helpful in understanding society as it is but in understanding how society can be changed. By recognizing the interconnecting social forces - the human center, institutional boundary and four social spheres - and how they shape and are shaped by the intertwining relationship with each other, complementary holists feel we are better equipped to transform society and overcome social oppressions.

Complementary holism sees two ways in which societies can change:

# ''Reproduction'': This is where a change recreates a past social feature. An example could be where a revolution overthrows one hierarchical political system and replaces it with another.
# ''Transformation'': This is where social activities create an entirely new characteristics that differ from the past. For example, a social revolution may overthrow a [[market economy]] and replace it with a self-managed [[participatory economy]].

'''Davydov soliton''' is a quantum [[quasiparticle]] representing an excitation propagating along the [[protein]] [[α-helix]] self-trapped [[amide|amide I]].  It is a solution of the Davydov [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is named for the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist [[Alexander Davydov]]. The Davydov model describes the interaction of the amide I [[vibration]]s with the [[hydrogen bond]]s that stabilize the [[α-helix]] of [[protein]]s. The elementary excitations within the α-helix are given by the [[phonon]]s which correspond to the deformational oscillations of the lattice, and the [[exciton]]s which describe the internal [[amide|amide I]] excitations of the [[peptide group]]s. Referring to the atomic structure of an α-helix region of protein the mechanism that creates the Davydov soliton ([[polaron]], [[exciton]]) can be described as follows: [[vibration]]al [[energy]] of the [[carbonyl|C=O]] [[stretching]] (or [[amide|amide I]]) [[oscillator]]s that is localized on the α-helix acts through a phonon coupling effect to distort the structure of the α-helix, while the helical distortion reacts again through phonon coupling to trap the amide I oscillation energy and prevent its dispersion. This effect is called ''self-localization'' or ''self-trapping''.&lt;ref name="Davydov1973"&gt;{{cite journal

Davydov's [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is formally similar to the [[Polaron#Polaron theory|Fröhlich-Holstein Hamiltonian]] for the interaction of electrons with a polarizable lattice. Thus the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the [[energy operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}+\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}+\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[quasiparticle]] ([[exciton]]) [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes the motion of the amide I excitations between adjacent sites; &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phonon]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes
the [[vibration]]s of the [[lattice model (physics)|lattice]]; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interaction]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes the interaction of the amide I excitation with the lattice.&lt;ref name="Davydov1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davydov1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davydov1977"/&gt;

The [[quasiparticle]] ([[exciton]]) [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n,\alpha}E_{0}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-J\sum_{n,\alpha}\left(\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n+1,\alpha}+\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n-1,\alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+L\sum_{n,\alpha}\left(\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha+1}+\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the index &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,\cdots,N&lt;/math&gt; counts the peptide groups along the α-helix spine, the index &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; counts each α-helix spine, &lt;math&gt;E_{0}=3.28\times10^{-20}&lt;/math&gt; J is the energy of the amide I

The [[phonon]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n,\alpha}\left[w(\hat{u}_{n+1,\alpha}-\hat{u}_{n,\alpha})^{2}+\frac{\hat{p}_{n,\alpha}^{2}}{M}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement operator]] from the equilibrium position of the [[peptide group]] &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum operator]] of the [[peptide group]] &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, M is the [[mass]] of each [[peptide group]], and &lt;math&gt;w=19.5&lt;/math&gt; N m&lt;math&gt;^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Elasticity (physics)|effective elasticity coefficient]] of the lattice (the [[spring constant]] of a [[hydrogen bond]]).

Finally, the [[interaction]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_{\text{int}}=\chi\sum_{n,\alpha}\left[(\hat{u}_{n+1,\alpha}-\hat{u}_{n,\alpha})\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi=-30&lt;/math&gt; pN is an anharmonic parameter arising from the coupling between the [[quasiparticle]] (exciton) and the lattice displacements (phonon) and parameterizes the strength of the [[exciton]]-[[phonon]] [[interaction]]. The value of this parameter for [[α-helix]] has been determined via comparison of the theoretically calculated absorption line shapes with the experimentally measured ones.&lt;ref name="Cruzeiro2005"&gt;

The mathematical techniques that are used to analyze Davydov's soliton are similar to some that have been developed in polaron theory. In this context the Davydov's soliton corresponds to a [[polaron]] that is (i) ''large'' so the continuum limit approximation is justified, (ii) ''acoustic'' because the self-localization arises from interactions
with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) ''weakly coupled'' because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt;

The Davydov soliton is a ''quantum quasiparticle'' and it obeys [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]. Thus any model that does not impose translational invariance is flawed by construction.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt; Supposing that the Davydov soliton is localized to 5 turns of the [[α-helix]] results in significant uncertainty in the [[velocity]] of the [[soliton]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=133&lt;/math&gt; m/s, a fact that is obscured if one models the Davydov soliton as a classical object.

There are three possible fundamental approaches towards Davydov model:&lt;ref name="Takeno1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruzeiro1997"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i) the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], in which both the amide I vibration ([[exciton]]s) and the lattice site motion ([[phonon]]s) are treated quantum mechanically; (ii) the mixed quantum-classical theory, in which the amide I vibration is treated quantum mechanically but the lattice is classical; and (iii) the [[classical theory]], in which both the amide I and the lattice motions are treated classically.

[[File:Faddan More Psalter cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the psalter, after conservation]]
The '''Faddan More Psalter''' ({{lang-ga|Saltair an Fheadáin Mhóir}}) (also '''Irish Bog Psalter''' or "Faddan Mor Psalter") is an [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] Christian [[psalter]] or text of the [[book of Psalms]], discovered in a [[peat bog]] in July 2006, in the townland of [[Faddan More]] ({{lang-ga|Feadán Mór}}) in north [[County Tipperary]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=IOL&gt;[http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/story.asp?j=191201038&amp;p=y9yzxy744&amp;n=191201798 Location of 'Ireland's Dead Sea Scrolls' revealed]- IOL news 05/08/2006 – 09:50:08&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was probably written in about 800 in one of a number of monasteries in the area.  A unique feature is that the inside of the leather cover is lined with [[papyrus]], probably as a stiffening, an indication of the links between the Irish and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic church]]es at the time.  After several years of conservation work, the psalter went on display at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Kildare St, Dublin in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;NMI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Grainne|title=Public gets first look at ancient book of psalms|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/public-gets-first-look-at-ancient-book-of-psalms-2668780.html|accessdate=9 June 2011|newspaper=The Irish Independent|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery was hailed by the National Museum of Ireland as one of the most significant Irish [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds in decades.&lt;ref name=RTE&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0725/manuscript.html Ancient manuscript discovered in the Midlands] – RTÉ News&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Meehan of the [[Trinity College Library]], who was called in to advise on the discovery, said that he believed the psalter was the first discovery of an Irish early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manuscript]] in two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Meehan cited in the [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/psalms-emerge-from-irish-bog/2006/07/26/1153816254848.html Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; During the conservation process, in the period 2006–2010, the lining of the binding was found to have elements of [[papyrus]], adding further evidence to the known links between Irish [[Celtic Christianity]] and the Egyptian [[Coptic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/manuscript-dug-from-bog-rates-among-our-top-10-biggest-finds-2325341.html ''Manuscript dug from bog rates among our top 10 biggest finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The psalter joins the very small number of very early Western books that have survived fully intact with their original [[bookbinding]]s.  These mostly have their origins in the monastic [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland, and the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missions to Europe.  The earliest is the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] of about 700 ([[British Library]]), and other examples probably of the mid-8th century are at [[Fulda]] on the continent. However the wallet-like style of the Faddan More binding, and the fact that it does not seem to have been physically attached to the sewn-together pages, make it unique among surviving covers.

==Description==
The psalter contains the Latin text of the Psalms, complete on 60 sheets of [[vellum]] in five gatherings or [[Paper quire|quire]]s. The text is a [[Latin_Psalters#Versio_Gallicana|Gallican]] version of the [[Vulgate]], written in [[Insular majuscule]] letters in a single column.  The first letter of each psalm has a capital and, as is often the case, the opening words of psalms 1, 51 and 101 are decorated, using black, red, and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;NMI&lt;/ref&gt;

The original leather binding has a fold-over flap with three horn buttons that were probably used to secure a thong or straps, now missing, that tied the cover up; it does not seem to have been physically attached to the gathered and sewn-together pages inside, forming what we might call today a folder or wallet.  Similar covers seem to be shown in some images in manuscripts, but no comparable covers have survived.  The outside of the cover was "painted with black carbon-based pigment".&lt;ref&gt;NMI PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The leather seems to have been used as a trial piece or sketchpad for composing patterns of [[interlace (art)|interlace]] for other objects. On the inside there is a sheet of papyrus, presumably used as a liner to stiffen the cover somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, and NMI PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Low oxygen levels in the bog provide unusual preservation conditions, and bogs were often used by Irish monks as hiding places for valuables in the face of [[Viking]] raids. In addition to low oxygen levels, [[sphagnum]] moss, of which the peat bog is composed, produces an antibiotic substance called [[sphagnan]] that binds with proteins on the surface of microorganisms, immobilising them. Its highly reactive carbonyl groups can alter chemicals and nutrients that would otherwise decompose organic matter. And above all the sphagnum moss causes organic material to undergo chemical changes itself that make it impervious to rot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2146638/ How do bogs keep things fresh?] by Daniel Engber, Slate, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
It was uncovered by bulldozer driver Eddie Fogarty,&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt; a worker extracting [[peat]] with a [[backhoe]]. Dr. Patrick Wallace, director of the National Museum, praised Fogarty for immediately having covered the book with damp soil, as exposure to dry air after so many centuries of dampness might have destroyed it.  The book was initially stored in refrigeration at the National Museum. Identifying the safest way to pry open the pages without damaging or destroying them was expected to take months, and conservation work to take two years.  The area around Faddan More Bog is rich in medieval history. Monastic foundations such as [[Lorrha]] and [[Terryglass]] in County Tipperary and [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] and Seirkieran in County Offaly are located nearby.&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt;

The bog is owned by local brothers Kevin and Patrick Leonard. Six years before the psalter find, a leather satchel was found that, by [[radiocarbon dating]], was estimated to originate from between the seventh and ninth centuries. This was located just 100m from the psalter findspot and is of a similar date suggesting that the satchel may have originally contained the book.  Additionally, in the years prior to 2006, two ancient wooden vessels were also found in the same bog.&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt;

==Misreported prophecy==
When found, the book was opened to a page displaying [[Psalms|Psalm]] [[s:la:The Old Testament (Vulgate)/Psalmi#83|83]] (in the [[Septuagint]] numbering), which corresponds with [[s:en:Bible (King James)/Psalms#84|Psalm 84]] in the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] numbering used in most English-language translations.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5584495 Ancient Psalms Found Preserved in Irish Bog] – NPR&lt;/ref&gt; Due to confusion regarding differences in numbering the Psalms, some news sites implied that the Psalter was open at the [[s:en:Bible (King James)/Psalms#83|Masoretic Psalm 83]]. That psalm contains such lines as "They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance"; this reference to the attempted destruction of [[Israel]] connected the find in some people's minds with the contemporaneous [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]. The matter was clarified by the director of the [[National Museum of Ireland]], who pointed out the difference in [[Septuagint]] vs. [[Masoretic]] numbering and that the displayed psalm contains no reference to the destruction of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2006/0728/1153813832813.html Museum plays diplomatic role on psalm's 'warning to Israel' – Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The National Museum of Ireland consulted with specialists in archaeological conservation and book conservation about the best way to conserve the psalter, and received partly conflicting advice. Ultimately a multi-phase conservation plan was determined. The first phase involved non-destructive examination of the psalter in the form in which it was discovered – e.g., photography, MRI scanning, and examination of the binding by book-binding specialists. In the second phase, experiments were done on 18th century parchments to determine the best way of drying waterlogged parchment. The most effective method involved soaking the parchment in ethanol to replace the water, placing it between blotting sheets, and vacuum-packing it. In the third phase, this technique was tested on small fragments of the psalter, and found to be effective. Conservators then began applying this method to larger sections of the psalter, and found they could consistently achieve shrinkage of only 2–5%, against 75% on a small fragment that was air-dried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=432d9d81-909c-4921-a86c-0992c01b4194 The Faddan More Psalter: a progress update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153450/http://www.museum.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=432d9d81-909c-4921-a86c-0992c01b4194 |date=15 June 2011 }}, by John Gillis and Anthony Read

[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation).&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5&lt;/ref&gt; Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|schēma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"&lt;ref&gt;Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.

*:Examples: "not too bad" for "very good" is an understatement as well as a double negative statement that confirms a positive idea by negating the opposite. Similarly, saying "She is not a beauty queen," means "She is ugly" or saying "I am not as young as I used to be" in order to avoid saying "I am old".

* [[sibilance]]: Repetition of letter 's', it is a form of [[alliteration]]

==Andorra==
{{Main|Andorra#Fire brigade}}
The Andorran Fire Brigade, with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 24 fire service vehicles - 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans), and four ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722172143/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Service is provided full-time, with five fire crews on station on a shift basis, and other firefighters available on call.

==Australia==
In Australia, fire services are state/territory organisations.

In several states, there are three principal fire burning organisations. One is salaried and (primarily) handles urban areas, one is (primarily) volunteer and (primarily) handles rural areas, and one handles government managed public land (mainly forests and plantations).

In the Australian Capital Territory:
*[[Australian Capital Territory Fire Brigade]]
*[[ACT Rural Fire Service]]

In New South Wales:
*[[Fire and Rescue NSW]]
*[[NSW Rural Fire Service]]

In the Northern Territory:
*[[Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service]]
*[[Bushfires NT]]

In Queensland:
*[[Queensland Fire and Emergency Services]]
*[[Rural Fire Service Queensland]] (now under Queensland Fire and Emergency Services)

In South Australia:
*[[Metropolitan Fire Service]]
*[[Country Fire Service]]

In Tasmania:
*[[Tasmania Fire Service]]

In Victoria:
*[[Country Fire Authority]]
*[[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)]]
*[[Department of Sustainability and Environment]]

In Western Australia, [[DFES]] is the overarching body.  The fire services consist of:
*Career Fire and Rescue Service - salaried staff.  Abbreviated to FRS or CFRS.
*Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service.  Abbreviated to VFRS.
*Volunteer Bush Fire Service.  Abbreviated to BFS.
*Volunteer Fire Service - VFRS and BFS combined and abbreviated to VFS.
*Volunteer Emergency Service Brigades - VFRS, BFS, [[State Emergency Service]] and/or Volunteer Marine Rescue. Abbreviated to VES and previously called FESA units.

DFES funds the CFRS and VFRS vehicles, stations, equipment and training. Local government funds the others. Money for local government is sourced through the Emergency Services Levy.

==Austria==
The structure in [[Austria]] is similar to that of [[Germany]]. There are just six career fire services in [[Vienna]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Klagenfurt]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Linz]]. As of 2007, some 4,527 volunteer fire departments, the back-bone of the Austrian fire service, relied on about 320,000 men and women voluntary firefighters as active members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 Österreichischer Bundesfeuerwehrverband: Statistik des ÖBFV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111522/http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 |date=2008-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire departments exist in even the smallest Austrian villages, where they contribute to community life, usually by organizing fairs and other fund-raising activities. Larger departments in towns from a few thousand to up to 100,000 inhabitants also still largely rely on volunteers, yet some are nowadays forced to have one or more ''de facto'' career firefighters, employed by the municipality and conscripts who can chose for this [[Zivildienst in Austria|compulsory community service]] instead of the compulsory [[military service]], for daily maintenance duties and to increase the availability of personnel during working hours. This is necessary, as such larger departments usually have to deal with several hundred interventions per year. In addition to volunteers and career departments, some 328 companies are required by law to run their own fire service, which may be manned by career firefighters and/or part timers who normally work on ordinary jobs in the company. This includes major airports, oil refineries, petro-chemical factories and many other businesses, even hospitals and clinics. Those departments are usually integrated in the contingency plans of the area and may therefore be called upon for reinforcing the volunteer departments outside the company grounds as well.

== Belgium ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
In Belgium, fire departments (Dutch: ''Brandweerdienst'', French: ''Service d'Incendie'') are still mainly funded by the community or local government. However, starting January 1, 2015, the Reformation of Fire Departments and Civil Protection (Dutch: ''Hervorming van de Civiele Veiligheid'') was complete. From then on, the fire departments will be grouped into 32 'Rescue Zones'. These can be looked at as a corporation that is partly self-reliant, but with funding by the federal government. This reformation was issued after the gas explosion of Ghislenghien in 2004, where it became apparent that equipment and procedures were outdated. Belgian fire fighter academies have begun adapting newer techniques, such as the Swedish techniques for structural firefighting or USA's RIT-procedure (''Rapid Intervention Team''). One of the first measures of the reformation put into action was the SAH (Dutch: ''Snelste Adequate Hulpverlening''), meaning that, regardless of territorial boundaries, the fire department who can arrive at the scene the fastest with the most adequate equipment (one driver, one petty officer and four fire fighters) will be the first one to turn out and handle the call until the department who has jurisdiction arrives.

Belgium relies on about 17,000 fire fighters in total, consisting of around 5,000 professional fire fighters (mainly in larger cities) and 12,000 volunteers. Also, almost all EMS interventions in Belgium are carried out by fire departments, more specifically fire fighters who have successfully completed their EMS formation. In some departments fire fighters are obligated to take the EMS formation or even get a permit to drive a truck. Belgium uses a military ranking system, going from ''fire fighter'' all the way to ''colonel'' - mirroring the French system.

One exception to the Belgian fire departments is ''Brussels Capital Region''. Since the Brussels Regional Government has its own service directing and managing both EMS and fire services, they frequently tend to have other procedures and regulations. For example: in Brussels fire fighters are equipped with orange turn-out gear and officers wear black gear, whereas the rest of Belgium uses this the other way around. The governmental organ responsible for this organisation is called the Fire and Urgent Medical Aid Service (Dutch: ''DBDMH'', ''Dienst voor Brandbestrijding en Dringende Medische Hulpverlening'', French: ''SIAMU'', ''Service d'Incendie et l'Aide Medicale Urgente'')

==Botswana==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Fire brigades are run at municipality or council level under the Ministry of Local Government and Service Management of the Republic of Botswana. There are 13 fire stations and two sub-fire stations across every city, Town and major village. Fire Service Act 40.1 aimed at saving lives, protection of property and rendering of humanitarian services to the public, extinguishing fires in buildings and offering extrication to all victims of vehicle collisions across all national highways. Most of these fire brigades are run under British Standard and American structures according to the geographic location. There are also influential supporting fire brigades owned by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Defense Force and police. Recently the country was able to train more than 100 firefighters in Australia based only on saving the forests and natures of Botswana run under the Forestry Department.

Almost all fire brigades have divisions similar to Britain:
* Administration
* Operations 
* Fire Prevention and Public Education
* Fire Training and Technical Division
* Fire Investigation
* Disaster Management Division

All these divisions are vital in the development of fire brigades in Botswana. There are more than 800 full-time working firefighters and 180 paramedics offering pre-hospital care, serving a population of more than 2 million. As in many developing countries, Botswana's government plays an important role in the purchasing of fire engines and fire equipment.

== Brazil ==
In Brazil, fire services are militarized like some fire departments of France. The "Corpos de bombeiros", or fire fighting corps, is an integral part of the military police. In Brazil military police perform regular police duties throughout the country. This means that in for example the State of São Paulo, people cannot just join the fire brigade. They are first of all policemen, performing the duties of a fire fighter. Each state has its own [[Military Firefighters Corps (Brazil)|Military Firefighters Corps]] (in Portuguese: ''Corpo de Bombeiros Militar''). Cities of southern Brazil, with traditional German communities, have had volunteer fire fighters since the nineteenth century.

Over all, fire fighting in Brazil has been undervalued and underfunded by the government, leading to overstretched areas to attend, constant failure of material and shifting of personnel towards police duties.

Private entities that require fire fighters by law hire them from the private market. These fire fighters are trained by private schools. The great level of corruption of private fire fighting schools and consequent incompetence of private fire fighters, or Bombeiro civil, has led towards the Policia militar, or military police, taking control over the accreditation of private fire fighting schools since October 23, 2013.

==Canada==
Large cities and most towns have full-time fire departments and firefighters (''Service de sécurité incendie'' and ''pompiers'' in Quebec and other French speaking areas in Canada). Smaller towns and other municipalities employ part-time volunteer firefighters. All municipal fire departments are publicly operated. Private companies do operate for fire protection on private property (mostly aerospace companies and refineries). Airport fire departments are operated by local airport authorities with assistance from local departments if needed. The [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] has its own firefighters on [[Canadian Forces]] bases for security reasons. Some provinces have designated firefighting crews specially equipped to handle [[forest fire]]s. Cities and towns along waterways have marine fire capability and the former likely have [[fireboats]]. The [[Canadian Coast Guard]] provides some marine firefighting capability off Canada's coastline as part of search and rescue operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/e0004254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chile==
In [[Chile]], [[firefighters]] are called "bomberos". They are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. They also must finance the [[Procurement|acquisition]], [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] and operation of their buildings and equipment (including [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]]) rather than rely upon government allocations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} All officers are democratically elected by the volunteers. The government does not finance specialization courses for firefighters. Instead, they have to pay for it on their own. 'Bomberos' is the name given for the firefighters in most Spanish speaking countries ('bomba' is the name of the water pumps).

Founded in 1851, Valparaíso's Fire Department is the oldest of the country. Following it is the Valdivia Fire Department in 1853, Ancud Fire Department in 1856 and Santiago Fire Department established in 1863. Now every city has a fire department, each with its own officers and companies.

Many of the companies were founded by expatriate citizens from European countries such as the Germans, British, Spanish, French and Italians. Many have an online and social media presence as well.

*[http://www.vigesima.cl Twentieth Santiago Bomberos Company]

These companies, and the departments upon which they are assigned, are part of one national organization - the [[Chilean National Firefighters Council]] (''Junta Nacional del Bomberos de Chile''), established in 1972.

==China==

Most fire departments (fire brigades) are provincial agencies (e.g. [[General Fire Brigade of Guangdong]]) in China, with exceptions in [[Beijing]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] which have their own separate publicly run fire services. Airports in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) also have their own departments. The majority of Chinese firefighters are enlisted personnel in the military police and they serve a fixed term of two years, unless they are promoted to non-commissioned officers or above.

==Costa Rica==
The ''Benemérito Cuerpo de Bomberos de Costa Rica'' (Costa Rica Firefighter Corps) is the institution responsible for firefighting, fire safety and fire prevention. It protects the whole country with 70 firehouses, each with paid and volunteer personnel. Paid firefighters in Costa Rica work 24-hour shifts, while volunteer firefighters must serve at least 40 hours every month.

==Croatia==
According to the Croatian constitution, fire-fighting is a matter of the local municipalities. Professional and volunteer fire-fighters are equal regarding the fulfilling their duties, but the professional fire-fighting units work on bases of the Law of Public Institutions, and the volunteer fire-fighting units on bases of the Law of Associations of Citizens. An additional four fire-fighting intervention-units work in four coastal counties in Dalmatia, and all fire-fighting units are commanded during the summer by the Center in Divulje near Split, all part of the National Directorate for protection and safety.

Specific for Croatia is also the engagement of 1.000 season fire-fighters and additional fire-fighting units on islands to protect them from wildland fires in summer.

Fire-fighting interventions are carried out by:

* 1835 volunteer fire fighting units in municipalities and cities
* 56 volunteer industrial fire fighting units
* 61 public city fire fighting units (professional)
* 34 professional industrial fire fighting units
* 4 intervention units of the Ministry of internal affairs
* Special fire-fighting forces and forces of the anti-fire escadrille of the Ministry of Defense (six Canadairs CL 415, six Air-tractors 802, a Fire Boss, and helicopters of the type Mi-8 and 117-S of the [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Croatian Air Force]])

==Denmark==
In Denmark fire fighting is, by law, a municipal task. Every municipal council are responsible for providing fire fighting and rescue services. The only requirements according to the law for this fire service are that the vehicles have to be manned with the necessary crew for the task at hand and they have to be on the way within five minutes after the alarm has come in.

Every municipality has to perform a risk analysis and based on this maintain a competent fire fighting service. The fire department itself can be run as any one of the following:
*A public fire department managed and run by the municipality either full-time or part-time
*A volunteer fire department contracted by the municipality
*Arrangement with neighbouring municipalities
*Outsourced to a private company (e.g. [[Falck (Denmark)|Falck]])
*Contract with the government run [[Danish Emergency Management Agency]] (DEMA), which has stations in five locations scattered over the country

All fire fighters (''brandmænd'') have the same training, no matter if they are volunteers, full-time professionals or public or private employees. The training takes five weeks and can be taken in several fire fighting schools all over the country.

==Finland==

{{main|Fire fighting in Finland}}

[[Finland|Finnish]] firefighters (''palomiehet'') are organised into professional, half-ordinary and voluntary fire brigades.  Professional firefighters in Finland graduate from one of the two firefighting schools in Finland. Firefighters in half-ordinary and voluntary fire brigades are trained volunteers.

There are approximately 85,000 emergency missions a year in Finland, of which fires account for 18%. According to the Ministry of the Interior, Finnish fire brigades extinguish around 12,000 fires every year. Voluntary fire brigades have a remarkable role in the fire rescue service and cover a large part of Finland's area.

==France==
[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] is a [[French Army]] unit which serves as the fire service for [[Paris]] and certain sites of national strategic importance.]]
French firefighters are called [[Sapeurs-Pompiers]], and reflecting the rural nature of much of the country (wide areas with low density of population), the Volunteer Fire brigade (SPV, ''sapeur-pompier volontaire''), with over 190,000 firefighters is the largest firefighting force in France. In addition to being called out from work to attend an incident, they may be on standby at firestations outside their working hours; the intervention and attending hours are paid by the session. The volunteer fire brigade is also a way to promote the culture of [[civil defense]] and of solidarity amongst the population. The Professional Fire Brigade (SPP, ''sapeur-pompier professionnel'') numbers over 30,000 firefighters, employed by the [[département]]s and working in shifts. In some towns there is a mixture of professionals and volunteers, in others only one or the other.

In Paris and [[Marseille]], the fire brigades are made up of military personnel, but under the control of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in a similar way to the [[French Gendarmerie|Gendarmes]]. The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] (BSPP) has around 7,000 firefighters, and the [[Marseille Marine Fire Battalion]] (BMPM) has over 2,000.

French firefighters tackle over 3.6 million incidents each year:
* 10% fires,
* 10% [[traffic accident]]s ([[Vehicle extrication|freeing]] the casualties and prehospital care as [[first responder]]s),
* 59% other help to people (mainly prehospital care as [[first responder]]s),
* 21% other incidents (gas escapes, stuck elevators, etc.).

With the [[Emergency medical services in France|SAMU]] (French [[Emergency medical services|EMS]]), they are the backbone of the French [[civil defense]].

==Germany==
{{main|German fire services}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Löschzug.jpg|thumb|German [[:de:Löschzug|Löschzug]]]] --&gt;
[[German fire department|German fire brigades]] (''[[Feuerwehr]]'') are organized on a town/village basis, with each town having at least one brigade. In Germany there are about 25,000 local brigades - 24,000 [[:de:Freiwillige Feuerwehr|volunteer fire brigades]] (''Freiwillige Feuerwehr''), 800 [[:de:Werkfeuerwehr|private fire brigades with public accreditation]] (''Werkfeuerwehr''), which mostly protect large industrial complexes or airports, many [[:de:Betriebsfeuerwehr|private fire brigades with no public accreditation]] (''Betriebsfeuerwehr''), and 100 [[:de:Berufsfeuerwehr|public fire brigades]] (''Berufsfeuerwehr'') compulsory by law for large towns and cities. However, public brigades are often supported by and cooperate with volunteer brigades. Some volunteer brigades also have a small core of full-time firefighters paid by local community funds. In very rare cases private individuals can be compelled to participate in a [[Compulsory Fire Service|compulsory fire department]], if there are not enough volunteer fire fighters available. Volunteer fire brigades are usually structured in three brigade categories (''Grundausstattung'', ''Stützpunktfeuerwehren'', ''Schwerpunktfeuerwehren'') depending on size and level of equipment. Many German fire brigades not only provide firefighters, they operate [[emergency medical services]] as well. They are estimated to have a total of 1,300,000 active members.

==Hong Kong==
The [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department|Hong Kong Fire Services Department (HKFSD)]] not only has firefighters, but [[Ambulance|ambulance crews]]. As of 14 May 2005, there are 8,675 uniformed personnel (including ambulancemen/ambulancewomen) and 676 civilian members. Fire Services also provides fire services to [[Hong Kong International Airport]]. [[Government Flying Service]] provides aerial fire fighting capabilities.

The head of HKFSD is called the [[wikt:director|Director]] but not the [[Commissioner]]. Assisted by the Deputy Director, the Director of the HKFSD is the head of three Operational Fire Commands: Hong Kong, [[Kowloon]] and [[New Territories|N.T.]] (i.e. The three Districts). Each of the Commands is under the control of the [[Chief Fire Officer|Chief Fire Officer(CFO)]]. In reality, there is one additional Command: The Heartquarters(HQ), which is under control of the CFO(HQ).

See [http://www.hkfsd.gov.hk/home/eng/index.html here] for more information.

==Hungary==
Some 7000 firemen are serving in Hungary at fire brigade unites founded by Ödön Széchenyi. Most of them are professional municipal firemen who are paid from month to month for their services. They generally work at 24/48-hour shifts, occasionally at 24/72. The second largest number of firemen can be found in the volunteer fire brigades. In Hungary volunteer fire brigades are common organisations established by a local government and a firemen's association. The third section are the units employed in the industrial establishments. These units may be employed full-time or part-time. Their regulation and order of duty (in case of full-time employed) is according to the professional municipal firemen and the level of safety more specialized to the characteristics of the establishment. One of the biggest establishment fire brigade units in the country, world-famous through its firefighting practices, is the FER Fire Brigade Ltd., operated and sustained by MOL Co. petrol industry in [[Százhalombatta]].

==India==
In India municipalities are bound by law to have a fire brigade and participate in a regional fire service. Each city has its own fire brigade. All the industrial corporations also have their own firefighting service. Each airport and seaport has its own firefighting units. The main functions of firefighting service in India are provision of fire protection and of services during emergencies, such as building collapses, drowning cases, gas leakage, oil spillage, road and rail accidents, bird and animal rescues, fallen trees, appropriate action during natural calamities, and providing consultancy in implementing fire protection and fire safety in industries and high rise buildings and other buildings having special fire risks, etc.

==Indonesia==
Firefightning units in Indonesia (''Dinas pemadam kebakaran''/''DPK'' or BPB/Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah) fall under the control of the provincial, city, regency and municipal district/township governments and under the supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

==Republic of Ireland==
In the Republic of Ireland, [[fire services]] are provided on a county-by-county, local authority basis. Apart from a small number of full-time brigades, most fire services operate a [[retained firefighter|retained]] duty system, where firefighters are alerted to the fire station by a pager/alerter system. Retained firefighters are typically on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week apart from pre-arranged leave. Management and [[fire prevention]] duties (inspections, building assessment etc.) are carried out by a small number of senior officers in each county, usually between 4 and 10 depending on size and population.

An Irish fire brigade attends a wide variety of incidents, spanning from fire calls to flooding incidents to extrication of trapped victims at road incidents. This means that a wide variety of equipment is carried on the first-turnout [[fire engine|appliance]] (ladders, hose, breathing apparatus and extrication equipment as well as a vehicle mounted pump and an 1800-litre water tank), whilst more specialised vehicles - water tankers, rescue tenders, high reach appliances etc. - are stationed at strategic locations.

At border areas, such as [[Donegal]], [[County Louth|Louth]] and so on, local agreements are in place with the [[Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service]] in relation to attending incidents.

==Israel==
{{main|Israel Fire and Rescue Services}}
In Israel, the [[Israel Fire and Rescue Services]] is the sole authority in control of firefighting across the entire country. It also provides rescue services for victims of terrorism, car accidents, and dangerous substance spillages. There are 24 metro regions with central major fire stations along with smaller, supplemental stations in neighboring villages and cities. The Israel fire and rescue services consists of about 1,200 paid, professional firefighters and 200-400 volunteers. Israel also has 6 Hazardous Materials units, although almost all Israeli firefighters are certified at hazardous materials response and handling, many of them receiving training in world-class facilities in the Netherlands.

==Italy==
The ''[[vigili del fuoco]]'', literally the ''Firewatchers'', (official name '''''Corpo nazionale dei vigili del fuoco''''') (CNVVF, '''National Fire-watchers' Corps''') is [[Italy]]'s institutional agency for [[fire and rescue service]]. It is part of the Ministry of Interior's ''Dipartimento dei Vigili del Fuoco, del Soccorso Pubblico e della Difesa Civile'' (Department of Fire Watch, Public Rescue and Civil(ian) Protection). The corps' task is to provide safety for people, animals and property, and to give technical assistance to industries and fire prevention advice.  It also ensures public safety in terrorist emergencies such as chemical, bacteriological, radiological and nuclear attacks.

==Lithuania==
[[Image:Kaunas-Fire Engine.jpg|thumb|Firefighter vehicle in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]]]
In Lithuania firefighters are called "Ugniagesiai gelbėtojai" and may be summoned by dialing to 112 (Lithuania's main emergency phone). Most of the biggest Lithuania cities are equipped with the newest gear and technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ve.lt/naujienos/lietuva/vakaru-lietuva/ugniagesiai-gelbetojai-dziaugiasi-naujausia-iranga-1024534/ Ugniagesiai gelbėtojai džiaugiasi naujausia įranga] {{lt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania firefighters vehicles are mostly made in Europe, like: [[Renault]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[MAN SE|MAN]], however some smaller towns still have [[GAZ]] vehicles from Soviet times.

==Japan==
[[Image:Tokyo fire department trucks.jpg|thumb|Vehicles of the [[Tokyo Fire Department]].]]
Japan's first fire service was founded in 1629 during the Edo era, and was called Hikeshi (Japanese: 火消し, ''lit. fire extinguisher''). During the Meiji Period, when Japan opened its doors to the West, the Hikeshi was merged into the police department. During this time period, pumps were imported and domestically produced, and modern firefighting strategies were introduced. In 1948, after World War II, a municipality fire service system was established.

Today, fire services are organized on a city/town/village basis. There are 894 fire headquarters (Japanese: 消防本部) and 3,598 volunteer fire corps (Japanese: 消防団). These have a total of 155,000 active career firefighters and 21,000 vehicles with 4,800 fire houses; 920,000 volunteer firefighters share an additional 51,000 trucks. Overall supervision is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

==Macau==

Like [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] has their own fire department, [[Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau]] and trained like their Western counterparts. The fire department also provides fire and rescue services to [[Macau International Airport]].

==The Netherlands==
In The Netherlands municipalities are bound by law to have a fire brigade and participate in a regional fire service. The local brigade is responsible for responding to all incidents; the regional fire service provides a control center and operates the special vehicles. There are 25 "safety Regions". These regions' boundaries are the same for fire, police and ambulance service and most regions have a combined control center. The regions are self-contained and can cope with most incidents, in extreme circumstances other regions will provide assistance. All emergency services rely on a single modern digital national communications network based on the [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|Tetra]] standard. This makes mutual assistance between regions simple to coordinate. Unlike some other countries the ambulance service is completely separated from the fire service, although the control center is usually shared.

About 75% of all firefighters are volunteers, the rest are career firefighters. Although most firefighters in the Netherlands are volunteers, they all get paid. Volunteers get a small amount of money to compensate the costs, because when called upon, they have to leave their jobs and take risks.

The appearance of emergency vehicles is standardized in order to keep them optimally recognizable for other road users. 
The basic first response unit is an engine manned by a crew of six, a commander, a driver, an attack-team and a [[water supply]] team. Aerial ladder or tower trucks are dispatched when needed. Because it is impractical to build trucks to carry all the possible types, all regional fire services across the nation use a standardized type of containers. These containers are transported by special trucks. The containers are built for specific purposes. There are containers with command and control, hydraulic submersible pumps (up to 8000 litres per minute), hoseline (up to 3&amp;nbsp;km of 150-mm hose), watertank, [[foam]]tank, [[decontamination]], [[Hazmat suit|Hazmat]], [[SCBA|breathing apparatus]], technical rescue, etc.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, fire protection services are overseen by the [[New Zealand Fire Service Commission]]. The Commission ensures coverage through all jurisdictions nationwide and reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Fire protection for [[Urban area|urban]] and peri-urban areas is provided by the [[New Zealand Fire Service]]. This nationwide organisation was established by the Fire Service Act 1975 from the various urban fire brigades in existence at the time. The Fire Service Act nationalised the service and provided the [[statute|statutory authority]] required to fight and prevent fire and to respond to other emergencies, including [[hazardous substance]] incidents and [[motor-vehicle collision]]s. There are mixture of career fire districts, covering major towns and cities, and [[volunteer fire brigade]]s, covering smaller towns and communities. Each district and brigade is headed by a Chief Fire Officer (CFO), who report via their Area Commander and Regional Commander to the National Commander, the chief operational firefighter of the entire Fire Service. The National Commander reports to the Chief Executive who in turn reports to the NZFSC. The roles of National Commander and Chief Executive may be performed by one person if  suitably qualified for both roles.

The NZFS has a significant role in [[Urban search and rescue|Urban Search and Rescue]] and contributes key resources to New Zealand's three USAR teams, based in [[Auckland]], [[Palmerston North]] and [[Christchurch]]. They also provide first-response medical services as a backup to local Ambulance Services, especially in rural areas.

In rural areas the [http://www.nrfa.org.nz/ National Rural Fire Authority] is responsible for providing fire response, as covered by the Forest and Rural Fires Act 1977.  Rural Fire Brigades are operated by City and District Councils, where each District appoints a Rural Fire Officer who reports to the National Rural Fire Officer, who reports to the NZFSC. Other participants in the New Zealand Fire Service Commission are the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] (responsible for fires on Military land) and the Department of Conservation (Responsible for fires in National Parks). Privately owned forestry areas are responsible for providing their own firefighting means.

There is much cooperation between the various firefighting resources in New Zealand, but it is recognised that current legislation is not very flexible - there are loopholes in the areas of funding and legal liability, among others.  The Department of Internal Affairs is currently in the process of reviewing legislation for Fire and Rescue services in New Zealand, with a view to rewriting both the Fire Service Act and the Forest and Rural Fires Act.

Specialist forest fire fighters from New Zealand are often requested to provide assistance at [[wildfire]] events in Australia and the United States, where their skills in [[incident management]] are utilised within the [[Incident Command System]].

==Norway==
Norway has 433 municipalities and 375 Fire and Rescue Services.

==Panama==
The idea for a volunteer fire brigade in [[Panama]] began in the 1870s and was officially inaugurated on November 28, 1887. Paid firefighters did not appear until May 1, 1909. Fire protection services are divided into regional zones each with its own independent institution. They are overseen by a council of zone directors for the fire departments of the entire country. Zone 1 encompasses [[Panama City]] and its suburbs. It has about 300 permanent, paid firefighters and twice as many volunteers.

==Paraguay==
The [[Paraguyan Firefighting Corps]], established in 1978, serves as the national firefighting service. It is Latin America's youngest national fire service, tasked to provide firefighting, disaster and accident rescue duties.

==Peru==
Founded in 1953, the [[Peruvian General Volunteer Firefighters Corps]] (''Cuerpo General de Bomberos Voluntarios del Perú'') serves as the official firefighting service of the country. It is the central authority for firefighting in Peru. With more than hundreds of municipal and city level departments the PGVFC provides the necessary training and equipment for these fire units.

==Philippines==
{{Main|Bureau of Fire Protection}}
Firefighting and rescue services in the Philippines are, since 1991, handled by the Bureau of Fire Protection of the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]].

==Portugal==
In Portugal, volunteer fire departments are established in every town: even the biggest Portuguese cities, have volunteer firefighters besides a career fire service. Well-trained and well-equipped fire departments are based in every Portuguese [[municipalities of Portugal|municipality]]. [[Aerial firefighting]] is widely used, especially in the forest. Video-based fire surveillance and remote monitoring systems for real-life application are used, besides fire surveillance outposts placed in strategic locations. Legislation regarding the installation and maintenance of fire detection and control in buildings is enforced. Like all the other [[EU member state]]s, in which under a [[European Union]] civil-protection programme, the [[European Commission]] manages requests for help with a natural disaster and keeps tabs on what resources are available in which member state, Portugal is ready to offer support in firefighting operations in the European Union.

==Singapore==
The [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (abbreviation: SCDF; Chinese: 新加坡民防部队) is the main agency in charge of the provision of emergency services in the Republic of Singapore during peacetime and emergency.

A uniformed organization under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the SCDF provides ambulance, firefighting and emergency response services in Singapore. It also plays a major role in the Republic's disaster relief operations.

==Slovenia==

The organization of firefighting in [[Slovenia]] has many similarities with firefighting in Austria, because of the historical influence. The emphasis is on [[volunteer fire department]]s which are non-profit organization by the law. As of 2008, there are 1295 volunteer fire departments and 68 industrial voluntary fire departments with more than 60,000 voluntary firefighters which represent the backbone of firefighting service in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasilec.net/ul-priloge/POROCILO%2015.KONGRESU%20GZS.pdf Poročilo 15. kongresa GZS]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity of the volunteer fire departments is financially supported by local [[Community (administrative division)|community]], but fire departments are also allowed to collect private donations. The voluntary fire departments are also heavily involved in community activities, especially in smaller towns and villages. The general organization of voluntary firefighting service is named ''[http://www.gasilec.net Gasilska zveza Slovenije]''.

In addition to voluntary firefighters there are also 34 career fire departments (13 of them provide public fire service in bigger cities, the rest of them on main [[airport]]s and big industrial facilities, including power plants) with more than 900 firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zspg.si/uvod.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615064123/http://www.zspg.si/uvod.php |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These professional firefighters are financially supported by the employers (in industry and at the airports), but public fire departments are supported by local municipalities and  the Slovenian [[Ministry of Defence (Slovenia)|Ministry of Defense]].

Both voluntary and professional firefighters must undergo a formal training to become qualified for the firefighting duty.

==Spain==
Fire brigades in Spain are different in each [[autonomous community]] with the exception of [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] which have their own brigades.
The Fire Brigade of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] is famous for having created an [[NGO]] called [[Bomberos Sin Fronteras]] (''Firefighters Without Borders'') which helps in any natural disaster that could happen anywhere in the world. There is also a [[Firefighters Museum of Alcoy|Firefighters Museum]], in [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]], ([[Province of Alicante|Alicante]]).

==Sri Lanka==
The fire brigades in [[Sri Lanka]] are based in large cities such as [[Colombo]], [[Kandy]], etc. These units come under the control of each municipal council. Some towns have smaller units. All major airports and harbors maintain their own fire brigades with specialized units and training.

==Switzerland==
In [[Switzerland]], it is common for [[Compulsory Fire Service|compulsory fire service]] duties to be required of both men and women, whether or not they are Swiss. Most fire services in Switzerland are so called Militia Fire Brigades (''Miliz-Feuerwehr''). [[Militia]] firefighters normally pursue other professions, and have active duty only during exercises and missions. In the case of an emergency, the first response is completed by a group of specially-trained police officers. The militia fire brigade arrives as soon as possible. In special situations (major events, demonstrations, etc.) the fire brigade provides a standby service. Currently 95.000 men and women serve as firefighters in 1.500 fire brigades (''Feuerwehrkorps''), Only 1.200 of them are professional firefighters, organized as plant fire brigades or a unit of a larger city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions include for example, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Zurich]], and in all places where professional fire brigades exist. If a fire brigade cannot find enough volunteers, it can carry out forced recruitment. These drafts are not popular, because the recruited firefighters are generally less motivated. Anyone who rejects service must pay a fire service exemption tax.

==United Kingdom==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pager]] --&gt;
{{main|Fire service in the United Kingdom|History of fire brigades in the United Kingdom}}

Fire and rescue services (FRS) in England are organised on a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] or [[county]] basis, mainly owing to the reorganisation of the counties in 1974.  In [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] they are on a regional basis, with eight and three FRS respectively. [[Northern Ireland]] and, since 2013, [[Scotland]] have single brigades, the [[Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service]] and the [[Scottish Fire and Rescue Service]] respectively. The term fire brigade is largely historical with only a few FRS, including the [[London Fire Brigade]] keeping it in use. The gradual change to the term fire and rescue service has been reinforced by new legislation including the [[Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/20040021.htm Fire &amp; Rescue Services Act 2004, Pub: The Stationery Office, Crown copyright] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031030651/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/20040021.htm |date=October 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly applies to England and Wales. The equivalent legislation in Scotland is the [[Fire (Scotland) Act 2005]]. In rural areas, there are often fire stations manned by part-time [[retained firefighters]]. In addition there are a number of independent fire services, such as the [[Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade|Peterborough volunteers]], the [[Down House#Downe House School|Downe House School]] brigade and those run by large industrial concerns. As well as responding to emergencies, UK FRS also have a legal obligation by various [[Acts of Parliament]] covering different parts of the UK, to respond to any emergency, which can pose a threat to life, and the environment. Dealing with [[Urban Search and Rescue]] incidents was incorporated into English law in 2007, FRS are required by law to deal with ''An emergency involving the collapse of a building or other structure..''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Fire&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3231087&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3231087&amp;filesize=15341 Ministry of Justice, UK Statute Law Database: The Fire &amp; Rescue Services (Emergencies) (England) Order 2007 No735]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Firefighting in the United States}}
[[Image:PGFD1.JPG|right|thumb|250 px|Prince George's County Fire Department Engine 553 in the foreground and Ladder 55 in the background parked at a firehouse in [[Brentwood, Maryland]]]]
U.S. firefighters work under the auspices of fire departments (also commonly called fire protection districts, fire divisions, fire companies, fire bureaus, and fire-rescue).  These departments are generally organized as local or [[County (United States)|county]] government subsidiaries, [[special-purpose district]] entities or [[not-for-profit corporation]]s.  They may be funded by the parent government, through millage, fees for services, fundraising or charitable contributions. Some state governments and the federal government operate fire departments to protect their wildlands, e.g., [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] (CAL FIRE),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_er.php CAL FIRE - Fire Protection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] Forest Fire Service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/fire/aboutus.html Department of Environmental Protection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[USDA Forest Service]] – Fire and Aviation Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ Fire and Aviation Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Smokejumper]]). Many military installations, major airports and large industrial facilities also operate their own fire departments.

==Vatican City==
{{Main|Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State}}
The world's smallest country maintains a full-time professional fire service, under the authority of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence. The original ''Guardie dei Fuoco'', established in 1820, was a military fire service, and part of the armed forces of the Papal States. This was reformed in 1941 into the ''Corpo dei vigili del fuoco dello Stato della Città del Vaticano'' or ''Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State''. The Corps has its Headquarters at Belvedere Courtyard in the Vatican City, and maintains full-tim cover throughout the year on a rotational shift pattern, staffed by 30 full-time firefighters. There are four principal appliances, plus a number of support vehicles.

==Venezuela==
In [[Venezuela]], there are several types of fire brigades, which are often divided by jurisdiction.  The two main types of fire brigades here are State or Municipal brigades, with many volunteer units existing as well.  One of the most important paid fire departments in Venezuela is the [http://www.bomberoscaracas.gov.ve ''Bomberos Metropolitanos de Caracas''] (Caracas Metropolitan Firefighters).

A fourth type, the University brigade, takes care of any emergency situation on a [[university]] campus.  These brigades are a rapidly growing trend in Venezuela.  An example of such a force is [http://www.ucv.ve/bomberos ''Cuerpo de Bomberos Universitarios de la Universidad Central de Venezuela''] (Venezuela Central University's Firefighter Brigade), which has more than 40 years of service and combined experience.  There are new institutions growing in other universities, such as the [http://bomberos.usb.ve ''Cuerpo de Bomberos Voluntarios de la Universidad Simón Bolívar''] (Simón Bolívar University's Volunteer Firefighter Brigade).

All these firefighting units report directly to the Ministry of Interior and Justice through the [[National Directorate for Civil Protection and Firefighting]].

==Vietnam==

The Vietnam Firefighting Force (Lực lượng Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy Việt Nam) is a component part of [[Vietnam People's Public Security]]. It includes 4 subbranches: Volunteer Fire Militia (Dân phòng Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy), Regular Fire Service (Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy Cơ sở), Special Fire Service (Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy Chuyên ngành) and Fire Police (Cảnh sát Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy).

Vietnam Firefighting Force has important roles in managing, organizing and commanding  firefighting and civil defense duties within Vietnam.

Vietnam Firefighting Force was established on 27 September 1961. As a part of the VPPS, it falls under the command of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam)]].

Each province of Vietnam has a Fire Office and each local area has a Fire Station under the Provincial Fire Office.

[[File:GI normal.jpg|thumb|The gut-brain axis is the relationship between the GI tract and brain function and development]]
The '''gut–brain axis''' is the biochemical signaling that takes place between the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GI tract) and the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=2014Wangrev /&gt; The term "gut–brain axis" is occasionally used to refer to the role of the [[gut flora]] in the interplay as well, whereas the term "'''microbiome–gut–brain axis'''" explicitly includes the role of gut flora in the biochemical signaling events that take place between the GI tract and CNS.&lt;ref name=2014Wangrev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sudo|first=N|last2=Chida|first2=Y|last3=Aiba|first3=Y|title=Postnatal microbial colonization programs the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system for stress response in mice|journal=J Physiol|year=2004|volume=558 (Pt 1)|pages=263–275}} cited in: {{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y | last2 = Kasper | first2 = LH | date = May 2014 | title = The role of microbiome in central nervous system disorders | journal = Brain Behav Immun | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2013.12.015 | pmid = 24370461 | pmc=4062078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer2014rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = EA | last2 = Knight | first2 = R | last3 = Mazmanian | first3 = SK | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Gut microbes and the brain: paradigm shift in neuroscience | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/46/15490.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 34 | issue = 46| pages = 15490–15496 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3299-14.2014 | pmid = 25392516 | pmc=4228144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DinanandCryan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinan|first1=T.G|last2=Cryan|first2=2015|title=The impact of gut microbiota on brain and behavior: implications for psychiatry|journal=Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care|date=2015|volume=18|issue=6|pages=552–558|pmid= 26372511|doi=10.1097/MCO.0000000000000221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly defined, the gut-brain axis includes the [[central nervous system]], neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, including the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] (HPA axis), sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the [[autonomic nervous system]], including the [[enteric nervous system]] and the [[vagus nerve]], and the gut [[microbiota]].&lt;ref name=2014Wangrev /&gt;&lt;ref name="DinanandCryan2015" /&gt; The first of the brain-gut interactions shown, was the [[cephalic phase]] of digestion, in the release of gastric and pancreatic secretions in response to sensory signals, such as the smell and sight of food. This was first demonstrated by [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]].&lt;ref name="Filaretova"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Filaretova |first1=L |last2=Bagaeva |first2=T |title=The Realization of the Brain-Gut Interactions with Corticotropin-Releasing Factor and Glucocorticoids. |journal=Current Neuropharmacology |date=2016 |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=876–881 |pmid=27306034|pmc=5333583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smeets"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smeets |first1=PA |last2=Erkner |first2=A |last3=de Graaf |first3=C |title=Cephalic phase responses and appetite. |journal=Nutrition Reviews |date=November 2010 |volume=68 |issue=11 |pages=643–55 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00334.x |pmid=20961295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2016, most of the work that had been done on the role of gut flora in the gut-brain axis had been conducted in animals, or on characterizing the various neuroactive compounds that gut flora can produce.

== Enteric nervous system ==
The [[enteric nervous system]] is one of the main divisions of the [[nervous system]] and consists of a mesh-like system of [[neuron]]s that governs the function of the [[gastrointestinal system]]; it has been described as a "second brain" for several reasons. The enteric nervous system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) through the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] (e.g., via the [[vagus nerve]]) and [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] (e.g., via the [[prevertebral ganglia]]) nervous systems.  However, [[vertebrate]] studies show that when the [[vagus nerve]] is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function.&lt;ref name="amjphysgastro"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/285/3/G461.full | title=Musings on the Wanderer: What's New in Our Understanding of Vago-Vagal Reflexes? V. Remodeling of vagus and enteric neural circuitry after vagal injury |author1=Li, Ying |author2=Owyang, Chung | journal=American Journal of Physiology. Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology |date=September 2003 | volume=285 | issue=3 | pages=G461–9 | doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00119.2003| pmid=12909562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In vertebrates, the enteric nervous system  includes [[efferent neurons]], [[afferent neuron]]s, and [[interneurons]], all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes in the absence of CNS input.  The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions.  Through intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control [[peristalsis]] and churning of intestinal contents.  Other neurons control the secretion of [[enzymes]].  The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 [[neurotransmitters]], most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as [[acetylcholine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]]. More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the body's dopamine and the dual function of these neurotransmitters is an active part of gut-brain research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasricha|first=Pankaj Jay|title=Stanford Hospital: Brain in the Gut – Your Health|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXx4WTVU34Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martinucci | first1 = I | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = Genetics and pharmacogenetics of aminergic transmitter pathways in functional gastrointestinal disorders | url = | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 16 | issue = 5| pages = 523–39 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.15.12 | pmid = 25916523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smitka | first1 = K | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = The role of "mixed" orexigenic and anorexigenic signals and autoantibodies reacting with appetite-regulating neuropeptides and peptides of the adipose tissue-gut-brain axis: relevance to food intake and nutritional status in patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa | journal = Int J Endocrinol | volume = 2013 | issue = | page = 483145 | doi = 10.1155/2013/483145 | pmid = 24106499 | pmc=3782835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the gut-brain interactions was shown to be between the sight and smell of food and the release of gastric secretions, known as the [[cephalic phase]], or cephalic response of digestion.&lt;ref name="Filaretova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smeets"/&gt;

== Gut-brain integration ==

The gut–brain axis, a bidirectional neurohumoral communication system, is important for maintaining [[homeostasis]] and is regulated through the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[enteric nervous system]]s and the neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways, and especially including the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] (HPA axis).&lt;ref name=2014Wangrev /&gt;  That term has been expanded to include the role of the gut flora as part of the "microbiome-gut-brain axis", a linkage of functions including the gut flora.&lt;ref name=2014Wangrev /&gt;&lt;ref name="DinanandCryan2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer2014rev /&gt;

Interest in the field was sparked by a 2004 study (Nobuyuki Sudo and Yoichi Chida) showing that germ-free mice (genetically homogeneous laboratory mice, birthed and raised in an antiseptic environment) showed an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress compared to non-GF laboratory mice.&lt;ref name=2014Wangrev /&gt;

The gut flora can produce a range of [[neuroactive]] molecules, such as [[acetylcholine]], [[catecholamines]], [[γ-aminobutyric acid]], [[histamine]], [[melatonin]], and [[serotonin]], which is essential for regulating peristalsis and sensation in the gut.&lt;ref name=Petra2015rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petra | first1 = AI | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | date = May 2015 | title = Gut-Microbiota-Brain Axis and Its Effect on Neuropsychiatric Disorders With Suspected Immune Dysregulation | journal = Clin. Ther. | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 984–95 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.04.002 | pmid = 26046241 | pmc=4458706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in the composition of the gut flora due to diet, drugs, or disease correlate with changes in levels of circulating [[cytokines]], some of which can affect brain function.&lt;ref name=Petra2015rev /&gt;  The gut flora also release molecules that can directly activate the [[vagus nerve]] which transmits information about the state of the intestines to the brain.&lt;ref name=Petra2015rev /&gt;

Likewise, chronic or acutely stressful situations activate the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]], causing changes in the gut flora and [[intestinal epithelium]], and possibly having [[systemic effect]]s.&lt;ref name=Petra2015rev /&gt;  Additionally, the [[cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway]], signaling through the vagus nerve, affects the gut epithelium and flora.&lt;ref name=Petra2015rev /&gt; [[Hunger (motivational state)|Hunger]] and satiety are integrated in the brain, and the presence or absence of food in the gut and types of food present, also affect the composition and activity of gut flora.&lt;ref name=Petra2015rev /&gt;

That said, most of the work that has been done on the role of gut flora in the gut-brain axis has been conducted in animals, including the highly artificial germ-free mice.   As of 2016 studies with humans measuring changes to gut flora in response to stress, or measuring effects of various probiotics, have generally been small and cannot be generalized; whether changes to gut flora are a result of disease, a cause of disease, or both in any number of possible feedback loops in the gut-brain axis, remains unclear.&lt;ref name=JFP2016rev /&gt;

== Research ==

===Probiotics===
A 2016 [[systematic review]] of laboratory animal studies and preliminary human [[clinical trial]]s using commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria found that certain species of the ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' [[genera]] (i.e., ''[[B. longum]]'', ''[[B. breve]]'', ''[[B. infantis]]'', ''[[L. helveticus]]'', ''[[L. rhamnosus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum|L. plantarum]]'', and ''[[L. casei]]'') had the most potential to be useful for certain [[central nervous system disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="CNS SystRev 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang H, Lee IS, Braun C, Enck P | title = Effect of probiotics on central nervous system functions in animals and humans - a systematic review | journal = J. Neurogastroenterol Motil. | volume = 22| issue = 4| pages = 589–605| date = July 2016 | pmid = 27413138 | doi = 10.5056/jnm16018|quote=We reviewed the effect of probiotics on the central nervous system in randomized controlled trials in animals and humans, and analyzed the possibility of translating animal models to human studies because few human studies have been conducted to date. According to the qualitative analyses of current studies, we can provisionally draw the conclusion that B. longum, B. breve, B. infantis, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and L. casei were most effective  in improving CNS function, including psychiatric disease-associated functions (anxiety, depression, mood, stress response) and memory abilities.| pmc = 5056568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anxiety and mood disorders ===
As of 2018 work on the relationship between gut flora and [[anxiety disorders]] and [[mood disorders]], as well as trying to influence that relationship using probiotics or prebiotics (called "psychobiotics"),  was at an early stage, with insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about a causal role for gut flora changes in these conditions, or about the efficacy of any probiotic or prebiotic treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarkar | first=Amar | last2=Lehto | first2=Soili M. | last3=Harty | first3=Siobhán | last4=Dinan | first4=Timothy G. | last5=Cryan | first5=John F. | last6=Burnet | first6=Philip W.J. | title=Psychobiotics and the Manipulation of Bacteria–Gut–Brain Signals | journal=Trends in Neurosciences | volume=39 | issue=11 | year=2016 | issn=0166-2236 | doi=10.1016/j.tins.2016.09.002 | pmid=27793434 | pmc=5102282 | pages=763–781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JFP2016rev /&gt;

People with anxiety and mood disorders tend to have gastrointestinal problems; small studies have been conducted to compare the gut flora of people with major depressive disorder and healthy people, but those studies have had contradictory results.&lt;ref name=JFP2016rev /&gt;

Much interest was generated in the potential role of gut flora in anxiety disorders, and more generally in the role of gut flora in the gut-brain axis, by studies published in 2004 showing that germ-free mice have an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress caused by being restrained, which was reversed by colonizing their gut with a ''Bifidobacterium'' species.&lt;ref name=Mayer2014rev /&gt;  Studies looking at maternal separation for rats shows neonatal stress leads to long-term changes in the gut microbiota such as its diversity and composition, which also led to stress and anxiety-like behavior.&lt;ref name="FosterNeufeld2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=J.A.|last2=McVey Neufelt|first2=K.A.|title=Gut-brain axis: how the microbiome influences anxiety and depression|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|date=2013|volume=36|issue=5|pages=305–312|pmid=23384445|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2013.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, while much work had been done as of 2016 to characterize various neurotransmitters known to be involved in anxiety and mood disorders that gut flora can produce (for example, ''Escherichia'', ''Bacillus'', and ''Saccharomyces'' species can produce [[noradrenalin]]; ''Candida'', ''Streptococcus'', and ''Escherichia'' species can produce [[serotonin]], etc.) the interrelationships and pathways by which the gut flora might affect anxiety in humans were unclear.&lt;ref name="Saxena" /&gt;

=== Autism ===
Around 70% of people with [[autism]] also have gastrointestinal problems, and autism is often diagnosed at the time that the gut flora becomes established, indicating that there may be a connection between autism and gut flora.&lt;ref name=BuieAutism2015rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buie | first1 = T | date = May 2015 | title = Potential Etiologic Factors of Microbiome Disruption in Autism | url = | journal = Clin. Ther. | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 976–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.04.001 | pmid = 26046240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies have found differences in the gut flora of children with autism compared with children without autism – most notably elevations in the amount of ''[[Clostridium]]'' in the stools of children with autism compared with the stools of the children without&lt;ref name="Chen2013rev"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = X | last2 = D'Souza | first2 = R | last3 = Hong | first3 = ST | year = 2013 | title = The role of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis: current challenges and perspectives | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 403–14 | pmid = 23686721 | doi=10.1007/s13238-013-3017-x | pmc=4875553}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but these results have not been consistently replicated.&lt;ref name=BuieAutism2015rev /&gt;  Many of the environmental factors thought to be relevant to the development of autism would also affect the gut flora, leaving open the question whether specific developments in the gut flora drive the development of autism or whether those developments happen concurrently.&lt;ref name="DinanandCryan2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BuieAutism2015rev /&gt;   As of 2016, studies with probiotics had only been conducted with animals; studies of other [[Autism therapies#Diets|dietary changes to treat autism]] have been inconclusive.&lt;ref name=JFP2016rev /&gt;

=== Parkinson's disease ===
As of 2015 one study had been conducted comparing the gut flora of people with [[Parkinson's disease]] to healthy controls; in that study people with Parkinsons had lower levels of ''Prevotellaceae'' and people with Parkinsons who had higher levels of
''Enterobacteriaceae'' had more clinically severe symptoms; the authors of the study drew no conclusions about whether gut flora changes were driving the disease or vice versa.&lt;ref name="DinanandCryan2015" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10957">The '''Human Security Report Project''' ('''HSRP''') is a [[peace and conflict studies]] research group. The Project is presently based at [[Simon Fraser University]]'s School for International Studies at [[Harbour Centre]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=342&amp;Itemid=68 About the Project] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; having formerly been based at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s [[Liu Institute for Global Issues]] in the Human Security Centre.[[Image:HSRP Logo.png|thumb|Human Security Report Project (HSRP)]]

== Publications and services ==
The Project is known primarily for the ''[[Human Security Report 2005]]'', which provided evidence that, according to the Project's data and definitions, there had been a large decline in the number of [[war]]s, [[genocide]]s, and international crises since the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005:  [http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 The HSR In the News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033240/http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 |date=2008-05-16 }} (accessed May 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Overview.pdf Overview] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Project adopts the 'narrow' conception of [[Human Security]]. The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' concepts of Human Security, is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the Human Security page.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in armed conflict in recent history has been referred to as the [[Long Peace]],&lt;ref name="Gaddis1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=John Lewis|title=The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504335-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Long-Peace-Inquiries-Into-History/dp/0195043359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=Lawrence|title=Stephen Pinker and the long peace: alliance, deterrence and decline|journal=Cold War History|volume=14|issue=4|year=2014|pages=657–672|issn=1468-2745|doi=10.1080/14682745.2014.950243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is general agreement among experts that the frequency of war has declined since at least the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; despite a widespread misperception that the world has become more dangerous.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Human Security Report 2013: The Decline in Global Violence| author = Human Security Research Group, [[Simon Fraser University]]| date = 2013| access-date = 11 November 2018| url = https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fettweis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace|journal=Security Studies|volume=26|issue=3|year=2017|pages=423–451|issn=0963-6412|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Project published the ''Human Security Brief 2006'', updating the core global trend data from the 2005 ''Report'', and the ''Human Security Brief 2007''. The 2007 ''Brief'' demonstrated that there had been a sharp decline in the incidence of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] violence (measured in terms of numbers of fatalities) around the world. If fatalities from [[political violence]] against [[civilian]]s perpetrated by [[Non-state actor|non-state groups]] in [[Iraq]] are counted as deaths from terrorism, the decline dated mid-2007. This claim was disputed in a press release from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf Chapter 1- Dying to Lose: Explaining the Decline in Global Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120005915/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Newsdesk: [http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 Terrorism Fatalities Up, Not Down UMD Analysis Disputes New Report] (accessed March 22, 2009). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621114431/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 |date=June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, START at that time only had incident data to 2004. Subsequent START reports confirmed the large decline in fatalities from terrorism in 2007. One problem with the START project's dataset is that it counts politically motivated killings of civilians in [[civil war]] by non-state actors as terrorism in some contexts, but not in others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Iraq, for example, such killings are counted as acts of terrorism, but the very large number of comparable killings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s civil wars in the 1990s are not. Subsequent to the publication of the 2007 ''Brief'', the incidence of global terrorism has again increased, with most of the increase being in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Further, the 2007 ''Brief'' suggested positive change in Sub-Saharan Africa's security landscape; the number of conflicts being waged in the region more than halved between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf Chapter 2- Towards A New Peace in Africa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120000129/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, the Project published, in conjunction with the [[World Bank]], the ''miniAtlas of Human Security''.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security"&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311073705/http://miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ |date=2009-03-11 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was produced in three languages and is an "at-a-glance guide to global security issues", using a selection of maps and graphics to illustrate security trends, and is part of the World Bank's ''miniAtlas'' series.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas World Bank miniAtlas Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717075252/http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas |date=2011-07-17 }} (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent translations of the ''miniAtlas'' into Russian, Japanese, and Arabic.

In 2010, the Project launched the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' at the [[United Nations]]. Part I of the ''Report'' examines "The Causes of Peace" since the end of [[World War II]]. Part II examines "The Shrinking Costs of War", paying particular attention to "indirect deaths" from war-exacerbated disease and [[malnutrition]]. Part III reviews recent trends in organized violence around the world. A hard copy version of the ''Report'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] early in 2011. The text of the ''Report'' is freely available online at www.hsrgroup.org.

In addition to its publications, the Project runs several free e-services available in a number of delivery formats:

*[[Human Security Gateway]]
*[http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/overview.aspx Human Security Research]

== Funding and collaboration ==
The Project works closely with a number of the world's leading research groups in peace and conflict studies, including:&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=56 Partners] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], based in [[Norway]]
*The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], based in [[Sweden]]

It has received funding from a number of governments, including:

*Canada's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]]
*The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Department for International Development]]
*The [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
*The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]]
*The [[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]

The Project is a principal partner of the [[International Relations and Security Network]].

== Criticism ==

Lack of robust conflict data remains a major problem with all attempts to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program's has an acknowledged tendency to undercount fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Part2.pdf Part II- The Human Security Audit] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends, and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes of war and peace are more concerned with trends––are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing?––than in absolute numbers. For [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s, the reverse is true. There are various methodologies that can be used to estimate war deaths––incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and censuses. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology. Part III of the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' contains a discussion of these debates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''India State Hunger Index''' ('''ISHI''') is a tool to calculate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] at the regional level in [[India]]. It is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) 2008 and was calculated for 17 states in India, covering more than 95 percent of the population. 

The ISHI was developed by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and presented for the first time 2008 in conjunction with the [[Non-Governmental Organization]] [[Welthungerhilfe]] and the Department of Economics, [[University of California]].

== Background ==

Despite the good economic performance, with over 200 million people who are [[food security|food insecure]], India is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the [[Global Hunger Index]] 2017 it covers position 100 out of 119 ranked countries and has an “serious“ (31.4) [[food security]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ishi08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem in the country is the high prevalence of [[underweight]] children under five, which is a result of low nutrition and educational status of women. 

While there has been attention to hunger and [[undernourishment]] at the central level, within India's political system, states are important political units with regard to the planning and execution of development programs. Thus unpacking the hunger index at the level of the  federal states is an important tool to build awareness of the disparities in hunger among them. In addition, the variability of the relative contribution of the underlying components of the hunger index across the different Indian states can help to stimulate the discussion about the drivers of hunger in different state contexts.

==Indicators and underlying data==

The ISHI is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] which follows a multidimensional approach to measuring hunger and [[malnutrition]]. It combines three equally weighted indicators:

# the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient dietary intake);
# the prevalence of [[underweight]] children under the age of five (indicating the proportion of children suffering from weight loss and / or reduced growth); and 
# the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy between dietary intake and unhealthy environments).

The ISHI uses two data sources for the estimation of the Indian state level: These are the first rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005–2006) for India and the National Sample Survey data from 2004 to 2005. It is calculated and presented for 17 major states, covering 95 percent of the country's population. While the National Family Health Survey has a large enough sample size to yield representative estimates of the child [[underweight]] and mortality rates even for the smaller states and union territories in the country, the sample size of the National Sample Survey is insufficient for estimating undernourishment rates in these places. Therefore, the ISHI restricts the sample to those states for which it yields precise states level estimates.

== Key findings ==

*ISHI 2008 scores for Indian states range from 13.6 (“serious”) for [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to 30.9 (“extremely alarming”) for [[Madhya Pradesh]], indicating substantial variability among states in India. Punjab is ranked 34th when compared to the GHI 2008 worldwide country ranking, while Madhya Pradesh is ranked 82nd. In this state more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. 60 percent of the children are undernourished.
*All 17 states have ISHI scores that are well above the “low” and “moderate” hunger categories. Twelve of the 17 states fall into the “alarming” category, and one into the “extremely alarming” category.
*ISHI scores are closely aligned with poverty, but there is little association with state level economic growth. High levels of hunger are seen in states that are performing well from an economic perspective.
*Inclusive economic growth and targeted strategies to ensure food sufficiency reduce child mortality and improve child nutrition are urgent priorities for all states in India.

'''Industrial Toxicology Research Centre''' (ITRC) is now named as '''Indian Institute of Toxicology Research''' ('''IITR'''), Lucknow, India. The institute is engaged in the field of [[Toxicology]] having its main campus in [[Lucknow]] city and the other Gheru campus, is located near village 'Gheru' at [[List of National Highways in India|Lucknow-Kanpur highway]].

It is one of the constituent laboratory of [[CSIR India]], which was established in 1965 with the motto of "Safety to Environment &amp; Health and Service to Industry". The founder Director (1965–78) of the institute was '''Prof. Sibte Hasan Zaidi''' who died on 5 April 2008 at New York. He was the recipient of Padmashri and prestigious Sir Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar award for scientific excellence. IITR conducts Dr. S.H. Zaidi Oration in his honour every year during its foundation day celebrations on 4 November.

The institute is dedicated towards research in Fundamental and Applied Toxicology. Major thrust areas include Environmental toxicology, Ground and surface water pollution, Safety assessment of food &amp; additives, Toxicity evaluation of substances for human use, Microbial contaminations, Bioremediation, Hazard identification and Toxicogenomics.

The institute attracts students from all over India to pursue research. IITR offers Ph.D. programme in various areas, few to name are ''In vivo'' &amp; ''In vitro'' Toxicology, Environmental Toxicology, Genetic Toxicology, Immunotoxicology, Neurotoxicology, Food Toxicology, Environmental Microbiology and Carcinogenesis.

The institute also offers services for Toxicological and Analytical evaluation of chemicals / finished products to public and private sectors as per OECD, USEPA, BIS, ISO guidelines.

IITR became a reality in 1965 as Industrial Toxicology Research Centre (ITRC) located in Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow. The founder Director, Prof. Sibte Hasan Zaidi, could foresee the need to address health related to work environment of the industrial workers in post independence era of rapid industrialization in our country. It was advocated that the adverse effects of chemicals on health and environment will make an adverse impact on overall development of the country. Hence, studies were needed to develop strategies for sustainable industrial development. ITRC gained national importance by addressing the health problems of our industrial work force in a growing economy. Pioneering studies carried out during the formative years were directly linked to miners' health especially to respiratory ailments.

The '''international trade in parrots''' is a lucrative enterprise, and forms an important part of the international [[wildlife trade]]. As [[parrot]]s have become increasingly endangered, many countries have placed restrictions on the trade and/or prohibited the trade altogether. Despite the restriction on trade in many countries however, the market still operates both legally and illegally.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted on October 23, 1992, to protect exotic bird species from international trade. The Act maintains that wild-caught birds may only be imported into the United States if they are produced in accordance with service-approved management plans for sustainable use of the species.&lt;ref name = US/&gt; After the WBCA, the number of parrots imported in the US declined from over 100,000 annually to only hundreds annually.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

The [[European Union]] placed a temporary ban on wild bird imports in October 2005 after imported birds died from the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 bird flu]]. The ban was made permanent in 2007, allowing only captive-bred birds from approved countries to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;

The Convention on International Trade protects certain endangered species by law, and prohibits them from being traded internationally. Several true parrots from the genus [[Ara (genus)|''Ara'']] ([[great green macaw]], [[blue-throated macaw]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[military macaw]]), are all protected under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.&lt;ref&gt;“Appendices 1,2, and 3” Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade in Mexico==
Although it is difficult to account for the exact number of birds trafficked each year, a comprehensive survey of parrot trappers by [[Defenders of Wildlife]], a national nonprofit organization in Mexico, estimates that anywhere from 65,000 to 78,500 birds are captured and traded annually. The same report indicates that [[Psittacidae]] populations have declined as much as 30% in Mexico over the past century due to a combination of habitat loss and overexploitation of the trade of these animals.&lt;ref name = Guzman&gt;

===History===
Although declining parrot populations in Mexico are a modern worry, the [[Psittacine]] trade is deeply rooted in the country’s history and culture. The [[Aztecs]] often kept parrots and macaws as pets, and their feathers were used to make ceremonial tokens. Smaller tribes taken over by the Aztec empire often provided their conquerors with Macaw feathers as a form of tribute and a symbol of submission.&lt;ref name = Guzman&gt;

===Illegal Trade Within Mexico===

The regulation of the parrot trade in Mexico has proven to be a problematic process. Until 2003, the parrot trade was authorized on a species by species basis. The number of species that could be legally trapped and sold had steadily declined since 1979, and in 2003 the [[Mexican government]] banned the trade of all Psittacines. However, in 2006 permits were once again issued for the capture and trade of select species. Although some trade in Psittacines was legal between 2006 and 2008, the absence of law enforcement for wildlife crimes meant that even trade in authorized species was usually perpetrated illegally.&lt;ref name = Guzman22&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2008, many parrots were captured and sold by bird trapper and salesman unions. These unions were often registered with the state, and agreed to terms that attempted to protect parrot populations in return for official trapping authorizations. Although these stipulations aimed to protect Psittacine populations, they proved to be largely ineffective in practice.&lt;ref name = Guzman33&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, federal law mandated that capture of authorized parrot species had to be performed inside [[Unidades de Manejo para la Conservación de la Vida Silvestre|UMA]]’s, or Wildlife Conservation, Management, and Sustainable Utilization Units, which are areas of land registered with the federal Office of wildlife regulated under a specific species management plan.&lt;ref name = Valdez1&gt;

The law also set quotas and other specific rules for trappers within these UMA’s. However, the Mexican wildlife law enforcement agency, PROFEPA, was too understaffed and underfunded to enforce these laws. It was not capable of monitoring each UMA for illicit activity. Instead, it visited a select group of predetermined UMA’s each year, and performed inspections of UMA’s where illegal activity had been reported.&lt;ref name = Guzman3&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 only 54 out of the 6,446 UMA’s in Mexico received visits from wildlife regulatory agencies. An absence of a concrete body of knowledge regarding Psitaccine populations and the activity of trappers within these areas meant that quotas were often exceeded and authorizations were bypassed. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that as much as 75% of the parrot trade, even in authorized species, was being perpetrated illegally.&lt;ref name = Guzman43&gt;

A 2006 report by Cantu et al. report demonstrated that the illegal trade of Psittacines actually ''increased'' when [[trapping]] was authorized by government agencies. This was because illegal activity was much more easily concealed under the auspices of legal trade.&lt;ref name = Guzman4&gt;

PROFEPA attempts to combat the illegal parrot trade using several methods including directly attending to reports regarding illegal activity; making scheduled inspections of markets, pet shops, zoos, and UMA’s; pinpointing identified locations for sale and transport; and patrolling ports, airports, and borders. However, these efforts do not make a significant impact. Much of PROFEPA’s enforcement activity is concentrated on the point of sale, but the high rate of mortality in trafficked parrots means that intervention efforts often occur too late to save the smuggled birds. The agency also lacks the resources to conduct raids on warehouses and markets that are used to store and sell parrots. Even when these operations can be implemented, PROFEPA is hindered by insiders who tip off the bird traders so that they can hide their animals before the raids occur. (new info, defenders, 54) Because of its ineffective system of management, it has been estimated that PROFEPA’s seizures of wildlife represent only 2% of the total annual Psittacine trade.&lt;ref name="Guzman53"&gt;{{cite report

===Solutions To Illegal Trade===

Today, the illegal parrot trade continues because it is a low risk, high reward criminal activity.&lt;ref name = Stephen&gt;

A 2006 report by Cantu. et al. is one of the only comprehensive and concentrated bodies of knowledge regarding the extent of the Psittacine trade in Mexico. This report is largely based on interviews with bird traders and union leaders, and attempts to organize data collected by a variety of Mexican agencies regarding the issue. However, the document is limited by a lack of concrete evidence specifically regarding the number of birds taken from the wild each year, and relies on interviews and speculation to fill in the gaps left by the absence of scientific data. It advocates for an increase in Psittacine [[population studies]] to regulate trade and to be able to formulate effective measures for reducing the exploitation of Psittacine populations.&lt;ref name="Clarkeandpires1"&gt;{{cite journal

Alternative forms of prevention were suggested in several different studies. A 2011 report by Pires and Moreto advocates a system of situational crime prevention in which enforcement is targeted on a community basis. They write, “…in areas where parrot poaching is concentrated, possible solutions to poaching include: removing ladders from trees, keeping a watch out by citizens/police during breeding periods, shutting down illegal pet markets, and [[CCTV]] for the most poached species.”&lt;ref name = Moreto1&gt;

A similar study by Pires and Clarke suggests that campaigns to build national pride for the Psitaccines of Mexico could be effective in lowering trafficking rates, but they acknowledge that the campaign may not be successful due to [[Mexico]]’s large urban population and diversity of parrot species. A more comprehensive and concrete suggestion, also by Pires and Clarke, is to promote and invest in ecotourist lodges that partner with local communities in order to conserve Psittacine populations by using them to attract tourists who stimulate the local economy. If these lodges were effective in providing adequate support to surrounding communities, it is foreseeable that the parrot trade in those areas would decrease as opportunistic trappers realize the value of psittacines as a [[natural resource]]. Need based trapping would decline as primary or secondary incomes would become dependent on the [[ecotourism]] business.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite report

'''''Law and the Modern Mind''''' is a 1930 book by [[Jerome Frank]] which argued that [[judicial decision]]s were more influenced by psychological factors than by objective legal premises.

Frank, then a legal academic, published the book after having undergone six months of [[psychoanalysis]]. In it, he argued against the "basic legal myth" that judges never make law but simply deduce legal conclusions from premises that are clear, certain, and substantially unchanging. Drawing on psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jean Piaget]], Frank proposed that judicial decisions were motivated primarily by the influence of psychological factors on the individual judge.&lt;ref name="Volkomer"&gt;Walter E. Volkomer, "Frank, Jerome N.", in Roger K. Newman, ed., ''The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law'' (2009), p. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his judicial hero, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], Frank urged judges and legal scholars to acknowledge openly the gaps and uncertainties in the law, and to think of law pragmatically as a tool for human betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Frank, ''Law and the Modern Mind''. New York: Anchor Books, 1963, pp. 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The book "dropped like a bombshell on the legal and academic world",&lt;ref name="Volkomer"/&gt; quickly becoming "a jurisprudential bestseller" which "was widely noticed as well as criticized".&lt;ref&gt;Lon Luvois Fuller, Thomas W. Bechtler, ''Law in a Social Context: Liber Amicorum Honouring Professor Lon L. Fuller'' (1978), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in the Universe}}

The speculation of life currently existing on [[Venus]] decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying Venus and it became clear that the conditions on Venus are extreme compared to those on Earth.

Venus's location closer to the [[Sun]] than [[Earth]] and the extreme [[greenhouse effect]] raising temperatures on the surface to nearly {{convert|735|K|C}}, and the atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth, make water-based [[life]] as we know it unlikely on the surface of the planet. However, a few scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic  [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]] might exist in the lower-temperature, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2843-acidic-clouds-of-venus-could-harbour-life.html|title=Acidic clouds of Venus could harbour life|work=New Scientist|first=Stuart|last=Clark|date=26 September 2003|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004).

==Historical views==

Until the mid 20th century, the surface environment of Venus was believed to be similar to Earth, and hence it was widely believed that Venus could harbor life.
In 1870, the British astronomer [[Richard Proctor]] said the existence of life on Venus was impossible near its equator,&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, Richard A., ''Other Worlds Than Ours: The Plurality of Worlds Studied Under the Light of Recent Scientific Researches''. New York : J.A. Hill and Co., 1870. s. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but possible near its poles.

Since the 1960s, increasingly clear evidence from various space probes showed Venus has an extreme climate, with a [[greenhouse effect]] generating a constant temperature of about 500&amp;nbsp;°C on the surface. The atmosphere contains [[sulfuric acid]] clouds and the atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 [[Bar (unit)|bar]], almost 100 times that of Earth and similar to that of more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in Earth's oceans. In such environment, and given the increasingly hostile characteristics of the Venusian weather, the chances of life as we know it are excluded from the surface of Venus.

In September 1967, Carl Sagan and Harold Morowitz published an analysis of the issue of life on Venus to the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Life on Venus|journal=Astrobiology|volume=11|issue=9|pages=931|via=Academic OneFile|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.9270|pmid=22059693|bibcode=2011AsBio..11..931M|year=2011|last1=Morowitz|first1=Harold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability of its atmosphere==
Although there is little possibility of existing life near the surface of Venus, the altitudes about 50&amp;nbsp;km above the surface have a mild temperature, and hence there are still some opinions in favor of such a possibility in the [[atmosphere of Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maik.ru/cgi-perl/search.pl?type=abstract&amp;name=solsys&amp;number=1&amp;year=12&amp;page=41  Venus as a Natural Laboratory for Search of Life in High Temperature Conditions: Events on the Planet on March 1, 1982], L.

In the analysis of mission data from the ''[[Venera program|Venera]]'', [[Pioneer Venus project|Pioneer Venus]] and ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' missions, it was discovered that [[carbonyl sulfide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] were present together in the upper atmosphere.

==Past habitability potential==
It is plausible that microbial life originated on Venus if liquid water existed on its surface prior to the heating of the planet by the [[runaway greenhouse effect]], but no longer exists.&lt;ref name= "Forbes"&gt;Bruce Dorminey, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/03/28/venus-likely-had-past-life-next-step-is-finding-it/ "Venus Likely Had Past Life; Next Step Is Finding It"], ''Forbes'', Mar 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming [[Origin of water on Earth|the process that delivered water to Earth]] was common to all the planets near the habitable zone, it has been estimated that liquid water could have existed on its surface for up to 600 million years during and shortly after the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which could be enough time for simple life to form, but this figure can vary from as little as a few million years to as much as few billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Venus_Express/Was_Venus_once_a_habitable_planet |title=Was Venus once a habitable planet? |date=24 June 2010 |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/67240/was-venus-once-a-waterworld/ |title=Was Venus once a waterworld? |date=24 June 2010 |author=Nancy Atkinson |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/283-venus-alive-signs.html |title=Was Venus Alive?

The '''[[Medical Research Council (UK)]] Human Genetics Unit''' is situated at the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. It is one of the largest MRC research establishments, housing over two hundred scientists, support staff, research fellows, PhD students, and visiting workers.

==Directors==
* 1956 - 1969 Dr Michael Court Brown
* 1969 - 1994 Professor John Evans
* 1994 - 2015 Professor [[Nicholas Hastie|Professor N Hastie]]
* 2015–Present [[Wendy Bickmore|Professor W Bickmore]]

==Sections==
The Human Genetics Unit is divided into three sections:

Biomedical Genomics
-Research harnesses the power of large genome-size and population data to reveal the complex nature of disease processes.
Section Head: Professor Chris Ponting

Genome Regulation
-Research focuses on mechanisms that maintain the stability of the genome between cells and between generations, regulate the expression of genes and how changes to these contribute to disease.
Section Head: Professor Javier Caceres

Disease Mechanisms
-Research aims to understand how changes in our genomes cause disease by studying patients and families as well as model organisms.
Joint Section Heads: Professor David FitzPatrick and Professor Ian Jackson

==Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (IGMM)==
In 2007 the Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with two neighbouring research centres on the Western General Hospital campus, the [http://www.cgem.ed.ac.uk/ Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine] ([[University of Edinburgh]]) and the [http://www.ecrc.ed.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre] ([[Cancer Research UK]]), to create the [http://www.igmm.ac.uk/ Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine]. The Human Genetics Unit officially became part of the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 2011. The three partner centres comprising the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine were linked with a new building in 2015.

[[File:Dirck Hals - Merry Company at Table - WGA11040.jpg|thumb|[[Dirck Hals]], ''Merry Company at Table'', 1627–29]]

'''Merry company''' is the term in [[art history]] for a painting, usually from the 17th century, showing a small group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making.  These scenes are a very common type of [[genre painting]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]]; it is estimated that nearly two thirds of Dutch genre scenes show people drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, II, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is the usual translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''geselschapje'',&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt; or ''vrolijk gezelschap'', and is capitalized when used as a title for a work, and sometimes as a term for the type. The scenes may be set in the home, a garden, or a tavern, and the gatherings range from decorous groups in wealthy interiors to groups of drunk men with prostitutes.  Gatherings that are relatively decorous and expensively dressed, with similar numbers of men and women, often standing, may be called ''Elegant Company'' or ''Gallant Company'', while those showing people who are clearly [[peasant]]s are more likely to use that word in their title.  Such subjects in painting are most common in Dutch art between about 1620 and 1670.

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Honthorst, Gerard van - Merry Company - 1623.jpg|thumb|right|Prostitution is clearly indicated in this scene by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] of 1623, complete with aged procuress, low cleavage, and a feathered headdress on the second girl.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Franits, 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
[[File:A merry company in a taverne Abraham II van den Hecke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abraham van den Hecken]], ''A Merry Company in a Tavern'', 1640s]]

The definition of a "merry company" is far from rigid, and overlaps with several other types of painting. Portraits of family groups or bodies such as militia companies may borrow an informal style of composition from them, but works where the figures were intended to represent specific individuals are excluded.  There are normally between four and about a dozen figures shown, which typically includes both men and women, but may just consist of men, perhaps with female servants, as in the Buytewech illustrated. Contemporary Dutch descriptions of paintings from inventories, auction catalogues and the like, use (no doubt somewhat arbitrarily) other terms for similar compositions including "a ''buitenpartij'' (an outdoor party or picnic), a ''cortegaarddje'' (a barrack-room or '''guardroom scene'''), a ''borddeeltjen'' (a bordello scene), and a ''beeldeken'' or ''moderne beelden'' (a picture with little figures or modern figures)".&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Musical party" or "concert" is often used when some of the main figures are playing instruments.  More generally such works may be referred to as "company paintings" or  "company subjects" (but this is not to be confused with Indian [[Company painting]], a style patronized by the [[British East India Company]]).  Few if any titles used for 17th century genre paintings can be traced to the artist; those used by museums and art historians today may derive from a record in the [[provenance]] or be made up in modern times.

Paintings showing specific celebrations such as weddings or the festivities for [[Twelfth Night]], the main mid-winter celebration in the Netherlands, or the playing of specific games, are likely to have titles relating to these where the subject is still clear.  For example, a painting by [[Godfried Schalcken]] (1665–1670, [[Royal Collection]]) is known from his biography by his pupil [[Arnold Houbraken]] to represent ''The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden''', and is so titled, although the rules of this are now unknown but "clearly involved the removal of clothes", at least by some male participants.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 147; [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=12516&amp;object=405343&amp;row=1 "The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden'"], Royal Collection online&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''La Main Chaud'' ("the hot hand") male participants just got smacked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/follower-of-hieronymus-janssens-ladies-and-gentlemen-playing-la-main-chaude ''Ladies and Gentlemen playing La Main Chaude''], National Gallery, London. The game is shown in other paintings, including two by [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] with peasants. In the variant described at Schama, 439, it is the "rump" that gets smacked.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paintings showing the [[parable of the Prodigal Son]] in his prodigal phase are conceived as merry company scenes of the brothel type, though they are often larger, as was expected of a [[history painting]].

==Interpretation==
As with other types of Netherlandish genre painting, the body of merry company paintings include some with a clear moralistic intention, carrying a message to avoid excess in drink, lavish spending, low company and fornication.  Others seem merely to celebrate the pleasures of sociability, often with a socially aspirational element.  Many fall somewhere in between, are hard to interpret, and "contain within them an obvious contradiction between their goal of condemning certain types of excessive behaviour and the amusing and attractive aspect of this very behaviour and its representation".&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Vergara, "The Subject Matter of Paintings of Domestic Interiors" in ''Vermeer and the Dutch Interior'', 2003, (orig. ''Vermeer y El Interior Holandes''), excerpted at [http://www.essentialvermeer.com/dutch-painters/dutch_art/subject_matter.html www.essentialvermeer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Jacob Ochtervelt - Musical Company in an Interior - WGA16621.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob Ochtervelt]], ''Musical Company in an Interior'', c. 1670]]

Often the art historian wishing to interpret them has first to decide such questions as whether the scene is placed in a home, a tavern or a brothel, and if a tavern whether the women present are respectable or prostitutes, or whether the artist had a intention to convey definite meaning to his contemporary viewers on these questions at all.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 20, 68–69, 78–82, 106–107, 124, 201; van de Pol; Schama, 462–464; Webster&lt;/ref&gt;  The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between "[[tavern]]s" or "[[inn]]s" and "[[brothel]]s", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: "Inn in front; brothel behind" was a Dutch [[proverb]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mira, "On Diderot's Art Criticism", [http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf p. 123] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134904/http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes with prostitutes do not reflect the realities of 17th century prostitution in many ways, but offer a conventionalized visual code.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 466–480; van de Pol; Franits, 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;  The madam or (as art historians like to call them) "procuress" is always an aged crone, whereas court records for [[Amsterdam]] (the national centre for Dutch prostitution) show that most were still fairly young, and 40% in their twenties.&lt;ref&gt;van de Pol, 40% is Amsterdam 1650–99; Schama, 477&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of a procuress figure is by itself sufficient to justify interpreting a painting as a brothel scene.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 20, 177&lt;/ref&gt; Fine clothes (rented from the madam) and in particular feathers in headresses are said to be signifiers of prostitutes,&lt;ref&gt;van de Pol&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the more obvious loosened clothes, low cleavages, and a provocative frontal stance. But in the later part of the century demure downcast looks by the woman feature in many scenes thought to represent prostitution;&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 106–107, 124, 201&lt;/ref&gt; in the famously ambiguous threesome ''[[The Gallant Conversation]]'' by [[Gerard ter Borch]], the young woman is seen only from behind.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;  Of one painting by [[Jacob Ochtervelt]], (c. 1670, now Cleveland, illustrated at left) Wayne Franits says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At first glance, the ''Musical Company in an Interior'' appears to be an elegant gathering of well-heeled youths [and women and a servant]... The picture exudes an aura of calmness and finesse.  Nevertheless, the series of female portraits on the wall behind the figures discloses the true nature of its subject.  There is strong evidence that actual brothels displayed portraits like these to assist clients in selecting their partners.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 201; the pictures are high on the back wall and not easy to make out in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Simon de Vos - Merrymakers in an Inn - Walters 371741.jpg|thumb|[[Simon de Vos]], 1630s; according to the owning museum "Well-bred young ladies did not join parties in public inns; these smiling women are prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/23727 ''Merrymakers at an Inn''], [[Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to [[Simon Schama]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when we are unsure whether we are looking at a picture of a home or a tavern, or whether what seems to be a tavern is actually a brothel, it may not be because we lack hard-and-fast clues to the artist's unambiguous intention, but because he meant us to be unsure. ... It would be futile to attempt to distinguish between scenes of good homely fun and public-house dissipation, because the figurative and actual territories were themselves deliberately mixed up. Where goings-on take place in a household or, conversely, children run around with gleeful worldliness in a tavern, there is a good chance that the picture is about the conmingling of innocence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 462–463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jan Steen]] owned a tavern for a period, living on the premises, and often included portraits of himself and members of his family in "genre" works.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 463; Slive, 169-171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], who painted several scenes that, like the one illustrated here, clearly do show prostitution, married the daughter of the proprietress of a tavern and a wine merchant, who was a distant cousin and something of an heiress.  The traditional interpretation and title of his ''Prodigal Son'' in [[Munich]] has been challenged, with the assertion that it merely shows a "festive" tavern scene, despite the presence of an older woman and feathers in the girls' hair, often taken as diagnostic of a brothel scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, I, 328–329; [[:File:Gerard van Honthorst 004.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Duck-scène-galante.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob Duck]], 1635-40]]
[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - The Prodigal Son - WGA11660.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] ''Prodigal Son''.]]

Elmer Kolfin, in "the first comprehensive study to date on the merry company in Dutch art during the first half of the seventeenth century" divides the pictures "into three iconographic categories: "idealistic", which present mainly positive views of the festive activities depicted; "moralistic", in which such activities are condemned from a moral point of view; and "satirical", in which they are held up for ridicule, but chiefly for comic rather than moralizing effect" seeing a movement away from moralistic to idealistic treatments from the 16th to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nevitt, reviewing Kolfin&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars see a large group of paintings as deliberately ambiguous or open in their meaning; the limited evidence we have suggests they were often displayed in the main rooms of their owners' houses.&lt;ref&gt;Nevitt; Webster; Schama, 461–464&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptional freedom allowed to Dutch women amazed and usually horrified foreign visitors; according to the visiting Englishman [[Fynes Moryson]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... mothers of good fame permit their daughters at home after they themselves go to bed, to sit up with young men all or most part of the night, banqueting and talking, yea with leave and without leave to walk abroad with young men in the streets by night.  And this they do out of a customed liberty without prejudice to their fame whereas the Italian women, strictly kept, think it folly to omit every opportunity they can get to do ill".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Schama, 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many paintings have lightly worn allegorical schemes; a plate of food, tobacco pipe, musical instrument and a squeeze, kiss or slap will be enough to make any group into an ''Allegory of the Five Senses''.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 27, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Many may illustrate the endless supply of moralistic Dutch proverbs.

==Development of the type==
[[File:Jan van Hemessen - The Prodigal Son - WGA11358.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jan van Hemessen]], ''The Prodigal Son'', 1536]]

Courtly party scenes, typically of couples of young lovers in a "garden of love", were popular in the late Middle Ages, mostly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[old master print|prints]] rather than [[panel painting]]s, and often as part of calendar series showing the months, or book illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/merry-company/hgHsn_TInoCy4g?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en-gb "Merry Company"], Istvan Nemeth, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, for Google Cultural Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Renaissance such scenes tended to be given specific settings from religion or classical mythology, such as the ''[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]'' which, unlike merry company scenes, was an excuse for copious amounts of nudity.  In 16th century [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]] traditions of genre painting of festivities or parties began to develop, most famously in the peasant scenes of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], which were the first large paintings to have peasant life as their sole subject. 

There was also a tradition of moralizing urban scenes, including subjects such as the "Ill-matched Couple" and "Prodigal Son",&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 68–69, 72–75; van de Pol&lt;/ref&gt; and a court tradition of recording actual or typical entertainments at a particular court, with portraits of the leading personages.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 151, and more generally the "Festival book" and related traditions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist]]'' by the German-[[Silesia]]n artist [[Bartholomeus Strobel]] (c. 1630-43, [[Prado]]) is an exceptionally large treatment of a subject often used since the 15th century to depict a courtly banquet. ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' by [[Paolo Veronese]] (1573, [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], [[Venice]]) is another famous and huge treatment of a grand feast.

The "courtly company scene" with anonymous genre figures developed in the first years of the 17th century in both the Northern and Southern Netherlands, now separated by the [[Eighty Years War]].  As the subject type developed, so did differences between the two regions: Flemish painting covered a wider range of settings in terms of class, with peasant scenes remaining strongly represented, and many scenes showing court milieus.  Dutch painting concentrated on a class spectrum that might all be called middle-class, though ranging from elegant patrician companies to scruffy and rowdy groups.  Flemish scenes tend to have far more characters, and the tranquil middle class group of four or five people sitting round a table at home is not seen.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most Dutch paintings, except for those by the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], had small figures, the "monumental company scene" remained part of Flemish painting, with [[Jacob Jordaens]] producing several examples, especially of Twelfth Night festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 166–171&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1630s artists in both regions, but especially the north, tended to specialize in particular genres, and the merry company was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 7-8; Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of Dutch painters included [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]] (1591/1592–1624), who can claim to have invented the small interior merry company,&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125–126; [https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/merry-company/hgHsn_TInoCy4g?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en-gb Google art project, Budapest example]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early artists were [[David Vinckboons]] (1576–1629),&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 124–125; Franits, 53–57&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587–1630), who was an even more significant pioneer of realistic [[landscape painting]], in a completely different style to his elegant garden parties.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125; 180–183&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous portraitist [[Frans Hals]] was attributed with a single very early merry company, a gallant picnic of about 1610, which was destroyed in [[Berlin]] in World War II;&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123–125&lt;/ref&gt; he also painted a "close-up" genre depiction of three revellers.&lt;ref&gt;Liedke, 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;  His younger brother [[Dirck Hals]] (1591–1656) was a prolific specialist in small merry company groups.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 1630 active painters included [[Hendrik Gerritsz. Pot]] (1587–1657), also a portraitist, [[Anthonie Palamedesz.]] (1601–1673), [[Pieter Codde]] (1599–1678), and [[Jacob Duck]] (1600–1667). Codde and Duck, with [[Willem Duyster]], were also painters of "guardroom scenes", which showed soldiers specifically, and became popular in the 1630s; as Lucy van de Pol notes, the sailors who made up a great part of the clientele of taverns and brothels, at least in Amsterdam, are very rarely represented.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 126, 131–133; van de Pol; Franits, 57–64; Rosen covers the guardroom scene very fully&lt;/ref&gt;  

After about the mid-century many "company paintings" showed smaller and more quiet groups more firmly located in homes, often with more narrative elements and a greater concentration on effects of lighting and texture.  Pictures showing many of the same interests as "company" works, but just using couples or individuals become very common.  The paintings of [[Vermeer]], none of which quite fall into the category of "merry company" works, exemplify this trend, which is also seen in those of [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Gerrit Dou]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Franits and Slive on these artists, via indices&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of [[Jan Steen]] (c. 1626–1679) maintained the tradition of rowdy drinking groups, but usually with a setting showing a specific occasion, or illustrating a proverb. Many show family groups, and often a self-portrait is included.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 169–176; Franits, 203–214&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:El Jardín del Amor (Rubens) (alta resolución).jpg|thumb|[[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'', 1630–35, the apotheosis of the outdoor courtly company]]

Flemish artists include [[David Vinckboons]], who moved to the north as a young adult, [[Frans Francken II]] with [[Hieronymus Francken I|his uncle Hieronymus I]] and [[Hieronymus Francken II|brother Hieronymus II]], [[Sebastian Vrancx]], [[Louis de Caullery]], all painting courtly scenes, often with small figures and much attention given to the architectural settings in or outside sumptuous palaces. [[Simon de Vos]] (1603–1676), painted smaller scenes closer to the Dutch style.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruegel tradition of peasant scenes was continued by his sons [[Jan Brueghel I]] and [[Peter Brueghel the Younger]], mostly painting ''[[Kermesse (festival)|kermesse]]''-type festivities with large numbers of figures, most often outdoors.  Smaller groups in interiors were pioneered by the intensely naturalistic [[Adriaen Brouwer]], who was Flemish but also worked and sold in [[Haarlem]] in the north, where he greatly influenced [[Adriaen van Ostade]], the leading Dutch painter of peasants.  Brouwer's sordid scenes are short on merriment, but van Ostade softened and sentimentalized his style.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 149–150, 154–159, 162; Slive, 133–137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Teniers the Elder]], his son [[David Teniers the Younger]] as well as other members of the family included many peasant scenes in their large and varied output.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the works of all these painters lie outside the typical boundaries of the "merry company", in terms of the number of figures or their class, but many fall within; there was also a later generation of Flemish painters of peasant scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 162–166&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]], who owned 17 paintings by Adriaen Brouwer, painted a few ''kermesse'' and other peasant scenes that are highly successful, despite their very heroic style.  He also painted a few large courtly company scenes, including his ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'', ([[Prado]], 1634-5).&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 152, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Jordaens and Rubens, Flemish painters of monumental company scenes included [[Theodoor Rombouts]] (1597–1637), who made several large paintings of card-players, [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Jan Cossiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 167–171&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mold health issues''' are potentially harmful effects of [[mold]]s.

Molds (US usage; British English "moulds") are ubiquitous in the biosphere, and mold [[spores]] are a common component of household and workplace dust. The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that "excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=A spreading concern: inhalational health effects of mold |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=A300–5 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17589582 |pmc=1892134 |doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a300}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are present in abnormally high quantities, they can present especially hazardous health risks to humans after prolonged exposure, including allergic reactions or poisoning by [[mycotoxin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality: Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or causing fungal infection ([[mycosis]]).

==Health effects==

Studies have shown that people who are [[atopic]] (sensitive), already suffer from [[allergies]], [[asthma]], or compromised [[immune system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa Conrad|title=Mold Exposure|website=medicinenet.com|date=July 16, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mold_exposure/page2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory and toxic responses to mold spores, metabolites and other components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elisabeth |last1=Heseltine |first2=Jerome |last2=Rosen, ed.|title=WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: dampness and mould|year= 2009 |page=93| ISBN= 978 92 890 4168 3 |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common health problem is an allergic reaction. Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], allergic alveolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. Severe reactions are rare but possible. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure and the type of mold or mold products.

Some molds also produce [[mycotoxins]] that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. The term "toxic mold" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'', not to all molds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19854819| year = 2009| author1 = Empting| first1 = L. D.| title = Neurologic and neuropsychiatric syndrome features of mold and mycotoxin exposure| journal = Toxicology and Industrial Health| volume = 25| issue = 9–10| pages = 577–81| doi = 10.1177/0748233709348393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure, e.g., daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.

The five most common genera of indoor molds are ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Alternaria]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]''.

Damp environments which allow mold to grow can also produce bacteria and help release [[volatile organic compounds]].

===Symptoms of mold exposure===
Symptoms of mold exposure can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnesota Department of Health|title=Mold and Moisture in Homes|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/|publisher=Minnesota North Star|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Nasal and sinus congestion, runny nose
*Respiratory problems, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing, chest tightness
*Cough
*Throat irritation
*Sneezing / Sneezing fits

==== Health effects linking to asthma ====
Infants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called Penicillium. Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and/or wheeze. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life.  Studies have shown that a correlation exists between the probability of developing asthma and increased exposure to ''Penicillium''. The levels are deemed ‘no mold’  to ‘low level’, from ‘low’  to ‘intermediate’, and from ‘intermediate’  to ‘high’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gent|first=Janneane|title=Levels of Household Mold Associated with Respiratory Symptoms in the First Year of Life in a Cohort at Risk for Asthma|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241132/pdf/ehp0110-a00781.pdf|journal= Environ Health Perspect|accessdate=November 18, 2011|pmc=1241132|pmid=12460818|volume=110|pages=A781-6|doi=10.1289/ehp.021100781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold exposures have a variety of health effects depending on the person. Some people are more sensitive to mold than others. Exposure to mold can cause a number of health issues such as; throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing, as well as skin irritation in some cases.  Exposure to mold may also cause heightened sensitivity depending on the time and nature of exposure.  People at higher risk for mold allergies are people with chronic lung illnesses, which will result in more severe reactions when exposed to mold.

There has been sufficient evidence that damp indoor environments are correlated with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, and wheezing in people with asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Aaron|title=WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood specific mold health effects===
Among children and adolescents, the most common health effect post-flooding was lower respiratory tract symptoms though there was a lack of association with measurements of total fungi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabito|first=Felicia A.|last2=Iqbal|first2=Shahed|last3=Kiernan|first3=Michael P.|last4=Holt|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Chew|first5=Ginger L.|title=Children's respiratory health and mold levels in New Orleans after Katrina: A preliminary look|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091674907022609|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=121|issue=3|pages=622–625|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that these respiratory symptoms were positively associated with exposure to water damaged homes, exposure included being inside without participating in clean up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite lower respiratory effects among all children, there was a significant difference in health outcomes between children with pre-existing conditions and children without.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Children with pre-existing conditions were at greater risk that can likely be attributed to the greater disruption of care in the face of flooding and natural disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Health effects in children and adolescents with chronic risk were also found to be at an increased risk of adverse outcomes following a natural disaster including diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, allergies, HIV/AIDS, other immune disease, heart defects, cystic fibrosis, depression, seizure disorders, Sickle Cell disease, kidney failure, and liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=Barbara|last2=Donato|first2=Jessica|last3=Duggan|first3=Alyson|last4=Perrin|first4=Keith|last5=Bronfin|first5=Daniel R.|last6=Ratard|first6=Raoult|last7=VanDyke|first7=Russell|last8=Magnus|first8=Manya|date=2007-05-01|title=Adverse Health Outcomes after Hurricane Katrina among Children and Adolescents with Chronic Conditions|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/214414|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=2|pages=405–417|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0043|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mold is the primary focus post flooding for residents, the effects of dampness alone must also be considered. According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a significant association between dampness in the home and wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendell|first=Mark J.|last2=Mirer|first2=Anna G.|last3=Cheung|first3=Kerry|last4=Tong|first4=My|last5=Douwes|first5=Jeroen|title=Respiratory and Allergic Health Effects of Dampness, Mold, and Dampness-Related Agents: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1002410|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en-US|volume=119|issue=6|pages=748–756|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002410}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later analysis determined that 30% to 50% of asthma-related health outcomes are associated with not only mold, but also dampness in buildings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another health effect associated with dampness and mold is Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), which is defined by manifestations of symptomatic illness as a result of poor indoor air quality and pollutant exposures .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Signs of potentially illness-causing buildings include condensation on the windows, high humidity in the bathrooms, a moldy odor, or water leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyanwu|first=Ebere C.|last2=Campbell|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Vojdani|first3=Aristo|title=Neurophysiological Effects of Chronic Indoor Environmental Toxic Mold Exposure on Children|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2003.22|journal=The Scientific World Journal|language=en|volume=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1100/tsw.2003.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a proven correlation between mold exposure and the development of upper and lower respiratory syndromes, there are still fewer incidences of negative health effect than one might expect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbeau|first=Deborah N.|last2=Grimsley|first2=L. Faye|last3=White|first3=LuAnn E.|last4=El-Dahr|first4=Jane M.|last5=Lichtveld|first5=Maureen|date=2010-03-01|title=Mold Exposure and Health Effects Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=31|issue=1|pages=165–178|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643|issn=0163-7525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barbeau and colleagues suggested that studies do not show a greater impact from mold exposure for a number of reasons: 1) the types of health effects are not severe and are therefore not caught; 2) people whose homes have flooded find alternative housing to prevent exposure; 3) self-selection, the healthier people participated in mold clean-up and were less likely to get sick; 4) exposures were time-limited as result of remediation efforts and; 5) the lack of access to health care post-flooding may result in fewer illnesses being discovered and reported for their association with mold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are also certain notable scientific limitations in studying the exposure effects of molds on individuals because there are currently no known biomarkers that can prove that a person has been exposed to molds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molds, Toxic Molds, and Indoor Air Quality|last=Davis|first=Pamela|publisher=California State Library|year=2001|isbn=1-58703-133-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is currently impossible to prove correlation between mold exposure and symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Mold-associated conditions ==
Health problems associated with high levels of airborne [[mold spore]]s include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date =November 8, 2005  |title = Mold: A Health Hazard (Release #1605-096) | url= http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=20379  | publisher= FEMA | accessdate= September 25, 2007 }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2010}} [[allergic reaction]]s, [[asthma]] episodes, irritations of the eye, nose and throat, [[Sinus cavity|sinus]] congestion, and other respiratory problems, although it should be noted that mold spores won't actually cause asthma, just irritate existing conditions.  For example, residents of homes with mold are at an elevated risk for both respiratory infections and bronchitis.&lt;ref name="Fisk 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisk WJ, Eliseeva EA, Mendell MJ |title=Association of residential dampness and mold with respiratory tract infections and bronchitis: a meta-analysis |journal=Environ Health |volume=9 |pages=72 |year=2010 |pmid=21078183 |pmc=3000394 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-9-72 |url=http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9//72}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are inhaled by an [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromise]]d individual, some mold spores may begin to grow on living tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Müller FM, Seidler M |title=Characteristics of pathogenic fungi and antifungal therapy in cystic fibrosis |journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=957–64 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20695750 |doi=10.1586/eri.10.72 |url=http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/eri.10.72?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; attaching to cells along the [[respiratory tract]] and causing further problems.&lt;ref&gt;Simicic S, Matos T, “Microbiological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.” Zdravnisji vestnik-slovanian medical journal. 2010, Vol. 79, Issue 10, p. 716-725.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erol S |title=Nosocomial aspergillosis: epidemiology and control |language=Turkish |journal=Mikrobiyol Bul |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=323–38 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20549969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, when this occurs, the illness is an [[epiphenomenon]] and not the primary pathology. Also, mold may produce mycotoxins, either before or after exposure to humans, potentially causing toxicity.

===Fungal infection===

A serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic [[mycosis]]).

===Mold-induced hypersensitivity===
The most common form of [[hypersensitivity]] is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or [[hypha]]l fragments which can lead to [[allergic asthma]] or [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref name="Indian"&gt;Indian Health Service: Bemidji Area Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Environmental Health Services Section “Guideline on the Assessment and Remediation of Fungi in Indoor Environments”&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common effects are [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and [[asthma|asthma attacks]].  Another form of hypersensitivity is [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]].  Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings.&lt;ref name="Indian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hp/hp_summary.html |title=What Is Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis? |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 12762072| year = 2003| last1 = Hardin | first1 = B.

Hypersensitivity may also be a reaction toward an established fungal infection in [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]].

===Mycotoxin toxicity===
{{Main|Mycotoxin}}
Molds excrete toxic compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reverberi M, Ricelli A, Zjalic S, Fabbri AA, Fanelli C |title=Natural functions of mycotoxins and control of their biosynthesis in fungi |journal=Appl.

Extreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Prolonged exposure, such as daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The health hazards produced by mold have been associated with [[sick building syndrome]], but no validated studies have been able to demonstrate that normal indoor exposures to these common organisms pose a significant threat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that all molds may produce [[mycotoxins]] and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals only when exposure is high enough, [[The dose makes the poison|as with absolutely all other substances]].

Mycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows.  Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation.

Some mycotoxins cause immune system responses that vary considerably, depending on the individual. The duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the concentration of the insult (exposure) are elements in triggering immune system response.

[[Aflatoxin]] is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.&lt;ref name=fsis&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/molds-on-food-are-they-dangerous_/ United States Food Safety and Inspection Service &gt; Molds On Food: Are They Dangerous?] Last Modified: August 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] from mold were thought to be the result of exposure to the [[mycotoxin]]s of some mold species, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]''.  However, studies are suggesting that the so-called toxic effects are actually the result of chronic activation of the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Studies indicate that up to 25% of the population have the genetic capability of experiencing chronic inflammation to mold exposure, but it is unknown how many actually experience such symptoms due to frequent misdiagnosis.  A 1993–94 [[case study]] based on cases of [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] in infants in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] originally concluded there was [[Causality|causal relationship]] between the exposure and the disease.  The investigators revisited the cases and established that there was no link to the exposure to ''S. chartrum'' and the infants in their homes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The common house mold, ''[[Trichoderma longibrachiatum]]'', produces small toxic peptides containing amino acids not found in common proteins, like alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, called trilongins (up to 10% w/w). Their toxicity is due to absorption into cells and production of nano-channels that obstruct vital [[ion channels]] that ferry potassium and sodium ions across the [[cell membrane]]. This affects in the cells [[action potential]] profile, as seen in [[cardiomyocytes]], [[pneumocytes]] and [[neurons]] leading to conduction defects. Trilongins are highly resistant to heat and [[antimicrobials]] making [[primary prevention]] the only management option.&lt;ref&gt;Reason Discovered for the Toxicity of Indoor Mould – ScienceDaily (Oct. 12, 2012) : https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121012074655.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;20-Residue and 11-residue peptaibols from the fungus Trichoderma longibrachiatum are synergistic in forming Na+/K+-permeable channels and adverse action towards mammalian cells      Raimo Mikkola1,†,     Maria A.

== Exposure sources and prevention ==
The main sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth, and from ingestion of food with mold growths.

===Air===
{{Main|Indoor air quality}}
Prevention of mold exposure and its ensuing health issues begins with prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment such as humid air. Extensive flooding and water damage can support extensive mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than {{convert|3|ft|m}} of indoor flooding, demonstrated higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbeau DN, Grimsley LF, White LE, [[Jane El-Dahr|El-Dahr JM]], Lichtveld M |title=Mold exposure and health effects following hurricanes Katrina and Rita |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=31 |pages=165–78 |year=2010 |pmid=20070193 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoemaker RC, House DE |title=Sick building syndrome (SBS) and exposure to water-damaged buildings: time series study, clinical trial and mechanisms |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17010568 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2006.07.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-0362(06)00085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of a hurricane is the worst-case scenario, but the concept of water damage supporting widespread mold growth is more generally applicable.

It is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels.&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kumar, Manisha |author2=Verma, Rajesh K |title=Fungi diversity, their effects on building materials, occupants and control– a brief review |journal=Journal of Scientific and industrial Research |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=657–661 |date=September 2010 |url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/10103 |issn=0975-1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wilson SC, Holder WH, Easterwood KV, etal |title=Identification, remediation, and monitoring processes used in a mold-contaminated high school |journal=Adv.

A common issue with mold hazards in the household is the placement of furniture, and the lack of ventilation which this causes to certain parts of the wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in a home so affected is to move the furniture in question.

Adverse respiratory health effects are associated with occupancy in buildings with moisture and mold damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krieger J, Jacobs DE, Ashley PJ, etal |title=Housing interventions and control of asthma-related indoor biologic agents: a review of the evidence |journal=J Public Health Manag Pract |volume=16 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S11–20 |year=2010 |pmid=20689369 |doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e3181ddcbd9 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1078-4659&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=S11|pmc=3934496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques.  Sometimes these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as "ergonomic odors" meaning the odors are detectable, but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.

===Food===
[[File:Moldy nectarines.jpg|thumb|Moldy [[nectarine]]s that were in a refrigerator. The nectarine with black mold is also affecting the nectarine underneath.]]
Molds that are often found on meat and poultry include members of the genera ''[[Alternaria]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', [[Botryotinia|''Botrytis'']], ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Geotrichum]]'', ''[[Mortierella]]'', ''[[Mucor]]'', ''[[Neurospora]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', and ''[[Rhizopus]]''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt;  Grain crops in particular incur considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens, post-harvest spoilage, and insect damage. A number of common microfungi are important agents of post-harvest spoilage, notably members of the genera ''Aspergillus'', ''Fusarium'', and ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt; A number of these produce mycotoxins (soluble, non-volatile toxins produced by a range of microfungi that demonstrate specific and potent toxic properties on human and animal cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kankolongo M, Hell K, Nawa I |title=Assessment for fungal, mycotoxin and insect spoilage in maize stored for human consumption in Zambia |journal=J.

Dietary exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, commonly produced by growth of the fungus ''Aspergillus flavus'' on improperly stored ground nuts in many areas of the developing world, is known to independently (and synergistically with Hepatitis B virus) induce liver cancer.&lt;ref name=liu2010/&gt; Mycotoxin-contaminated grain and other food products have a significant impact on human and animal health globally. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 25% of the world's food may be contaminated by mycotoxins.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;

Prevention of mold exposure from food is generally to consume food that has no mold growths on it.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt; Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of [[mold growth, assessment, and remediation]] that prevents air exposure. In addition, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator, and to ensure dishcloths, towels, sponges and mops are clean.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt;

Ruminants are considered to have increased resistance to some mycotoxins, presumably due to the superior mycotoxin-degrading capabilities of their gut microbiota.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;  The passage of mycotoxins through the food chain may also have important consequences on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tanuma H, Hiramatsu M, Mukai H, etal |title=Case report.

=== Flooding ===
Flooding in houses causes a unique opportunity for mold growth which may be attributed to adverse health effects in people exposed to the mold, especially children and adolescents. In a study on the health effects of mold exposure after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the predominant types of mold were ''[[Aspergillus]], [[Penicillium|Penicillum]]'', and ''[[Cladosporium]]'' with indoor spore counts ranging from 6,142 – 735,123 spores&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Molds isolated following flooding were different from mold previously reported for non-water damaged homes in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research found that homes with greater than three feet of indoor flooding demonstrated significantly higher levels of mold than those with little or no flooding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Mitigation ====

Recommended strategies to prevent mold include: avoiding mold-contamination; utilization of environmental controls; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including skin and eye protection and respiratory protection; and environmental controls such as ventilation and suppression of dust.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Mary|last2=Brown|first2=Clive|last3=Burkhart|first3=Joe|last4=Burton|first4=Nancy|last5=Cox-Ganser|first5=Jean|last6=Damon|first6=Scott|last7=Falk|first7=Henry|last8=Fridkin|first8=Scott|last9=Garbe|first9=Paul|date=2006|title=Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods|jstor=24842334|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Recommendations and Reports|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1–CE–4|doi=10.2307/24842334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mold cannot be prevented, the CDC recommends clean-up protocol including first taking emergency action to stop water intrusion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Second, they recommend determining the extent of water damage and mold contamination. And third, they recommend planning remediation activities such as establishing containment and protection for workers and occupants; eliminating water or moisture sources if possible; decontaminating or removing damaged materials and drying any wet materials; evaluating whether the space has been successfully remediated; and reassembling the space to control sources of moisture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== History ==
In the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' was found growing on wet grain used for animal feed.  Illness and death also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals that were heavily overgrown with the ''Stachybotrys'' mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=JD|last2=Rand|first2=TG|last3=Jarvis|first3=BB|title=Stachybotrys chartarum: cause of human disease or media darling?|journal=Medical mycology|date=August 2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=271–91|doi=10.1080/1369378031000137350|pmid=12964721|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369378031000137350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, building [[construction]] techniques changed in response to changing economic realities including the [[energy crisis]]. As a result, homes and buildings became more airtight.  Also, cheaper materials such as [[drywall]] came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures making moisture problems more prevalent.  This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Today, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] and the agriculture industry closely monitor mold and mycotoxin levels in grains and foodstuffs in order to keep the contamination of animal feed and human food supplies below specific levels. In 2005 [[Diamond Pet Foods]], a US pet food manufacturer, experienced a significant rise in the number of corn shipments containing elevated levels of [[aflatoxin]].

== Policy ==
While there is a national policy regarding mold, each state is responsible for independently creating and administering their own policy. For example, following Hurricane Harvey, the governor of Texas sought to expand the emergency response to allow mold remediation companies to come from out of state.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bouldercounty.org/disasters/flood/health/mold-remediation/|title=Mold Remediation After a Flood|work=Boulder County|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2003-11-27 Northerner boots in mud.jpg|thumb|300px|A pair of muddy [[boots]]]]
'''Mud''' is a liquid or semi-liquid mixture of [[water]] and any combination of different kinds of [[soil]] ([[loam]], [[silt]], and [[clay]]). It usually forms after rainfall or near water sources. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as [[shale]] or [[mudstone]] (generally called [[lutite]]s). When geological deposits of mud are formed in [[estuaries]], the resultant layers are termed [[bay mud]]s.

== Building and construction ==
[[File:Punjabi Home.JPG|thumb|250|Mud plastered home in Pakistan]]
[[File:Fortaleza de Bam, Irán, 2016-09-23, DD 09.jpg|thumb|[[Arg e Bam]], One of The largest adobe and mud building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1208|title=Bam and its Cultural Landscape|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Adhesive ===
In the [[construction]] industry, mud is a semi-fluid material that can be used to coat, seal, or adhere materials. Depending on the composition of the mud, it can be referred by many different names, including [[slurry]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], [[plaster]], [[stucco]], and [[concrete]].

=== Material ===
Mud, [[Cob (material)|cob]], [[adobe]], [[clay]], and many other names are historically used synonymously to mean a mixture of [[subsoil]] and water possibly with the addition of stones, gravel, straw, lime, and/or bitumen. This material was used a variety of ways to build walls, floors and even roofs. For thousands of years it was common in most parts of the world to build walls using [[mudbrick]]s or the [[wattle and daub]], [[rammed earth]] or [[cob (material)|cob]] techniques and cover the surfaces with [[earthen plaster]].

==== Mudbrick ====
{{Main|Mudbrick}}
[[File:Amran.jpg|right|thumb|Mud house in Amran, [[Yemen]]]]
Mud can be made into mud bricks, also called [[adobe]], by mixing mud with water, placing the mixture into [[molding (process)|moulds]] and then allowing it to dry in open air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhome.gov.au/materials/mud-brick|title=Mud brick|first=|last=admin_666|date=29 July 2013|work=yourhome.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw is sometimes used as a binder within the bricks, as it adds a support lattice. When the brick would otherwise break, the straw will redistribute the force throughout the brick, decreasing the chance of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. ''The Cobber’s Companion: How to Build Your Own Earthen Home''. Cottage Grove: Cob Cottage, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such buildings must be protected from groundwater, usually by building upon a masonry, fired brick, rock or rubble foundation, and also from wind-driven rain in damp climates, usually by deep roof overhangs. In extremely dry climates a well drained flat roof may be protected with a well-prepared ([[Puddling (engineering)|puddled]]) and properly maintained dried mud coating, viable as the mud will expand when moistened and so become more water resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/5-adobe-buildings.htm|title=Preservation Brief 5: Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings|work=nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe mudbricks were commonly used by the [[Pueblo]] Indians to build their homes and other necessary structures.

==== Fired brick ====
Mud that is mostly clay, or a mixture of clay and sand may be used for [[ceramic]]s, of which one form is the common fired [[brick]]. Fired brick are more durable but consume much more energy to produce.

==== Stabilized mud ====
Stabilized mud (earth, soil) is mud which has had a binder such as cement or bitumen added. Examples are [[mudcrete]], landcrete, and [[soil cement]].

== Pottery ==
{{Main|Pottery}}

Pottery is made by forming a [[List of pottery terms#Clay body|clay body]] into objects of a required shape and heating them to high temperatures in a [[kiln]] which removes all the water from the [[clay]], which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be [[Pottery#Decorating and glazing|decorated]] before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. [[List of pottery terms#K|Kneading]] helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum [[List of pottery terms#pug|pug]] or manually by [[List of pottery terms#W|wedging]]. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.

In ceramics, the making of liquid mud (called [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]) is a stage in the process of refinement of the materials, since larger particles will settle from the liquid.

== Habitat ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

=== Land ===
Mud can provide a home for numerous types of animals, including varieties of [[worm]]s, [[frog]]s, [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[crayfish]]. Other animals, such as [[hippopotamus]]es, [[pig]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[water buffalo]] and [[elephant]]s, bathe in mud in order to cool off and protect themselves from the [[sun]]. Submerged mud can be home to [[larvae]] of various [[insects]].

=== Marine life ===
Mud plays an important role in the [[marine ecosystem]]. The activities of burrowing animals and fish have a dramatic churning effect on muddy seabeds. This allows the exchange and cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and minerals between water and sediment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A summary of the ‘Burrowed Mud’ MPA search feature. (n.d.). Retrieved January 13, 2015, from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4-c-IWKEf1kJ:www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00394205.doc &amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the surface, the burrows of some species form intricate lattice-like networks and may penetrate a meter or more downwards. This means that the burrowed mud is a productive habitat, providing food and shelter for a wide range of mud-dwellers and other animals that forage in and over the mud.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Problems ==
[[File:Glenwood mud slide (6089986106).jpg|thumb|A landslide on a railroad]]
Mud can pose problems for motor traffic when moisture is present, because every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface, so a layer of mud on the surface of the road or tires can cause the vehicle to [[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]].

Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of ground water may trigger a movement of soil or sediments, possibly causing [[mudslides]], [[landslides]], [[rockslide|avalanches]], or [[sinkholes]].

Mudslides in volcanic terrain (called [[lahar]]s) occur after eruptions as rain remobilizes loose ash deposits.&lt;ref&gt;"Mud on the Move." Earth: The Definitive Visual Guide. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2013. 98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mudslides]] are also common in the western United States during [[El Niño]] years due to prolonged rainfall.

== As food ==
[[File:Pohnpeian kava (32834047675).jpg|thumb|A bowl of [[kava]] tea.]]
There are numerous [[dysphemism]]s for poor-tasting food such as "tastes like dirt". [[Kava]] tea is often described this way, as it is bitter, brown, and contains sediments. 

There also exist children's recipes for "mud", which is generally a chocolate or cornstarch-based sludge used more for visual appeal than actual taste. Never does this confectionery mud actually contain real mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookadvice.com/recipes/magic_mud-36597-recipe.htm |title=Magic mud food recipe – Magic mud ingredients &amp; cooking | publisher=Cookadvice.com | date=2 September 2012 | accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophagia===
{{main|Geophagia}}
The practice of eating earth or soil-like substances is geophagia.

== Recreation ==

=== Mud bath ===
{{Main|Mud bath}}
A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can combine with volcanic ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and can be found now in high-end spas in many countries of the world.

=== Mud wallow ===

Mud wallows are a common source of entertainment for kids. Mud wallows can be any shape, size, depth and some can have water as well as mud. Usually wallows are shallow dips in the ground that have been flooded and were full of dirt and those two have mixed to make a squishy mud wallow.

=== Mudding ===
{{Main|Mud bogging}}
Mud bogging is a form of off-road motorsport popular in Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to traverse the pit will determine the winner.

=== Mud run ===
Mud runs are a popular activity involving mud.  Participants run a distance of 3 miles to as long as 10 miles, while crawling through mud bogs, and battling other obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toughmudder.com|title=Mud Run – Obstacle Races – Tough Mudder|work=Tough Mudder|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerebrun.com|title=Cerebrun – Get Mental|work=Cerebrun|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriordash.com|title=Warrior Dash – The World's Largest Obstacle Race Series|work=Warrior Dash|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
* Mud is used in mud wrestling as a form of entertainment.
* Mud can be used in a [[dunk tank]].
* [[Dirt biking]] involves biking through muddy tracks and courses.
* [[Baseball Rubbing Mud]] is used to remove the sheen from new baseballs.
* Children often like to make 'mud pies', throw mud at each other and play barefoot and cover their bare feet in mud and/or coat themselves in mud.
* [[Albuquerque]] and other towns across the United States such as [[Gillette, Wyoming]] hold a yearly event in which participants play volleyball in a giant mud pit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">'''Muntanya Assolada''' is a [[Bronze Age]] settlement located on the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river, in Spain, built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, dominating the river plain from a height of {{convert|227|m}} above sea level. It is located in the municipality of [[Alzira, Valencia]], Spain.

Excavation campaigns began in 1978, under the direction of [[Bernat Martí Oliver]], and continued until 1996, and work on the site was resumed in 2004. From the 1990s [[Rosa Enguix Alemany]] and [[María Jesús de Pedro]] joined the direction of the site. At present the excavated area covers {{convert|700|m2}} and includes different structures, like a central street and rectangular departments on both sides; a wall of two meters wide that preserves almost three meters of height ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}); occupancy soils and abandonment episodes; livestock stabling; and terracing of the slopes to expand its surface.

At present the site is property of the Alzira City council, and the new beginning of the excavations by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] has as objective the consolidation of the exhumed structures and its signposting for visitor access.

A nearby [[burial cave]] indicates the continuity in the use of natural caves as necropolis, and an individual burial has been found in a pit in the interior of the area too. On the other hand, the recovered remains show a wide chronological sequence between the [[Early Bronze Age|Early Bronze]] and the [[Late Bronze Age|Late Bronze]].
[[File:Assolada_localización.jpg|thumb|Location of the Muntanya Assolada]]

== Location ==
On the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river is located the Muntanya Assolada Bronze Age village of Alzira. The settlement was built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, west of Tallat Roig, between the Murta and the Aixavegó ravine, dominating the plain of the river from a height of 227 metres above sea level. The toponym "Muntanya Desolada" refers to the partial collapse of the summit that occurred in autumn of 1783, the night of 24–25 October. Until then the place was known as Muntanya de la Font del Baladre.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_muro.jpg|thumb|Wall area]]

== Archaeological interventions ==
The excavations carried out by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] began in 1978 and continued until 1996, resuming again from 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/4497|title=Repositorio Institucional de la Universidad de Alicante |accessdate=9 March 2017 |author=|authorlink= |date= |language= |website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area currently excavated covers more than {{cvt|700|m2}} and corresponds to different room structures with anthropic deposits and evidences of the different activities developed there, such as occupation soils and abandonment episodes in which fire was detected, perhaps due to the combustion of materials accumulated by livestock stabling, and terracing of the slopes to gradually expand the surface of the village. In its upper part, can be seen a central street and departments on both sides. In one of them it has been documented a domestic oven for cooking bread or toasting cereals. And in the other, the entrance has stone steps.

The site is surrounded by a wall that is almost two meters wide and stands three meters high ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}). It was built on a summit that has been terraced by solid stone and clay buildings arranged in slope, thus prolonging the settlement on the slope. The existence of different levels of occupation, documented by stratigraphy and remains, is corroborated by the remodeling of the structures, some of them quickly and intentionally filled to give way to new construction lines. However, it seems to indicate that it was inhabited continuously throughout the Bronze Age.

== Archaeological remains ==
The remains are deposited in the [[Prehistory Museum of Valencia|Museu de Prehistòria de València]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es/web_mupreva/sala/?q=fr&amp;id=119 |title=La Muntanya Assolada (Alzira, Valencia) |accessdate=9 March 2017 |last=Render |website= www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery shows a variety of shapes, such as cups and bowls, pots and storage urns, fairing and geminated vessels, or spoons; and decorative motifs such as incisions, dots, typed strings, or burnished decoration. Among the metallic objects are gravers, arrowheads, a dagger of rivets, and a chisel, as well as other elements linked to the metallurgical activity, such as slags, a stone hammer and a ceramic crucible. The lithic industry has a good representation of sickle and flint arrowheads, polished stone tool and numerous remains of the lithic reductions. The bone industry is represented by gravers, spatulas and chisels, and by a ring and different ivory buttons. The fauna remains show the results of an agricultural village with sheep and goats predominating, the ox being used as an animal of draft and strength, and as a producer of meat and milk. Also the pig was raised, and there are remains of horse and dog. The hunt of the deer, beyond the necessary protection of the crops against herbivores, indicates the existence of a remarkable vegetation cover. The dating of a set of fauna from the lower layer of a space existing between the upper wall and a thickened structure, that is attached to it, has provided a date of 3470 ± 70 BP, between 1890&amp;nbsp;BC and 1690&amp;nbsp;BC.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Enterrament_2.jpg |thumb|Human burial]]

== Human burials ==
The presence of human burials in the site is attested by the excavation of a small sepulchral cave immediately near the village, in the escarpment of its south-east side, which provided remains of a minimum of four individuals, animal bones and part of the grave goods that are with the buried. On the other side, in its westernmost southern slope, in the space delimited by a wide wall and by different stone courses that follow along the outer slope, a circular grave was excavated that contained another human burial, under a sedimentation of more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} of depth. The buried was in fetal position, right lateral decubitus, with the legs folded and the feet crossed. The right arm was elongated behind the back and the hand crushed by a block. The left arm was flexed in front of the body and the hand stretched below the face, missing most of the skull and upper maxilla. The absolute dating of this individual by C-14 has provided a date of 3760 ± 40 BP, between 2210&amp;nbsp;BC and 2130&amp;nbsp;BC.

== Relevance in its context ==
The Muntanya Assolada has been considered as a typical village of the Valencian Bronze Age, according to some decorative motifs of the pottery, globular and tall carena, the archaism of the lithic industry, the copper metallurgy, or the sepulchral cave found next to the village. The end of its habitation is related to the Late Bronze, attending to the fairing vessels with flared profile and with a pronounced angle of inflection, the flat bases or the presence of authentic bronze in the metallic objects. In fact, the typology of the vessels of Muntanya Assolada corresponds to what is usual in the villages of the Valencian Bronze Age. However, in their highest levels, such shapes as the mentioned fairing vessels are accompanied by the geminados, bowls and outgoing edge pots, considered more-evolved. The two absolute dates are shown in accordance with a sequence from the Early to the Late Bronze Age. La Muntanya Assolada and other nearby sites represent the continuity of a settlement that spans from the Bronze Age to the [[Iberian Culture]], in a permanently occupied territory such as the Ribera del [[Xúquer]].

The site was abandoned in the final period of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] or Late Bronze, to give way to a settlement located on the plain, first on Cases de Montcada, during the Late Bronze Age on Escoles Pies and during the [[Iron Age]] on the L'Alteret de la Vintihuitena of Albalat, to occupy later the slope of the highest hills with the arrival of the [[Iberian Culture]].

The '''Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica''' is a [[music museum]] and [[music library]] in the Palazzo Aldini Sanguinetti, in the historic center of [[Bologna, Italy]].

==Museum==

===Background===
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 to hold the city's collection of musical objects. It was renamed Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica in 2004 when the museum's current site, the Palazzo Sanguinetti, opened to the public. The palace was reopened after a long and careful restoration that brought the rich, interior [[frescoe]]s back to their original splendour. These frescoes were first completed between the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and provide one of the finest examples of Napoleonic and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] decoration.

The purpose of the museum was to make the public aware of the rich musical heritage owned by the Comune di Bologna. Until recently, much of this heritage remained confined in warehouses – primarily due to lack of adequate space – and was only brought out occasionally for temporary display.

Palazzo Sanguinetti offered the possibility to enhance the cultural value of such precious musical heritage and to provide an environment worthy of the priceless items displayed. The palace also guarantees ideal conditions for managing and conserving these items.

The institute is now divided into two sites. An ample selection of volumes, paintings, and musical instruments are displayed in the museum halls in Strada Maggiore 34 (Palazzo Sanguinetti), while the majority of bibliographic material is accessible in Piazza Rossini 2 (the ex-Convent of San Giacomo) in rooms attached to the G.B. Martini Conservatory of Music.

====The Palazzo Sanguinetti====
In the early 16th century, the original core of the Palazzo Sanguinetti belonged to the Loiani family. The building was sold in 1569 to the Bolognese brothers, Ercole and Giulio Riario, who were originally from Savona and were related to the della Roveres. Having acquired neighboring land and buildings, Senator Ercole Riario had the home reconstructed and enlarged. The individual homes were united into one structure, and construction on the impressive staircase, which still characterizes the building today, was likely begun. The second major reconstruction was commissioned by Count Antonio Aldini, to whom the Marquis Raffaello Riario Sforza had granted a long-term lease in 1796. Count Aldini tasked the architect Giovanni Battista Martinetti (1774–1830) with modernizing the building. A neighboring house was attached to the tower belonging to the Oseletti family, and the huge 16th-century hall was divide into two rooms, which correspond to the modern museum's two most spacious rooms – the vestibule, or the Room of Virtues, and the Ballroom.

Following the fall of [[Napoleon]] and the economic ruin of Aldini, the palace was sold to the Cuban nobleman don Diego Pegnalverd, a former member of the Napoleonic government. Upon his death in 1832, the palazzo passed to the famous tenor, [[Domenico Donzelli]]. It is noted that [[Gioachino Rossini]] stayed there while his own nearby home was under reconstruction. In 1870 the Sanguinetti family purchased the building. They were responsible for the most recent decorations in the intended library and the “Egyptian Room.” During recent renovations of the palazzo, marvelous frescoes were discovered in these two areas.

In 1986 the last heiress, Eleonora Sanguinetti, donated the larger part of the building to the Comune di Bologna in memory – as she wrote in her will – of “my unforgettable father, Dr. Guido Sanguinetti. I wanted to donate the building in Strada Maggiore 34 in his name and memory, and for the love that he always had for his city and his home, so that it could become a music museum and library.”

===The frescos and decorations===
The Palazzo Sanguinetti decorations displays works by major 18th- and 19th-century [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] painters, such as [[Pelagio Palagi]] (1777–1860), [[Serafino Barozzi]], and [[Antonio Basoli]] (1774–1848), under the direction of [[Vincenzo Martinelli]] (1737–1807). On the ground floor, the landscape fresco (a magnificent trompe-l'oeil perspective) is attributed to [[Luigi Busatti]], while the [[quadratura]] is the work of [[Francesco Santini]] (1763–1840). Santini, with the probable collaboration of [[Serafino Barozzi]] (1735–1810), also decorated the walls of the grand staircase. On the first floor, the Woodland Room (Room 1), used as and called the Banquet Room, was designed by Martinelli: he illustrates landscapes rich with greenery and classical architecture in the distance. These classical elements surround the onlooker in the illusion of a step that supports hermes and statues of Bacchus and Ceres, works by a young Palagi.&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions by Paola Foschi writes in the museum guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aeneas Room (Room 2), also by Palagi, depicts stories of the [[Aeneid]] on a black, ''Etruscan'' background. The Zodiac and Aurora Room (Room 3) depicts the Zodiac signs by Domenico Corsini (1774–1814) and a figure of Aurora, attributed to Palagi. The last small room of the east wing (Room 4) is decorated by artists from the Barozzi workshop.  They are also credited with the two rooms (Rooms 6 and 7) that conclude the west wing, which are decorated in ''oriental'' style with curtains and pavilions, exotic plants, and feminine figures with small umbrellas. Room 5 is the Ballroom. At the end of the museum tour are two salons in the apartment designed by Aldini; they were the first two rooms to be decorated. The original room (Room 8), is decorated by Antonio Basoli in a ''neo-gothic'' style, with figures, statues, and bass reliefs by [[Pietro Fancelli]] (1764–1850).

====Father Giovanni Battista Martini====
[[File:Padre Martini 1.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Padre Gianbattista Martini. Author: Angelo Crescimbeni, 1770.]]

The original core of the museum's musical collections is credited to the Conventual Franciscan [[friar]], [[Giovanni Battista Martini]] (Bologna, April 24, 1706 – August 3, 1784), important 18th-century music scholar and collector, a theorist and composer, and a teacher of counterpoint. [[Johann Christian Bach]] and [[Mozart|Wolfgang Amadé Mozart]] were among his students.

At only 19 years old, Martini was appointed chapel-master of the Church of [[Basilica of San Francesco, Bologna|San Francesco]] in Bologna. His fame as an excellent teacher and connoisseur of music began to grow when he “won” a dispute with the scholar, Redi, regarding the interpretation of a mysterious ''canone dell'Animuccia'' that existed in the choir gallery of the Santa Casa di Loreto, where Redi himself was chapel-master. After this triumph, not content with being only a scholar, he continued his music studies and was an admired composer of [[sonatas]] for the harpsichord, canons, and about 500 unpublished musical pieces.

The numerous letters conserved in the library (around 80 volumes with more than 6,500 letters), document the broad network of musicians, aristocrats, singers, and [[cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]] who had contacts with Martini. Even the [[Emperor of Austria]] visited Padre Martini while in Bologna. Martini collected not only manuscripts and musical works of various kinds, but also portraits of musicians displayed on the walls of his library in the Monastery of San Francesco.

===Exhibition path===
[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Wolfgang Amadé Mozart, composer Author:unknown, 1777.]]
The museum path opens among the lush decorations of '''the Boschereccia Room''' with some symbolic works which serve as an introduction to the museum and prepare the visitor for their trip through the musical universe.

'''Rooms 2''' and 3 are dedicated to the spiritual father of the new museum, pictured in an oval by Angelo Crescimbeni: Giambattista Martini, whose priceless moral heritage, both intellectual and material, is celebrated here and made known to the greater public.
&lt;br /&gt;
In '''Room 3''', the relationships between [[Padre Martini]] and the stand-out personalities of the music world of the time, such as the young [[Mozart]] or [[Johann Christian Bach]], who is represented in the famous portrait by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], are displayed. In the same room, one can also admire the famous Sportelli di libreria musicale by [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]].&lt;br /&gt;
'''Room 4''' (“The Idea of Music”) follows, which is dedicated to the musical scholars from the 15th century to the 17th century, with important examples of musical treatises, and portraits of their respective authors. This room also contains some musical instruments of great importance, like the unique omnitonum harpsichord  by [[Vito Trasuntino]] ([[Venice]] 1606).

Some of the more relevant pieces are on display in the following '''Room 5''' (Arts Room), which is dedicated to the “Books for music and instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries.” In this room, rare texts from ranging the 15th century to the famous Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, the first printed musical book by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], can be admired. They are kept inside very modern, circular cases in the center of the room, which match the rich decoration of the floors.

Then there are the instruments: lutes; the harmony of flutes by Manfredo Settala of 1650, which represents a real unicum;
the pochette, various little violins used as instruments by dance instructors, the ghironde, the serpentoni, the extraordinary series of horns and cornets from the 16th and 17th centuries, and finally, a unique performance instrument: the tiorba, which is in the shape of a khitára.

Italian opera is the focus of the following room.
The 18th century are first in '''Room 6''', dedicated to the famous singer [[Carlo Broschi]], known as [[Farinelli]].

His beautiful portrait, painted by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], dominates the room, together with the portraits of the castrati from various periods and of composers from the time, such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[Domenico Cimarosa]].

'''Room 7''' places the visitor in the 19th century with [[Gioachino Rossini]], whose name is forever tied to [[Bologna]]. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first recitals of [[Isabella Colbran]], a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of [[The Barber of Seville]] and some rather curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by [[Camille Pleyel]].

The path proceeds through the centuries, the musical uses, and styles in '''Room 8''', which is dedicated to “Books for music and instruments in the 18th and 19th centuries.” There are viole d'amore and flutes along with the original scores composed by [[Torelli]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Ferdinando Bertoni|Bertoni]], etc. There are also clarinets and the beautiful Buccin, created in [[Lyon]] by Jean Baptiste Tabard (1812–1845).

Concluding the exhibit, '''Room 9''' pays a proper tribute to two important people in the Italian and Bolognese musical culture, [[Giuseppe Martucci]] and [[Ottorino Respighi]].  This room displays the composer's portraits, photographs, and a selection of works from the Respighi property, which were donated to the library in 1961 by his widow, Elsa, for the 25th anniversary of his death. In the same room lies the portrait of the musician Arrigo Serato, painted by the famous artist [[Felice Casorati]].

===Collections===
The first floor of the Palazzo is home to the nine rooms of the exhibition, which illustrates about six centuries of the history of European music. There are over one hundred paintings of famous people from the music world, which are a part of the picture gallery started by Padre Giovanni Battista Martini, more than eighty antique musical instruments, and a large selection of valuable historical documents, such as treatises, volumes, opera libretti, letters, manuscripts, original musical scores, etc.

==Library==
[[File:Due sportelli di libreria con scaffali di libri di musica.jpg|thumb|right|Libreria. Autore:G.M.Crespi, c. 1720 – 1730. Collocazione: Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica]]
The collection inherited from Padre Martini constitutes one of the most prestigious collections of music repertory printed between the 16th and 18th centuries because of its incunabulums, valuable manuscripts, opera libretti, and for the unique collection of autographs and letters, which are the result of the correspondence Martini painstakingly kept with eminent people, scholars, and musicians of the time.
Saved from the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations  due to the intervention of [[Stanislao Mattei]], Martini's disciple and successor, the valuable bibliographic patrimony was donated to the Liceo musicale di [[Bologna]] in 1816. The Liceo had been founded in 1804 at the ex-convent of the Agostinians in the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. The library grew considerably throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, thanks to the amount of materials produced from the didactic activity of the Liceo (famous students of the Liceo included Rossini, Donizetti, and Respighi and directors Mancinelli, Martucci, and Busoni).
The library also grew because of the valuable items and rare volumes that were acquired by [[Gaetano Gaspari]], who was appointed as librarian in 1855.
Gaspari directed the library for many years with a unique zeal and knowledge. After many years of hard work and constant effort, he was able to excellently organize and card-catalogue all the library material (also from this period came the posthumous publication, the "Library Catalogue of the Liceo Musicale di Bologna", which bears his name and is now also available online).
In 1942, when the Liceo musicale was transformed into a state institution – Regio Conservatorio di Musica – the [[Comune di Bologna]] chose to maintain ownership of Padre Martini's bibliographic patrimony and the attached picture gallery.
The Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale was founded in 1959 in order to conserve and make the most of the bibliographic patrimony and portrait gallery.

===Picture gallery===
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|right|Supposed portrait of [[Antonio Vivaldi]]. Author and date unknown.]]
There is not much information about the development of the picture gallery, which seems to have had no rivals in [[Bologna]] during the 18th century. From the valuable letters of correspondence that [[Padre Martini]] kept with different well-known people of the time (for example, musicians that were his students in [[Bologna]], members of the [[Philharmonic Academy of Bologna|Accademia Filarmonica]], music theorists, composers, nobles, illustrious intellectuals, chapel masters, and custodians of Franciscan convents), it is evident that there was a complex network of informers and intermediaries that were responsible for finding the portraits he desired.
Many of the portraits were commissioned to the artists directly by [[Padre Martini]]. The painters drew the features of the musicians from engravings of the time. In reality, he wasn't interested in the artistic worth of the paintings as much as their plausible resemblance to the model. He was also more interested in whether they were in harmony with his century's interest in the physiognomic reading of faces with the intention of giving iconographic testimony of the people bonded by one common denominator – music. It was also important that the paintings had a direct relationship with his Library.
It's worth noting that there are many paintings by famous artists present in the collection, including the portrait of [[Farinelli]] by [[Corrado Giaquinto]], the portrait of [[Johann Christian Bach]] by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], and one of [[Charles Burney]] by [[Joshua Reynolds]].
It also seems that the prestige of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable [[Europe]]an expert on the art of music, was so great that it was important for a musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.
The picture gallery remained in the convent of [[San Francesco]] even after Martini's death, surviving the [[Napoleonic]] confiscations thanks to Martini's successor, Padre Stanislao Mattei. Only in 1801 was it transferred to the ex-convent of the Agostinians at the Chiesa di San Giacomo Maggiore. Today, the collection consists of 319 paintings, the majority of which are oil on canvas with some pastels and drawings.

===The collection of musical instruments===
The musical instruments displayed in the rooms of the museum originate from the collections of two important Bolognese institutions: the Museo Civico Medievale and the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale. The core of this collection from the Museo Civico Medievale comes from the Liceo musicale, which was founded in 1804. As Federico Parisini (the Liceo librarian from 1881 to 1891) explained, following the Napoleonic suppressions, “the instruments, many famous musical works, chorus books, rare instruments, and other items related to music were sold publicly.”
The central administration of the Dipartimento del Reno had asked the government of the Repubblica Cisalpina to purchase and conserve the objects that risked being dispersed. The recovered instruments were then entrusted to the Liceo and, in 1881, were finally added to the Museo Civico Medievale, where they have remained until today.
Among the most valuable instruments now displayed in the rooms of the museum is the Trasuntino harpsichord of 1606 (displayed in Room 4). It was constructed for Camillo Gonzaga, the Count of Novellara, and afterwards was passed to Giuseppe Baini (1775–1844), the celebrated author of the first biography of [[Palestrina]]. In his will, Baini bequeathed the harpsichord to the Liceo Musicale. Other valuable instruments on display are the Trasuntino monochord, which was built to tune the cymbal, and the 5-reed flute, which is able to mimic several flutes playing in harmony. There is also the polyphonic flute (displayed in Room 5), which bears the mark of Manfredo Settala (1600–1680), a Milanese rector, who was a great collector and famous personality in the cultural panorama of the 17th century.
The origin of the collection of musical instruments in the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale is more uncertain. The collection includes some particularly important models, such as eight pianos, five of which are grand pianos and three of which are rectangular. These pianos date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Among these are the priceless Erard from 1811 (that possibly belonged to Paolina Borghese), which was restored for the inauguration of the museum and is now exhibited in Room 8. Also included are [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] piano of 1844 (exhibited in Room 7), and the so-called “spinette of Padre Martini”, a rectangular Glonner from 1780 (displayed in Room 3). Other important instruments on display are the Heckelphon of 1900 (Room 8), various English horns, some cornets, and two oboes.

'''Library'''

Though it is to be transferred to a new site, the library is located in Piazza Rossini 2. It is made up of a single reading room, which is shared with the Conservatorio di Musica “G.B. Martini”. The room has 20 seats, twelve of which are exclusively reserved for the consultation of antique and particular texts. There are two microfilm (and one microfilm/microfiches) machines available in the room, and a space for bibliographic and catalogue searches.

The '''NASA Space Radiation Laboratory''' ('''NSRL''', previously called Booster Applications Facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://server.c-ad.bnl.gov/esfd/nsrl/operations/index.html | title = NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory | accessdate = 2012-07-25 | work = Brookhaven National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a United States [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratory]] and part of the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], located in [[Upton, New York]] on [[Long Island]]. It is dedicated to learn about the possible risks to human beings [[Health threat from cosmic rays|exposed to cosmic radiation]].

==Overview==
Although Brookhaven Lab researchers and their colleagues used beams of heavy ions for radiobiology research at another Brookhaven accelerator from 1995, the NSRL became operational during summer 2003, and over 75 experimenters from some 20 institutions from the U.S. and abroad have taken part on radiobiology research.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt; Jointly managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and NASA’s Johnson Space Center, the facility employs beams of heavy ions extracted from Brookhaven’s Booster accelerator that are then used to simulate the [[Cosmic ray]]s found in space. NSRL also features its own beam line dedicated to radiobiology research, as well as specimen-preparation areas.

==Science==
Since [[astronaut]]s are spending more time in outer space, they are receiving more exposure to ionizing radiation, a stream of particles that, when passing through a body, has enough energy to cause the atoms and molecules within that substance to become an [[ion]]. By directly or indirectly ionizing and thus damaging the components of living cells, including genetic material called [[DNA]], ionizing radiation may cause changes in cells' ability to carry out repair and reproduction. This may lead to mutations, which, in turn, may result in [[tumor]]s, [[cancer]], genetic defects in offspring, or death.

Although the spacecraft itself somewhat reduces radiation exposure, it does not completely shield astronauts from galactic cosmic rays, which are highly energetic heavy ions, or from [[solar energetic particles]], which primarily are energetic protons. By one NASA estimate, for each year that astronauts spend in deep space, about one-third of their DNA will be hit directly by heavy ions.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt;

NSRL researchers employ the unique [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] to irradiate a variety of biological specimens, tissues, and cells, as well as DNA in solution. Other experimenters use industrial materials as samples, studying their suitability for [[space suit]]s and spacecraft shielding.&lt;ref name='research'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spaceradiation.usra.edu/ | title = NASA Space Radiation  Research | accessdate = 2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In increasing knowledge of the effects of cosmic radiation, NSRL studies may expand the understanding of the link between ionizing radiation and aging or neuro-degeneration, as well as cancer. In aiming to limit the damage to healthy tissue by ionization, NSRL research may also lead to improvements in cancer radiation treatments.&lt;ref name='intro'/&gt;

[[File:Tongass national forest juneau img 7501.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] is managed by the [[United States Forest Service]]]]

'''Natural resource management''' refers to the management of [[natural resource]]s such as [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, with a particular focus on how management affects the [[quality of life]] for both present and future generations ([[stewardship]]).

Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural [[landscapes]] interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, [[Conservation biology|biodiversity conservation]], and the future sustainability of industries like [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Resilient landscapes and communities  managing natural resources in New South Wales|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173746/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and [[ecology]] and the life-supporting capacity of those resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Massey University|url=http://study.massey.ac.nz/massey/students/studymassey/programme.cfm?major_code=2261&amp;prog_code=93013|title=Bachelor of Applied Science (Natural Resource Management)|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental management]] is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the [[Rural sociology|sociology of natural resources]] is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.

==History==
[[File:US-DOI-BureauOfLandManagement-Logo.svg|thumb|right|135px|The [[Bureau of Land Management]] in the United States manages America's [[public land]]s, totaling approximately 264 million acres (1,070,000 km2) or one-eighth of the landmass of the country.]]

The emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of [[North America]]n [[rangeland]]s in the late 19th century, and the [[Conservation movement|resource conservation]] movement of the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley University of California: Geography: [http://geography.berkeley.edu/programcourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf Geog 175: Topics in the History of Natural Resource Management: Spring 2006: Rangelands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611112307/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Department of Geography: GEOG 657/ENVS 657:  Natural Resource Management:  Biotic Resources: [http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf Natural Resource Management and Environmental History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217101744/http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources. A more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social, cultural, economic and political aspects of resource management.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thakadu |first=O. T. |year=2005 |title=Success factors in community based natural resources management in northern Botswana: Lessons from practice |journal=Natural Resources Forum |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=199–212 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-8947.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the [[Brundtland Commission]] and the advocacy of [[sustainable development]].

In 2005 the government of [[New South Wales]], established a ''Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NSW Government 2005, Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management, NSW Natural Resources Commission, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the consistency of practice, based on an [[adaptive management]] approach.

In the [[United States]], the most active areas of natural resource management are [[wildlife management]] often associated with [[ecotourism]] and [[rangeland management]]. In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.

==Ownership regimes==

Natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:

* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.

* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.

* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.

* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that "Everybody's property is nobody's property". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.

* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholder analysis==

[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity. Stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Dandy"&gt;Dandy, N. et al. (2009) ‘Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management,’ Journal of Environmental Management, vol. 90, pp. 1933–1949&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below. Especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder.&lt;ref name="Billgrena"&gt;Billgrena, C., Holme, H. (2008) ‘Approaching reality: Comparing stakeholder analysis and cultural theory in the context of natural resource management,’ Land Use Policy, vol. 25, pp. 550–562&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised.

Billgrena and Holme&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt; identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:

*Identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence
*Develop an understanding of why changes occur
*Establish who can make changes happen
*How to best manage natural resources

This gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimble, R|date=1998|title=Stakeholder methodologies in natural resource management, Socioeconomic Methodologies|publisher=Chatham: Natural Resources Institute|pages=1–12|url=http://www.nri.org/old/publications/bpg/bpg02.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous stakeholder theories such as Mitchell et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell, R. K.|date=1997|title=TOWARD A THEORY OF STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION AND SALIENCE: DEFINING THE PRINCIPLE OF WHO AND WHAT REALLY COUNTS|publisher=Academy of Management Review|volume=22|number=4|pages=853–886|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt; created a framework of stages for a Stakeholder Analysis in natural resource management. Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;  designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management.

'''Stages in Stakeholder analysis:'''&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;
#        Clarify objectives of the analysis
#       Place issues in a systems context
#        Identify decision-makers and stakeholders
#         Investigate stakeholder interests and agendas
#           Investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence  (e.g. conflicts and compatibilities, trade-offs and synergies)

'''Application:'''

Grimble and Wellard&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt; established that Stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as;

*	Cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests
*	Multiple uses and users of the resource.
*	[[Market failure]]
*	[[Subtractability]] and temporal trade-offs
*	Unclear or [[open-access]] [[property rights]]
*	Untraded products and services
*	[[Poverty]] and under-representation&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

'''Case studies:'''

In the case of the [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]], a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the Batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people's livelihoods and loss of life.&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

Nepal, Indonesia and Koreas' [[community forestry#5Best Practices|community forestry]] are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources. This allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests.

'''Criticisms:'''

*	Natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by Clarkson. ‘‘Stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the world's misery.’’&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, M.B.E. (1994) A risk based model of stakeholder theory. Toronto: Working Paper, University of Toronto, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Starik&lt;ref&gt;Starik, M. (1995) ‘Should trees have managerial standing? Toward stakeholder status for non-human nature,’ Journal of Business Ethics, vol. 14, pp. 207–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder. However this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;
*	Stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Dandy" /&gt;
*	Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Prell"&gt;Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;
*	On-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions.&lt;ref name="Prell" /&gt;

'''Alternatives/ Complementary forms of analysis:'''

*	[[Social network analysis]]
*	[[Common pool resource]]

==Management of the resources==

Natural resource management issues are inherently complex. They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.

After the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.

The various approaches applied to natural resource management include:

* Top-down (command and control)
* Community-based natural resource management
* [[Adaptive]] management
* Precautionary approach
* Integrated natural resource management

=== Community-based natural resource management ===

The community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005" /&gt; When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993. Institutional incentives and sustainable development: infrastructure policies in perspective. Westview Press. Oxford, UK. 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

The United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Unless clearly defined, decentralised NRM can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e.g. forest communities in central Kalimantan (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, T Andersson, K, Jager P and Van Laerhoven 2008 The contribution of Institutional Theories for explaining [[Decentralization]] of Natural Resource Governance. Society and Natural Resources, 21:160-174 {{doi|10.1080/08941920701617973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem of CBNRM is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kellert, S|author2=Mehta, J|author3=Ebbin, S|author4=Litchtenfeld, L.|date=2000|title=Community natural resource management: promise, rhetoric, and reality|publisher=Society and Natural Resources, 13:705-715|url=http://biologicalcapital.com/art/Article-%20Community%20Natural%20Resource%20Management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and conflicting interests of CBNRM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brosius, J.|author2=Peter Tsing|author3=Anna Lowenhaupt|author4=Zerner, Charles|date=1998 |title=Representing communities: Histories and politics of community-based natural resource management |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|publisher=Society &amp; Natural Resources: An International Journal |volume=11 |issue=2|pages=157–168|url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/08941929809381069|accessdate=27 October 2014|doi=10.1080/08941929809381069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, C 2000.

Understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based NRM. Locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits.

CBNRM is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities, on the one hand, and national and transnational organizations, on the other, to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shackleton, S|author2=Campbell, B|author3=Wollenberg, E|author4=Edmunds, D.|date=March 2002|title=Devolution and community-based natural resource management: creating space for local people to participate and benefit? |publisher=ODI, Natural Resource Perspectives|number=76|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3646/76-devolution-community-based-natural-resource-management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues, employment, diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity.

The capacity of [[indigenous Australians|indigenous]] communities to conserve natural resources has been acknowledged by the Australian Government with the Caring for Country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Australian Government|title=Caring for Country Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|url=http://www.nrm.gov.au/nrm/index.html|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928132125/http://www.nrm.gov.au/nrm/index.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program. Caring for our Country is an Australian Government initiative jointly administered by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. These Departments share responsibility for delivery of the Australian Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs, which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of ‘natural resource management’. These programs have been delivered regionally, through 56 State government bodies, successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|title=PROGRESS TOWARDS HEALTHY RESILIENT LANDSCAPES IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARD, TARGETS AND CATCHMENT ACTION PLANS|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217095859/http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|archivedate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, a research study based in Tanzania and the Pacific researched what motivates communities to adopt CBNRM's and found that aspects of the specific CBNRM program, of the community that has adopted the program, and of the broader social-ecological context together shape the why CBNRM's are adopted&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management. In the State of NSW, the 13 [[Catchment Management Authority of (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) are overseen by the [http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/ Natural Resources Commission] (NRC), responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+102+2003+cd+0+N/?autoquery=%28Content%3D%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29%20AND%20%28%28Type%3D%22act%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%20OR%20%28Type%3D%22subordleg%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%29&amp;dq=Document%20Types%3D%22Acts,%20Regs%22,%20Any%20Words%3D%22natural%20resources%20commission%22,%20Search%20In%3D%22Text%22&amp;fullquery=%28%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29|title=NSW Legislation|publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive management===
The primary methodological approach adopted by [[Catchment Management Authority (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) for regional natural resource management in Australia is [[adaptive management]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of ‘plan-do-review-act’. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice:
*	Determination of scale
*	Collection and use of knowledge
*	[[Information management]]
*	Monitoring and evaluation
*	[[Risk management]]
*	[[Community engagement]]
*	Opportunities for [[collaboration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Integrated natural resource management ===
Integrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. The conceptual basis of INRM has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use, participatory planning, integrated watershed management, and adaptive management.&lt;ref name="Conservation Ecology 52: 25"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lovell, C.|author2=Mandondo A.|author3=Moriarty P.|date=2002|title=The question of scale in integrated natural resource management|publisher=Conservation Ecology 5(2): 25|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol5/iss2/art25/|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling C.S pages 328"&gt;Holling C.S. and Meffe, G. K. 2002 'Command and control and the Pathology of Natural Resource Management. Conservation Biology. vol.10. issue 2. pages 328–337, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling C.S pages 328"/&gt; INRM is being used extensively and been successful in regional and community based natural management.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;ICARDA 2005, Sustainable agricultural development for marginal dry areas, International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, Aleppo, Syria&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frameworks and modelling==
There are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management.

'''Geographic Information Systems (GIS)'''

[[GIS]] is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links. A bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall, cleared land and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Harding R., 1998, Environmental Decision-Making: The Role of Scientists, Engineers and the Public, Federation Press, Leichhardt. pp366.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Metadata Directories such as NDAR provide data on Australian natural resources such as vegetation, fisheries, soils and water.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, C and Attwater, R (1996) Usage of, and demand for Environmental Statistics in Australia, in Tracking Progress: Linking Environment and Economy Through Indicators and Accounting Systems Conference Papers, 1996 Australian Academy of Science Fenner Conference on the Environment, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW, Sydney, 30 September to 3 October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation.

'''Natural Resources Management Audit Frameworks'''

The NSW Government in Australia has published an audit framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|format=PDF|title=Framework for Auditing the  Implementation of Catchment Action Plans|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621122515/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for natural resource management, to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management. This audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies, including [[performance audit]], [[environmental audit]] and [[internal audit]]. Audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders, identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|format=PDF|title=MURRAY CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY : Audit Report|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621120858/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riskaudit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nature-audit-NZ-Accountants-Journal-March-2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nature Audit|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements.

The Australian Government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management, focussing on the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.

==Other elements==
;Biodiversity Conservation

The issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, KJ &amp; Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is "the variety of life" and relate to different kinds of "biodiversity organization". According to Gray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.

;Precautionary Biodiversity Management

The "threats" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of "alien species" and "climate change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;( p.&amp;nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.

;Concrete "policy tools"

Cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on "evidences", relating to "high standard of proof", the forbidding of special "activities" and "information and monitoring requirements". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of "activities" is regarded as a critical and "irreversible" endangerment, these "activities" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to "catch fish" by using explosives and toxicants.

;Administration and guidelines

According to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;

# "[[Ecosystem-based management]]" including "more risk-averse and precautionary management", where "given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management".
# "[[Adaptive management]]" is "a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems".
# "[[Environmental impact assessment]]" and exposure ratings decrease the "uncertainties" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and
# "Protectionist approaches", which "most frequently links to" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.

;Land management

In order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young&lt;ref&gt;Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises some important points of land management:

* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils
* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations
* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills

Dale et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dale, VH, Brown, S, Hawuber, RA, Hobbs, NT, Huntly, Nj Naiman, RJ, Riebsame, WE, Turner, MG &amp; Valone, TJ 2000, ‘Ecological guidelines for land use and management’, in Dale, VH &amp; Hawuber, RA (eds), Applying ecological principles to land management, Springer-Verlag, NY&lt;/ref&gt; study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them. The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways.It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:

* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.
* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.
* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.
* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.
* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.
* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.
* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.
* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.

'''''Philobiblon''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[Central University Library of Cluj-Napoca]], Romania, in collaboration with [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj University Press]] (Presa Universitară Clujeană). It was established in 1996 as a continuation of an irregular publication entitled ''Biblioteca și Învățămîntul'' (''Library and Education'').

The subtitles and publication frequency of the journal have changed several times: ''Bulletin of the Lucian Blaga Central University Library'' (1996−2008), ''Journal of the Lucian Blaga Central University Library'' (2009−2010), and currently: ''Transylvanian Journal of Multidisciplinary Research in Humanities''. Until 2011 it was published annually (except for 1996−1997, when it was also published twice a year).

''Philobiblon'' is available electronically through [[EBSCO Publishing]] and [[ProQuest]] databases, as well as in print. The journal was ranked in 2011 by the [[Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education]] in seven Humanities categories as a periodical having serious chances to gain international import: Arts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_10.pdf|title=Arts|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_9_20121.pdf|title=Philosophy|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_5.pdf|title=Architecture|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; History of Science;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_1.pdf|title=History of Science|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historiography and Theory of History;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_4.pdf|title=Historiography|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian Language and Literature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_7.pdf|title=Language and Literature|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Languages and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncs-nrc.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dom_rev_8.pdf|title=Foreign Languages|publisher=Cncs-nrc.ro|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Until 2011, issues of the journal were thematic, engaging several areas of academic research in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. As of 2011, the journal changed its profile, appearing with two issues per year as an academic journal of multidisciplinary research in humanities, covering research at the confluence of various branches of the humanities and social sciences and promoting the contemporary synergy of sciences (such as, for example, [[medical humanities]]).

Selected articles from ''Philobiblon'' are translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in a series of biannually published [[Anthology|anthologies]] entitled ''Hermeneutica Bibliothecaria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hermeneutica Bibliothecaria |url=http://www.philobiblon.ro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=336&amp;Itemid=76&amp;lang=en |title=Welcome |work=Philobiblon |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep and phonological dyslexia==

Individuals who suffer from phonological dyslexia have the opposite problem to surface dyslexics. These individuals are able to read using the [[Reading education in the United States#Whole Language|whole word method]]. However, they struggle when it comes to [[Reading education in the United States#Phonics|sounding words out]]. Phonological dyslexics are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties when it comes to unfamiliar words or non-words that are pronounceable.&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauvois MF, Dérouesné J |title=Phonological alexia: three dissociations |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=1115–24 |date=December 1979 |pmid=533850 |pmc=490427 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.42.12.1115|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that many phonological dyslexics have a good reading ability if the individual has developed a large vocabulary prior to suffering from brain damage. These individuals seem to stop developing their vocabulary post-brain damage, which affects their reading capacity.&lt;ref name="Derouesne, 1979"/&gt;

Phonological dyslexia is a reading disorder in which the patient has impaired reading of nonwords. The symptoms of phonological dyslexia are very similar to those of [[deep dyslexia]]. The major difference between these two dyslexias is that phonological dyslexics do not make semantic errors associated with deep dyslexia. Beauvois and Dérouesné (1979) studied the first case of phonological dyslexia and came up with this term.&lt;ref name="Welbourne"&gt;{{Citation|title=Proceedings of the 28th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society|author1=Welbourne S.R.|author2=Lambon Ralph M.A.|contribution= Phonological and Surface Dyslexia in a Single PDP Model of Reading|year=2006|pages=2359&amp;ndash;64|place=Mahwah, New Jersey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2006/docs/p2359.pdf|isbn=9780976831822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem people with phonological dyslexia have is that they are able to read words using the whole word method; however, they are not able to sound words out. This means that they are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties reading new words.

Initially it was believed that the factor causing phonological dyslexia was lexicality; however, other factors such as imageability and concreteness also play a critical role in reading. A study done by Crisp and Lambon Ralph concluded that imageability has a significant effect on phonological dyslexia. The study found that eleven out of the twelve patients had more accuracy when reading words with high imageability.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt; In that study, the patient who was the exception was the least severely damaged, contributing to a view of phonological dyslexia and deep dyslexia as points on a continuum rather than discrete disorders.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt;

==Physiology==
Several studies have found that different levels of [[brain damage]] can lead to the occurrence of varying forms of non-word reading disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, R.S., Hawndiges, A.N., Mitchum, C. C., &amp; Wayland, S.C. (1996). An investigation of nonlexical reading impairments. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 13, 763-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dérouesné, J |author2=Beauvois, M F. |chapter=The "phonemic" state in the non-lexical reading process: Evidence from a case of phonological alexia |editors=Coltheart, Max; Patterson, Karalyn; Marshall, John F. |title=Surface dyslexia: neuropsychological and cognitive studies of phonological reading |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1985 |pages= 399–457 |isbn=0-86377-026-6 |oclc=789357383 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that during certain tasks, dyslexics had activated one of two regions of the brain: the [[Broca's area]], which is responsible for speech, or the [[Wernicke's area]], which is responsible for forming and understanding. Both areas were seldom active together. This study has led to the conclusion that there exist neural connection breakdowns between the language centers that may be causing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lishman WA |title=Developmental dyslexia |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=12 |pages=1603–5 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14638872 |pmc=1757419 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.74.12.1603|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyphenation==
An investigation conducted by Harley, T. A., and O'Mara, D.A. (2006) found that [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] significantly improved a participant`s reading ability. The subject suffered from phonological dyslexia that was due to a deficiency in graphemic parsing. The study suggested that hyphenation might be generally useful as a strategy to assist phonological dyslexics.&lt;ref name="Harley, O'Mara, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harley |first1=Trevor A. |last2=O'Mara|first2=David A.|title=Hyphenation can improve reading in acquired phonological dyslexia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=20|issue=8 |year=2006 |pages=744–761 |issn=0268-7038|doi=10.1080/02687030600591658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study==
A study was done by Beauvois and Dérouesné on a 64-year-old man. The individual is described as right-handed, a retiree, and having formerly been an agricultural machinery representative. The individual had had surgery for a left parieto-occipital [[angioma]]. Scans showed a lesion at the left angular gyrus, the posterior part of the second temporal convolution, the [[inferior longitudinal fasciculus]], the geniculostriate fibres and [[tapetum of corpus callosum|tapetum]]. The patient was also found to be suffering from neurological defects such as right inferior quadrantanopia, mild memory deficit, mild calculation impairment, minimal constructional apraxia, and [[astereognosia]]. It was found that the patient did not suffer from motor or sensory defects. He had been obliged to retire as the phonological dyslexia disrupted his ability to work. He had previously enjoyed reading, but was now unable to read his own or other pieces of writing. The diagnosis was confirmed with the Alouette reading test, which concluded that the patient suffered from a reading disability. He was found to have the reading ability of a 6-year-old child, which is considered to be the lowest reading level. The level of reading was not determined from the speed, rather from the fact that the patient was not able to read more than 62 of the stimuli presented in three minutes, while 40% of the represented stimuli were either read incorrectly or left unread. The reading errors included [[adjectives]], [[possessive adjectives]], [[conjunctions]] and [[verbs]].&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"/&gt;

==The dual route cascaded model==
Patients with phonological dyslexia have problem reading non-words and unfamiliar words. According to the dual route model, patients with phonological dyslexia use route 2 or 3 that have intact orthographic input lexicon which allow them to pronounce familiar words whether regular or irregular. However due to phonological dyslexia they are unable to use grapheme-phoneme conversion (Route 1), as route 1 is impaired, thus patients find it difficult to pronounce unfamiliar words and non-words.

A '''pulvinus''' (pl. ''pulvini'') is a [[joint]]-like thickening at the base of a plant [[leaf]] or leaflet that facilitates growth-independent ([[Nyctinasty|nyctinastic]] and [[Thigmonasty|thigmonastic]]) movement. Pulvini are common in members of the bean family [[Fabaceae]] (Leguminosae)&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book|first1=V.H.|last1=Heywood|first2=R.K.|last2=Brummitt|first3=A.|last3=Culham|first4=O.|last4=Seberg, O.|year=2007|title= Flowering plant families of the world|publisher=Firefly Books|location=New York|isbn=9781554072064}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}} and the prayer plant family [[Marantaceae]].&lt;ref name=Heywood /&gt;{{rp|381}}

Pulvini may be present at the base or apex of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] or where the leaflets of a compound leaf are inserted into the [[Rachis#In botany|rachis]]. They consist of a core of [[vascular tissue]] within a flexible, bulky cylinder of thin-walled [[parenchyma]] cells. A pulvinus is also sometimes called a geniculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Pulvinar movement is caused by changes in [[turgor]] pressure leading to a contraction or expansion of the parenchyma tissue. The response is initiated when [[sucrose]] is unloaded from the [[phloem]] into the [[apoplast]]. The increased sugar concentration in the apoplast decreases the [[water potential]] and triggers the efflux of [[potassium]] ions from the surrounding cells. This is followed by an efflux of water, resulting in a sudden change of turgor pressure in the cells of the pulvinus. [[Aquaporins]] on the [[vacuole]] membrane of pulvini allow for the efflux of water that contributes to the change in turgor pressure. The process is similar to the mechanism of [[stoma]]tal closure.

Common examples for pulvinar movements include the night closure movement of [[legume]] leaves and the touch response of the sensitive plant (''[[Mimosa pudica]]''). Nyctinastic movements (sleep movements) are controlled by the [[circadian clock]] and light signal transduction through [[phytochrome]]. Thigmonastic movements (touch response) appear to be regulated through electrical and chemical signal transduction spreading the stimulus throughout the plant.

== Pulvinus in Mimosa Pudica ==
In [[Mimosa pudica]], the internal biological clock mediates the closing of leaflets at night and opening during day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ueda|first1=Minoru|last2=Yamamura|first2=Shosuke|title=Leaf-closing substance of Mimosa pudica L.; chemical studies on another leaf-movement of mimosa II|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|date=9 April 1999|volume=40|issue=15|pages=2981–2984|doi=10.1016/s0040-4039(99)00342-1|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-4039(99)00342-1|accessdate=30 May 2018|issn=0040-4039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seismonastic or rapid movement of leaves is triggered in response touch and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=Hafsa|last2=Sehgal|first2=Sakshi|last3=Mishra|first3=Anurag|last4=Gupta|first4=Rajiv|title=Mimosa pudica L.

[[File:Lead container for nuclear medications.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lead container for iodine-123 capsule]]
'''Radiopharmacology''' or '''medicinal radiochemistry''' is [[radiochemistry]] applied to [[medicine]] and thus the [[pharmacology]] of radiopharmaceuticals ([[medicinal radiocompounds]], that is, [[pharmaceutical drug]]s that are [[radioactive]]). Radiopharmaceuticals are used in the field of [[nuclear medicine]] as [[radioactive tracer]]s in [[medical imaging]] and in [[therapy]] for many [[disease]]s (for example, [[brachytherapy]]). Many radiopharmaceuticals use [[technetium-99m]] (Tc-99m) which has many useful properties as a [[Gamma decay#Radioactive decay (gamma decay)|gamma-emitting]] [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] [[nuclide]]. In the book ''Technetium'' a total of 31 different radiopharmaceuticals based on Tc-99m are listed for imaging and functional studies of the [[brain]], [[myocardium]], [[thyroid]], [[lungs]], [[liver]], [[gallbladder]], [[kidneys]], [[skeleton]], [[blood]] and [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schwochau, Klaus. ''Technetium''. Wiley-VCH (2000). {{ISBN|3-527-29496-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''radioisotope''''', which in its general [[word sense|sense]] refers to any radioactive [[isotope]] ([[radionuclide]]), has historically been used to refer to all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a [[radioactive tracer]] atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a [[gamma camera]] or similar gamma imaging device. An example is [[fludeoxyglucose]] in which [[fluorine-18]] is incorporated into [[deoxyglucose]]. Some radioisotopes (for example [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]]) are used directly as soluble ionic salts, without further modification. This use relies on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the body.

==History==
See [[nuclear medicine]].

==Production==

Production of a radiopharmaceutical involves two processes:

* The production of the [[radionuclide]] on which the pharmaceutical is based.
* The preparation and packaging of the complete radiopharmaceutical.

Radionuclides used in radiopharmaceuticals are mostly radioactive [[isotopes]] of elements with atomic numbers less than that of [[bismuth]], that is, they are radioactive isotopes of elements that also have one or more stable isotopes. These may be roughly divided into two classes:

* Those with more neutrons in the nucleus than those required for stability are known as '''proton-deficient''', and tend to be most easily produced in a [[nuclear reactor]]. The majority of radiopharmaceuticals are based on proton deficient isotopes, with [[technetium-99m]] being the most commonly used medical isotope, and therefore nuclear reactors are the prime source of medical [[radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100708111326.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those with fewer neutrons in the nucleus than those required for stability are known as '''neutron-deficient''', and tend to be most easily produced using a proton accelerator such as a medical [[cyclotron]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/32941/Nuclear_Medicine_Brochure_May08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical use ==
Because radiopharmeuticals require special licenses and handling techniques, they are often kept in local centers for medical radioisotope storage, often known as [[radiopharmacy|radiopharmacies]]. A [[radiopharmacist]] may dispense them from there, to local centers where they are handled at the [[practical medicine]] facility.

==Drug nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals==
As with other pharmaceutical drugs, there is [[standardization]] of the [[drug nomenclature]] for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (INN) gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as atomic weight, no space, element symbol) in parentheses with no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). It is common to see square brackets and superscript superimposed onto the INN name, because [[chemical nomenclature]] (such as IUPAC nomenclature) uses those. The [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP) name gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as element symbol, space, atomic weight) with no parentheses, no hyphen, and no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). The USP style is not the INN style, despite their being described as one and the same in some publications (e.g., ''[[AMA Manual of Style|AMA]],''&lt;ref name="AMA_10e_15.9.2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=[[AMA Manual of Style]] |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |chapter=15.9.2 Radiopharmaceuticals |chapter-url=http://www.amamanualofstyle.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose style for radiopharmaceuticals matches the USP style). The [[United States Pharmacopeia|United States Pharmacopeial Convention]] is a sponsor organization of the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN Council]], and the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] for a given drug is often the same as the USP name.

'''Sandra Metts''' (Ph.D) is a prominent interpersonal communication scholar and Professor Emeritus in the School of Communication at [[Illinois State University]].

Metts has dedicated her academic career to the study of interpersonal and social communication. Her research areas include [[deception]] in close relationships, [[politeness]], [[sexual communication]], relationship engagement, and [[facework]]—face is a social identity that people construct during social interactions. A prolific scholar, Metts has published numerous articles, edited several top journals in her field, and co-authored multiple books. Her research and scholarship in interpersonal communication offers her “the opportunity to move beyond describing how meaning is created." She states, "I can actually offer an explanation of how communication functions in relationships and suggest ways that it can be improved.”

In an interview, she says that her research aims “to contribute to our growing knowledge of what makes relationships succeed or fail. Since we all have friendships, romances, and family ties, the relevance of my work is broad and, I hope, useful.” In addition Metts states all her responsibilities as a teacher are of importance, even the tasks that she may grumble through such a grading exams or putting together effective course packets. She finds her work as a teacher very rewarding. “I guess the most meaningful to me is providing students with the opportunity to have better lives, personally and professionally, to be in control of their communication rather than a victim of it, and to be able to appreciate and facilitate the communication efforts of other people.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cas.illinoisstate.edu/sites/casnews/2005/07/18/faculty-profile-sandra-metts/ |title=Faculty Profile: Sandra Metts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Metts completed both of her Bachelor of Arts degrees (in English Education and Sociology) from [[Western Washington University]]. She has a total of three master's degrees: one in American Literature from the [[University of Washington]], another in Art History from [[Bowling Green University]] and a third in Performance Studies from the [[University of Northern Iowa]]. She earned her Ph.D. in Communication Research from the [[University of Iowa]]. In 1983 Metts joined the faculty at Illinois State University, where she remained until her retirement in 2014. Metts still teaches courses in [[interpersonal communication]] as an emerita professor.

==Awards and honors==
In 2013, Dr. Metts was inducted into the [[Central States Communication Association]]'s (CSCA) Hall of Fame - the highest honor bestowed by the organization - for her commitment to scholarship, mentoring, and service in the field of Communication. In 2013, Metts was also awarded the CSCA Outstanding Mentor Award for her commitment to mentoring students and faculty in the discipline.

Metts served as the CSCA Vice President from 1997-1998 and president from 1998-1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediarelations.illinoisstate.edu/news_releases/1213/feb/mettsrelease.shtml |title=Metts to be Inducted into CSCA Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, she received the College of Arts and Sciences Lecturer Award.

She has also garnered numerous teaching awards throughout her career including [[Illinois State University]]'s Outstanding Teacher Award in 2002-03, the College’s Outstanding Teacher Award in 1989, the International Society for the Study of Personal Relationships Outstanding Teacher Award in 2000, and the Central States Communication Association Outstanding New Teacher Award in 1985.

'''Social gravity''' was an application of [[Newtonian gravity]] to the system of commerce influence.

For instance, in ''The Administration of the Colonies'' (1764), [[Thomas Pownall]] (1722–1805) used the Newtonian concept of "attraction" to form the basis of his political and commercial theory of empire. Pownall's vision provided an important explanation of the mechanism by which colonial theorists understood the possibility of empire being "transferred" from one state to another. Pownall applied the Newtonian concept of gravity to his theory of empire, as evident in his suggestion that the "laws of nature" held the colonies to [[Great Britain]] in a manner "analogous in all cases, by which the center of gravity in the solar system" held the planets in their orbits. In making this analogy, Pownall's notion of 'social gravity' drew upon earlier visions of social cohesion, particularly ideas of sociability in eighteenth-century Britain. These ideas, in turn, were often predicated upon Stoic notions of [[cosmopolitanism]], expressed by the key term [[oikeiôsis]], in order to stress the "moral" imperative for like-minded humans to forge bonds dedicated to the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breuninger |first=Scott |date=Summer 2006 |title='Social Gravity' and the Translatio Tradition in Early American Theories of Empire |journal=Southern Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=70–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Internet}}

The '''sociology of the Internet''' involves the application of sociological theory and method to the [[Internet]] as a source of information and communication. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social implications of the technology; new [[social networks]], [[Virtual community|virtual communities]] and ways of [[Social interaction|interaction]] that have arisen, as well as issues related to [[cyber crime]].

The Internet—[[History of communication|the newest]] in a series of major [[Information revolution|information breakthroughs]]—is of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for [[social research|research]], for example, in using [[online]] [[questionnaires]] instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. The [[sociology]] of the Internet in the stricter sense concerns the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. as found in [[newsgroups]]), [[virtual communities]] and [[Virtual World|virtual worlds]], organizational change catalyzed through [[new media]] such as the Internet, and social change at-large in the transformation from [[Industrial society|industrial]] to [[informational society]] (or to [[information society]]). Online communities can be studied statistically through [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] and at the same time interpreted qualitatively, such as through [[virtual ethnography]]. Social change can be studied through statistical [[demographics]] or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols in online [[media studies]].

==Emergence of the discipline==
The Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. As [[Robert Darnton]] wrote, it is a revolutionary change that "took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it."&lt;ref name="Darnton"&gt;Robert Darnton, ''[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age]'', The New York Review of Books, Volume 55, Number 10. June 12, 2008. Retrieved on 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The [[World Wide Web]] as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when [[graphical interface]] and services like [[email]] became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"&gt;Paul DiMaggio, Eszter Hargittai, W. Russell Neuman, and John P. Robinson, ''Social Implications of the Internet'', Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 27: 307-336 (Volume publication date August 2001), {{doi|10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307}} [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Explorer]] was first released in 1995; [[Netscape]] a year earlier. [[Google]] was founded in 1998.&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; [[Wikipedia]] was founded in 2001. [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], and [[YouTube]] in the mid-2000s. [[Web 2.0]] is still emerging. The amount of information available on the net and the [[Global Internet usage|number of Internet users worldwide]] has continued to grow rapidly.&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; The term '[[digital sociology]]' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0.

==Research trends==
According to DiMaggio et al. (1999),&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains:
# [[Economic inequality|inequality]] (the issues of [[digital divide]])
# [[public]] and [[social capital]] (the issues of [[date displacement]])
# [[political participation]] (the issues of [[public sphere]], [[deliberative democracy]] and [[civil society]])
# [[organization]]s and other economic institutions
# [[cultural participation]] and [[cultural diversity]]

Early on, there were predictions that the Internet would change everything (or nothing); over time, however, a consensus emerged that the Internet, at least in the current phase of development, complements rather than displaces previously implemented [[Media (communication)|media]].&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; This has meant a rethinking of the 1990s ideas of "convergence of new and old media". Further, the Internet offers a rare opportunity to study changes caused by the newly emerged - and likely, still evolving - [[information and communication technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt;

==Social impact==
The Internet has created new forums of [[social interaction]] and [[social relations]] including [[Social network service|social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] and sites such as [[meetup.com]] and [[Couchsurfing]] which facilitate offline interaction.

Though [[virtual communities]] were once thought to be composed of strictly virtual social ties, researchers often find that even those social ties formed in virtual spaces are often maintained both online and offline &lt;ref&gt;Lauren F. Sessions, "How offline gatherings affect online community members: when virtual community members ‘meetup’.""Information, Communication, and Society"13,3(April, 2010):375-395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bo Xie, B. ‘The mutual shaping of online and offline social relationships."Information Research, 1,3(2008):n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ongoing debates about the impact of the Internet on [[strong ties|strong]] and [[weak ties]], whether the Internet is creating more or less [[social capital]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rainie, John Horrigan, Barry Wellman, and Jeffrey Boase. (2006)"The Strength of Internet Ties" Pew Internet and American Life Project. Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N. B., Steinfield, C., &amp; Lampe, C. (2007). The benefits of Facebook "friends:" Social capital and college students' use of online social network sites. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12(4).&lt;/ref&gt; the Internet's role in trends towards social isolation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/18--Social-Isolation-and-New-Technology.aspx|title=Social Isolation and New Technology|date=4 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether it creates a more or less diverse social environment.

It is often said the Internet is a new frontier, and there is a line of argument to the effect that social interaction, cooperation and conflict among users resembles the anarchistic and violent [[American frontier]] of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen. "Military History on the Electronic Frontier: Wikipedia Fights the War of 1812," ''The Journal of Military History'' (October 2012) 76#4  pp 1165-82 [http://www.americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/JMH1812.PDF online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, researchers from the [[Benedictine University at Mesa]] in [[Arizona]] studied how online interactions affect face-to-face meetings. The study is titled, "Face to Face Versus Facebook: Does Exposure to Social Networking Web Sites Augment or Attenuate Physiological Arousal Among the Socially Anxious," published in ''[[Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking]]''.&lt;ref name=Charles-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles|first=Megan|title=Meeting Facebook Friends Face To Face Causes Anxiety (Study) |url=http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/meeting-facebook-friends-face-face-causes-anxiety-study-0803603#!yTDAe|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Business 2 Community|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed 26 female students with electrodes to measure social anxiety. Prior to meeting people, the students were shown pictures of the subject they were expected to meet. Researchers found that meeting someone face-to-face after looking at their photos increases arousal, which the study linked to an increase in social anxiety. These findings confirm previous studies that found that socially anxious people prefer online interactions. The study also recognized that the stimulated arousal can be associated with positive emotions and could lead to positive feelings.&lt;ref name=Woollaston-Facebook&gt;{{cite news|last=Woollaston|first=Victoria|title=Is Facebook making us socially AWKWARD? Meeting face-to-face is more difficult after meeting people online|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2574879/Is-Facebook-making-socially-AWKWARD-Meeting-face-face-difficult-meeting-people-online.html|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has taken the [[Internet of Things]] within its purview, as global networks of interconnected everyday objects are said to be the next step in technological advancement.&lt;ref name="AtzoriIera2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atzori|first1=Luigi|last2=Iera|first2=Antonio|last3=Morabito|first3=Giacomo|last4=Nitti|first4=Michele|title=The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) – When social networks meet the Internet of Things: Concept, architecture and network characterization|journal=Computer Networks|volume=56|issue=16|year=2012|pages=3594–3608|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, global space- and earth-based networks are expanding coverage of the IoT at a fast pace. This has a wide variety of consequences, with current applications in the health, agriculture, traffic and retail fields.&lt;ref name="MatternFloerkemeier2010" /&gt; Companies such as [[Samsung]] and [[Sigfox]] have invested heavily in said networks, and their social impact will have to be measured accordingly, with some sociologists suggesting the formation of socio-technical networks of humans and technical systems.&lt;ref name="Technology Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonite|first1=Tom|title=Silicon Valley to Get a Cellular Network, Just for Things|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527376/silicon-valley-to-get-a-cellular-network-just-for-things/|website=Technology Review|publisher=Technology Review|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kranz"&gt;Kranz, Matthias, Luis Roalter, and Florian Michahelles.

Children can use technology to enhance their learning skills - for example: using online programs to improve the way they learn how to read or do math. The resources technology provides for children may enhance their skills, but children should be cautious of what they get themselves into due to how cyber bullying may occur. [[Cyber bullying]] can cause academic and psychological affects due to how children are suppressed by people who bully them through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.688.1918&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title= Download Limit Exceeded|website= citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When technology is introduced to children they are not forced to accept it, but instead children are permitted to have an input on what they feel about either deciding to use their technological device or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Allison|last= Druin|authorlink=Allison Druin|date= 1999-10-02|title= The Role of Children in the Design Technology|url= https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1028|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=September 2018}} [[Social]] exclusion in the classroom occurs to children who associate themselves more with using computers, which causes them to exclude themselves from the classroom's everyday context due to how they grow more attached to the device. Children who are socially popular are the ones who try and get away from using any form of technological skills they can possibly develop due to how they believe technological devices, such as a computer can be a threat to their social identities.&lt;ref&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/33364239/valentine_antipode.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522504675&amp;Signature=IVvNJYVynCtVOCv4FPrBS03xq0Y%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Digital_Generation_Children_ICT_and.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The routines of children have changed due to their use of the technological device they have been introduced to, but "while the children's health and quality of life benefited from the technology, the time demands of the care routines and lack of compatibility with other social and institutional timeframes had some negative implications".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.york.ac.uk/res/iht/projects/l218252023/Heatonhsc_571.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Children prioritizing their technological device has put a limit on their capabilities to take part in employment, school and in having a social life overall.

Technology can have negative impacts on the lives of children and can be an essential [[learning]] tool that can encourage cognitive, linguistic and social development. Children that use technological devices have had greater gains in problem-solving, intelligence, language skills and structural knowledge in comparison to those children who have not incorporated the use of technology in their learning.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ898529.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In research conducted, "studies did find improvements in student scores on tests closely related to material covered in computer-assisted instructional packages", which demonstrates how technology can have positive influences on children by improving their learning capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED452818.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Problems have arisen between children and their parents as well when parents limit what children can use their technological devices for, specifically what they can and cannot watch on their devices, making children frustrated.&lt;ref name="komunikasi.unsoed.ac.id"&gt;

Studies have found that "the average child in this country{{which?|date=September 2018}} spends over 6 hours each day with some form of mediated communication", meaning that children spend more time with their technological device rather than spending that time with their family or friends.&lt;ref name="komunikasi.unsoed.ac.id"/&gt; The introduction of technology to children has the positive outcome of increasing a child's learning capabilities, but can have the negative outcome of affecting a child's behavior in acting more isolated from the rest of society.

===Political organization and censorship===
{{See also|Internet censorship}}

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the [[United States]] became famous for its ability to generate donations via the Internet, and the 2008 campaign of [[Barack Obama]] became even more so. Increasingly, [[social movements]] and other organizations use the Internet to carry out both traditional and the new [[Internet activism]].

Governments are also getting online. Some countries, such as those of [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] use filtering and censoring software to [[Internet censorship|restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], they also use software to locate and arrest various individuals they perceive as a threat. Other countries including the United States, have enacted laws making the possession or distribution of certain material such as [[child pornography]] illegal but do not use filtering software. In some countries [[Internet service providers]] have agreed to restrict access to sites listed by police.

===Economics===
While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[Electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ "How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World"] ''The Atlantic'' February 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[peer-to-peer charities]], which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites such as [[Donors Choose]] and [[Global Giving]] now allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.

A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''], by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, Oct. 2, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Kiva&amp;st=cse ''Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes''], by Stephanie Strom, in The New York Times, Nov. 8, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. Inspired by interactive websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[eBay]], Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. Web users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ "Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
The Internet has been a major source of [[leisure]] since before the World Wide Web, with entertaining social experiments such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much of the main traffic. Today, many [[Internet forum]]s have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas.

The [[pornography]] and [[gambling]] industries have both taken full advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although governments have made attempts to censor Internet porn, Internet service providers have told governments that these plans are not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=Tom|title=Internet pornography block plans: other attempts to control the internet|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8215030/Internet-pornography-block-plans-other-attempts-to-control-the-internet.html|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=Dec 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also many governments have attempted to put restrictions on both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.

One area of leisure on the Internet is [[MMORPG|online gaming]]. This form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. This has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet.

While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]], to which players of games would typically subscribe. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of gameplay or certain games.

Many use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. As discussed above, there are paid and unpaid sources for all of these, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Discretion is needed as some of these sources take more care over the original artists' rights and over copyright laws than others.

Many use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book holidays and to find out more about their random ideas and casual interests.

People use [[Internet Relay Chat|chat]], [[Instant messaging|messaging]] and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social networking]] websites like [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]] and many others like them also put and keep people in contact for their enjoyment.

The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files, folders, and settings via the Internet.

[[Cyberslacking]] has become a serious drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spends 57 minutes a day surfing the Web at work, according to a study by [[Peninsula Business Services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&amp;id=1001802003 Scotsman.com News - Net abuse hits small city firms]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19996">{{short description|Study of the ultimate distributional or spatial unit occupied by a species}}
'''Spatial ecology ''' studies the ultimate distributional or spatial unit occupied by a [[species]]. In a particular [[habitat]] shared by several species, each of the species is usually confined to its own [[microhabitat]] or spatial niche because two species in the same general territory cannot usually occupy the same [[ecological niche]] for any significant length of time.

==Overview==
In nature, organisms are neither [[Species_distribution#Regular or uniform distribution|distributed uniformly]] nor at [[Species_distribution#Random distribution|random]], forming instead some sort of [[spatial pattern]].&lt;ref name=Legendre&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Legendre | first = P. |author2=Fortin, M.-J.  | title = Spatial pattern and ecological analysis | journal = Plant Ecology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–138 | publisher =  | location =  | year = 1989 | url =  | issn = | doi = 10.1007/BF00048036 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to various energy inputs, [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]], and species interactions that result in spatially patchy structures or [[gradient]]s. This spatial variance in the environment creates diversity in communities of organisms, as well as in the variety of the observed biological and ecological events.&lt;ref name=Legendre/&gt; The type of spatial arrangement present may suggest certain interactions within and between species, such as [[biological competition|competition]], [[predation]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Perry | first = J.N. |author2=A.M.

Gurevitch  | title = Integrating the statistical analysis of spatial data in ecology | journal = Ecography | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 553–557 | publisher =  | location =  | year = 2002 | issn =  | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250505.x | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although spatial ecology deals with spatial patterns, it is usually based on [[Empirical|observational data]] rather than on an [[Scientific modelling|existing model]].&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; This is because nature rarely follows set expected order.  To properly research a spatial pattern or population, the spatial extent to which it occurs must be detected.  Ideally, this would be accomplished beforehand via a benchmark spatial survey, which would determine whether the pattern or process is on a local, regional, or global scale. This is rare in actual field research, however, due to the lack of time and funding, as well as the ever-changing nature of such widely-studied [[organism]]s such as [[insect]]s and [[wildlife]].&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Tobin  | first = P.C. | title = Estimation of the spatial autocorrelation function: consequences of sampling dynamic populations in space and time | journal = Ecography  | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 765–775 | publisher =  | location =  | year = 2004 | url =  | issn =  | doi = 10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03977.x | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With detailed information about a species' life-stages, dynamics, [[demography]], movement, behavior, etc., models of spatial pattern may be developed to estimate and predict events in unsampled locations.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

==History==
Most mathematical studies in ecology in the nineteenth century assumed a uniform distribution of living organisms in their habitat.&lt;ref name=Legendre /&gt; In the past quarter century, ecologists have begun to recognize the degree to which organisms respond to spatial patterns in their environment. Due to the rapid advances in computer technology in the same time period, more advanced methods of statistical data analysis have come into use.&lt;ref name=Liebhold /&gt; Also, the repeated use of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] imagery and [[geographic information systems]] in a particular area has led to increased analysis and identification of spatial patterns over time.&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt;  These technologies have also increased the ability to determine how human activities have impacted animal habitat and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Keitt | first = Timothy H. |author2=Ottar N. Bjørnstad |author3=Philip M. Dixon |author4=Steve Citron-Poust  | title = Accounting for spatial pattern when modeling organism-environment interactions | journal = Ecography | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 616–625 | publisher =  | location =  | year = 2002 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250509.x | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural world has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities; anthropogenic landscape change has had a ripple-effect impacts on wildlife populations, which are now more likely to be small, restricted in distribution, and increasingly isolated from one another. In part as a reaction to this knowledge, and partially due to increasingly sophisticated theoretical developments, ecologists began stressing the importance of spatial context in research. Spatial ecology emerged from this movement toward spatial accountability; "the progressive introduction of spatial variation and complexity into ecological analysis, including changes in spatial patterns over time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rockwood|first=Larry L.|title=Introduction to Population Ecology|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA, USA|isbn=9781405132633|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Scale===
In spatial ecology, scale refers to the spatial extent of ecological processes and the spatial interpretation of the data.&lt;ref name=Fortin&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fortin | first = Marie-Josée | authorlink =  |author2=Mark R. T. Dale   | title = Spatial Analysis: A Guide for Ecologists | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | year = 2005 | location =  | pages =  | url =  | isbn = 978-0-521-80434-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The response of an organism or a species to the environment is particular to a specific scale, and may respond differently at a larger or smaller scale.&lt;ref name=Bellier /&gt; Choosing a scale that is appropriate to the ecological process in question is very important in accurately hypothesizing and determining the underlying cause.&lt;ref&gt;De Knegt; H.J.; F. van Langevelde; M.B.

===Spatial autocorrelation===
[[Spatial analysis#Spatial dependency or auto-correlation|Spatial autocorrelation]] refers to the value of samples taken close to each other are more likely to have similar magnitude than by chance alone.&lt;ref name=Fortin/&gt; When a pair of values located at a certain distance apart are more similar than expected by chance, the spatial [[autocorrelation]] is said to be positive. When a pair of values are less similar, the spatial autocorrelation is said to be negative. It is common for values to be positively autocorrelated at shorter distances and negative autocorrelated at longer distances.&lt;ref name=Legendre /&gt; This is commonly known as [[Tobler's first law of geography]], summarized as "everything is related to everything else, but nearby objects are more related than distant objects".

In ecology, there are two important sources of spatial autocorrelation, which both arise from spatial-temporal processes, such as [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] or [[human migration|migration]]:&lt;ref name="ver Hoef" /&gt;
* True/inherent spatial autocorrelation arises from interactions among individuals located in close proximity. This process is endogenous (internal) and results in the individuals being spatially adjacent in a [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patchy]] fashion.&lt;ref name=Fortin /&gt; An example of this would be [[sexual reproduction]], the success of which requires the closeness of a male and female of the species.
* Induced spatial autocorrelation (or 'induced [[spatial dependence]]') arises from the species response to the spatial structure of exogenous (external) factors, which are themselves spatially autocorrelated.&lt;ref name=Fortin /&gt; An example of this would be the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and [[forage]].

Most ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial autocorrelation, depending on the ecological scale (spatial resolution) of interest. As the spatial arrangement of most ecological data is not random, traditional [[random sample|random population samples]] tend to overestimate the true value of a variable, or infer significant [[correlation]] where there is none.&lt;ref name=Legendre /&gt;  This [[systemic bias|bias]] can be corrected through the use of [[geostatistics]] and other more statistically advanced models. Regardless of method, the sample size must be appropriate to the scale and the spatial statistical method used in order to be valid.&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt;

===Pattern===
Spatial patterns, such as the distribution of a species, are the result of either true or induced spatial autocorrelation.&lt;ref name=Fortin /&gt; In nature, organisms are distributed neither uniformly nor at random. The environment is spatially structured by various ecological processes,&lt;ref name=Legendre/&gt; which in combination with the behavioral response of species’ generally results in:
*Gradients (trends) steady directional change in numbers over a specific distance
*Patches (clumps) a relatively uniform and homogenous area separated by gaps
*Noise (random fluctuations) variation not able to be explained by a model

Theoretically, any of these structures may occur at any given scale.  Due to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, in nature gradients are generally found at the global level, whereas patches represent intermediate (regional) scales, and noise at local scales.&lt;ref name="ver Hoef"/&gt;

The analysis of spatial ecological patterns comprises two families of methods;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Legendre | first = P. | title = Spatial autocorrelation: trouble or new paradigm? | journal = Ecology | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 1659–1673 | publisher = Ecological Science of America | location =  | year = 1993 | issn = 0012-9658 | doi = 10.2307/1939924 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Point pattern analysis deals with the distribution of individuals through space, and is used to determine whether the distribution is random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilschut|first1=L.I.|last2=Laudisoit|first2=A.|last3=Hughes|first3=N.K.|last4=Addink|first4=E.A.|last5=de Jong|first5=S.M|last6=Heesterbeek|first6=J.A.P.|last7=Reijniers|first7=J.|last8=Eagle|first8=S.|last9=Dubyanskiy|first9=V.M.|last10=Begon|first10=M.|title=Spatial distribution patterns of plague hosts: point pattern analysis of the burrows of great gerbils in Kazakhstan|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=2015|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1281-1291|doi=10.1111/jbi.12534|pmc=4737218}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also describes the type of pattern and draws conclusions on what kind of process created the observed pattern. Quadrat-density and the [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] methods are the most commonly used statistical methods.
*Surface pattern analysis deals with spatially continuous phenomena. After the spatial distribution of the variables is determined through discrete sampling, statistical methods are used to quantify the magnitude, intensity, and extent of spatial autocorrelation present in the data (such as [[correlogram]]s, variograms, and peridograms), as well as to map the amount of spatial variation.

==Applications==

===Research===
Analysis of spatial trends has been used to research wildlife management, fire ecology, population ecology, disease ecology, invasive species, marine ecology, and carbon sequestration modeling using the spatial relationships and patterns to determine ecological processes and their effects on the environment.
Spatial patterns have different ecosystem functioning in ecology for examples enhanced productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rietkerk, M. and Van de Koppel, J. 2008 Regular pattern formation in real ecosystems. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 23:169-175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdisciplinary===
The concepts of spatial ecology are fundamental to understanding the spatial dynamics of [[population ecology|population]] and [[community ecology]]. The spatial heterogeneity of populations and communities plays a central role in such ecological theories as [[ecological succession|succession]], [[adaptation]], community stability, [[Competition (biology)|competition]], [[predator-prey interaction]]s, [[parasitism]], and [[epidemic]]s.&lt;ref name=Legendre /&gt; The rapidly expanding field of landscape ecology utilizes the basic aspects of spatial ecology in its research.

The practical use of spatial ecology concepts is essential to understanding the consequences of [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and habitat loss for wildlife. Understanding the response of a species to a spatial structure provides useful information in regards to [[biodiversity|biodiversity conservation]] and habitat restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collinge | first = S.K. | title = Spatial ecology and biological conservation: Introduction | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 100 | issue =  | pages = 1–2 | publisher =  | location =  | year = 2001 | url =  | issn =  | doi = 10.1016/s0006-3207(00)00201-9| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial ecology modeling uses components of remote sensing and [[geographical information system]]s (GIS).

==Statistical tests==

A number of statistical tests have been developed to study such relations.

===Tests based on distance===

;Clark and Evans' R

Clark and Evans in 1954&lt;ref name=Clark1954&gt;Clark PJ, Evans FC (1954) Distance to nearest neighbor as a measure of spatial relationships in populations. Ecology 35: 445–453&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a test based on the density and distance between organisms. Under the [[null hypothesis]] the expected distance ( ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ) between the organisms (measured as the nearest neighbor's distance) with a known constant density ( ''ρ'' ) is

: &lt;math&gt; r_e = \frac { 1 } { 2 \sqrt { \varrho } } &lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the observed ( ''r''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; ) and the expected ( ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ) can be tested with a Z test

: &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{ r_o - r_e } { SE } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; SE = \sqrt{ \frac{ 0.0863 A } { N } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the region sampled and ''N'' is the total number of organisms. For large samples ''Z'' is distributed normally. The results are usually reported in the form of a ratio: ''R'' = ( ''r''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; ) / ( ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; )

;Pielou's α

Pielou in 1959 devised a different statistic.&lt;ref name=Pielou1959&gt;Pielou E C 1959. The use of point-to-plant distances in the study of patterns in plant populations. J Ecol 47: 607-613&lt;/ref&gt; She considered instead of the nearest neighbors the distance between an organism and a set of pre-chosen random points within the sampling area, again assuming a constant density. If the population is randomly dispersed in the area these distances will equal the nearest neighbor distances. Let ''ω'' be the ratio between the distances from the random points and the distances calculated from the nearest neighbor calculations. The ''α'' is

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \pi d \omega &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the constant common density and π has its usual numerical value. Values of α less than, equal to or greater than 1 indicate uniformity, randomness (a [[Poisson distribution]]) or aggregation respectively. Alpha may be tested for a significant deviation from 1 by computing the test statistic

: &lt;math&gt; \chi^2_{ 2n } = 2 n \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

where ''χ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is distributed with 2''n'' degrees of freedom. ''n'' here is the number of organisms sampled.

Montford in 1961 showed that when the density is estimated rather than a known constant, this version of alpha tended to overestimate the actual degree of aggregation. He provided a revised formulation which corrects this error.
There is a wide range of mathematical problems related to spatial ecological models, relating to spatial patterns and processes associated with chaotic phenomena, bifurcations and instability (18).

The '''Sterling-Winthrop Research Centre''' was a research centre in [[Alnwick]].

==History==
It was also known as the Alnwick Research Center. It was part of the Sterling Research Group, owned by [[Sterling Drug]]. It was taken over by Sanofi-Aventis, run by [[Sanofi R&amp;D]].

===Closure===
The site was near a Homebase and Argos. The site was put up for sale by Sanofi-Aventis in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Regulatory-Safety/Sanofi-may-sell-Alnwick-R-D-facility 2009 sale]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It was sited off the [[A1068 road|A1068]] near the junction with the A1, in the south of Alnwick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">Temporary adjustments are set of operations which are performed on a [[theodolite]] to make it ready for taking observations. These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.

==Initial setting==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The measurement axes and scales of a theodolite]]
&lt;div&gt;The initial setting operation includes fixing the theodolite on a [[tripod]], along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For setting up the instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that the centre of the tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through the trivet.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through [[telescope]] conveniently. After this, a [[plumb bob]] is suspended from the bottom of the instrument and it should approximately align with the station mark.&lt;/div&gt;

==Centering==
[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
&lt;div&gt;Centering means bringing the [[vertical axis]] of the theodolite exactly over the station mark.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 341. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]]. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.

==Levelling==
[[File:Green bull's eye level (level).jpg|thumb|Bull's eye level with alignment rings]]
[[File:Theodolite in use.JPG|thumb|Theodolite in use with cones to protect tripod positioning]]
Leveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.

For two spirit vials at right angles;

# Bring one of the level tubes parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward. The bubble moves in the same direction as the left thumb.
# The bubble of the other level tube is then brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating the third foot screw either inward or outward. [In step 1 itself, the other plate level will be parallel to the line joining the third foot screw and the centre of the line joining the previous two foot screws.]
# Repeat Step 2 and step 3 in the same quadrant till both the bubble remain central.
# By rotating the upper part of the instrument through 180°, the level tube is brought parallel to first two-foot screws in reverse order. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment.
Otherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.

The same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:

# Bring the level parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward.
# Rotate the upper part of the instrument through 180°, so the level is over the remaining foot screw. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment. If not adjust this screw to halve the error. Then rotate back through 180 degrees and check the error. Adjust those screws to halve the residual error.  Continue until the bubble is always central on the ring.

==Focusing==
To obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.

* '''Focusing of eyepiece lens'''.
For focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the [[sky]] or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher on Page no. 342. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
To Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.

* '''Focusing of objective lens'''.
It is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the [[telescope]] towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.

==Initial linkage==
The 1993 study by [[Dean Hamer|Hamer]] ''et al.'' examined 114 families of [[Homosexuality|gay]] men in the United States and found increased rates of homosexuality among maternal uncles and cousins, but not among paternal relatives. This pattern of inheritance suggested that there might be linked genes on the [[X chromosome]], since males always inherit their copy of the X chromosome from their mothers.  Polymorphisms  of [[genetic markers]] of the X chromosome were analyzed for 40 families to see if a specific marker was shared by a disproportionate amount of brothers who were both gay. The results showed that among gay brothers, the concordance rate for markers from the Xq28 region were significantly greater than expected for random Mendelian segregation, indicating that a link did exist in that small sample. It was concluded that at least one form of male homosexuality is preferentially transmitted through the maternal side and is genetically linked to the Xq28 region.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

A follow-up study, Hu ''et al.'' (1995), conducted by the Hamer lab in collaboration with two groups of statistical experts in 1995, corroborated the original results for males with homosexual brothers sharing Xq28 at significantly elevated rates.  This study also included heterosexual brothers, who showed significantly less than expected sharing of the Xq28 region, as expected for a genetic locus that in one form is associated with same-sex attraction and in another form is associated with opposite-sex attraction.  In this study no link to Xq28 was found among homosexual females, indicating a different genetic pathway as for most sex-specific phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng1195-248 |title=Linkage between sexual orientation and chromosome Xq28 in males but not in females |year=1995 |last1=Hu |first1=Stella |last2=Pattatucci |first2=Angela M.

===Controversy===
In June 1994, an article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' by [[John Crewdson]] stated that an anonymous junior researcher in Hamer’s laboratory alleged that Hamer selectively presented the data in his 1993 paper in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The junior researcher had assisted in the gene mapping in Hamer's 1993 study. Shortly after voicing her questions, she was summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in Hamer’s lab; who dismissed her could not be determined. Later, she was given another position in a different lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-06-25/news/9506250219_1_dean-hamer-office-of-research-integrity-genes | title=Study On 'Gay Gene' Challenged: Author Defends Findings Against Allegations | publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]], Washington Bureau | date=25 June 1995 | accessdate=19 February 2016 | author=Crewdson, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamer stated that Crewdson's article was "seriously in error" and denied the allegations made against him.&lt;ref name="NoMisconductScience"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaiser J|title=No Misconduct in 'Gay Gene' Study|journal=Science|date=28 Feb 1997|volume=275|issue=5304|page=1251|doi=10.1126/science.275.5304.1251b|pmid=11644902|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5304/1251.2|accessdate=22 March 2016|issn=1095-9203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinnTheScientist"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Finn R|title=Biological Determination Of Sexuality Heating Up As A Research Field|journal=The Scientist|date=8 Jan 1996|volume=10|issue=1|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=10620510|accessdate=22 March 2016|issn=0890-3670}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official inquiry launched by the [[Office of Research Integrity]] (ORI) to investigate  the allegations of selective presentation of the data ended in December 1996.

==Subsequent studies==

Two further studies in the 1990s gave mixed results. One was an X chromosome linkage analysis of 54 pairs of gay brothers carried out by the independent research group of Sanders ''et al.'' in 1998. The results of the study were indistinguishable from the results of the study by Hu ''et al.'': both reported that the chromosomal location of maximum sharing was locus DXS1108 and both reported similar degrees of allele sharing (66% versus 67%).&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99/&gt; The second study by Rice ''et al.'' in [[1999 in science|1999]] studied 52 pairs of Canadian gay brothers and found no statistically significant{{refn|name=statsignifnote|group=note|The linkage analysis by Rice ''et al.'' (1999) ''did'' report that gay brothers shared approximately 46% of their alleles at the Xq28 region. However, this result was not ''statistically significant'' because to show that male sexual orientation is influenced by a gene (or genes) at Xq28 ''in a statistically significant manner'',  their linkage analysis needed to find that gay brothers share more than 50% of their alleles at the Xq28 region. In contrast, analyses by Hamer ''et al.'' (1993), Hu ''et al.'' (1995) and the 1998 study by Sanders ''et al.'' did find greater than 50% allele sharing at Xq28 in gay brothers, thus yielding statistically significant results.&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99 /&gt;}} linkage in [[allele]]s and [[haplotype]]s. Consequently, they concluded against the possibility of any gene in the Xq28 region having a large genetic influence on male sexual orientation (though they could not rule out the possibility of a gene in this region having a small influence).&lt;ref name="WickelgrenScience99"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wickelgren I|title=Discovery of 'Gay Gene' Questioned|journal=Science|date=23 Apr 1999|volume=284|issue=5414|page=571|doi=10.1126/science.284.5414.571|pmid=10328731|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/284/5414/571|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice ''et al.'' also asserted that their results do not exclude the possibility of finding male homosexuality genes elsewhere in the [[human genome|genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rice G|author2=Anderson C|author3=Risch N|author4=Ebers G|title=Male homosexuality: absence of linkage to microsatellite markers at Xq28|journal=Science|date=Apr 1999|volume=284|issue=5414|pages=665–7|doi=10.1126/science.284.5414.665|pmid=10213693|bibcode=1999Sci...284..665R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamer criticized the study for not selecting families for their study population based on maternal transmission as selecting only families that show an excess of maternal gay relatives is necessary to detect the Xq28 linkage.&lt;ref name="WickelgrenScience99"/&gt; A meta-analysis of all  data available at that time (i.e., Hamer ''et al.'' (1993), Hu ''et al.'' (1995), Rice ''et al.'' (1999), and the unpublished 1998 study by Sanders ''et al.'' indicated that Xq28 has a significant but not exclusive role in male sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/285/5429/803a |title=Genetics and Male Sexual Orientation |date=1999-08-06 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |doi=10.1126/science.285.5429.803a |volume=285 |issue=5429 |journal=Science |pages=803a-803|last1=Hamer |first1=D. H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the meta-analysis (which included three authors of the Rice ''et al.'' study, Rice, Risch and Ebers) presented several methodological reasons due to which Rice ''et al.'' (1999) may have been unable to detect statistically significant linkage between Xq28 and male sexual orientation: the families [[genotyping|genotyped]] by Rice ''et al.'' were non-representative as they had an excess of paternal instead of maternal gay relatives thus obscuring the display of any X-chromosome linkage; the [[statistical power]] of their sample was insufficient to adequately detect linkage{{refn|name=statpowernote|group=note|There was a 35% chance that Rice ''et al.'' would not detect Xq28's linkage with homosexuality simply by chance.&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99/&gt;}} and they lacked definite criteria for what constituted as ''homosexuality'' (the researchers depended on their own judgement and sometimes based their judgement on a single question to the subject).&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99/&gt; They also lacked criteria "to select appropriate families for the study of a putative X-linked locus"&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99/&gt; — as they did not select families based on the presence of maternal transmission of homosexuality, the Xq28 contribution to male sexual orientation may have been hidden.&lt;ref name="WickelgrenScience99"/&gt; In addition, the meta-analysis revealed that the family pedigree data of Rice ''et al.'' (1999), in contrast to the genotyping data, seemed to support X chromosome linkage for homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99/&gt;{{refn|name=FamPediData|group=note|Rice ''et al.'' did not include the family pedigree data in their April 1999 report, which described only the genotyping results for a subset of 48 families. The realization that the family pedigree data actually supported X chromosome linkage came later when the data was analysed during the meta-analysis published in August 1999.&lt;ref name=Sciencemetanalysis99/&gt;}}

In 2012, a large, comprehensive [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide linkage study]] of male sexual orientation was conducted by several independent groups of researchers.&lt;ref name=camb20141117&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sanders AR, Martin ER, Beecham GW, Guo S, Dawood K, Rieger G, Badner JA, Gershon ES, Krishnappa RS, Kolundzija AB, Duan J, Gejman PV, Bailey JM |date = November 2014 |title = Genome-wide scan demonstrates significant linkage for male sexual orientation |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0033291714002451 |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume = 45 |issue = 7 |pages = 1379–88 |doi = 10.1017/S0033291714002451 |pmid = 25399360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers from 384 families, who were analyzed with over 300,000 [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] markers. The study confirmed the Xq28 linkage to homosexuality by two-point and multipoint (MERLIN) LOD score mapping. Significant linkage was also detected in the region near the [[centromere]] of [[chromosome 8]], overlapping with one of the regions detected in a previous genomewide linkage study by the Hamer lab. The authors concluded that "our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation." It was the largest study of the genetic basis of homosexuality to date and was published online in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Grant for The Scientist.
