'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]], access to information is a Constitutional right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/greece
|title=Freedom of the Press 2016: Greece |last= |first= |date=2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House|access-date=20 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information is governed by several laws since 1986, but according to [[Transparency International]] Greece the practical implementation of these provisions is quite poor.&lt;ref name=Transparency&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010-09-28_TI_EU_FOI.pdf  |title=Differences in access to information cultures and regulations in EU Member states: A problem for transparency in the EU? |last= |first= |date=2010 |website=Blog.transparency.org |publisher=Transparency International |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the [[Freedom of information legislation#European Union|European Union Directive 2003/98/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html Article 5 of the Administrative Procedures Code — Document Access] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730040742/http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html |date=2007-07-30 }} (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the financial crisis, a new law has been passed in July 2010 providing for the online publication of all decisions involving commitments of funds in the government sector.&lt;ref name=Transparency/&gt;

==FOI provisions under the law==

According to the Greek legal framework, all persons have the right to information in accordance with the law. Restrictions may be imposed only on the basis of reasons specified by law and insofar as they are absolutely necessary and justified for reasons of national security, contrast to [[Organized crime|organised crime]] and of protecting rights and interests of third parties.&lt;ref name=RTI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country/?country_name=Greece  |title=Global Right to Information Rating: Greece |last= |first= |date=1 May 2016 |website=Rti-rating.org |publisher=Global Right to Information Rating |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek access to information law applies to administrative documents, in particular, only to a certain kind of administrative documents, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, replies of the Administration, opinions and resolutions.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

The definition of the "public services" which are subject to access to information law includes all central, regional and local administration, but not the executive branch.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; The law does not specify if it applies also to State-owned enterprises (commercial entities that are owned or controlled by the State), to other public authorities (including constitutional, statutory and oversight body, such as election commission or information commissioner/er, or to private bodies performing a public function or receive significant public funding.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

Competent authorities are obliged to handle the requests and decide on them within the time limit, if any, stipulated by the relevant special provisions, otherwise, within sixty days. In case the request cannot be handled within this time limit, the competent service is obliged to notifying the following to the interested party in writing: the reason for the delay; the public officer to whom the case was assigned and his/her telephone number; the supporting documents that may be missing.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

Costs for accessing information under the FOI law are limited to the actual costs for reproducing the documents.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; According to the Greek access to information law, the competent legislative authority may refuse to satisfy the right of access to information if the documents requested refer to the discussion of the Cabinet of Ministers of if the satisfaction of this right may substantially obstruct the investigation of judicial, police or military authorities concerning the commission of a crime or an administrative violation.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

The refusal to grant access to documents under the FOI law should be justified and notified in writing to the applicant within one month after the submission of the request.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; In case of refusals, applicants can apply to the administrative authority that issued the deed (application for remedy) or for the cancellation thereof to the superior authority of the authority that issued the deed (hierarchical appeal).&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt; The right to lodge an external appeal with an independent oversight body (e.g. an information commission or [[ombudsman]]) is not mentioned by the law, Ombudsman in Greece has a proactive attitude in defence of the access to public document field.&lt;ref name=RTI/&gt;

The principle of transparency in all areas of public life, including media, is expected to be enhanced given that there is an Action Plan Promoting Open Government since 2014 ([[Greek Action Plan 2014-16]]). Technical and institutional changes have been adopted to enhance the principle of transparency and these should lead to the enhancement of the functionality of the [[DIAVGEIA]] project (Transparency Program Initiative),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diavgeia.gov.gr/en|title=DIAVGEIA Project, Transparency Program Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=diavgeia.gov.gr|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the publication of public procurements and to the open, transparent and secure exchange of public documents. The DIAVGEIA project began in October 1, 2010. Under this Transparency Program Initiative, all government institutions are obliged to upload their acts and decisions on the Internet with special attention to issues of national security and sensitive personal data. Each document is digitally signed and assigned a unique Internet Uploading Number (IUN) certifying that the decision has been uploaded at the “Transparency Portal”. Following the latest legislative initiative (Law 4210/2013) of the Ministry of Administrative Reform and e-Governance, administrative acts and decisions are not valid unless published online.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In particular, as to the right to access public information, the innovations provided by the Action Plan promoting Open Government are the following:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*  Acts that are not published in the Official Gazette, are valid and get into force only if they are published on the Transparency Portal
* The uploaded document prevails over all other versions of the act (prototypes in paper)
* Uploaded acts can be used by citizens and the other public authorities without validation, by solely referring to their unique number.

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

Since the beginning of the 21st century ABMs have been deployed in architecture and urban planning to evaluate design and to simulate pedestrian flow in the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G.D.P.A |last2=Wullschleger |first2=Tobias |last3=Müller |first3=Hanspeter |last4=Schmitt |first4=Gerhard |last1=Aschwanden |year=2009 |title=Evaluation of 3D city models using automatic placed urban agents |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=22 |pages=81–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580511001415 |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a growing field of socio-economic analysis of infrastructure investment impact using ABM's ability to discern systemic impacts upon a socio-economic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Paul |last2=Stiff |first2=David |last1=Smetanin |year=2015 |title=Investing in Ontario's Public Infrastructure: A Prosperity at Risk Perspective, with an analysis of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area |journal=The Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis |url=http://www.cancea.ca/sites/economic-analysis.ca/files/reports/CANCEA%20Report%20-%20Investing%20in%20Ontario%27s%20Infrastructure%20FINAL%20Oct%202015%20Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

==Verification and validation==
[[Verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sargent |first1=R.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A. K. |last=Niazi |title=Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems |date=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[University of Stirling]]|hdl=1893/3365 }} PhD Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis also gives details of "exploratory agent-based modeling", "descriptive agent-based modeling" and "validated agent-based modeling", using several worked case study examples.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], an '''ansatz''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ae|t|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzats|lang}}, meaning: "initial placement of a tool at a work piece", plural '''ansätze''' {{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ɛ|t|s|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzɛtsə|lang}} or '''ansatzes''') is an educated guess&lt;ref name="Gershenfeld 1999"&gt;In his book on "The Nature of Mathematical Modelling", Neil Gershenfeld introduces ''ansatz'', with interpretation "a trial answer", to be an important technique for solving differential equations. Gershenfeld 1999, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; that is verified later by its results.

==Use==
An ansatz is the establishment of the starting equation(s), the theorem(s), or the value(s) describing a mathematical or physical problem or solution. It can take into consideration [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]].  After an ansatz has been established (constituting nothing more than an assumption), the equations are solved for the general function of interest (constituting a confirmation of the assumption).

==Examples==
Given a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of experimental data that looks to be [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] about a line, a linear ansatz could be made to find the [[parameter]]s of the line by a [[least squares]] curve fit. [[Calculus of variations|Variational]] [[approximation]] methods use ansätze and then fit the parameters.

Another example could be the mass, energy, and entropy balance equations that, considered simultaneous for purposes of the elementary operations of [[linear algebra]], are the ''ansatz'' to most basic problems of [[thermodynamics]].

Another example of an ansatz is to suppose the solutions of a homogeneous linear [[differential equation]] and [[difference equation]] to have, respectively, exponential and power form. More generally, one can guess a particular solution of a system of equations and test such an ansatz by direct substitution of the solution in the system of equations.

{{About|the ancient Indian concept of human life stages|spiritual hermitage|Ashram}}

An '''''Ashrama''''' in [[Hinduism]] is one of four age-based life stages discussed in Indian texts of the ancient and medieval eras.&lt;ref name=patrick&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Āśrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{oclc|466428084}}, pages 1–29, 84–111&lt;/ref&gt; The four ashramas are: ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' (student), ''[[Grihastha]]'' (householder), ''[[Vanaprastha]]'' (retired) and  ''[[Sannyasa]]'' (renunciate).&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;

The ''Ashrama'' system is one facet of the ''[[Dharma]]'' concept in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=aw2/&gt; It is also a component of the ethical theories in Indian philosophy, where it is combined with four proper goals of human life (''[[Purusartha]]''), for fulfilment, happiness and spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=aw0/&gt;

==Ashram system==
Under the Ashram system, the human lifespan was divided into four periods.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath, Pradeep (2005), p. 39"&gt;Chakkarath, Pradeep (2005), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rama, p. 467"&gt;Rama, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of each period was the fulfilment and development of the individual. The classical system, in the ''[[Ashrama Upanishad]]'', the ''[[Vaikhanasa Dharmasutra]]'' and the later ''[[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmashastra]]'', presents these as sequential stages of human life and recommends ages for entry to each stage, while in the original system presented in the early ''[[Dharmasutras]]'' the Ashramas were four alternative available ways of life, neither presented as sequential nor with age recommendations.&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), Dharma, in The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, page 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashrama and Purushartha==
The Ashramas system is one facet of the complex [[Dharma]] concept in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=aw2&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 237–239&lt;/ref&gt; It is integrated with the concept of [[Purushartha]], or four proper aims of life in Hindu philosophy, namely, [[Dharma]] (piety, morality, duties), [[Artha]] (wealth, health, means of life), [[Kama]] (love, relationships, emotions) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom, self-realization).&lt;ref name=aw2/&gt; Each of the four Ashramas of life are a form of personal and social environment, each stage with ethical guidelines, duties and responsibilities, for the individual and for the society. Each Ashrama stage places different levels of emphasis on the four proper goals of life, with different stages viewed as steps to the attainment of the ideal in Hindu philosophy, namely [[Moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither ancient nor medieval texts of India state that any of the first three Ashramas must devote itself solely to a specific goal of life (''Purushartha'').&lt;ref name=paol&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Āśrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{oclc|466428084}}, pages 216–219&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth stage of ''Sannyasa'' is different, and the overwhelming consensus  in ancient and medieval texts is that ''Sannyasa'' stage of life must entirely be devoted to ''Moksha'' aided by ''Dharma''.&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

''Dharma'' is held primary for all stages. ''Moksha'' is the ultimate noble goal, recommended for everyone, to be sought at any stage of life. On the other two, the texts are unclear.&lt;ref name=paol/&gt; With the exception of [[Kamasutra]], most texts make no recommendation on the relative preference on Artha or Kama, that an individual must emphasise in what stage of life. The Kamasutra states,&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

{{Quote|
The life span of a man is one hundred years. Dividing that time, he should attend to three aims of life in such a way that they support, rather than hinder each other. In his youth he should attend to profitable aims ([[artha]]) such as learning, in his prime to pleasure ([[kama]]), and in his old age to [[dharma]] and [[moksha]].|Kamasutra 1.2.1 – 1.2.4|Translated by Patrick Olivelle &lt;ref name=paol/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Berkeley school of political theory''' is a [[school of thought]] in [[political theory]] associated originally with the work of faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], some of whom formulated and popularized its ideas. The school of thought was founded by [[Sheldon Wolin]], [[Hanna Pitkin]],&lt;ref&gt;"In light of Pitkin's long association with Berkeley, it is no surprise that academic lore frequently connects her work to a 'Berkeley School' of political theory, said to have flourished in the 1960s and '70s.", Mathiowetz, 2016, p.5 of the PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Rogin]], [[John Schaar]], and [[Norman Jacobson]], among others, and has been carried on by theorists including [[Wilson Carey McWilliams]] and [[J. Peter Euben]].&lt;ref name="grimes-obit"&gt;William Grimes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/sheldon-s-wolin-theorist-who-shifted-political-science-back-to-politics-dies-at-93.html "Sheldon S.

The Berkeley school has been characterized as returning political theory back in the direction of politics and political action, and away from efforts to center "scientific" models such as economics, psychology, sociology, and the natural sciences, specifically [[behavioralism]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="mathiowetz-2016"&gt;Mathiowetz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes-obit" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">The '''Black Horse''' was a study concept for a proposed winged [[single-stage to orbit]] [[spaceplane]] that would use [[aerial refueling]] to greatly reduce the size of the spacecraft, to about the size of an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. The original concept was proposed in 1993 by [[US Air Force]] Captain Mitchell Burnside Clapp, who was familiar with the Air Force's use of aerial refueling to extend the performance of combat aircraft. The concept was further developed by others, including an even smaller concept developed by [[Robert Zubrin]], '''Black Colt'''. Clapp left the Air Force in 1996 and partnered with Zubrin to form [[Pioneer Rocketplane]], who proposed a slightly larger version known as '''Pathfinder'''. This has since become the [[Pathfinder XL]] concept.

Clapp proposed Black Horse as a solution to the Air Force's ongoing TransAtmospheric Vehicle (TAV) mission. The concept was picked up by the [[Phillips Laboratory]], and over the winter of 1993-94 they carried out a six-week study with WJ Schafer Associates and Conceptual Research Corporation (an aircraft design firm) into what was now known as the Aerial Propellant Transfer (APT) concept. APT was based on using as many off-the-shelf components as possible and considered a wide variety of possible propellants. Wishing to use only non-cryogenic fuels, they favored the use of conventional [[JP-5]] [[jet fuel]] with [[hydrogen peroxide]] as the [[oxidizer]]. Other mixes considered, mostly for comparison purposes, were [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX), [[methane]]/LOX, and [[RP-1]]/LOX. Although the performance of the alternate fuels was higher, they all included at least one cryogenic component and were much less dense. Using peroxide had the additional advantage of cooling the combustion, which allowed the use of conventional JP-5 rather than the more expensive RP-1.{{sfn|Zubrin|Clapp|1995}}

The study demonstrated that Black Horse would outperform any [[VTHL|vertical take-off/horizontal landing]] concept no matter what fuel it used. The study also noted that the speed that the aerial fuel transfer took place was a key input to the overall performance of the system. Black Horse was deliberately designed to use existing [[tanker aircraft]], specifically the KC-135Q and T models, which had fuel tanks completely separate from the aircraft's own fuel system (most models allowed the 135's engines to draw from the tanks). However, performance was slightly increased if the transfer took place in the [[supersonic]] regime at Mach 3.0, and dramatically increased, almost doubled, if it was [[hypersonic]] at Mach 5.5.{{sfn|Zubrin|Clapp|1995}}

The concept was also picked up by Zubrin, who was then working at [[Martin Marietta]], who carried out their own design series from January to May 1994. This developed the smaller Black Colt concept. Clapp and Zubrin later wrote an extensive article on the concepts in the June 1985 edition of [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']] magazine.{{sfn|Zubrin|Clapp|1995}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Blau space''' consists of the multidimensional [[coordinate system]], created by considering the set of [[demographics|socio-demographic]] variables as dimensions.  All socio-demographic characteristics are potential elements of Blau space, including continuous characteristics such as age, years of education, income, occupational prestige, geographic location, and so forth. In addition, categorical measures of socio-demographic characteristics such as race, sex, religion, birthplace, and others are Blau dimensions. "Blau space" is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct which was developed by Miller McPherson and named after [[Peter Blau]].  It was later elaborated by McPherson and Ranger-Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McPherson, Miller|title=Ecology of Affiliation|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=48|year=1983|pages=519–532|doi=10.2307/2117719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=Miller|first2=James|last2=Ranger-Moore|title=Evolution on a Dancing Landscape: Organizations and Networks in Dynamic Blau Space|journal=Social Forces|volume=70|year=1991|pages=19–42|jstor=10.2307/2580060|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1991/mcpherson1991a.pdf|doi=10.1093/sf/70.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizing force in Blau space is the [[homophily]] principle, which argues that the [[information flow|flow of information]] from person to person is a declining function of [[distance function|distance]] in Blau space.  Persons located at great distance in Blau space are very unlikely to interact, which creates the conditions for social differences in any characteristic that is transmitted through social [[communication]].  The homophily principle thus localizes communication in Blau space, leading to the development of social [[ecological niche|niche]]s for human activity and [[social organization]].

Although the idea of Blau Space was originally developed to consider individuals, it was extended to the context of cities (and other urban units) in Neal's "Building a Blauürban Space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zachary P.

In [[social science]], the term '''built environment''', or '''built world''', refers to the [[human impact on the environment|human-made surroundings]] that provide the setting for [[human behavior|human activity]], ranging in scale from buildings to parks. It has been defined as "the human-made space in which people live, work, and recreate on a day-to-day basis."&lt;ref name=roof&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roof|first=K|author2=Oleru N.|title=Public Health: Seattle and King County's Push for the Built Environment.|journal=J Environ Health|year=2008|volume=75|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "built environment encompasses places and spaces created or modified by people including buildings, parks, and transportation systems." In recent years,{{when|date=January 2015}} [[public health]] research has expanded the definition of "built environment" to include [[healthy diet|healthy]] [[food security|food access]], [[community gardening|community garden]]s, [[mental health]],&lt;ref&gt;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44398590/14-IJTPE-Issue26-Vol8-No1-Mar2016-pp81-87.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1483131396&amp;Signature=gIDntD2bsxFSNNgi%2BR2REeETjFc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIJTPE_Journal_IMPACT_OF_BUILT_ENVIRONMEN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Assari, A Birashk, B Nik, M Mousavi Naghdbishi, R|year=2016|title=IMPACT OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT ON MENTAL HEALTH: REVIEW OF TEHRAN CITY IN IRAN|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44398590/14-IJTPE-Issue26-Vol8-No1-Mar2016-pp81-87.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1483131396&amp;Signature=gIDntD2bsxFSNNgi%2BR2REeETjFc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIJTPE_Journal_IMPACT_OF_BUILT_ENVIRONMEN.pdf|journal=International Journal on Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering|volume=8 |issue=26|pages=81–87|via=IJTPE}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[walkability]]", and "[[bikeability]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=V|title=Strategies for Enhancing the Built Environment to Support Healthy Eating and Active Living|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/component/jlibrary/article/id-60/127.htm|work=Prevention Institute|accessdate=29 April 2012|author2=Mikkelsen, L|author3=Srikantharajah, J|author4=Cohen, L}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Early concepts of built environment date to [[Classical Antiquity]]: [[Hippodamus]] of [[Miletos]], known as the "father of urban planning,"{{by whom|date=January 2015}} developed [[Ancient Greece|Greek cities]] from 498&amp;nbsp;BC to 408&amp;nbsp;BC that created order by using grid plans that mapped the city. These early city plans eventually gave way to the City Beautiful movement in the late&amp;nbsp;1800s and early&amp;nbsp;1900s, inspired by [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]], a reformist for the Progressivism movement who actively promoted "a reform of the landscape in tandem with political change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/citybeautiful/city.html |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was in partnership with others who believed that beautifying American cities would improve the moral compass of the cities and encourage the upper class to spend their money in cities. This beautification process included parks and architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture: The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/61.html|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-century modernist "indifferent" design influenced the character of work and public spaces, followed by what Alexander describes as a late twentieth century "revival of interest relating to the concept of place (including the built environment), and its relevance to mental health and other fields of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Donald|date=2008|title=Physical determinism, modernism and mental health|journal=Environments|issue=35 no.3|doi=|pmid=|hdl=10613/2722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern built environment==
Currently, built environments are typically used to describe the [[interdisciplinary]] field that addresses the design, construction, management, and use of these man-made surroundings as an interrelated whole as well as their relationship to human activities over time (rather than a particular element in isolation or at a single moment in time). The field is generally not regarded as a traditional profession or [[academic discipline]] in its own right, instead drawing upon areas such as [[economics]], law, [[public policy]], public health, [[management]], [[geography]], design, engineering, technology, and [[environmental sustainability]]. Within the field of public health, built environments are referred to as building or renovating areas in an effort to improve the community's well-being through construction of “aesthetically, health improved, and environmentally improved landscapes and living structures”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Built Environment and Health: 11 Profiles of Neighborhood Transformation|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/index.php?option=com_jlibrary&amp;view=article&amp;id=114&amp;Itemid=127|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: community forest user group in Nepal is multidimensional institution, which serves goods and services to the communities through natural resource management (see [[Climate change adaptation in Nepal]]).

==Public health==
In public health, built environment refers to physical environments that are designed with health and wellness as integral parts of the communities. Research has indicated that the way neighbourhoods are created can affect both the physical activity and mental health of the communities’ residents.&lt;ref name=renalds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Renalds|first=A|author2=Smith, T|author3=Hale, P|title=A Systematic Review of Built Environment and Health|journal=Family and Community Health|year=2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1097/fch.0b013e3181c4e2e5|pmid=20010006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that built environments that were expressly designed to improve physical activity are linked to higher rates of physical activity, which in turn, positively affects health.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=C|author2=Aytur, S|author3=Gardner, K|author4=Rogers, S|title=Complexity in Built Environment, Health, and Destination Walking: A Neighborhood-Scale Analysis|journal=J Urban Health|year=2012|volume=89|issue=2|pages=270–84|doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9652-8|pmid=22350512|pmc=3324613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WTM3 Gnarly 0028.jpg|thumb|A separated bike lane in New York City.]]
Neighbourhoods with more [[walkability]] had lower rates of [[obesity]] as well as increased physical activity among its residents. They also had lower rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], higher [[social capital]], and less [[alcohol abuse]]. Walkability features in these neighbourhoods include safety, [[sidewalk]] construction, as well as destinations in which to walk.&lt;ref name=renalds /&gt; In addition, the perception of a walkable neighbourhood, one that is perceived to have good sidewalks and connectivity, is correlated with higher rates of physical activity.&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt;

Assessments of walkability have been completed through the use of [[GIS]] programs, such as the Street Smart Walk Score. This example of a walkability assessment tool determines distances to grocery stores and other amenities, as well as connectivity and intersection frequency using specific addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walk Score Methodology|url=http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085256/http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments such as the Street Smart Walk Score can be utilized by city and country planning departments to improve existing walkability of communities. 

To implement walkable neighbourhoods, community members and local leaders should focus on policy development. An effective framework that has been utilized in an abundance of communities is the Complete Streets concept of community planning that has been developed by the National Complete Streets Coalition (NCSC). &lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete Streets local policy workbook, Smart Growth America| url=https://smartgrowthamerica.org/resources/complete-streets-local-policy-workbook|archivedate=21 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCSC states that the most successful policies are those that reflect input from a broad group of stakeholders, including transportation planners and engineers, elected officials, transit agencies, public health departments, and members of the community. &lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; According to Riggs, 2016, policies may focus on a “Complete Streets” investment, which includes sidewalk bulb-outs and refuges to reduce crossing distances or street widths for pedestrians. Other investments should include installing crosswalks, road markings, benches, shelters and sidewalk art installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riggs|first1=William|title=Inclusively walkable: exploring the equity of walkable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area|journal=Local Environment|volume=21|issue=5|pages=527–554|doi= 10.1080/13549839.2014.982080|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every community will have a unique method of policy development depending on whether it is an urban, suburban, or rural community and how the policy will combine the variety of transportation modalities. Communities may choose to focus on walkability, but will also need to consider biking, wheeling/rolling, driving, and emergency vehicles. The NCSC policy workbook gives descriptive guidance on how to proceed with policy development whether they be council-driven, council-approved, directives, or citizen vote. &lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; When deciding how to proceed with walkability policy development, considerations should be made regarding current and past transportation policies, local community and government support, and how transportation policies have been implemented in the past. 

[[File:Community garden.jpg|thumb|A [[community garden]] located in Montreal, Canada.]]
Public health also addresses additional components of built environments including “[[bikeability]]” and healthy food access such as proximity to grocery stores and [[community garden]]s. Bikeability refers to the access that an area has granted to safe biking through multiple bike paths and [[bike lane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horacek|first=TM|author2=White AA|author3=Greene GW|title=Sneakers and spokes: an assessment of the walkability and bikeability of U.S. postsecondary institutions|journal=J Environ Health|year=2012|volume=74|issue=2|pages=8–15|display-authors=etal|pmid=21949979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both walkability and bikeability have been cited as determinants of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochrane|first=T|author2=Davey, R|title=Increasing uptake of physical activity: A social ecological approach|journal=J R Soc Promot Health|year=2008|volume=128|issue=1|pages=31–40|pmid=18274328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to healthy food is also an important component of the built environment. A higher density of convenience stores has been associated with obesity in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grafova|first=I|title=Overweight Children: Assessing The Contribution Of The Built Environment.|journal=Prev Med|year=2008|volume=47|issue=3|pages=304–308|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.04.012|pmid=18539318}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, improved access to community supermarkets and farmer's markets is correlated with lower overweight status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahman|first=T|author2=Cushing RA|author3=Jackson RJ|title=Contributions of built environment to childhood obesity|journal=Mt Sinai J Med|year=2011|volume=78|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1002/msj.20235|pmid=21259262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in low income neighbourhoods, the presence of a local grocery store is correlated with lower BMI/overweight risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zick|first=C|author2=Smith, K|author3=Fan, J|author4=Brown, B|author5=Yamada, I|author6=Kowaleski-Jones, L|title=Running to the store?

The intersection of public health with other disciplines is evident in the design process of built environments which includes [[environmental planning]], [[policy development]] and [[land-use planning]].&lt;ref name=roof /&gt; Research suggests that people are more active in [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use communities]] or those that incorporate retail and residential and densely populated areas as well as those with good street connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heath|first=G|author2=Brownson, R|author3=Kruger, J|title=The effectiveness of urban design and land use and transport policies and practices to increase physical activity: a systematic review|journal=J Phys Act Health|year=2006|volume=3|issue=s1|pages=S55–S76|display-authors=etal|pmid=28834525|doi=10.1123/jpah.3.s1.s55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who preferred to walk and live in walkable environments often have lower obesity rates and drive less compared to those who preferred living in auto-dependent environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=L|author2=Saelens, B|author3=Powell, K|author4=Chapmen, J|title=Stepping towards causation: Do built environments or neighborhood and travel preferences explain physical activity, driving, and obesity?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2007|volume=65|issue=9|pages=1898–1914|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.053 |pmid=17644231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built environments containing recreational facilities have been associated with greater physical activity among children.&lt;ref name="Sallis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallis |first1=James F. |last2=Floyd |first2=Myron F. |last3=Rodriguez |first3=Daniel A. |last4=Saelens |first4=Brian E. |title=The Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity, Obesity, and CVD |journal=Circulation |date=February 2012 |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=729–37 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.969022 |pmid=22311885 |pmc=3315587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study found that walking paths, parks with playgrounds, swimming areas, basketball courts and other various recreational facilities increased physical activity among adolescent girls. &lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Ashwood |first2=Scott |last3=Scott |first3=Molly M. |last4=Overton |first4=Adrian |last5=Evenson |first5=Kelly R. |last6=Staten |first6=Lisa K. |last7=Porter |first7=Dwayne |last8=McKenzie |first8=Thomas L. |last9=Catellier |first9=Diane |title=Public Parks and Physical Activity Among Adolescent Girls |journal=Pediatrics |date=November 2006 |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=e1381–9 |pmid=17079539 |pmc=2239262 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/5/e1381.long?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token |accessdate=October 29, 2018|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning and its utilization of mixed use development are key factors affecting childhood obesity. Mixed use spaces are composed of residential, commercial, cultural, and institutional components. &lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planning and Community Health Research Center: Mixed Use Development |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207034351/https://www.planning.org/nationalcenters/health/mixedusedevelopment.htm |website=American Planning Association |accessdate=October 29, 2018|date=2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of development helps to reduce the distance residents have to travel to access a grocery store or school. It also creates a more walkable and bike friendly environment for residents. It has been proven that high-density environments, meaning mixed use spaces and neighborhoods with higher walkability and bikeability, will increase physical activity. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; A multivariable cross-sectional study done by the Harvard School of Public Health examined the association of walkable built environment characteristics with body mass index (BMI) scores among a large sample of children and adolescents. &lt;ref name="duncan2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Dustin T. |last2=Sharifi |first2=Mona |last3=Melly |first3=Steven J. |last4=Marshall |first4=Richard |last5=Sequist |first5=Thomas D. |last6=Rifas-Shiman |first6=Sheryl L. |last7=Taveras |first7=Elsie M. |title=Characteristics of walkable built environments and BMI z-scores in children: evidence from a large electronic health record database |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=December 2014 |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=1359–65 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1307704|pmid=25248212 |pmc=4256697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight geographic information system variables were used to characterize a walkable built environment. (1) A distance less than 15 km to a private or public recreational open space has been linked to an increase in physical activity among children. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt;This may be due to the influence children have on one another when they see others playing.&lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (2) Also, a higher number of open spaces increases the likelihood of physical activity among children. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (3) A more densely populated residential area can increase children’s proximity to their peers creating a more walkable environment. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (4) Less traffic density can also increase physical activity among children because their parents feel safe when they are walking in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (5-7) Lower neighborhood speed limits with more sidewalks and intersections also create a safer environment for children increasing their likelihood to walk in the neighborhood. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (8) Finally, a greater variety of land use mix, or mixed use spaces, result in more children walking. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; These built environment characteristics that can increase walkability were found to be generally associated with a lower BMI scores among the children sampled. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; Another study looking at active commuting, those reporting walking, biking, or skateboarding to school more than three times a week, among elementary aged children had significantly lower BMI than non-active commuters. &lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Dori E. |last2=Sallis |first2=James F. |last3=Conway |first3=Terry L. |last4=Cain |first4=Kelli L. |last5=McKenzie |first5=Thomas L. |title=Active Transportation to School Over 2 Years in Relation to Weight Status and Physical Activity |journal=Obesity |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=1771–6 |date=September 2012 |doi=10.1038/oby.2006.204 |pmid=17062807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reason, mixed use lands within the built environment are imperative to helping address childhood obesity. Urban sprawl, which has been positively associated with increased obesity, and an overall decline in active transportation in recent decades presents a real need for improving health within the built environment. &lt;ref name="Rosenberg" /&gt; &lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Russ |title=Urban Sprawl and Risk for Being Overweight or Obese |journal=Am J Public Health |date=September 2004 |volume=94 |issue=9 |pages=1574–9 |pmid=15333317 |pmc=1448496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-density environments bring schools, parks, and grocery stores closer to residents making it convenient to potentially eat healthier foods and exercise on a regular basis. Comprehensive urban planning, such as mixed use development, promotes healthier lifestyles in general. 

The strength of the evidence for reducing obesity through environment has been highlighted by the [[Center for Disease Control]] in its Common Community Measures for Obesity Prevention Project, which includes measures of healthy food access and physical activity environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=LK|author2=Sobush K|author3=Keener D|title=Recommended community strategies and measurements to prevention obesity in the United States|journal=MMWR Recomm Rep|year=2009|volume=58|issue=RR-7|pages=1–26|display-authors=etal|pmid=19629029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25682">'''Cellular manufacturing''' is a process of manufacturing which is a subsection of [[just-in-time manufacturing]] and [[lean manufacturing]] encompassing group technology. The goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as possible, make a wide variety of similar products, while making as little waste as possible. Cellular manufacturing involves the use of multiple "cells" in an [[assembly line]] fashion. Each of these cells is composed of one or multiple different machines which accomplish a certain task. The product moves from one cell to the next, each station completing part of the manufacturing process.  Often the cells are arranged in a "U-shape" design because this allows for the overseer to move less and have the ability to more readily watch over the entire process. One of the biggest advantages of cellular manufacturing is the amount of flexibility that it has. Since most of the machines are automatic, simple changes can be made very rapidly. This allows for a variety of scaling for a product, minor changes to the overall design, and in extreme cases, entirely changing the overall design. These changes, although tedious, can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Toyota Way|last = Liker|first = Jeffery|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2004|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 31, 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output, such as a part or a set of instructions. These cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output, and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly. Once implemented, cellular manufacturing has been said to ''reliably'' create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory, space and lead time required to create a product. It is for this reason that the one-piece-flow cell has been called "the ultimate in lean production."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Cellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology, which were proposed by [[Ralph Flanders|Flanders]] in 1925&lt;ref&gt;5.	Flanders, R.E. 1925. Design, manufacture, and production control of a standard machine. ''Transactions of ASME'', Vol. 26, 691-738.&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted in Russia by [[Sergei Petrovich Mitrofanov|Mitrofanov]] in 1933 (whose book&lt;ref&gt;6.	Mitrofanov, S.P. 1959. ''The scientific principles of group technology''. Leningrad (trans. By J.L. Grayson, Birmingham University).&lt;/ref&gt; was translated into English in 1959). Burbidge actively promoted group technology in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;4.	Burbidge, J.L. 1975. ''The Introduction to Group Technology''. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; "Apparently, Japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the 1970s," and in the 1980s cells migrated to the United States as an element of just-in-time (JIT) production.&lt;ref&gt;Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit. p 20&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first English-language books to discuss cellular manufacturing, that of Hall in 1983, referred to a cell as a “U-line,” for the common, or ideal, U-shaped configuration of a cell&lt;ref&gt;7.	Hall, Robert W. 1983. ''Zero Inventories''. Homewood, Ill., Dow Jones-Irwin. pp 120-126&lt;/ref&gt;—ideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster, affording high visibility and contact. By 1990 cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in JIT manufacturing, so much so that Harmon and Peterson, in their book, ''Reinventing the Factory'', included a section entitled, "Cell: Fundamental Factory of the Future".&lt;ref&gt;8.	Harmon, R.L., and L.D. Peterson. 1990. ''Reinventing the Factory: Productivity Breakthroughs in Manufacturing Today''. New York: Free Press. pp 118-123&lt;/ref&gt; Cellular manufacturing was carried forward in the 1990s, when just-in-time was renamed lean manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;2.	Black, J. T., and Steve L. Hunter. 2003. op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, when JIT/lean became widely attractive in the service sector, cellular concepts found their way into that realm; for example, Hyer and Wemmerlöv’s final chapter is devoted to office cells.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 573-617&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell design==
Cells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow. This is accomplished by bringing together operations (or machines, or people) involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another, distinct from other groups. This grouping is called a cell. These cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing ''one-piece flow'' to occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Toyota Product Development System|last = Morgan|first = J.M.|publisher = Productivity Press|year = 2006|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one-piece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces, requiring assembly. First, the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell, where they would be welded together, then polished, then coated, and finally packaged. All of these steps would be completed in a single cell, so as to minimize various factors (called [[No value added|non-value-added]] processes/steps) such as time required to transport materials between steps. Some common formats of single cells are: the U-shape (good for communication and quick movement of workers), the straight line, or the L-shape. The number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production. For example, if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled, four workers should be placed in the cell. Similarly, if demand halves, one worker will occupy the cell. Since cells have a variety of differing equipment, it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Figure 8-4 from The Toyota Way.png|thumb|This figure from The Toyota Way shows the design of a U-shaped cell, graphing the paths of two employees through it.|188x188px]]While there exist many advantages to forming cells, there are some obvious benefits. It is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie, such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive. Resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above 100% in many cases. In addition to this, formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturing/assembly environment (by having inventory only where it is absolutely required), improves safety in the work environment (due to smaller quantities of product/inventory being handled), improves morale (by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees), reduces cost of inventory, and reducing inventory obsolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When formation of a cell would be too difficult, a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow, that is, to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand (this rate is called the ''[[Takt time|takt]]'' [[Takt time|time]]). This is referred to as the Pacemaker Process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the advantages of designing for one-piece-flow, the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation. Use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|"A cell is a small organizational unit...designed to exploit similarities in how you process information, make products, and serve customers. Manufacturing cells [closely locate] people and equipment required for processing families of like products. [Prior to cellularization, parts] may have traveled miles to visit all the equipment and labor needed for their fabrication... After reorganization, families of similar parts are produced together within the physical confines of cells that house most or all of the required resources,...facilitating the rapid flow and efficient processing of material and information... Furthermore, cell operators can be cross-trained in several machines, engage in job rotation, and assume responsibilities for tasks [that] previously belonged to supervisors and support staff [including] activities such as planning and scheduling, quality control, trouble-shooting, parts ordering, interfacing with customers and suppliers, and record-keeping."&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit. p 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows. Moreover, the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow build-ups of inventory between cell stations. To formalize that advantage, cells often have designed-in rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations. Such a rule is known, in JIT/lean parlance, as [[kanban]] (from the Japanese), which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station. (Discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 332-338&lt;/ref&gt;) The simplest form, kanban squares, are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations. The rule, applied to the producing station: "If all squares are full, stop. If not, fill them up."&lt;ref&gt;3.	Hall, Robert W. 1987. op. cit., p 92&lt;/ref&gt;

An office cell applies the same ideas: clusters of broadly trained cell-team members that, in concert, quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space. In a virtual cell, as in the standard model, team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services. Although people and equipment are physically dispersed, as in a job shop, their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput, with all its advantages, just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 27, 136, 585-586&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking the visibility of physical cells, virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process.

A simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a 1985 booklet of 96 pages by Kone Corp. in Finland, producer of elevators, escalators, and the like. Excerpts follow: 
{{quote|"The first step involved creating cells in the assembly, electrical and chemical testing departments. In April 1984 six cells, identified by different colors, were established... All devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cell's color, and all feed-back from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned... The second step, in summer, 1984, was to "cellularize" manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies [that are] needed in the analyzer cells, and to test them if necessary. Production of the five sub-assembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer sub-units. The parts and materials are located in the cells... Material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand. In the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each (roughly 25 different) sub-unit. When one piece is taken into assembly, a new one is ordered from the corresponding unit-cell. The order is made [using] a magnetic [kanban] button, which identifies the ordering cell (by color), unit (by code), and order date... When the manufacturing cell has completed the order, the unit is taken with the [kanban] button to its place on the ordering cell shelf. Orders from the unit cells to the sub-cells are based on the same principle. The only difference is that the buffer size is six sub-units. This [procedure] was implemented in August, 1984."&lt;ref&gt;"JIT-Production." Hyvinkaa, Finland: Kone Corporation/ATF&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Implementation process ==
In order to implement cellular manufacturing, a number of steps must be performed. First, the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity (in design or manufacturing requirements) into families.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Management|last=Inman|first=R. Anthony|last2=Helm|first2=Marilyn|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7876-6556-2|location=Detroit, MI|pages=72–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed; typically in the form of [[production flow analysis]] (PFA) for manufacturing families, or in the examination of design/product data for design families.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This analysis can be time consuming and costly, but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts. Clustering of machines and parts is one of the most popular production flow analysis methods. The algorithms for machine part grouping include Rank Order Clustering, Modified Rank Order Clustering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|title=Modified Rank Order Clustering Algorithm Approach by Including Manufacturing Data|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405896316302993|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|volume=49|issue=5|pages=138–142|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.103|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Similarity coefficients. 

There are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center, which take into account a variety of important variables such as, "multiple plant locations, multi-market allocations with production planning and various part mix."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aalaei|first=Amin|last2=Davoudpour|first2=Hamid|title=A robust optimization model for cellular manufacturing system into supply chain management|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527316000153|journal=International Journal of Production Economics|volume=183|pages=667–679|doi=10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.01.014|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty, optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as, "total cost of holding, inter-cell material handling, external transportation, fixed cost for producing each part in each plant, machine and labor salaries."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Difficulties in creating flow ==
The key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes. Upon implementation of cellular manufacturing, management commonly "encounters strong resistance from production workers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually.

It is also difficult to fight the desire to have some [[inventory]] on hand. It is tempting, since it would be easier to recover from an [[employee]] suddenly having to take [[sick leave]]. Unfortunately, in cellular manufacturing, it is important to remember the main tenants: "You sink or swim together as a unit" and that "Inventory hides problems and inefficiencies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved, the process will not improve.

Another common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations. These problems include, "exceptional elements, number of voids, machine distances, bottleneck machines and parts, machine location and relocation, part routing, cell load variation, inter and intracellular material transferring, cell reconfiguring, dynamic part demands, and operation and completion times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delgoshaei|first=Aidin|last2=Ariffin|first2=Mohd Khairol Anuar Mohd|last3=Leman|first3=Zulkiflle|last4=Baharudin|first4=B. T. Hang Tuah Bin|last5=Gomes|first5=Chandima|date=2016-01-12|title=Review of evolution of cellular manufacturing system's approaches: Material transferring models|journal=International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=131–149|doi=10.1007/s12541-016-0017-9|issn=2234-7593}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing.

==Benefits and costs==
Cellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short, focused paths in concentrated physical space. So constructed, by logic a cell reduces flow time, flow distance, floor space, inventory, handling, scheduling transactions, and scrap and rework (the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities). Moreover, cells lead to simplified, higher validity costing, since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather than scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit. Chapter 10: Cost Accounting and Cellular Manufacturing, pp 281-310)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frecka, Thomas J. Accounting for Manufacturing Productivity: A Set of Papers from an AME Meeting--Problems and Directions in Cost Accounting. Association for Manufacturing Excellence, 2nd Printing. Several of the 11 articles in this report pertain to changes in cost accounting stemming from JIT production, and cells in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement. The segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem.

There are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing. The small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more self-motivated to propose changes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management, so over time overhead costs can be reduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell, which offers variety in their work. This can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Case studies in just-in-time and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines. For example, BAE Systems, Platform Solutions (Fort Wayne, Ind.), producing aircraft engine monitors and controls, implemented cells for 80 percent of production, reducing customer lead time 90 percent, work-in-process inventory 70 percent, space for one product family from 6,000 square feet to 1,200 square feet, while increasing product reliability 300 percent, multi-skilling the union-shop work force, and being designated an ''Industry Week'' Best Plant for the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;9.	Sheridan, John L. 2000. “Lean Sigma synergy,” ''Industry Week'' (October 16) pp 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; By five years later, rework and scrap had been cut 50 percent, new product introduction cycles 60 percent, and transactions 90 percent, while also increasing inventory turns three-fold and service turn times 30 percent, and being awarded a Shingo Prize for the year 2005.&lt;ref&gt;10.	2005 Shingo Prize website.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself; among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits. One exception is the contention, at Steward, Inc. (Chattanooga, Tenn.), producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression. According to case study authors, cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from 14 to 2 days, work-in-process inventories by 80 percent, finished inventories by 60 percent, lateness by 96 percent, and space by 56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;11.	Levasseur, Gerls A., Marilyn M. Helms, and Aleisha A. Zink. 1995. “A Conversion from a functional to a cellular manufacturing layout at Steward, Inc. ''Production and Inventory Management''. 3rd quarter, pp 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a "WIP chart system" by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01&lt;ref&gt;Tonkin, Lea A.P. 1992. Hughes Ground Systems Group Takes Aim at Defects, Delays. Target (May–June). pp 25-27&lt;/ref&gt; Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op. cit., pp 225-232&lt;/ref&gt; When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Hyer, Nancy, and Urban Wemmerlöv. 2002. op cit., pp 519-521&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of possible limitations to implementing cellular manufacturing. Some argue that cellular manufacturing can lead to a decrease in production flexibility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cells are typically designed to maintain a specific flow volume of parts being produced. Should the demand or necessary quantity decrease, the cells may have to be realigned to match the new requirements, which is a costly operation, and one not typically required in other manufacturing setups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">In [[theoretical physics]], '''composite gravity''' refers to models that attempted to derive [[general relativity]] in a framework where the [[graviton]] is constructed as a composite bound state of more elementary particles, usually [[fermion]]s. A theorem by [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Edward Witten]] shows that this is not possible in [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz covariant]] theories: massless particles with [[spin (physics)|spin]] greater than one are forbidden. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] may be viewed as a loophole in their argument. However, in this case not only the graviton is emergent; a whole [[spacetime]] dimension is emergent, too.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Tyszowiecka Confederation 1655.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The swearing in of the [[Tyszowce Confederation]] in 1655, painting by [[Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski]].]]
A '''konfederacja''' ({{IPA-pl|kɔ̃fɛdɛˈrat͡sja|lang|Pl-konfederacja.ogg}}, "confederation") was an ''[[ad hoc]]'' association formed by Polish-Lithuanian ''[[szlachta]]'' (nobility), clergy, cities, or military forces in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for the attainment of stated aims. A konfederacja often took the form of an armed rebellion aimed at redressing perceived abuses or trespasses of some (e.g. royal) authority. Such "confederations" acted in lieu of state authority or to force their demands upon that authority.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; They could be seen as a primary expression of [[direct democracy]] and [[right of revolution]] in the Commonwealth, and as a way for the nobles to act on their grievances and against the state's central authority.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

==History and function==
In the late 13th century, confederations of cities, aiming to support public safety and provide security from rampant banditry, appeared, with the first confederation being that of several towns ([[Poznań]], [[Pyzdry]], [[Gniezno]] and [[Kalisz]] in [[Greater Poland]]) in 1298.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-125-132"/&gt; In the mid-14th century, confederations of nobility, directed against the central authorities, emerged, with the first such confederation being that of 1352.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-125-132"/&gt; During [[interregnum]]s, confederations (essentially vigilance committees) formed to replace the inactive royal court, protect internal order, and defend the country from external dangers.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The confederations, as a [[right of revolution]], were recognized in [[Polish law]] through the [[Henrician articles]] (1573), part of the [[pacta conventa]] sworn by every Polish king since 1576.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;&lt;ref name=bardach2/&gt; They stated (in the ''articulus de non praestanda oboedientia'', a rule dating to 1501 from [[Privilege of Mielnik]]&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt;) that if the monarch did not recognize or abused the rights and privileges of the nobility (szlachta), the nobles would no longer be bound to obey him and would have the legal right to disobey him.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;

With the beginning of the 17th century, confederations became an increasingly significant element of the Commonwealth's political scene.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, confederations were organized by [[magnates]], and were either pro- or anti-royal.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; A confederation not recognized by the king was considered a ''[[rokosz]]'' ("rebellion"), although some of the rokosz would be eventually recognized by the king, who could even join them himself.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Most pro-royal confederations were usually formed as a response to an anti-royal one, and some would take a form of an extraordinary session of the parliament ([[sejm]]), as happened in 1710, 1717 and 1735.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Confederations where usually formed in one part of the country, and could expand into "general confederations" taking in most or all of the [[voivodeships of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; However, even such general confederations would be formed separately for the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and for the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Each confederation had a key document explaining its goals, known as the act of the confederation, which was deposited with the court (usually the local court for the region the confederation was formed).&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Additional resolutions of the confederates, known as ''sanctia'', would also be deposited with the court.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Membership of the confederation was voluntary, and required an oath.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The executive branch of a confederation was headed by a marshal, and a group of advisers, each known as ''konsyliarz konfederacji''.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; A marshal and associated konsyliarze were known as a generality (''generalność'').&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; A confederation would also have a larger council, similar to a parliament (''walna rada''), which made decisions by majority vote.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Until around the mid-18th century, resolutions of the council had to be [[unanimous]], but afterwards, majority voting became more common.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; The chief military commanders of confederations were known as [[regimentarz]]e.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt;

Also in the 18th century an institution known as a "[[confederated sejm]]" evolved.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; It was a parliament session (sejm) that operated under the rules of a confederation.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Its primary purpose was to avoid being subject to disruption by the ''[[liberum veto]]'', unlike the national Sejm, which was paralyzed by the veto during this period.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed from the whole membership of the national Sejm, so that the ''liberum veto'' would not operate there.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-136-138"/&gt;

Confederations were proscribed by law in 1717, but continued to operate, indicating a weakness of the Commonwealth's central authority.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; They were also abolished by the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]] (adopted by the [[Four-Year Sejm]] of 1788–1792, itself a confederated sejm).&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; But in practice this prohibition was not observed. The May 3rd Constitution was overthrown in mid-1792, by the [[Targowica Confederation]] of Polish magnates backed by [[Russian Empire]] and eventually joined, under extreme duress, by King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław II August]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-184-185"/&gt; The ensuing Russian military intervention led (to the Confederates' surprise) to the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-184-185"/&gt; One of the last instances of confederation came in 1812, when the [[General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland]] was formed in [[Warsaw]] to [[Napoleon I]]'s campaign against the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-136-138"/&gt;

[[File:Egg-rmh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An eggshell is often used a visual metaphor for the thin skull rule.]]
The '''eggshell rule''' (or '''thin skull rule''') is a well-established [[legal doctrine]] in [[common law]], used in some [[tort law]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/708/708.F2d.1217.82-1714.html 708 F.2d 1217], citing Prosser, ''Handbook of the Law of Torts'' 261 (4th ed. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar doctrine applicable to [[criminal law]].  The rule states that, in a tort case, the unexpected frailty of the injured person is not a valid defense to the seriousness of any injury caused to them.

==The law==
This rule holds that a [[tortfeasor]] is liable for all consequences resulting from their tortious (usually [[negligent]]) activities leading to an injury to another person, even if the victim suffers an unusually high level of damage (e.g. due to a pre-existing [[vulnerability]] or [[medical condition]]).&lt;ref name="Watts v Rake"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|50|1960|litigants=Watts v Rake |parallecite=(1960) 108 [[Commonwelath Law Reports|CLR]] 158, [8] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggshell skull rule takes into account the physical, social and economic attributes of the plaintiff which might make them more susceptible to injury.&lt;ref name="Nader"&gt;''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501, [[NSW Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia) per McHugh JA. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1985+2+NSWLR+501 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;  It may also take into account the family and cultural environment.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term implies that if a person had a skull as delicate as that of the shell of an egg, and a tortfeasor who was unaware of the condition injured that person's head, causing the skull unexpectedly to break, the defendant would be held liable for all damages resulting from the wrongful contact, even if the tortfeasor did not intend to cause such a severe injury.

In criminal law, the general maxim is that the [[defendant]] must "take their victims as they find them", as echoed in the judgment of [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]] in ''[[R v. Blaue]]'' (1975), in which the defendant was held responsible for killing his victim, despite his contention that her refusal of a blood transfusion constituted ''[[novus actus interveniens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |year= 1975 |court=EWCA | division=Crim |num=3 |litigants=R v Blaue |parallelcite=[1975] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 1411 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is applied in all areas of torts – [[intentional torts]], [[negligence]], and [[strict liability]] cases – as well as in criminal law. There is no requirement of physical contact with the victim – if a [[trespasser]]'s wrongful presence on the victim's property so terrifies the victim that he has a fatal [[heart attack]], the trespasser will be liable for the damages stemming from his original tort. The foundation for this rule is based primarily on policy grounds. The courts do not want the defendant or accused to rely on the victim's own vulnerability to avoid liability.

The thin skull rule is not to be confused with the related [[crumbling skull rule]] in which the plaintiff suffers from a detrimental position (from a prior injury, for instance) pre-existent to the occurrence of the present tort.  In the "crumbling skull" rule, the prior condition is only to be considered with respect to distinguishing it from any new injury arising from the present tort – as a means of apportioning damages in such a way that the defendant would not be liable for placing the plaintiff in a better position than they were in prior to the present tort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Athey v Leonati |year=1996 |court=SCC |num=83 |format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 235 |date= |courtname=auto |juris=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In an example, a person who has [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]] (OI; also known as "Brittle Bone Syndrome") is more likely to be injured in a motor vehicle accident.  If the person with OI is hit from behind in a motor vehicle collision and suffers medical damages (such as [[clavicle]] fracture), it would not be a prudent defense to state that the Osteogenesis Imperfecta was the cause of the fracture.

==Case illustrations==
(UK) In the case of ''[[Smith v Leech Brain &amp; Co]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v Leech Brain &amp; Co]]'' [1962] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 405.&lt;/ref&gt; an employee in a factory was splashed with molten metal. The metal burned him on his lip, which happened to be [[premalignant]] tissue. He died three years later from cancer triggered by the injury.  The judge held that as long as the initial injury was foreseeable, the defendant was liable for all the harm.

(US) In 1891, the [[State supreme court|Wisconsin Supreme Court]] came to a similar result in ''[[Vosburg v. Putney]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vosburg v. Putney]]'' 80 Wis. 523, 50 N.W. 403 (Wis., 1891) ([[Reversal (law)|reversed]] and [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed for a new trial on other grounds).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, a boy threw a small kick at another from across the aisle in the classroom. It turned out that the victim had an unknown microbial condition that was irritated, and resulted in him entirely losing the use of his leg. No one could have predicted the level of injury. Nevertheless, the court found that the kicking was [[Law|unlawful]] because it violated the "order and decorum of the classroom", and the perpetrator was therefore fully liable for the injury.

(US) In ''[[Benn v. Thomas]]'', the appellate court determined that the eggshell rule should have been applied to a case in which a man had a heart attack and died after being bruised in the chest during a rear-end car accident.&lt;ref&gt;
512 N.W.2d 537 ( Iowa, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Aus) In the case of ''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'',&lt;ref name="Nader"/&gt; the plaintiff was a 10 year old boy who struck his head on a bus stop pole while alighting from a slowly moving bus. He developed a rare psychological condition known as [[Ganser Syndrome]]. The defendant argued that the illness resulted from his family’s response to the accident. McHugh JA said (at 537), "The defendant must take the plaintiff with all his weaknesses, beliefs and reactions as well as his capacities and attributes, physical, social and economic. If the result of an accident is that a ten year old boy reacts to his parents’ concern over his injuries and develops an hysterical condition, no reason of justice, morality or entrenched principle appears to me to prevent his recovery of compensation."

(Aus) In the case of ''[[Kavanagh v Akhtar]]'',&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"/&gt; the court held the tortfeasor should take into account the plaintiff's family and cultural setting. Equality before the law puts a heavy onus on the person who would argue that the "unusual" reaction of an injured plaintiff should be disregarded because a minority religious or cultural situation may not have been foreseeable.

==Exceptions==
[[causation (law)#Intervening cause|Intervening cause]] is typically an exception to the eggshell skull rule.  If an injury is not immediate, but a separate situation agitates the injury (such as the injured party being involved in a vehicular collision while being taken to a hospital), the tortfeasor is not liable under common law in Australia (see ''Haber v Walker'',&lt;ref name="Haber v Walker"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|51|1963|litigants=Haber v Walker |parallelcite=[1963] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 339 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mahoney v Kruschich Demolitions''&lt;ref name="Mahoney v Kruschich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|1985|litigants=Mahony v J Kruschich (Demolitions) Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 522 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). In ''Haber v Walker'' it was held that a plaintiff will not be liable for a novus actus interveniens (intervening act) if the chain of causation was broken by a voluntary, human act or, an independent event, which in conjunction with the wrongful act, was so unlikely as to be termed a coincidence.&lt;ref name="Haber v Walker"/&gt; In ''Mahoney v Kruschich Demolitions'' the plaintiff, Glogovic, was injured while working on the demolition of a power house for the respondent. While being treated for his injuries, his injuries were exacerbated by the negligent medical treatment of the appellant, Mahony. It was held that there was no novus actus as a result of medical treatment of injuries caused by the defendant’s negligence, unless such treatment is inexcusably bad or completely outside the bounds of what a reputable medical practitioner might prescribe.&lt;ref name="Mahoney v Kruschich"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">The '''equal authenticity rule''' is a rule of judicial interpretation developed by Canadian courts as a way of interpreting laws which are written in two parallel texts in English and French. The constitution of Canada requires that both versions of each Canadian law be treated as equally authoritative, which can result in problems when the English and French versions do not say exactly the same thing. The equal authenticity rule is derived from section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', which states, ''inter alia'', "The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [i.e. both English and French]."

==History==
The rule requires courts to treat "both [the English and French] versions of statutes [as] equally valid and authoritative interpretations of the law,"&lt;ref&gt;This definition of the equal authenticity rule is from Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule holds that both versions are equally authoritative even if the statute in question was clearly drafted in one language and translated into the other, and even if the two versions of the law are incompatible.

An early version of the principle may be found a statute of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, enacted in 1857. The ''Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relative to Civil Matters and Procedure'' requires that the Civil Code of Lower Canada be printed only in bilingual form, with English and French displayed on the same page: "[T]he two texts, when printed, shall stand side by side." It has been suggested that this provision of the 1857 Act is "best understood as a non-verbal legislative sign that the two texts should be interpreted dialogically." &lt;ref&gt;Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Toronto: LexisNexis, 2008, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this is an overstatement, it is certainly true that side-by-side publication was the first step towards the eventual adoption of the Equal Authenticity Rule for interpreting bilingual statutes.

The equal authenticity rule was developed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1891, in the court’s ruling in ''[[CPR v. Robinson]]''. This case dealt with the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'', which is enacted in both French and English.

By implication, the rule also related to all laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada, as section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' is equally binding upon the federal Parliament and Quebec legislation.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] first applied this rule of judicial interpretation to Acts of Parliament in 1935, in its ruling in the case of ''[[R. v. DuBois]]''

The rule was reaffirmed as section 18(1) in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], when the constitution was repatriated in 1982.

==Unresolved issue regarding the application of the rule==
Some Canadian provinces (Quebec and Manitoba from the time of their establishment, and since 1982 New Brunswick) are constitutionally obligated to enact all laws in both official languages. However, a number of other provinces, such as Ontario, have opted to enact their laws in both English and French, even though they are not constitutionally required to do so. One question, not yet tested in the courts, "arises...as to whether both versions of bilingual legislation enacted in a province where there is no constitutional requirement to do so would be considered equally authoritative in the absence of an express Equal Authenticity Rule."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; (An "express" equal authenticity rule would presumably take the form of such a rule in the relevant province's ''Interpretation Act'' or some other piece of [[Quasi-constitutionality|quasi-constitutional legislation]].

Bastarache ''et al.'', who raise this question, answer it in the affirmative, explaining that in their view, "the logic applicable to federal, Quebec and Manitoba legislation under the Constitution would also apply [even in the absence of a legislated statement of this logic]: that is, where two languages [sic] versions of a statute are enacted simultaneously both versions will be considered equally authoritative."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Harry''' is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] derogatory term used in slang, derived from the [[England|English]] name [[Harry (name)|Harry]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=harry&amp;bokmaal=S%F8k+i+Bokm%E5lsordboka&amp;ordbok=bokmaal&amp;alfabet=n&amp;renset=j |title=Entry on "harry" |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best English translation may be "cheesy" or "tacky". ''[[Norsk ordbok (Riksmål)|Norsk ordbok]]'' defines "harry" as "tasteless, vulgar".&lt;ref name="no" /&gt;

The term "harry" was first used by [[upper class]] youth in [[Oslo]] in the beginning of the 20th century, and was used to describe people who belonged to the [[working class]]. People in the lower social classes at the time often gave their children [[England|English]] first names such as [[Harry (name)|Harry]]. The middle and upper classes mostly preferred Scandinavian or German (and occasionally French) names. English names (except English names that are also widely found in other European languages) had no tradition in Scandinavia and were generally considered bad taste and as a phenomenon of the working-class of the time in all the Scandinavian countries. The traditional elite of Norway mostly used conservative Danish names.

A person who is ''harry'' is often perceived as unsophisticated, vulgar or with bad taste.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ordnett.no/ordbok.html?search=harry&amp;search_type=&amp;publications=23 |title=Entry on "Harry" |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="financialExpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/&amp;8216harry&amp;8217-pottiness-stirs-swedishnorwegian-shop-war/40443/|title=‘Harry’ Pottiness Stirs Swedish-Norwegian Shop War|date=March 16, 2002|publisher=Financial Express|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of bad taste is often characterized with the term ''harry'', e.g. a ''harry'' dress or a ''harry'' car. Since the definition of good and bad taste is defined by fashion, there is no precise definition of ''harry''. [[D.D.E. (band)|D.D.E.]], [[Sputnik_(singer)|Sputnik]], shopping in [[Sweden]], [[Raggare]] culture and [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]s are often mentioned today. In the 1970s it was the 1960s' hairwax or sharp shoes that were harry. In the 1980s the 1970s' flared pants or whiskers, and in the 1990s more or less everything that could be associated with the 1980s. Yesterday's fashion will often be interpreted as harry. Often what is harry in one period can be hip [[retro]] fashion the next year.

Harry may also be interpreted as something like [[Machismo|macho]]. The feminine parallel is ''doris''.

The term was repopularised by then minister of Agriculture [[Lars Sponheim]] in 2002 to describe Norwegians who drive (in some cases, for hours) to reach and cross the border to [[Sweden]] in order to [[Border trade|purchase groceries, tobacco and alcohol at cheaper prices]]. Responses to this were retorts that seeking out bargains is smart shopping, and Swedish shops introduced humorous campaigns with one shopkeeper giving 1000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] to customers named "Harry".&lt;ref name="financialExpress"/&gt; The terms ''Harrytur'' ("Harry trip") or ''Harryhandel'' ("Harry trade") have since been popular descriptions of this trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/02/16/nyheter/utenriks/harry-handel/4884668/ Harryhandel til halv pris] Dagbladet, February 16, 2009 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">The term '''hermit kingdom''' can be used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world - The country of [[North Korea]] is a prime example of a hermit kingdom.

Korea in the age of [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] was the subject of the first use of the term, in [[William Elliot Griffis]]' 1882 book ''Corea: The Hermit Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David H.|title=Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Myoung Chung|title=Korean Government Publications: An Introductory Guide. Lantham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/28/104992374.pdf The Obliteration of the Kingdom of Korea] by [[Stephen Bonsal]], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and it is often used by [[Koreans]] themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by United States former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=World&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/world/w022017A.xml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
Several other countries reluctant to engage in dialogue with the outside world have also been described as hermit kingdoms, including: [[Bhutan]],{{cn}} the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]],{{cn}} and the early African civilization of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axum]].{{cn}}

An '''honesty box''' is a method of charging for a service such as admission or car parking, or for a product such as home-grown produce and flowers, which relies upon each visitor paying at a box using the [[honour system]]. Tickets are not issued and such sites are usually unattended. When used in [[camping sites]] and other [[park]] settings, they are sometimes referred to as an '''iron ranger''' as there is often an iron cash box instead of an actual [[park ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homernews.com/stories/101508/arts_14_001.shtml Don Henry's prolific metal sculpture abounds in Homer 'Divas and Dolls'  ''Michael Armstrong, Homer News, 10-15-08'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some stores also use them for selling newspapers to avoid queues at a [[cash register|till]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite journal

Such boxes are typically used in [[rural]] areas where the low number of customers and other visitors, along with the low quantity and/or value of the products on offer, means that an attendant would not bring a positive return on investment.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Many are also domestically run operations where attendance is not feasible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">In [[engineering]], '''interoperation''' is the setup of ad hoc components and [[Methodology|methods]] to make two or more [[systems]] work together as a combined [[system]] with some partial functionality during a certain time, possibly requiring human [[Supervisor|supervision]] to perform necessary adjustments and [[corrections]].

This contrasts to [[interoperability]], which theoretically permits any number of [[systems]] [[Regulatory compliance|compliant]] to a given [[technical standard|standard]] to work together a long time smoothly and unattended as a combined [[system]] with the full functionality by the standard.

Another definition of interoperation: "services effectively combining multiple resources and domains...; requires interoperability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/gio/1996/glossat.ps Glossary] Gio Wiederhold, "Glossary"; in Intelligent Integration of Information, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston MA, July 1996, pages 193--203; reprinted from the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, Vol.6 Nos.2/3, June 1996, pages 281-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Interoperation is usually performed when the [[systems]] having to be combined were [[designed]] before [[standardization]] (for example [[legacy systems]]), or when standard [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] is too expensive, too difficult, or immature.

Interoperation may use following [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]], components and methods:
* [[electrical connector|Connectors]]
* [[Adapter]]s
* [[Electric power conversion|Converters]]
* [[Simulators]]
* [[Protocol bridge|Bridges]]

In the area of [[data processing]], interoperation may also use following components and methods:
* [[Callback (computer programming)|Handlers]]
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-in]]s
* [[Translators]]

==Background==
Jason Kessler graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a bachelor of arts in psychology in 2009. Prior to his involvement in political extremism, Kessler has written that he was employed in various working class jobs as a dishwasher, gym technician, truck driver and handyman.&lt;ref name="kessler1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jasonkessler.us/about/|title=About Jason Kessler|date=October 30, 2017 |accessdate=October 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014546/http://jasonkessler.us/about/ |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |quote=Prior to becoming a writer and activist he did various working class jobs from dishwasher and gym technician to truck driver and handyman.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Kessler began his original blog JasonKessler.net.&lt;ref name="kessler2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasonkessler.net/|title=JasonKessler.net|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=October 30, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229204224/http://www.jasonkessler.net/|archivedate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was used to publish and take credit for the work of another Jason Kessler, which included a [[Noir fiction|noir crime novel]], ''Badland Blues,'' as well as a work of poetry, ''Midnight Road''.&lt;ref name="kessler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kessler3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/not-that-jason-kessler|title=Not That Jason Kessler|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, he revealed lewd and offensive tweets made by Charlottesville vice-mayor and councilman Wes Bellamy, who is also a teacher at Charlottesville's [[Albemarle High School (Virginia)|Albemarle High School]]. Bellamy first drew criticism from Kessler when he called a press conference to call for the removal of the [[Robert E. Lee]] statue in Charlottesville in March 2016. In December, Kessler began circulating a petition demanding that Bellamy resign or be removed from office.&lt;ref name="kessler5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/34520495/group-files-petition-to-have-charlottesville-vice-mayor-bellamy-recalled|title=Group Files Petition to Have Charlottesville Vice Mayor Bellamy Recalled|publisher=WVIR News|date=February 16, 2017 |access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing investigations, Bellamy voluntarily resigned from his teaching position at Albemarle High School in December 2016.&lt;ref name="kessler6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/12/01/virginia-board-of-education-member-resigns-after-vulgar-tweets-surface/|title=Virginia Board of Education member resigns after vulgar tweets surface|publisher=Washington Post|date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, while attempting to gain signatures for his petition Kessler was arrested for [[misdemeanor]] [[assault]] after punching a man in the face. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 50 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref name="assault"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Jason-Kessler-pleads-guilty-to-assault--418532093.html|title=Jason Kessler pleads guilty to assault charge|publisher=CBS 19 News|date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Kessler was contracted to write two pieces for the ''[[Daily Caller]]''.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; He wrote another piece in May about the first protests in Charlottesville over the statue of Lee.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; Kessler has also written several posts for the anti-immigrant white nationalist site [[VDare]].&lt;ref name=nm&gt;[http://www.nationalmemo.com/right-wing-media-provided-home-white-supremacist-organized-charlottesville-rally/ nationalmemo.com: "Right-Wing Media Provided Home For White Supremacist Before He Organized Charlottesville Rally"], August 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kessler's posts claimed that the government was waging [[white genocide conspiracy theory|genocide against white people]] by policies that cause low Caucasian birth rates.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;

After ''[[ProPublica]]'' contacted ''the Daily Caller'' pointing out Kessler's ties to white supremacist groups, the outlet severed its ties with Kessler, and its Executive Editor Paul Conner defended his editorial judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/author/jasonkessler/|title=Jason Kessler - The Daily Caller|date=June 15, 2017|website=archive.org|accessdate=August 21, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615054638/http://dailycaller.com/author/jasonkessler/|archivedate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/things-got-left-out-of-the-daily-callers-report-confederate-monument-rally|title=A Few Things Got Left Out of The Daily Caller's Report on Confederate Monument Rally|first=A.C.|last=Thompson|date=May 31, 2017|website=propublica.org|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kessler was sworn in as a member of the far right organization the [[Proud Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Who are the alt-right leaders and provocateurs addressing the Charlottesville white nationalist rally?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-leaders-are-addressing-largest-white-nationalist-rally-decades-650096|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=Newsweek|date=August 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proud Boys founder [[Gavin McInnes]] said that he kicked Kessler out of the group once his views on race became known.&lt;ref name=globeandmail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Houpt|first1=Simon|title=Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes's path to the far-right frontier|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/gavin-mcinnes-path-to-the-far-rightfrontier/article36024918/|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=Globe and Mail|date=August 18, 2017|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Unite the Right rally}}
Kessler was one of the organizers of the Unite the Right rally on August 12, 2017. The rally was a protest of the removal of the statue of [[Robert E. Lee]], a cause Kessler had taken up a year earlier when he began his crusade against Bellamy. Kessler was also involved in a smaller protest of the removal of the statue on May 14, 2017 which ended in a torch-lit march. At this event, he was arrested for failure to obey an officer's commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/three-including-jason-kessler-arrested-during-lee-park-counter-protest/article_a2445258-3988-11e7-bb48-634a1a44cc32.html|title=Three, including Jason Kessler, arrested during Lee Park counter-protest|publisher=The Daily Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, Kessler appeared at town hall to promote his rally, but also distance himself from another rally that was held by the [[Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/kessler-discusses-kkk-unite-the-right-rallies-and-his-political/article_610ca84a-66a0-11e7-af48-1389a3205b81.html|title=Kessler discusses KKK, Unite the Right rallies and his political beliefs|publisher=The Daily Progress|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, Kessler and most speakers scheduled to attend the rally were described by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) as [[alt-right]] leaders. The ADL's director said that Kessler was listed because of both his statements and his activities.&lt;ref name=nbcadl&gt;[http://www.nbc29.com/story/35966208/adl-lists-kessler-other-unite-the-right-speakers-as-white-supremacists nbc29.com: "ADL Lists Kessler, Other 'Unite The Right' Speakers as White Supremacists"], July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler responded by calling the ADL hypocritical for "attacking uppity whites when they support the ethno-state of Israel" and saying he was "happy to be considered the enemy of the ADL".&lt;ref name=nbcadl/&gt;

On August 7, the city manager attempted to change the location of the rally, away from Emancipation Park towards McIntire Park. The city manager confirmed that Kessler had a [[First Amendment]] right to protest but stressed the city's need to protect public safety.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://www.c-ville.com/rally-relocation-city-okays-permit-mcintire-park-kessler-refuses-change/ c-ville.com: "Rally relocation: City okays permit for McIntire Park, Kessler refuses to change"], August 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, the [[Rutherford Institute]] and the Virginia state branch of the [[ACLU]] supported Kessler in an [[injunction]] lawsuit, later known as ''Kessler v City of Charlottesville'', in the United States District Court. They pointed out that "Two other groups that oppose Kessler's message, which have called on thousands of protesters to attend, have been granted permits by the city for downtown parks close to Emancipation Park on August 12." Arguments were heard in [[Glen E. Conrad|Judge Glen Conrad]]'s courtroom on the afternoon of August 11. The court enjoined the city from revoking Kessler's permit to conduct a demonstration at Emancipation Park on August 12, and the rally went ahead.&lt;ref name=dela&gt;[http://www.realnewsdelaware.net/index.php/2017/08/11/unite-right-rally-tomorrow-charlottesville-va/ realnewsdelaware.com: "“Unite the Right” rally tomorrow in Charlottesville, VA"], August 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally on August 12 turned violent and resulted in the [[Unite the Right rally#Vehicular attack and homicide|death of Heather Heyer]], when one of the rally attendees drove at high speed into a crowd of counter-protestors several blocks from the rally.&lt;ref name="NYT Heyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT Heyer" /&gt; On the day following the rally Kessler attempted to hold a news conference in front of Charlottesville City Hall which was quickly overtaken by protesters. However, before ending the short news conference Kessler stated "I disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic." He also posted videos online in which he blames the city for the violence and death.&lt;ref name="kessler7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/kessler-blames-city-officials-as-news-conference-dissolves-into-chaos/article_cc7ae852-8096-11e7-8198-bbb38b7b63d1.html|title=Kessler blames city officials as news conference dissolves into chaos|author=Chris Saurez|publisher=The Daily Progress|date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2017, Kessler contradicted his previous statement by tweeting "Heather Heyer was a fat, disgusting Communist. Communists have killed 94 million.

On September 6, 2018, a jury in Charlottesville ordered Jeffrey Winder to pay a fine of $1 and no jail times for the misdemeanor assault charge against Kessler that took place on August 13, 2017. Winder had appealed his original February, 2018 guilty finding, which included a 30-day jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chappell |first=Bill |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645177784/jury-fines-man-1-for-punching-charlottesville-rally-organizer |title=Jury Fines Man $1 For Punching Charlottesville Rally Organizer |work=[[NPR]] |date=2018-09-06 |accessdate=2018-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Kessler applied for a permit to hold a rally in Charlottesville in August 2018, on the anniversary of the first march.

However, other far-right individuals and groups who participated in the first Unite the Right rally, including [[Richard B. Spencer]], the [[League of the South]], [[Christopher Cantwell]], [[Andrew Anglin]], and militia groups — indicated that they would not attend the anniversary rally, having distanced themselves from Kessler, who holds "pariah status among his fellow racists."&lt;ref&gt;Brett Barrouquere, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/08/07/unite-right-2-approaches-few-big-names-expected-rally-amid-lots-questions-about-size As "Unite the Right 2" approaches, few big names expected for rally amid lots of questions about size, speakers], ''Hatewatch'', Southern Poverty Law Center (August 7, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''letter to the editor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwp.duke.edu/wstudio/resources/documents/letter_to_editor.pdf |title=Definition from Duke University's University Writing Program |publisher=Uwp.duke.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''LTTE''' or '''LTE''') is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] sent to a [[publication]] about issues of concern from its readers. Usually, letters are intended for publication. In many publications, letters to the editor may be sent either through [[Mail|conventional mail]] or [[electronic mail]].

Letters to the editor are most frequently associated with [[newspapers]] and [[newsmagazines]]. However, they are sometimes published in other [[periodical]]s (such as entertainment and technical magazines), and [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station|television]] stations. In the latter instance, letters are sometimes read on the air (usually, on a news broadcast or on [[talk radio]]). In that presentation form, it can also be described as '''viewer mail''' or '''listener mail''', depending on the medium.

In [[academic publishing]], letters to the editor of an [[academic journal]] are usually open [[postpublication review]]s of a paper, often critical of some aspect of the original paper. The authors of the original paper sometimes respond to these with a letter of their own. Controversial papers in mainstream journals often attract numerous letters to the editor. Good [[citation index]]ing services list the original papers together with all replies. Depending on the length of the letter and the journal's style, other types of headings may be used, such as '''peer commentary'''. There are some variations on this practice. Some journals request open commentaries as a matter of course, which are published together with the original paper, and any authors' reply, in a process called [[open peer commentary]]. The introduction of the "[[Electronic article|epub]] ahead of print" practice in many journals now allows unsolicited letters to the editor (and authors' reply) to appear in the same print issue of the journal, as long as they are sent in the interval between the electronic publication of the original paper and its appearance in print.

==Subject matter==
The subject matter of letters to the editor vary widely. However, the most common topics include:

* Supporting or opposing a stance taken by the publication in its [[editorial]], or responding to another writer's letter to the editor.
* Commenting on a current issue being debated by a governing body – local, regional or national depending on the publication's circulation. Often, the writer will urge elected officials to make their decision based on his/her viewpoint.
* Remarking on materials (such as a news story) that have appeared in a previous edition. Such letters may either be critical or praising.
* Correcting a perceived error or misrepresentation.

==History==
{{globalize|section|date=December 2010}}

LTEs always have been a feature of American newspapers.  Much of the earliest news reports and commentaries published by early-American newspapers were delivered in the form of letters, and by the mid-18th century, LTEs were a dominant carrier of political and social discourse.  Many influential essays about the role of government in matters such as personal freedoms and economic development took the form of letters — consider [[Cato's Letters]] or [[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]], which were widely reprinted in early American newspapers. Through the 19th century, LTEs were increasingly centralized near the editorials of newspapers, so that by the turn of the 20th century LTEs had become permanent fixtures of the opinion pages.

Modern LTE forums differ little from those earlier counterparts.  A typical forum will include a half-dozen to a dozen letters (or excerpts from letters). The letters chosen for publication usually are only a sample of the total letters submitted, with larger-circulation publications running a much smaller percentage of submissions and small-circulation publications running nearly all of the relatively few letters they receive.  Editors generally read all submissions, but in general most will automatically reject letters that include profanity, libelous statements, personal attacks against individuals or specific organizations, that are unreasonably long (most publications suggest length limits ranging from 200 to 500 words) or that are submitted anonymously.

The latter criterion is a fairly recent development in LTE management. Prior to the Cold War paranoia of the mid-20th century, anonymous LTEs were common; in fact, the right to write anonymously was central to the free-press/free-speech movement (as in the 1735 trial against [[John Peter Zenger]], which started with an anonymous essay).  By the 1970s, editors had developed strong negative attitudes toward anonymous letters, and by the end of the 20th century, about 94 percent of newspapers automatically rejected anonymous LTEs. Some newspapers in the 1980s and '90s created special anonymous opinion forums that allowed people to either record short verbal opinions via telephone (which were then transcribed and published) or send letters that were either unsigned or where the author used a pseudonym. Although many journalists derided the anonymous call-in forums as unethical (for instance, someone could make an unfounded opinion without worry of the consequences or having to back the comment up with hard facts), defenders argued that such forums upheld the free-press tradition of vigorous, uninhibited debate similar to that found in earlier newspapers.

Although primarily considered a function of print publications, LTEs also are present in electronic media.  In broadcast journalism, LTEs have always been a semi-regular feature of 60 Minutes and the news programs of National Public Radio.  LTE's also are widespread on the Internet in various forms.

By the early 21st century, the Internet had become a delivery system for many LTEs via e-mail and news Web sites (in fact, after several envelopes containing a powder suspected to be anthrax were mailed to lawmakers and journalists, several news organizations announced they would only accept e-mail LTEs). Because the Internet broadly expanded the potential readership of editorials and opinion columns at small newspapers, their controversial editorials or columns could sometimes attract much more e-mail than they were used to handling — so much so that a few newspapers had their e-mail servers crash.

Editors are a frequent target of letter-writing campaigns, also called “[[astroturfing]],” or “fake grass-roots” operations where sample letters are distributed on the Internet or otherwise, to be copied or rewritten and submitted as personal letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/how-organize-a-letter-writing-campaign Action Tips: Organize a Letter Writing Campaign] Dosomething.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=79797 Sample LTE] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803065007/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=79797 |date=2012-08-03 }} The Jewish Federations of North America&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LTE management gets little attention in trade journals, one organization, the National Conference of Editorial Writers, often includes essays on LTE management in its newsletter, The Masthead, and at its annual meetings.  Among the NCEW's strongest champions for LTEs was Ronald D. Clark of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, who wrote, "Consider letters as a barometer of how well (you are) engaging readers or viewers. The more you receive, the more you're connecting. The fewer you receive, the stronger the sign that you're putting the masses to sleep."

On the other hand many editors will allow the publication of anonymous letters where the details of name and address of the author are not printed, but are disclosed to the editor.  This can promote a debate of issues that are personal, contentious or embarrassing, yet are of importance to raise in a public debate.

Sometimes a letter to the editor in a local newspaper, such as the [[Dear IRS]] letter written by Ed Barnett to the ''[[Wichita Falls Times Record News]]'' in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], will end up receiving attention from the national media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/business/1467702,w-dear-irs-texas-barnett-taxes030909.article 'Dear IRS' rant against taxes hits nerve], Chicago Sun-Times, March 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misrepresentation==
Submitting a letter under a false name to [[shill]] in support or to criticize an opponent can have significant consequences. For example, Canadian politician [[Paul Reitsma]]'s career ended in scandal in 1999, after he signed letters addressed to newspapers as "Warren Betanko" praising himself and attacking his political opponents. His local paper wrote a [[wikt:front page|front-page]] story under the headline of "[[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] Reitsma is a liar and we can prove it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/disgraced-b-c-mla-reitsma-seeks-political-redemption-1.1028847|title=Disgraced B.C. MLA Reitsma seeks political redemption|date=September 24, 2011|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1966 [[Israel]], the [[Herut]] Party of then opposition leader [[Menachem Begin]] was shaken by scandal when letters sharply attacking Begin, which had been published in major dailies, were proven to have been authored by Begin's rivals for the party leadership and sent to the papers under various aliases and false names. As a result, the rivals were discredited and eventually expelled from the party, which helped buttress Begin's leadership position up to win the 1977 general elections and become [[Prime Minister of Israel]].

Vialleton was born in [[Vienne]]. He was the first professor of [[histology]] in the faculty of medicine at the [[University of Montpellier]].&lt;ref name="Lavabre-Bertrand"&gt;Lavabre-Bertrand T.

''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. p. 396 {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vialleton attempted to refute gradual [[transformism]] from a morphological perspective in his work ''Morphologie générale Membres et ceintures des vertébrés tétrapodes: Critique morphotogique du transformisme'' (1924).&lt;ref name="Engels"&gt;Engels, Eve-Marie; Glick, Thomas F.

(1924) 'Transformisme et morphologie', Bulletin biologique de la France et de la Belgique 58: 321-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed the chapter ''Morphologie et transformisme'' to the book ''Le Transformisme'' (1927). Vialleton's views were often misrepresented by [[Creationism|creationists]] as anti-evolutionary. His writings were influential to creationists such as [[Douglas Dewar]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers, Ronald L. (2006). ''[[The Creationists|The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design]]''. Harvard University Press. p. 146. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not reject evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Lustig, Abigail; Richards, Robert J.; Ruse, Michael. (2004). ''Darwinian Heresies''. Cambridge University Press. p. 85. {{ISBN|0-521-81516-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also incorrectly described as a critic of evolution by [[A.

The '''Maxwell stress tensor''' (named after [[James Clerk Maxwell]]) is a symmetric second-order [[tensor]] used in [[classical electromagnetism]] to represent the interaction between electromagnetic forces and [[momentum|mechanical momentum]]. In simple situations, such as a point charge moving freely in a homogeneous magnetic field, it is easy to calculate the forces on the charge from the [[Lorentz force law]]. When the situation becomes more complicated, this ordinary procedure can become impossibly difficult, with equations spanning multiple lines. It is therefore convenient to collect many of these terms in the Maxwell stress tensor, and to use tensor arithmetic to find the answer to the problem at hand.

In the relativistic formulation of electromagnetism, the Maxwell's tensor appears as a part of the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]] which is the electromagnetic component of the total [[stress–energy tensor]]. The latter describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in [[spacetime]].

==Motivation==
[[File:Lorentz force continuum.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force (per unit 3-volume) '''f''' on a continuous [[charge distribution]] ([[charge density]] ρ) in motion. The 3-[[current density]] '''J''' corresponds to the motion of the charge element ''dq'' in [[volume element]] ''dV'' and varies throughout the continuum.]]

As outlined below, the electromagnetic force is written in terms of '''E''' and '''B''', using [[vector calculus]] and [[Maxwell's equations]] symmetry in the terms containing '''E''' and '''B''' are sought for, and introducing the Maxwell stress tensor simplifies the result.

{{ordered list
|1= Starting with the [[Lorentz force]] law
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;
the force per unit volume is
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{f} = \rho\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|2= Next, ρ and '''J''' can be replaced by the fields '''E''' and '''B''', using [[Gauss's law]] and [[Ampère's circuital law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0 \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} \right)\mathbf{E} + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right) \times \mathbf{B} - \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \times \mathbf{B}\,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|3= The time derivative can be rewritten to something that can be interpreted physically, namely the [[Poynting vector]]. Using the [[product rule]] and [[Faraday's law of induction]] gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}) = \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\times \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{E} \times \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\times \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E})\,&lt;/math&gt;
and we can now rewrite '''f''' as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0 \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} \right)\mathbf{E} + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right) \times \mathbf{B} - \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right) - \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}),&lt;/math&gt;
then collecting terms with '''E''' and '''B''' gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0\left[  (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} )\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}) \right] + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[ -  \mathbf{B}\times\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right)  \right]
- \epsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|4= A term seems to be "missing" from the symmetry in '''E''' and '''B''', which can be achieved by inserting (∇ • '''B''')'''B''' because of [[Gauss' law for magnetism]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0\left[  (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} )\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{E} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}) \right] + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{B} )\mathbf{B} -  \mathbf{B}\times\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{B} \right)  \right]
- \epsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Eliminating the curls (which are fairly complicated to calculate), using the [[vector calculus identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\nabla} (\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{A} \times (\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}) + (\mathbf{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}) \mathbf{A}, &lt;/math&gt;
leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \epsilon_0\left[  (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{E} )\mathbf{E} + (\mathbf{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}) \mathbf{E} \right] + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \mathbf{B} )\mathbf{B} + (\mathbf{B}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}) \mathbf{B} \right] - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(\epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{\mu_0} B^2 \right)
- \epsilon_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
|5= This expression contains every aspect of electromagnetism and momentum and is relatively easy to compute. It can be written more compactly by introducing the '''Maxwell stress tensor''',
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j} \equiv \epsilon_0 \left(E_i E_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} E^2\right) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}  \left(B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} B^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;
All but the last term of f can be written as the tensor [[divergence]] of the maxwell stress tensor, giving:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} = \mathbf{f}  + \epsilon_0 \mu_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{S}}{\partial t}\,&lt;/math&gt;,

As in the [[Poynting's theorem]], the second term on the right side of the above equation can be interpreted as the time derivative of the EM field's momentum density, while the first term is the time derivative of the momentum density for the massive particles.  In this way, the above equation will be the law of conservation of momentum in classical electrodynamics.

where the [[Poynting vector]] has been introduced
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
}}

in the above relation for conservation of momentum,  &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''momentum flux density''' and plays a role similar to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; in [[Poynting's theorem]].

The above derivation assumes complete knowledge of both ρ and '''J''' (both free and bounded charges and currents). For the case of nonlinear materials (such as magnetic iron with a BH-curve), the nonlinear Maxwell stress tensor must be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggaaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=is+maxwell+stress+tensor+correct+for+nonlinear+steel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ln8aI46_ya&amp;sig=CXzs9vU-hUXY--Mn8ssR4GuMohg&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjggMizl9nSAhXJ2SwKHXNKCXQQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=is%20maxwell%20stress%20tensor%20correct%20for%20nonlinear%20steel&amp;f=false|title=Magnetic Actuators and Sensors|last=Brauer|first=John R.|date=2014-01-13|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118754979|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equation==
In [[physics]], the '''Maxwell stress tensor''' is the stress tensor of an [[electromagnetic field]]. As derived above in [[SI unit]]s, it is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j}  = \epsilon_0 E_i  E_j   + \frac{1}
{{\mu _0 }}B_i  B_j   - \frac{1}{2}\bigl( {\epsilon_0 E^2  + \tfrac{1}
{{\mu _0 }}B^2 } \bigr)\delta _{ij} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]] and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]], '''E''' is the [[electric field]], '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]] and δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Kronecker's delta]]. In Gaussian [[cgs unit]], it is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\left(E_{i}E_{j}+H_{i}H_{j}-
\frac{1}{2}(E^2+H^2)\delta_{ij}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where '''H''' is the [[magnetizing field]].

An alternative way of expressing this tensor is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\leftrightarrow  }{ \mathbf{\sigma} } = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left[ \mathbf{E}\otimes\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{H}\otimes\mathbf{H} - \frac{E^2+H^2 }{2}\mathbb{I} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
where ⊗ is the [[dyadic product]], and the last tensor is the unit dyad::

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{I}
\equiv
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1
\end{array}
\right)
=
(\mathbf{\hat x}\otimes\mathbf{\hat x} + \mathbf{\hat y}\otimes\mathbf{\hat y} + \mathbf{\hat z}\otimes\mathbf{\hat z})
&lt;/math&gt;

The element ''ij'' of the Maxwell stress tensor has units of momentum per unit of area per unit time and gives the flux of momentum parallel to the ''i''th axis crossing a surface normal to the ''j''th axis (in the negative direction) per unit of time.

These units can also be seen as units of force per unit of area (negative pressure), and the ''ij'' element of the tensor can also be interpreted as the force parallel to the ''i''th axis suffered by a surface normal to the jth axis per unit of area. Indeed, the diagonal elements give the [[tension (physics)|tension]] (pulling) acting on a differential area element normal to the corresponding axis. Unlike forces due to the pressure of an ideal gas, an area element in the electromagnetic field also feels a force in a direction that is not normal to the element. This shear is given by the off-diagonal elements of the stress tensor.

==Magnetism only==
If the field is only magnetic (which is largely true in motors, for instance), some of the terms drop out, and the equation in SI units becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i j} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} B^2 \delta_{i j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For cylindrical objects, such as the rotor of a motor, this is further simplified to:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{r t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} B_r B_t - \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} B^2 \delta_{r t} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the shear in the radial (outward from the cylinder) direction, and ''t'' is the shear in the tangential (around the cylinder) direction. It is the tangential force which spins the motor. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the flux density in the radial direction, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the flux density in the tangential direction.

==In Electrostatics==

In [[electrostatics]] the effects of magnetism are not present. In this case the magnetic field vanishes, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and we obtain the ''electrostatic Maxwell stress tensor''. It is given in component form by

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ij} = \varepsilon_0E_iE_j - \frac12\varepsilon_0E^2\delta_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;

and in symbolic form by

&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}\otimes\mathbf{E} - \frac12\varepsilon_0(\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{E})\mathbf{I}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the appropriate identity tensor (usually &lt;math&gt;3\times3&lt;/math&gt;).

==Eigenvalue==
The eigenvalues of the Maxwell stress tensor are given by:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
:&lt;math&gt;\{ \lambda \} = \left\{ - \frac{ \epsilon_0 E^2 + B^2 / \mu_0 }{2} ,~ \pm \sqrt{ \left( \frac{ \epsilon_0 E^2 - B^2 / \mu_0 }{2} \right)^2 + \frac{\epsilon_0}{\mu_0}\left( \boldsymbol{E} \cdot \boldsymbol{B} \right)^2} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

These eigenvalues are obtained by iteratively applying the [[Matrix determinant lemma|Matrix Determinant Lemma]], in conjunction with the [[Sherman-Morrison Formula]].

Noting that the characteristic equation matrix, &lt;math&gt;\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}}&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as

&lt;math&gt;\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}} = -\left(\lambda+ V\right)\mathbf{\mathbb{I}} + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}\mathbf{E}^T + \frac{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}^T}{\mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon_0 E^2 + B^2 / \mu_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

we set

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = -\left(\lambda+ V\right)\mathbf{\mathbb{I}} + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}\mathbf{E}^T&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the Matrix Determinant Lemma once, this gives us

&lt;math&gt;\det{\left(\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}}\right)} = \left(1 + \mu_0^{-1}\mathbf{B}^T\mathbf{U}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\right)\det{\left(\mathbf{U}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying it again yields,

&lt;math&gt;\det{\left(\overleftrightarrow{\sigma} - \lambda\mathbf{\mathbb{I}}\right)} = \left(1 + \mu_0^{-1}\mathbf{B}^T\mathbf{U}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\right) \left( 1 - \frac{\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E}}{\left( \lambda+ V \right)} \right)\left( -\lambda- V \right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

From the last multiplicand on the RHS, we immediately see that &lt;math&gt;\lambda=-V&lt;/math&gt; is one of the eigenvalues.

To find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;, we use the Sherman-Morrison formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}^{-1}=-\left(\lambda+ V\right)^{-1} - \frac{\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E}\mathbf{E}^T}{\left(\lambda+V\right)^2 - \left(\lambda+V\right)\left(\epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

Factoring out a &lt;math&gt;\left( -\lambda- V \right)&lt;/math&gt; term in the determinant, we are left with finding the zeros of the rational function:

&lt;math&gt;\left(-\left( \lambda+ V \right) - \frac{\epsilon_0\left(\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}\right)^2}{\mu_0\left(-\left(\lambda+ V\right) + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E} \right)} \right) \left( -\left(\lambda+ V\right) + \epsilon_0\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{E} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, once we solve

&lt;math&gt;-\left( \lambda+ V \right)\left(-\left(\lambda+ V\right) + \epsilon_0E^2 \right) - \frac{\epsilon_0\left(\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}\right)^2}{\mu_0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain the other two eigenvalues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Medium specificity''' is a consideration in [[aesthetics]] and [[art criticism]]. It is most closely associated with [[modernism]], but it predates it.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Overview==
According to [[Clement Greenberg]], who helped popularize the term, medium specificity holds that "the unique and proper area of competence" for a form of art corresponds with the ability of an artist to manipulate those features that are "unique to the nature" of a particular medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html

|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060105194921/http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |archivedate = 2006-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in painting, literal flatness and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] are emphasised rather than illusionism and [[figurative art|figuration]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa R. Schwartz, Jeannene M. Przyblyski, ''The Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture Reader'', Routledge, 2004, p8. {{ISBN|0-415-30866-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medium specific can be seen to mean that ''"the artwork is constituted by the characteristic qualities of the raw material."'' This would probably include the techniques used to manipulate the materials. ''"Medium-specificity is based on the distinct materiality of artistic media."'' As early as 1776  [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] ''"contends that an artwork, in order to be successful, needs to adhere to the specific stylistic properties of its own medium."''&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term is used both to describe artistic practices and as a way to analyze [[Visual arts|artwork]].   Critic [[N. Katherine Hayles]], for example, speaks of "media specific analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Much debate can remain as to what a given medium best lends itself to. 

Art dialogue in the post-modern period has tended to steer away from medium specificity as a particularly relevant principle.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Medium Specificity&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral relativism''' may be any of several [[philosophical]] positions concerned with the differences in [[morality|moral]] judgments across different [[people]] and [[culture]]s. ''[[Descriptive ethics|Descriptive]]'' moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral; ''[[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]]'' moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is [[Moral universalism|objectively]] right or wrong; and ''[[Normative ethics|normative]]'' moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to [[tolerate]] the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it.

Not all descriptive relativists adopt meta-ethical relativism, and moreover, not all meta-ethical relativists adopt normative relativism. [[Richard Rorty]], for example, argued that relativist philosophers believe "that the grounds for choosing between such opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought", but not that any belief is as valid as any other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rorty |first=Richard |title=Consequences of Pragmatism |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-8166-1064-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral relativism has been debated for thousands of years, from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[India]] to the present day, in diverse fields including art, philosophy, [[science]], and [[religion]].

==Variations==
===Descriptive===
Descriptive moral relativism is merely the [[positive science|positive]] or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts hold true and the same consequences seem likely to arise.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Swoyer
  | first = Chris
  | date = February 22, 2003
  | title = Relativism
  | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2
  | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the observation that different cultures have different moral standards.

Descriptive relativists do not necessarily advocate the tolerance of all behavior in light of such disagreement; that is to say, they are not necessarily normative relativists. Likewise, they do not necessarily make any commitments to the semantics, [[ontology]], or [[epistemology]] of moral judgement; that is, not all descriptive relativists are meta-ethical relativists.

Descriptive relativism is a widespread position in academic fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], which simply admit that it is incorrect to assume that the same moral or ethical frameworks are always in play in all historical and cultural circumstances.

===Meta-ethical===
[[Metaethics|Meta-ethical]] moral relativism is unpopular among philosophers; many are quite critical of it,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} though there are several [[contemporary philosophers]] who support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/ |title=Moral Relativism |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-ethical moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as "good", "bad", "right" and "wrong" do not stand subject to [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[truth]] conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Gowans]], "Moral Relativism" [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/#ForArg article link at Stanford Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The American anthropologist [[William Graham Sumner]] was an influential advocate of this view.  He argues in his 1906 work ''Folkways'' that what people consider right and wrong is shaped entirely - not primarily - by the traditions, customs, and practices of their culture.  Moreover, since in his analysis of human understanding there cannot be any higher moral standard than that provided by the local morals of a culture, no trans-cultural judgement about the rightness or wrongness of a culture's morals could possibly be justified.

Meta-ethical relativists are, first, descriptive relativists: they believe that, given the same set of facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what a person ''ought'' to do or prefer (based on societal or individual [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s). What's more, they argue that one cannot adjudicate these disagreements using any available independent standard of evaluation—any appeal to a relevant standard would always be merely personal or at best societal.

This view contrasts with [[moral universalism]], which argues that, even though well-intentioned persons disagree, and some may even remain unpersuadable (e.g. someone who is closed-minded), there is still a meaningful sense in which an action could be more "moral" (morally preferable) than another; that is, they believe there ''are'' objective standards of evaluation that seem worth calling "moral facts"—regardless of whether they are universally accepted.

===Normative===
Normative moral relativists believe not only the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has normative implications on what we ought to do. Normative moral relativists argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we ''ought'' to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an "ought" from relativistic premises.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/moral-relativism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Chris|last=Gowans|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=15 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist's ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like "we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour" without always adding "other people think ''intolerance'' of certain behaviours is moral". Philosophers like [[Russell Blackford]] even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As he puts it, "we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of our own respective societies, to the extent that they are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;at the end of his review at http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality. We can also criticize other cultures for failing to pursue even ''their own goals'' effectively.

The moral relativists may also still try to make sense of non-universal statements like "in this country, it is wrong to do X" or even "to me, it is right to do Y".&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

[[Moral universalist]]s argue further that their system often ''does'' justify tolerance, and that disagreement with moral systems does not always demand interference, and certainly not aggressive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; For example, the [[utilitarian]] might call another society's practice 'ignorant' or 'less moral', but there would still be much debate about courses of action (e.g. whether to focus on providing better education, or technology, etc.).

==History==
Moral relativism encompasses views and arguments that people in various [[culture]]s have held over several thousand years. For example, the ancient [[Jainism|Jaina]] [[Anekantavada]] principle of [[Mahavira]] (c. 599–527 BC) states that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth;&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp. 400–07&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Protagoras]] (c. 481–420 BC) famously asserted that "man is the measure of all things". The Greek [[historian]] [[Herodotus]] (c. 484–420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as better than all others. Various other ancient [[philosopher]]s also questioned the idea of an objective standard of morality.

In the early modern era [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18th-century [[the enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern [[emotivism]] and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) believed that we have to assess the value of our values since values are relative to one's goals and one's self. He emphasized the need to analyze our moral values and how much impact they may have on us. The problem with morality, according to Nietzsche, is that those who were considered "good" were the powerful nobles who had more education, and considered themselves better than anyone below their rank. Thus, what is considered good is relative. A "good man" is not questioned on whether or not there is a "bad", such as temptations, lingering inside him and he is considered to be more important than a man who is considered "bad" who is considered useless to making the human race better because of the morals we have subjected ourselves to. But since what is considered good and bad is relative, the importance and value we place on them should also be relative. He proposed that morality itself could be a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Douglas|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=362–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that morals should be constructed actively, making them relative to who we are and what we, as individuals, consider to be true, equal, good and bad, etc. instead of reacting to moral laws made by a certain group of individuals in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spinks|first=Lee|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar, supporting an anti-realist interpretation, concludes that "Nietzsche's central argument for anti-realism about value is explanatory: moral facts don't figure in the 'best explanation' of experience, and so are not real constituents of the objective world.  [[Moral value]]s, in short, can be 'explained away.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], "Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy" [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/ article link at Stanford Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is certain that Nietzsche criticizes Plato's prioritization of [[transcendentalism|transcendence]] as the [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. The Platonist view holds that what is 'true', or most real, is something which is other-worldly while the (real) world of experience is like a mere 'shadow' of the Forms, most famously expressed in Plato's [[allegory of the cave]]. Nietzsche believes that this transcendence also had a parallel growth in [[Christianity]], which prioritized life-denying moral qualities such as humility and obedience through the [[Christianity|church]].  (See ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'', ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', etc.)

Anthropologists such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) have cautioned observers against [[ethnocentricism]]—using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that transcendent morals do not exist—only socially constructed customs do (''see'' [[cultural relativism]]); and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist "insofar as he remains an anthropologist ... is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other". To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both [[Social sciences|social scientists]] and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist [[Edward Westermarck]] (1862–1939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one's upbringing. He rejected [[G.E. Moore]]'s (1873–1958) [[ethical intuitionism]]—in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition—because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power.

===Philosophical===

====R. M. Hare====
{{See also|Universal prescriptivism}}
Some philosophers, for example [[R. M. Hare]] (1919–2002), argue that moral propositions remain subject to human logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral [[discourse]] with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or [[truth condition]]s of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that human logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, human logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare's ''Sorting out Ethics''). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as ''less'' or ''more'', which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, "this is a ''good'' wrench" or "this is a ''bad'' wheel". This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain "facts".

====Walter Terence Stace====
"Ethical Relativity" is the topic of the first two chapters in ''The Concept of Morals'', in which [[Walter Terence Stace]] argues against [[moral absolutism]], but for [[moral universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Philosophical poverty====
Critics propose that moral relativism fails because it rejects basic premises of discussions on morality, or because it cannot arbitrate disagreement.  Many critics, including [[Ibn Warraq]] and [[Eddie Tabash]], have suggested that meta-ethical relativists essentially take themselves out of any discussion of normative morality, since they seem to be rejecting an assumption of such discussions: the premise that there are right and wrong answers that can be discovered through reason. Practically speaking, such critics will argue that meta-ethical relativism may amount to [[moral nihilism]], or else incoherence.

These critics argue specifically that the moral relativists reduce the extent of their input in normative moral discussions to either rejecting the very having of the discussion, or else deeming both disagreeing parties to be correct. For instance, the moral relativist can only appeal to preference to object to the practice of murder or torture by individuals for [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podcast.tv/video-podcasts/reasonable-doubts-podcast-121147.html|title=Reasonable Doubts Podcast, Ibn Warraq interviews "Defending the West" and "What the Koran Really Says"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118155705/http://www.podcast.tv/video-podcasts/reasonable-doubts-podcast-121147.html|archivedate=2009-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accusation that relativists reject widely held terms of discourse is similar to arguments used against other "discussion-stoppers" like some forms of [[solipsism]] or the rejection of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]].

Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] made a similar criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/08/simon-blackburn.html|title=Simon Blackburn on Moral Relativism|website=philosophy bites}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explains that moral relativism fails as a ''moral system'' simply because it cannot arbitrate disagreements.

The moral relativist might respond that their conception of morality is more accurate given the provided cross cultural data and that it seems to hold true regardless of the counter arguments of the position's objectors.  They also might argue that most moral arguments are a form of the logical fallacy "Begging the Question" because it assumed that the moral position being argued is already good and moral and people who argue to "prove" their moral position are assuming that the cultural moral norms that they already have are already true.  The critics, however, maintain that their conception of morality is, for that exact reason, inadequate. Ultimately critics can do little more than to ''invite'' moral-relativists to re-define "morality" in practical or [[Moral realist|morally realistic]] terms.

====Other criticism====
Some arguments come when people question which moral justifications or truths are said to be relative. Because people belong to many groups based on culture, race, religion, etc., it is difficult to claim that the values of the group have authority for the members.  A part of meta-ethical relativism is identifying which group of people those truths are relative to. Another component is that many people belong to more than one group. The beliefs of the groups that a person belongs to may be fundamentally different, and so it is hard to decide which are relative and which win out. A person practicing meta-ethical relativism would not necessarily object to either view, but develop an opinion and argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Fall 2015|title = Moral Relativism|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/moral-relativism/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Chris|last = Gowans|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===

====Roman Catholicism====
{{See also|Relativism#Catholic Church and relativism}}
Catholic and some secular intellectuals attribute the perceived post-[[World War II|war]] decadence of Europe to the displacement of absolute values by moral relativism. [[Pope Benedict XVI]], [[Marcello Pera]] and others have argued that after about 1960, Europeans massively abandoned many traditional norms rooted in [[Christianity]] and replaced them with continuously evolving relative moral rules. In this view, [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] has become separated from procreation, which led to a decline in the importance of [[family|families]] and to [[Sub-replacement fertility|depopulation]]. As a result, currently the population vacuum in Europe is filled by immigrants, often from [[Islam]]ic countries, who attempt to reestablish absolute values which stand at odds with moral relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XVI|Josef Cardinal Ratzinger]], [[Marcello Pera]], ''Without Roots: The West, Relativism, Christianity, Islam'' (Basic Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-465-00634-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The most authoritative response to moral relativism from the Roman Catholic perspective can be found in ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'', an [[encyclical]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Many of the main criticisms of moral relativism by the Catholic Church relate largely to modern controversies, such as elective abortion.

====Buddhism====
[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], an American [[Buddhist]] monk, has written: "By assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity, the materialistic [[world view]] ... threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality. The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today. To counter this tendency, mere moral exhortation is insufficient. If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct, it cannot be propounded as a self-justifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order. Religion must affirm, in the clearest terms, that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion, not subjective superstructure, but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], "A Buddhist Response to Contemporary Dilemmas of Human Existence" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/response.html article link at Access to Insight]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary===
The literary perspectivism begins at the different versions of the Greek myths. Symbolism created multiple suggestions for a vers. Structuralism teaches us the polysemy of the poems.

'''Neo-futurism''' is a late 20th to early 21st century movement in [[the arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]. It could be seen as a departure from the attitude of [[Postmodern architecture|post-modernism]] and represents an [[Idealism|idealistic]] belief in a better future and "a need to periodize the modern rapport with the technological".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hal Foster]], Annals of the Architectural Association School of Architecture, Issues 14-16, Published by The Architectural Association, London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrialization that began worldwide following the end of the [[Second World War]] gave wind to new streams of thought in life, art and architecture, leading to post-modernism, neo-modernism and then neo-futurism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/10-of-the-most-unusual-architectural-structures-in-europe/?view=all|title=10 of the Most Unusual Architectural Structures in Europe|work=TheRichest|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Louis Cohen]] has defined neo-futurism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/design/the-future-of-architecture-since-1889.php|title=The Future of Architecture Since 1889|work=Cool Hunting|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.stmarytx.edu/mobile/item.php?search/o681503360|title=Blume Library Mobile|publisher=Library.stmarytx.edu|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "a corollary to technology, being the structures built today byproducts of new materials to create previously impossible forms." Etan J. Ilfeld wrote that in the contemporary neo-futurist aesthetics "the machine becomes an integral element of the creative process itself, and generates the emergence of artistic modes that would have been impossible prior to computer technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Contemporary-Art-Etan-Ilfeld/dp/1908126221|title=Beyond Contemporary Art: Amazon.co.uk: Etan Ilfeld: Books|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reyner Banham's definition of "une architecture autre" is a call for an architecture that technologically overcomes all previous architectures but possessing an expressive form,&lt;ref&gt;Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as Banham stated about neo-futuristic "Archigram’s Plug-in Computerized City, form does not have to follow function into oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;Reyner Banham, "A Clip-on Architecture," Architectural Design 35, no. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''Nielsen theory''' is a branch of mathematical research with its origins in [[topological]] [[fixed point theory]]. Its central ideas were developed by Danish mathematician [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], and bear his name.

The theory developed in the study of the so-called ''minimal number'' of a [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' from a [[compact (topology)|compact]] space to itself, denoted ''MF''[''f'']. This is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MF}[f] = \min \{ \# \mathrm{Fix}(g) \, | \, g \sim f \},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''~'' indicates [[homotopy]] of mappings, and #Fix(''g'') indicates the number of fixed points of ''g''. The minimal number was very difficult to compute in Nielsen's time, and remains so today. Nielsen's approach is to group the fixed point set into classes, which are judged "essential" or "nonessential" according to whether or not they can be "removed" by a homotopy.

Nielsen's original formulation is equivalent to the following:
We define an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of fixed points of a self-map ''f'' on a space ''X''. We say that ''x'' is equivalent to ''y'' if and only if there exists a [[path (topology)|path]] ''c'' from ''x'' to ''y'' with ''f''(''c'') homotopic to ''c'' as paths. The equivalence classes with respect to this relation are called the '''Nielsen classes''' of ''f'', and the '''Nielsen number''' ''N''(''f'') is defined as the number of Nielsen classes having non-zero [[fixed point index]] sum.

Nielsen proved that
:&lt;math&gt;N(f) \le \mathit{MF}[f],&lt;/math&gt;
making his invariant a good tool for estimating the much more difficult ''MF''[''f'']. This leads immediately to what is now known as the '''Nielsen fixed point theorem:''' ''Any map f has at least N(f) fixed points.''

Because of its definition in terms of the [[fixed point index]], the Nielsen number is closely related to the [[Lefschetz number]]. Indeed, shortly after Nielsen's initial work, the two invariants were combined into a single "generalized Lefschetz number" (more recently called the [[Reidemeister trace]]) by [[Wecken]] and [[Reidemeister]].

'''Norms''' are concepts ([[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s) of practical import, oriented to effecting an action, rather than conceptual abstractions that describe, explain, and express. Normative sentences imply "ought-to" types of statements and assertions, in distinction to sentences that provide "is" types of statements and assertions. Common normative sentences include [[Imperative mood|commands]], permissions, and prohibitions; common normative abstract concepts include ''sincerity'', ''justification'', and  ''honesty''. A popular account of norms describes them as [[reason]]s to take [[action (philosophy)|action]], to [[belief|believe]], and to [[emotion|feel]].

==Types of norms==
Orders and permissions express norms. Such norm sentences do not describe how the [[world]] is, they rather prescribe how the world should be. [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] sentences are the most obvious way to express norms, but declarative sentences also may be norms, as is the case with [[law]]s or 'principles'. Generally, whether an expression is a norm depends on what the sentence intends to assert. For instance, a sentence of the form "All Ravens are Black" could on one account be taken as descriptive, in which case an instance of a white raven would contradict it, or alternatively "All Ravens are Black" could be interpreted as a norm, in which case it stands as a principle and definition, so 'a white raven' would then not be a raven.

Those norms purporting to create [[Convention (norm)|obligation]]s (or [[duty|duties]]) and [[permission (philosophy)|permission]]s are called ''[[deontology|deontic]] norms'' (see also [[deontic logic]]). The concept of deontic norm is already an extension of a previous concept of norm, which would only include imperatives, that is, norms purporting to create duties. The understanding that permissions are norms in the same way was an important step in [[ethics]] and [[philosophy of law]].
[[File:Constitutive Norms vs. Deontic Norms.png|thumb|A flowchart with examples of constitutive and deontic norms.|339x339px]]
In addition to deontic norms, many other varieties have been identified. For instance, some [[constitution]]s establish the [[national anthem]]. These norms do not directly create any duty or permission. They create a "[[National symbols|national symbol]]". Other norms create [[nation]]s themselves or [[politics|political]] and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] regions within a nation. The action orientation of such norms is less obvious than in the case of a command or permission, but is essential for understanding the relevance of issuing such norms: When a folk song becomes a "national anthem" the meaning of singing one and the same song changes; likewise, when a piece of land becomes an administrative region, this has legal consequences for many activities taking place on that territory; and without these consequences concerning action, the norms would be irrelevant. A more obviously action-oriented variety of such ''constitutive norms'' (as opposed to deontic or ''regulatory norms'') establishes social institutions which give rise to new, previously inexistent types of actions or activities (a standard example is the institution of marriage without which "getting married" would not be a feasible action; another is the rules constituting a game: without the norms of soccer, there would not exist such an action as executing an [[indirect free kick]]).

Any [[convention (norm)|convention]] can create a norm, although the relation between both is not settled.

There is a significant discussion about (legal) norms that give someone the [[power (sociology)|power]] to create other norms. They are called ''power-conferring norms'' or ''norms of competence''. Some authors argue that they are still deontic norms, while others argue for a close connection between them and [[institutional fact]]s (see Raz 1975, Ruiter 1993).

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] conventions, for example, the convention in [[English language|English]] that "cat" means cat or the convention in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] that "gato" means cat, are among the most important norms.

[[Game]]s completely depend on norms. The fundamental norm of many games is the norm establishing who wins and loses. In other games, it is the norm establishing how to score points.

==Major characteristics==
One major characteristic of norms is that, unlike [[proposition]]s, they are not descriptively [[truth|true]] or false, since norms do not purport to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something.  Some people say{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} they are "prescriptively true" or false.  Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] to [[reality]], some philosophers, beginning with [[Aristotle]], assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right [[Motivation|desire]].  Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their [[proposition]]al content obtains or not (see also [[John Searle]] and [[speech act]]).

There is an important difference between ''norms'' and ''normative propositions'', although they are often expressed by identical sentences.  "You may go out." usually expresses a norm if it is uttered by the teacher to one of the students, but it usually expresses a normative proposition if it is uttered to one of the students by one of his or her classmates.  Some ethical theories reject that there can be normative propositions, but these are accepted by [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]].  One can also think of propositional norms; [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s and [[question]]s arguably express propositional norms (they set a proposition as asserted or questioned).

Another purported feature of norms, it is often argued, is that they never regard only natural [[property|properties]] or [[entity|entities]].  Norms always bring something artificial, [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], [[institution]]al or "unworldly".  This might be related to [[David Hume|Hume's]] assertion that it is not possible to [[is-ought problem|derive ought from is]] and to [[G.E. Moore|G.E. Moore's]] claim that there is a [[naturalistic fallacy]] when one tries to analyse "good" and "bad" in terms of a natural [[concept]].  In [[aesthetics]], it has also been argued that it is impossible to derive an aesthetical [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] from a non-aesthetical one. The acceptability of [[Ethical non-naturalism|non-natural properties]], however, is strongly debated in present-day philosophy. Some authors deny their [[existence]], some others try to [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduce]] them to natural ones, on which the former [[Supervenience|supervene]].

Other thinkers (Adler, 1986) assert that norms can be [[nature|natural]] in a different sense than that of "corresponding to something proceeding from the object of the prescription as a strictly internal source of action".  Rather, those who assert the existence of natural prescriptions say norms can suit a natural ''need'' on the part of the prescribed entity.  More to the point, however, is the putting forward of the notion that just as descriptive statements being considered true are conditioned upon certain [[self-evident]] descriptive truths suiting the nature of reality (such as:  it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be at the same time and in the same manner), a prescriptive truth can suit the nature of the will through the authority of it being based upon [[self-evident]] prescriptive truths (such as:  one ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else).

Recent works maintain that normativity has an important role in several different philosophical subjects, not only in ethics and philosophy of law (see Dancy, 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21720">In [[mathematics]], an '''ordered pair''' (''a'', ''b'') is a pair of objects. The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair (''a'', ''b'') is different from the ordered pair (''b'', ''a'') unless ''a'' = ''b''.  (In contrast, the [[unordered pair]] {''a'', ''b''} equals the unordered pair {''b'', ''a''}.)

Ordered pairs are also called [[tuple|2-tuples]], or [[sequence]]s (sometimes, lists in a computer science context) of length 2; ordered pairs of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] are also called 2-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]].
The entries of an ordered pair can be other ordered pairs, enabling the recursive definition of ordered [[n-tuple|''n''-tuple]]s (ordered lists of ''n'' objects). For example, the ordered triple (''a'',''b'',''c'') can be defined as (''a'', (''b'',''c'')), i.e., as one pair nested in another.

In the ordered pair (''a'', ''b''), the object ''a'' is called the ''first entry'', and the object ''b'' the ''second entry'' of the pair. Alternatively, the objects are called the first and second ''components'', the first and second ''coordinates'', or the left and right ''projections'' of the ordered pair.

[[Cartesian product]]s and [[binary relation]]s (and hence [[function (mathematics)|functions]]) are defined in terms of ordered pairs.

==Generalities==
Let &lt;math&gt;(a_1, b_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a_2, b_2)&lt;/math&gt; be ordered pairs. Then the ''characteristic'' (or ''defining'') ''property'' of the ordered pair is:

:&lt;math&gt;(a_1, b_1) = (a_2, b_2)\text{  if and only if  } a_1 = a_2\text{ and }b_1 = b_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all ordered pairs whose first entry is in some set ''A'' and whose second entry is in some set ''B'' is called the [[Cartesian product]] of ''A'' and ''B'', and written ''A'' × ''B''. A [[binary relation]] between sets ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'' × ''B''.

The {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} notation may be used for other purposes, most notably as denoting [[open interval]]s on the [[real number line]]. In such situations, the context will usually make it clear which meaning is intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Steven R.|last=Lay|title=Analysis / With an Introduction to Proof|edition=4th|publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-148101-5|year=2005|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=Sets, Functions and Logic / An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|edition=3rd|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall / CRC|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-449-1|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; For additional clarification, the ordered pair may be denoted by the variant notation {{math|&lt; ''a'', ''b''&gt;}}, but this notation also has other uses.

The left and right projection of a pair ''p'' is usually denoted by ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') and ''π''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''p''), or by ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') and ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p''), respectively.
In contexts where arbitrary ''n''-tuples are considered, ''π''{{su|p=''n''|b=''i''}}(''t'') is a common notation for the ''i''-th component of an ''n''-tuple ''t''.

==Informal and formal definitions==

In some introductory mathematics textbooks an informal (or intuitive) definition of ordered pair is given, such as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For any two objects {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, the ordered pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is a notation specifying the two objects {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, in that order.&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;{{citation|first=Robert S.|last=Wolf|title=Proof, Logic, and Conjecture / The Mathematician's Toolbox|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co.|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7167-3050-7|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is usually followed by a comparison to a set of two elements; pointing out that in a set {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} must be different, but in an ordered pair they may be equal and that while the order of listing the elements of a set doesn't matter, in an ordered pair changing the order of distinct entries changes the ordered pair.

This "definition" is unsatisfactory because it is only descriptive and is based on an intuitive understanding of ''order''. However, as is sometimes pointed out, no harm will come from relying on this description and almost everyone thinks of ordered pairs in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Peter|last1=Fletcher|first2=C. Wayne|last2=Patty|title=Foundations of Higher Mathematics|publisher=PWS-Kent|year=1988|isbn=0-87150-164-3|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more satisfactory approach is to observe that the characteristic property of ordered pairs given above is all that is required to understand the role of ordered pairs in mathematics. Hence the ordered pair can be taken as a [[primitive notion]], whose associated axiom is the characteristic property. This was the approach taken by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|N. Bourbaki]] group in its ''Theory of Sets'', published in 1954. However, this approach also has its drawbacks as both the existence of ordered pairs and their characteristic property must be axiomatically assumed.&lt;ref name=Wolf /&gt;

Another way to rigorously deal with ordered pairs is to define them formally in the context of set theory. This can be done in several ways and has the advantage that existence and the characteristic property can be proven from the axioms that define the set theory. One of the most cited versions of this definition is due to Kuratowski (see below) and his definition was used in the second edition of Bourbaki's ''Theory of Sets'', published in 1970. Even those mathematical textbooks that give an informal definition of ordered pairs will often mention the formal definition of Kuratowski in an exercise.

==Defining the ordered pair using set theory==

If one agrees that [[set theory]] is an appealing [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]], then all mathematical objects must be defined as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of some sort. Hence if the ordered pair is not taken as primitive, it must be defined as a set.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]] has argued that the set-theoretical implementations of the concept of the ordered pair   is a paradigm for the clarification of philosophical  ideas (see  "[[Word and Object]]", section 53).
The general notion of such definitions or implementations  are discussed in Thomas Forster "Reasoning about theoretical entities".
&lt;/ref&gt; Several set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair are given below.

===Wiener's definition===
[[Norbert Wiener]] proposed the first set theoretical definition of the ordered pair in 1914:&lt;ref&gt;Wiener's paper "A Simplification of the logic of relations" is reprinted, together with a valuable commentary on pages 224ff in van Heijenoort, Jean (1967), ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1979-1931'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, {{isbn|0-674-32449-8}} (pbk.). van Heijenoort states the simplification this way: "By giving a definition of the ordered pair of two elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes".&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left( a, b \right) := 
\left\{\left\{ \left\{a\right\},\, \emptyset \right\},\,  \left\{\left\{b\right\}\right\}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
He observed that this definition made it possible to define the [[type theory|types]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' as sets. ''Principia Mathematica'' had taken types, and hence [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] of all arities, as [[primitive notion|primitive]].

Wiener used &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''b''}} instead of {''b''} to make the definition compatible with [[type theory]] where all elements in a class must be of the same "type". With ''b'' nested within an additional set, its type is equal to &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\}, \emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;'s.

===Hausdorff's definition===
About the same time as Wiener (1914), [[Felix Hausdorff]] proposed his definition:
: &lt;math&gt;(a, b) := \left\{ \{a, 1\}, \{b, 2\} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
"where 1 and 2 are two distinct objects different from a and b."&lt;ref&gt;cf introduction to Wiener's paper in van Heijenoort 1967:224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kuratowski's definition===
In 1921 [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] offered the now-accepted definition&lt;ref&gt;cf introduction to Wiener's paper in van Heijenoort 1967:224. van Heijenoort observes that the resulting set that represents the ordered pair "has a type higher by 2 than the elements (when they are of the same type)"; he offers references that show how, under certain circumstances, the type can be reduced to 1 or 0.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sur la notion de l'ordre dans la Théorie des Ensembles|first=Casimir|last=Kuratowski|authorlink=Kazimierz Kuratowski|year=1921|journal=[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]|pages=161–171|volume=2|number=1|url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm2/fm2122.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
of the ordered pair (''a'', ''b''):
:&lt;math&gt;(a, \ b)_K \; := \  \{ \{ a \}, \ \{ a, \ b \} \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this definition is used even when the first and the second coordinates are identical:
: &lt;math&gt;(x,\ x)_K = \{\{x\},\{x, \ x\}\} = \{\{x\},\ \{x\}\} = \{\{x\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Given some ordered pair ''p'', the property "''x'' is the first coordinate of ''p''" can be formulated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall{Y}{\in}{p}:{x}{\in}{Y}.&lt;/math&gt;
The property "''x'' is the second coordinate of ''p''" can be formulated as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\exist{Y}{\in}{p}:{x}{\in}{Y})\land(\forall{Y_{1},Y_{2}}{\in}{p}:Y_{1}\ne Y_{2}\rarr ({x}{\notin}{Y_{1}}\lor{x}{\notin}{Y_{2}})).&lt;/math&gt;
In the case that the left and right coordinates are identical, the right [[conjunct]] &lt;math&gt;(\forall{Y_{1},Y_{2}}{\in}{p}:Y_{1}\ne Y_{2}\rarr ({x}{\notin}{Y_{1}}\lor{x}{\notin}{Y_{2}}))&lt;/math&gt; is trivially true, since ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is never the case.

This is how we can extract the first coordinate of a pair (using the notation for [[Intersection (set theory)#Arbitrary intersections|arbitrary intersection]] and [[Union (set theory)#Arbitrary unions|arbitrary union]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(p) = \bigcup\bigcap p.&lt;/math&gt;

This is how the second coordinate can be extracted:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(p) = \bigcup\{x \in \bigcup p \mid \bigcup p \not= \bigcap p \rarr x \notin \bigcap p \}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Variants====
The above Kuratowski definition of the ordered pair is "adequate" in that it satisfies the characteristic property that an ordered pair must satisfy, namely that &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = (x,y) \leftrightarrow (a=x) \land (b=y)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, it adequately expresses 'order', in that &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = (b,a)&lt;/math&gt; is false unless &lt;math&gt;b = a&lt;/math&gt;. There are other definitions, of similar or lesser complexity, that are equally  adequate:
* &lt;math&gt;( a, b )_{\text{reverse}} :=  \{ \{ b \}, \{a, b\}\};&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;( a, b )_{\text{short}} :=  \{ a, \{a, b\}\};&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;( a, b )_{\text{01}} := \{\{0, a \}, \{1, b \}\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This differs from Hausdorff's definition in not requiring the two elements 0 and 1 to be distinct from ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''reverse''' definition is merely a trivial variant of the Kuratowski definition, and as such is of no independent interest. The definition '''short''' is so-called because it requires two rather than three pairs of [[braces (punctuation)|braces]]. Proving that '''short''' satisfies the characteristic property requires the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] [[axiom of regularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Tourlakis, George (2003) ''Lectures in Logic and Set Theory. Vol. 2: Set Theory''. Cambridge Univ. Press. Proposition III.10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if one uses [[von Neumann ordinal|von Neumann's set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers]], then 2 is defined as the set {0, 1} = {0, {0}}, which is indistinguishable from the pair (0, 0)&lt;sub&gt;short&lt;/sub&gt;. Yet another disadvantage of the '''short''' pair is the fact, that even if ''a'' and ''b'' are of the same type, the elements of the '''short''' pair are not. (However, if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' then the '''short''' version keeps having cardinality 2, which is something one might expect of any "pair", including any "ordered pair". Also note that the '''short''' version is used in [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], upon which the [[Mizar system]] is founded.)

====Proving that definitions satisfy the characteristic property====
Prove: (''a'', ''b'') = (''c'', ''d'') [[if and only if]] ''a'' = ''c'' and ''b'' = ''d''.

'''Kuratowski''':&lt;br&gt;
''If''. If ''a = c'' and ''b = d'', then {{''a''}, {''a, b''}} = {{''c''}, {''c, d''}}. Thus (''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c, d'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Only if''. Two cases: ''a'' = ''b'', and ''a'' ≠ ''b''.

If ''a'' = ''b'':
:(''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = {{''a''}, {''a, b''}}  = {{''a''}, {''a, a''}} = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''}}.
:(''c, d'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = {{''c''}, {''c, d''}} = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''}}.
:Thus {''c''} = {''c, d''} = {''a''}, which implies ''a'' = ''c'' and ''a'' = ''d''. By hypothesis, ''a'' = ''b''. Hence ''b'' = ''d''.

If ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then (''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c, d'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; implies {{''a''}, {''a, b''}} = {{''c''}, {''c, d''}}.

:Suppose {''c, d''} = {''a''}. Then ''c = d = a'', and so {{''c''}, {''c, d''}} = {{''a''}, {''a, a''}} = {{''a''}, {''a''}} = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''}}. But then {{''a''}, {''a, b''}} would also equal &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''}}, so that ''b = a'' which contradicts ''a'' ≠ ''b''.

:Suppose {''c''} = {''a, b''}. Then ''a = b = c'', which also contradicts ''a'' ≠ ''b''.

:Therefore {''c''} = {''a''}, so that ''c = a'' and {''c, d''} = {''a, b''}.

:If ''d = a'' were true, then {''c, d''} = {''a, a''} = {''a''} ≠ {''a, b''}, a contradiction. Thus ''d = b'' is the case, so that ''a = c'' and ''b = d''.

'''Reverse''':&lt;br&gt;
(''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;reverse&lt;/sub&gt; = {{''b''}, {''a, b''}} = {{''b''}, {''b, a''}} = (''b, a'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;.

''If''. If (''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;reverse&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c, d'')&lt;sub&gt;reverse&lt;/sub&gt;,
(''b, a'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = (''d, c'')&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore ''b = d'' and ''a = c''.

''Only if''. If ''a = c'' and ''b = d'', then {{''b''}, {''a, b''}} = {{''d''}, {''c, d''}}.
Thus (''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;reverse&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c, d'')&lt;sub&gt;reverse&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Short:'''&lt;ref&gt;For a formal [[Metamath]] proof of the adequacy of '''short''', see [http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/opthreg.html here (opthreg).] Also see Tourlakis (2003), Proposition III.10.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

''If'': If ''a = c'' and ''b = d'', then {''a'', {''a, b''}} = {''c'', {''c, d''}}. Thus (''a, b'')&lt;sub&gt;short&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c, d'')&lt;sub&gt;short&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Only if'': Suppose {''a'', {''a, b''}} = {''c'', {''c, d''}}.
Then ''a'' is in the left hand side, and thus in the right hand side.
Because equal sets have equal elements, one of ''a = c'' or ''a'' = {''c, d''} must be the case.
:If ''a'' = {''c, d''}, then by similar reasoning as above, {''a, b''} is in the right hand side, so {''a, b''} = ''c'' or {''a, b''} = {''c, d''}.
::If {''a, b''} = ''c'' then ''c'' is in {''c, d''} = ''a'' and ''a'' is in ''c'', and this combination contradicts the axiom of regularity, as {''a, c''} has no minimal element under the relation "element of."
::If {''a, b''} = {''c, d''}, then ''a'' is an element of ''a'', from ''a'' = {''c, d''} = {''a, b''}, again contradicting regularity.
:Hence ''a = c'' must hold.

Again, we see that {''a, b''} = ''c'' or {''a, b''} = {''c, d''}.
:The option {''a, b''} = ''c'' and ''a = c'' implies that ''c'' is an element of ''c'', contradicting regularity.
:So we have ''a = c'' and {''a, b''} = {''c, d''}, and so: {''b''} = {''a, b''} \ {''a''} = {''c, d''} \ {''c''} = {''d''}, so ''b'' = ''d''.

===Quine–Rosser definition===
[[J. Barkley Rosser|Rosser]] (1953)&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser]], 1953. ''Logic for Mathematicians''. McGraw–Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; employed a definition of the ordered pair due to [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]] which requires a prior definition of the [[natural number]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; be the set of natural numbers and define first
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) := \left\{\begin{matrix}
      x, &amp; \mbox{if }x \not\in \N \\
      x+1, &amp; \mbox{if }x \in \N.
    \end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; increments its argument, if it is a natural number and leaves it as is otherwise. Note: 0 does not appear as functional value of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
As &lt;math&gt;x \setminus \N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of the elements of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; not in &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; go on with
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) := \sigma[x] = \{\sigma(\alpha)|\alpha \in x\} = (x \setminus \N) \cup \{n+1 : n \in (x \cap \N) \}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the (elementwise) [[Image (mathematics)#Other terminology|image]] of a set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma''x&lt;/math&gt; as well. Applying this function to a set ''x'' simply increments every natural number in it. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; does never contain the number 0, so that for any sets ''x'' and ''y'',
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) \not= \{0\} \cup \varphi(y).&lt;/math&gt;
Further, define
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) := \sigma[x] \cup \{0\} = \varphi(x) \cup \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
By this, &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; does always contain the number 0.

Finally, define the ordered pair (''A'', ''B'') as the disjoint union
:&lt;math&gt;(A, B) := \varphi[A] \cup \psi[B] = \{\varphi(a) : a \in A\} \cup \{\varphi(b) \cup \{0\} : b \in B \}.&lt;/math&gt;
(which is &lt;math&gt;\varphi''A \cup \psi''B&lt;/math&gt; in alternate notation).

Extracting all the elements of the pair that do not contain 0 and undoing &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; yields ''A''. Likewise, ''B'' can be recovered from the elements of the pair that do contain 0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ Holmes, M. Randall]: ''[http://math.boisestate.edu/~best/best18/Talks/holmes_best18.pdf On Ordered Pairs]'', on: Boise State, March 29, 2009. The author uses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[type theory]] and in outgrowths thereof such as the axiomatic set theory [[New Foundations|NF]], the Quine–Rosser pair has the same type as its projections and hence is termed a "type-level" ordered pair. Hence this definition has the advantage of enabling a [[function (mathematics)|function]], defined as a set of ordered pairs, to have a type only 1 higher than the type of its arguments. This definition works only if the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is the case in [[New Foundations|NF]], but not in [[type theory]] or in [[New Foundations|NFU]]. [[J. Barkley Rosser]] showed that the existence of such a type-level ordered pair (or even a "type-raising by 1" ordered pair) implies the [[axiom of infinity]]. For an extensive discussion of the ordered pair in the context of Quinian set theories, see Holmes (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, M. Randall (1998) ''[http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/head.pdf  Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]''. Academia-Bruylant. The publisher has graciously consented to permit diffusion of this monograph via the web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantor-Frege definition===
Early in the development of the set theory, before paradoxes were discovered, Cantor followed Frege by defining the ordered pair of two sets as the class of all relations that hold between these sets, assuming that the notion of relation is primitive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frege |first=Gottlob |year=1893 |title=Grundgesetze der Arithmetik |url=https://korpora.zim.uni-duisburg-essen.de/Frege/PDF/gga1_o_corr.pdf |location=Jena |publisher=Verlag Hermann Pohle }} §144&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) = \{R : x R y \}.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is inadmissible in most modern formalized set theories and is methodologically similar to defining the [[Cardinality|cardinal]] of a set as the class of all sets equipotent with the given set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kanamori |first=Akihiro |year=2007 |title=Set Theory From Cantor to Cohen |url=http://math.bu.edu/people/aki/16.pdf |publisher=Elsevier BV }} p. 22, footnote 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morse definition===
[[Morse–Kelley set theory]] makes free use of [[proper class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morse |first=Anthony P. |year=1965 |title=A Theory of Sets |location= |publisher=Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Morse|Morse]] defined the ordered pair so that its projections could be proper classes as well as sets. (The Kuratowski definition does not allow this.) He first defined ordered pairs whose projections are sets in Kuratowski's manner. He then ''redefined'' the pair

:&lt;math&gt; (x, y) = (\{0\} \times s(x)) \cup (\{1\} \times s(y))&lt;/math&gt;

where the component Cartesian products are Kuratowski pairs of sets and where

:&lt;math&gt; s(x) = \{\emptyset \} \cup \{\{t\} | t \in x\} &lt;/math&gt;

This renders possible pairs whose projections are proper classes. The Quine-Rosser definition above  also admits [[proper class]]es as projections. Similarly the triple is defined as a 3-tuple as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; (x, y, z) = (\{0\} \times s(x)) \cup (\{1\} \times s(y)) \cup (\{2\} \times s(z))&lt;/math&gt;

The use of the singleton set &lt;math&gt; s(x) &lt;/math&gt; which has an inserted empty set allows tuples to have the uniqueness property that if ''a'' is an ''n''-tuple and b is an ''m''-tuple and ''a'' = ''b'' then ''n'' = ''m''.  Ordered triples which are defined as ordered pairs do not have this property with respect to ordered pairs.

==Category theory==
A category-theoretic [[Product (category theory)|product]] ''A'' × ''B'' in a [[category of sets]] represents the set of ordered pairs, with the first element coming from ''A'' and the second coming from ''B''. In this context the characteristic property above is a consequence of the [[universal property]] of the product and the fact that elements of a set ''X'' can be identified with morphisms from 1 (a one element set) to ''X''. While different objects may have the universal property, they are all [[naturally isomorphic]].

== Production Process ==
The Seattle based chocolate maker Theo Chocolate was one of the first companies that were "fair-trade certified" and produced Organic Chocolate. In 2006 Theo Chocolate began their production of organic chocolate, there were no solid guidelines for the manufacturing and they had to get the process and ingredients in the correct measurements. The main ingredient in chocolate, cocoa is going to be found close to the equator and the majority of it is grown in Western Africa. The organic cocoa, the main ingredient in organic chocolate, is sent to the chocolate factor where they arrive in burlap sacks. The cocoa beans are then thoroughly cleaned and foreign objects are removed until just the beans remain. The manufacturer makes sure to use all organic ingredients to ensure that the final product is truly organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emagazine.com/sweet-dreams/|title=Sweet Dreams|date=2007-10-26|work=Emagazine.com|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orgel's First Rule==
"Whenever a [[spontaneous process]] is too slow or too inefficient a [[protein]] will evolve to speed it up or make it more efficient."

This "rule" comments on the fact that there are a great number of proteins in all organisms which fulfil a number of different functions through modifying chemical or physical processes. An example would be an [[enzyme]] that [[Catalysis|catalyses]] a [[chemical reaction]] that would take place too slowly to benefit an organism without being sped up by this enzyme.

==Orgel's Second Rule==
"[[Evolution]] is cleverer than you are."

This rule is well known among biologists. It does not imply that evolution has conscious motives or method but that people who say "evolution can't do this" or "evolution can't do that" are simply lacking an imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/11/orgels-second-rule-and-unbeatable/ |title=Orgel’s Second Rule and "unbeatable" predation tactics. |author=T.

Orgel's second rule tells us that the process of natural selection is not itself intelligent, clever or purposeful but that the products of evolution are ingenious.&lt;ref name="Le Comber pp. 189–189"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Le Comber | first=S C | title=The genetic code has a ‘shift’ key | journal=Heredity | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=103 | issue=3 | date=2009-04-22 | issn=0018-067X | doi=10.1038/hdy.2009.40 | pages=189–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, '''Pachner moves''', named after Udo Pachner, are ways of replacing a [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of a [[piecewise linear manifold]] by a different triangulation of a [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] manifold. Pachner moves are also called '''bistellar flips'''. Any two triangulations of a piecewise linear manifold are related by a finite sequence of Pachner moves.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[simplex]].   &lt;math&gt;\partial \Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a combinatorial ''n''-sphere with its triangulation as the boundary of the ''n+1''-simplex. 

Given a triangulated piecewise linear ''n''-manifold &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and a co-dimension ''0'' subcomplex &lt;math&gt;C \subset N&lt;/math&gt; together with a simplicial isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi : C \to C' \subset \partial \Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the Pachner move on ''N'' associated to ''C'' is the triangulated manifold &lt;math&gt;(N \setminus C) \cup_\phi (\partial \Delta_{n+1} \setminus C')&lt;/math&gt;. By design, this manifold is PL-isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; but the isomorphism does not preserve the triangulation.

'''Perceptual mapping''' is a [[diagram]]matic technique used by asset [[marketing|marketers]] that attempts to visually display the perceptions of customers or potential customers. Typically the [[positioning (marketing)|position]] of a company's [[product (business)|product]], [[product line]], or [[brand]] is displayed relative to their competition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mccarthy, E. J., Mcguiggan, I. R., Perreault, D. W., &amp; Quester, G. P. (2007). ''Marketing: Creating and delivering value.'' Australia, Sydney: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Perceptual maps''', also known as '''market maps''', usually have two dimensions but can be multi-dimensional; they can be used to identify gaps in the market and potential partners or merger targets as well as to clarify perceptual problems with a company's product.

== Uses ==
Perceptual mapping enables companies to better understand their customers: the who, why, where, how and what of their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F|title=The Practice of Management|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0750685042|page=x Foreword|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brassington|first1=Frances|last2=Pettitt|first2=Stephen|title=Essentials of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|isbn=9780273728139|page=243|edition=3|language=English|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobber|first1=David|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780077140007|page=290|edition=7|language=English|format=Paperback|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feintzeig|first1=Rachel|title=Business News: Holiday Stress for Businesses|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=24 December 2015|page=B2|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Holman W Jr|title=The Broadband Future And Its Enemies|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=19 November 2015|location=New York|page=A.10|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a business is perceived in a manner they find unsatisfactory, further research then identifies what can be done to change that. Perceptual mapping also allows businesses to see what consumers think of other brands, particularly their competitors. Regular uses of the maps can help track  preferences, and see changes as they happen. Perceptual mapping can help define market segments, showing clusters of businesses differentiated by key aspects (such as higher class or number of restaurants). Within the clusters found in perceptual maps of entire industries, a business can classify potential partners or possible businesses to merge with, since the clustering of brands signifies the similarity in businesses, meaning they have corresponding attributes. It can also help identify gaps in a market where a new product or service could be introduced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Perceptual maps can also be used to help keep track of how a new product, such as a recently introduced smartphone, is being viewed in a specific market. It is important to see that the way a business is marketing its product is not only successful, but successful in a manner that aligns with the business’s overarching goal for positioning.

Some companies seem to have fallen out of favor with the public, such as Quicken Loans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudegeair|first1=Peter|title=At Quicken Loans, a Will to Do Battle|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=16 June 2015|page=25|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anonymous|title=A mucky business; The Volkswagen scandal|issue=416.8957|publisher=The Economist|date=26 September 2015|pages=23–25|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual mapping can help elicit the extent of the damage.

== Limitations ==
There are many limitations to perceptual mapping. The largest is the number of variables used. Traditionally, the map uses two variables and does not account for others. This assumption can hinder the reliability of results, as in some cases, it is not safe to assume that there are only two major factors influencing the decision of purchase for a consumer. For example, a graph may use quality of food and pricing, but not take into account other relevant variables such as the number of visits and locations. Also, there is often a blurred line between what a business can offer and what a consumer thinks the business can offer. This could be due to miscommunication, lack of knowledge, impact from social media, and so on. These untruths can influence the result, creating a slight bias in the statistics. Another limitation is data gathering. The data needed to form a perceptual map is usually obtained through surveys, and can be difficult to obtain. The range of behaviours that the map covers is also a constraint, as the limitation to two variables means that its application works mainly with purchase decisions made with little thought and effort, such as purchasing a beverage at a store or going to a fast food restaurant.

== Examples ==
Perceptual maps can have any number of dimensions but the most common is two dimensions. The first perceptual map below shows consumer perceptions of various [[automobile]]s on the two dimensions of sportiness/conservative and classy/affordable. This sample of consumers felt [[Porsche]] was the sportiest and classiest of the cars in the study (top right corner). They felt [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] was most practical and conservative (bottom left corner).

[[Image:PerceptualMap1.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of competing products]]

Cars that are positioned close to each other are seen as similar on the relevant dimensions by the consumer. For example, consumers see Buick, Chrysler, and Oldsmobile as similar. They are close competitors and form a competitive grouping. A company considering the introduction of a new model will look for an area on the map free from competitors. Some perceptual maps use different-sized circles to indicate the sales volume or market share of the various competing products.

Displaying consumers’ perceptions of related products is only half the story. Many perceptual maps also display consumers’ ideal points. These points reflect ideal combinations of the two dimensions as seen by a consumer. The next diagram shows a study of consumers’ ideal points in the alcohol/spirits product space. Each dot represents one respondent's ideal combination of the two dimensions. Areas where there is a cluster of ideal points (such as A) indicate a [[market segment]]. Areas without ideal points are sometimes referred to as demand voids.

[[Image:PerceptualMap2.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of ideal points and clusters]]

A company considering introducing a new product will look for areas with a high density of ideal points. They will also look for areas without competitive rivals. This is best done by placing both the ideal points and the competing products on the same map.

Some maps plot ideal vectors instead of ideal points. The map below displays various aspirin products as seen on the dimensions of effectiveness and gentleness. It also shows two ideal vectors. The slope of the ideal vector indicates the ratio of the two dimensions preferred by those consumers within that segment. This study indicates that there is one segment that is more concerned with effectiveness than harshness, and another segment that is more interested in gentleness than strength.

[[Image:PerceptualMap3-new.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of competing products with ideal vectors]]

== Other types of mapping ==
=== Spidergrams ===
Spidergrams are an alternative to perceptual mapping that similarly are visual marketing tools; however, spidergrams also request customers to rate attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobber|first1=David|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780077140007|page=291|edition=7|language=English|format=Paperback|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multidimensional perceptual maps ===
[[File:Multi-Dimensional Perceptual Map.gif|thumb|Example of a multi-dimensional perceptual map]]
Traditional perceptual maps are built with two visual dimensions (X and Y axis). Multidimensional perceptual maps are built with more dimensions visualised as profile charts in small map regions, and then items are mapped to the regions by their similarity to the vectors that represent the region. A common technique to construct this kind of multidimensional perceptual maps is the [[self-organizing map]]. This helps pinpoint more variables, allowing for more in-depth research into what influences the consumer. This means that the perceptual map can be applied beyond low-involvement purchases, and also helps with identification of segments in a market.

=== Intuitive maps ===
Perceptual maps need not come from a detailed study. There are also intuitive maps (also called judgmental maps or consensus maps) that are created by marketers based on their understanding of their industry. These are limited by not being based on consumer data.

When detailed marketing research studies are done methodological problems can arise, but at least the information is coming directly from the consumer. An assortment of statistical procedures can be used to convert the raw data collected in a survey into a perceptual map. [[Preference regression (in marketing)|Preference regression]] will produce ideal vectors. [[Multi dimensional scaling (in marketing)|Multi dimensional scaling]] will produce either ideal points or competitor positions. [[Factor analysis]], [[discriminant analysis (in marketing)|discriminant analysis]], [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]] and [[logit analysis (in marketing)|logit analysis]] can also be used. Some techniques are constructed from perceived differences between products, others from perceived similarities, and still others from [[Cross elasticity of demand|cross price elasticity of demand]] data from electronic scanners.

==Modern techniques==

Marketers can reveal shoppers' collective perceptual map with increasing precision and detail by aggregating and analysing their data; this is done, for example, in the smartphone and laptop industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Anthony JT|last2=Sun|first2=Chih-Yuan|last3=Yang|first3=Fu-Chen|last4=Chen|first4=Chao-Hung|last5=Wang|first5=Chun-Sheng|title=Mining perceptual maps from consumer reviews|journal=Decision Support Systems|date=2016|volume=82|issue=February|pages=12–25|doi=10.1016/j.dss.2015.11.002|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|language=English|issn=0167-9236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaribaf|first1=Mehdi|last2=Shameli|first2=Nora|title=Notebook Positioning by Perceptual Map and Laddering Method|journal=New Marketing Research Journal |date=Fall 2012 |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=121–134|publisher=University of Isfahan, Iran|language=Persian|issn=2228-7744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, they can be used in non-commercial applications, such as identifying factors involved in dangerous driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanlaar |first1=Ward |last2=Simpson |first2=Herb |last3=Robertson |first3=Robyn|title=A perceptual map for understanding concern about unsafe driving behaviours |journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention |date=2008 |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=1667–1673|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2008.05.009|publisher=Elsevier B.V. |language=English |issn=0001-4575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom''''' ({{lang-de|Philosophische Untersuchungen über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenhängenden Gegenstände}}) is an 1809 work by [[Friedrich Schelling]]. It was the last book he finished in his lifetime, running to some 90 pages of a single long essay. It is commonly referred to as his "''Freiheitsschrift''" (freedom text) or "freedom essay".

Described by [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] as "the most titanic work of German idealism",&lt;ref&gt;John Laughland, ''Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics'' (2007), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also seen as anticipating much of the collection of basic [[Existentialism|existentialist]] motifs. Its ambitions were high: to tackle the problem of [[radical evil]], and to innovate at a metaphysical level, in particular to correct [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. As its title suggests, it intends to give an account of [[human freedom]], and the requirements on the philosophical side to protect this idea from particular formulations, at issue during the period, of [[determinism]].

==Influences on Schelling==

The literature on the history of philosophy contains many assertions about the general influences on Schelling. There are also more specific comments about other thinkers and traditions that had a definite effect on this transitional work. The opening pages make it clear that Schelling is engaged in arguing against [[Spinozism]], a position which (often simply called "dogmatism") had been a target for both philosophical and religious thinkers in Germany for decades. Schelling was not concerned about rejecting all that [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s thought implied, in the terms of that debate, but to salvage something from the unification of view ([[monism]]) that came with it, while allowing room for freedom.

At this time Schelling was influenced also by [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] and the writings of [[Jakob Böhme]]. In fact ''Of Human Freedom'' contains explicit references to Baader's doctrine of [[evil]], and Böhme's schematic creation myths, and uses the term [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]; a detailed mapping of Böhme's thought onto Schelling's argument in the ''Freiheitsschrift'' has been carried out by Paola Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer pp. 197-209.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand Robert Schneider and Ernst Benz have argued for the more direct influence of the pietist [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and theosophist [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Explicit concerns of Schelling in the book are: the existence of evil and the emergence into reason. Schelling offers a solution to the first, an old theological chestnut, in brief that “evil makes arbitrary choice possible”. On the other hand, by no means all interpretations of the work come from the direction of theology and the [[problem of evil]]. The second idea, requiring a rationale of [[emergence]], was more innovative, because of the place it gave to [[irrationalism]] and [[anthropomorphism]], within the "cosmic" setting (which need not be taken literally). The work stands also in relation to a decade of previous publications, formulations, and rivalries.

A view from the nineteenth century is that of [[Harald Høffding]] (who sets the book in the context of a supposed personal crisis and philosophical block):

{{cquote|... [Schelling] attempts to show that we are only justified in conceiving God as a personal being if we posit an original antithesis within the absolute, within the essence of the Deity,&amp;mdash;a dark irrational ground which becomes purified and harmonised ... in the course of the life-development of the Divine Being. [...] All evil consists in a striving to return to the chaos out of which the order of Nature has proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harald Høffding]], ''History of Modern Philosophy'' (1900 translation), vol. II p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern readings of Schelling's intentions can differ quite widely from this interpretation (and each other). This writing of Schelling is also seen as the beginning of his critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and an announcement of a transitional moment in philosophy; part of the purpose was self-justification, verging on polemic in defence of Schelling's [[panentheism]]. It is therefore a signpost marking a fork in the road for what is now called "classical German philosophy": even if it had its time of dominance, [[absolute idealism]] in Hegel's sense is (after the "freedom essay") just one branch of the discussion of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] in [[German idealism]]. Hegel became a system-builder while Schelling produced no systematic or finished philosophy in three decades after the ''Freiheitsschrift''.

===Evil as radical===

The conception of evil is set against both the [[Neoplatonic]] ''[[privatio boni]]'' and the [[Manichaean]] division into two disconnected and contending powers. Evil must be seen as active, in both God and natural creatures. There is a distinction: in God evil can never stray out of its place (at the base), while in man it certainly may exceed its role of basing self-hood.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer pp. 198-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Žižek]] writes that the central tenet is that

{{cquote|...if one is to account for the possibility of Evil, one has to presuppose a split in the Absolute into God insofar as he fully exists, and the obscure, impenetrable Ground of his Existence.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''The Abyss of Freedom'' p. 5, in ''The Abyss of Freedom/Ages of the World'' (1997) (with Judith Norman, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John W. Cooper writes

{{cquote|Either Evil is unreal or God is its cause. Schelling's solution to this perennial problem is to view God's freedom as the possibility of evil and human freedom as responsible for the actuality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper, ''Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers'' (2006), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Spinoza and pantheism===

At the time of writing the ''Freiheitschrift'', Schelling had on his mind an accusation of [[pantheism]], levelled at him by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in ''Über Sprache und Weisheit der Indier'' (1808).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Pantheism controversy]] of the 1780s continued to cast a long shadow. [[F. H. Jacobi]], who had launched it, was someone with whom Schelling was in contact in [[Munich]], where the book was written.

In his book, Schelling takes up the issue of pantheism, concerned to refute the idea that it necessarily leads to [[fatalism]], so negating human freedom. Here he is closer to Spinoza, erasing the distinction between nature and God. On the other hand, Schelling is trying to overcome the distinction made in Spinoza's system, between ''[[natura naturans]]'' (dynamic) and ''[[natura naturata]]'' (passive). Schelling wanted to locate the fatalism in Spinoza, not in the pantheism or monism, but in his formulation.&lt;ref name = Hedley&gt;Douglas Hedley, ''Coleridge, philosophy and religion: Aids to reflection and the mirror of the spirit'' (2000), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis claimed===

According to Andrew Bowie:

{{cquote|The central issue in ''FS'' is ... a non-reductionist account of the relationship of thinking to being. Spinoza's system ... is seen as 'one-sidedly realistic' (in the sense of 'materialist'), and as in need of completion by an 'ideal' aspect in which 'freedom reigns'.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schelling considered that the idealist conception of freedom, in [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], had remained undeveloped, absent a cleaner break with the rationalist systems of Spinoza and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and a distinctive theory of its human element.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Francois Courtine]], ''Schelling'', p. 86-87 in Simon Critchley, William Ralph Schroeder (editors), ''A Companion to Continental Philosophy'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In another view of the book's main theme, leading onto the further development of the philosophy of the ''[[Weltalter]]'' (Ages of the World), Schelling

{{cquote|...sought to grasp the dynamic differentiation in God and hence the temporal quality of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, ''Heidegger on Ethics and Justice'', p. 194 in Arleen B. Dallery, Stephen H. Watson, E. Marya Bower (editors), ''Transitions in Continental Philosophy'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this approach, the Absolute takes on a darker side, and shows therefore the connection to the theme of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Zöller, ''German realism: the self-limitation of idealist thinking in Fichte, Schelling and Schopenhauer'', p. 209, in [[Karl Ameriks]] (editor), ''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect then pervades all life:

{{cquote|The duality of (blind) nature and (enlightened) existence is not limited to God's original self-construction. It is said to permeate all of creation, which thus repeats on a finite scale the divine process of self-realization from will to reason. In finite individuals the dark, blind will manifests itself as particular will as stands in opposition to the enlightened or universal will.&lt;ref&gt;Zöller in ''Cambridge Companion'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Summary==

This is an approximate summary of the content of the ''Freiheitsschrift'' using page numbering as appears in Schelling's ''Works''.&lt;ref&gt;These numbers are shown in the Gutmann translation in the margin, and a German text in the original numbering is available as a [http://www.dalank.de/archiv/freiheit.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no division except into paragraphs.

*336-8 There is a traditional view that system excludes individual freedom; but on the contrary it does have "a place in the universe". This is a problem to solve.
*338-343 Reformulation as the issue of pantheism and fatalism.
*343-8 Spinoza and Leibniz.
*348 German idealism versus French atheistic mechanism; Fichte's ''Wissenschaftslehre''.
*349-352 It is a mistake to believe that idealism has simply displaced pantheism.
*352-355 The real conception of freedom is the possibility of good and evil.
*356-357 Critique of the abstract conception of God; ''Naturphilosophie''.
*357-358 Ground of God and light.
*359-366 Critique of immanence.
*366-373 Conception of evil according to Baader.

==A debated transition==

Schelling placed the ''Freiheitsschrift'' at the end of the first volume of his ''Sämmtliche Werke'' (Collected Works). The correct periodisation of his philosophy is still a contentious area, and there are differing views of what kind of punctuation mark it really represents in Schelling's work. It is admittedly important that the book itself begins with an outright rejection of “system”.&lt;ref&gt;David Walsh, ''The Modern Philosophical Revolution: The Luminosity of Existence'' (2008), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of this book is said, on the one hand, to mark the beginning of Schelling's “middle period”.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schelling/#3&lt;/ref&gt; As such it marks the break with the “identity philosophy” on which he worked in the first decade of the nineteenth century, after his beginnings as a follower of [[Johann Fichte]] and developer of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.

The divergence of Schelling and Hegel becomes clear from around this year, with Hegel's ambitions being systematic and explicitly encyclopedic, notions of freedom being quite different, and the use of dialectic becoming obviously distinct on the two sides. Hegel's star was in the ascendent, while Schelling's other road led into the wilderness, at least as far as academic respectability was concerned. Academic recognition for Schelling's work as important to philosophy, as opposed to an idiosyncratic contribution to [[philosophy of religion]], was indeed slow to come. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], one of Schelling's contemporaries and followers, rated it highly.&lt;ref name = Hedley/&gt;

In 1936, [[Martin Heidegger]] gave a series of lectures on Schelling's freedom essay. These were published in German in 1971 and translated into English in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;M. Heidegger, ''Schellings Abhandlung über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit'', Tubingen, Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1971 

Translation by Joan Stambaugh as ''Schelling's Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom'', Athens, Ohio University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger largely treated the ''Freiheitschrift'' as continuous with the "identity philosophy" period leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;Kyriaki Goudeli, ''Challenges to German Idealism: Schelling, Fichte and Kant'' (2002), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger by 1941 had hardened his line to the position that Schelling is still a theorist of an enclosing [[subjectivity]], while treating the ''Freiheitsschrift'' as the apex (''Gipfel'') of the metaphysics of German idealism. This view is still contested: other authors read the book as the start of something new in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Schelling's ''Stuttgart Vorlesungen'' of 1810 reformulate and build on the freedom essay, and the ''Weltalter'' manuscripts go further in trying to work out details of the Behmenist insights.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is therefore really whether the ''Freiheitschrift'' is culminating, seminal, or possibly both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">The '''proper generalized decomposition''' ('''PGD''') is a [[numerical method]] for solving [[boundary value problem]]s. It assumes that the solution of a multidimensional (or multiparametric) problem can be expressed in a separated representation of the form

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \approx \mathbf{u}^N(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{X_1}_i(x_1) \cdot \mathbf{X_2}_i(x_2) \cdots \mathbf{X_d}_i(x_d), &lt;/math&gt;

where the number of terms ''N'', and the functions ''X'' are a priori unknown.

Since solving decoupled problems is computationally much less expensive than solving multidimensional problems, PGD is usually considered a [[dimensionality reduction algorithm]].

# the right to use the good
# the right to earn income from the good
# the right to transfer the good to others
# the right to enforce property rights

In economics, property is usually considered to be ownership ([[Property income|rights to the proceeds generated by the property]]) and control over a resource or good. Many economists effectively argue that property rights need to be fixed and need to portray the relationships among other parties in order to be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecpo.12021/full|title=Private Property Rights, Investment Patterns, and Asset Structure|first=Zhiyong|last=An|date=1 November 2013|publisher=|journal=Econ Polit|volume=25|issue=3|pages=481–495|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/ecpo.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regimes ==
Property rights to a good must be defined, their use must be monitored, and possession of rights must be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Southern Africa: An Introduction|journal=AuthorHouse|date= 2013|first=K. et al.|last=Mulale}}&lt;/ref&gt;The costs of defining, monitoring, and enforcing property rights are termed [[transaction costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Measurement Costs and the Organization of Markets|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date= April 1982|first=Yoram|last=Barzel|volume=25|issue=1|pages=27–48|id= |doi=10.1086/467005|issn=0022-2186|jstor=725223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas Allen, |title=What are Transaction Costs? (Research in Law and Economics) |publisher=Jai Pr |location= |year=1991 |isbn=0-7623-1115-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of transaction costs, various forms of property rights institutions will develop. Each institutional form can be described by the distribution of rights.

The following list is ordered from no property rights defined to all property rights being held by individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daniel W. Bromley, |title=Environment and Economy: Property Rights and Public Policy |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year= 1991|isbn=1-55786-087-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-access property (''[[res nullius]]'') is not 'owned' by anyone. It is non-excludable (no one can exclude anyone else from using it) but may be [[rivalry (economics)|rival]] (one person's use of it reduces the quantity available to other users). Open-access property is not managed by anyone, and access to it is not controlled. There is no constraint on anyone using open-access property (excluding people is either impossible or prohibitively costly). Examples of open-access property are the upper atmosphere (navigable airspace) or ocean fisheries (navigable waterways).

{{quote|text=Open-access property may exist because ownership has never been established, granted, by laws within a particular country, or because no effective controls are in place, or feasible, i.e., the cost of exclusion outweighs the benefits. The government can sometimes effectively convert open access property into private, common or public property through the land grant process, by legislating to define public/private rights previously not granted.|sign=Kevin Guerin|source=&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;Guerin, K. (2003). ''Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective''. Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Public property]] (also known as [[state property]]) is property that is owned by all, but its access and use are controlled by the state or community. An example is a national park or a state-owned enterprise.&lt;ref name="NZ"/&gt;
* [[Common property]] or collective property is property that is owned by a group of individuals. Access, use, and exclusion are controlled by the joint owners. True commons can break down, but, unlike open-access property, common property owners have greater ability to manage conflicts through shared benefits and enforcement.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;
* [[Private property]] is both excludable and rival. Private property access, use, exclusion and management are controlled by the private owner or a group of legal owners.

== The environment ==
Implicit or explicit property rights can be created by regulating the environment, either through prescriptive [[Command and control (government)|command and control]] approaches (e.g. limits on input/output/discharge quantities, specified processes/equipment, audits) or by [[market-based instruments]] (e.g. taxes, transferable permits or quotas),&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt; and more recently through cooperative, self-regulatory, post-regulatory and reflexive law approaches.&lt;ref&gt;See literature on post-regulatory approaches and reflexive law, especially literature from Gunther Teubner. See also the example of the 'conservation property right'&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Conservation Property Right]]

It has been proposed by [[Ronald Coase]] that clearly defining and assigning property rights would resolve environmental problems by internalizing externalities and relying on incentives of private owners to conserve resources for the future.  At common law nuisance and tort law allows adjacent property holders to seek compensation when individual actions diminish the air and water quality for adjacent landowners.
Critics of this view argue that this assumes that it is possible to internalize all environmental benefits, that owners will have perfect information, that scale economies are manageable, transaction costs are bearable, and that legal frameworks operate efficiently.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;

== Literature ==
In 2013 researchers&lt;ref&gt;Mike Denison and Robyn Klingler-Vidra, October 2012, Annotated Bibliography for Rapid Review on Property Rights, Economics and Private Sector Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services (EPS PEAKS)https://partnerplatform.org/?tcafmd80&lt;/ref&gt; produced an annotated bibliography on the property rights literature concerned with two principal outcomes: (a) reduction in investors risk and increase in incentives to invest, and (b) improvements in household welfare; the researchers explored the channels through which property rights affect growth and household welfare in developing countries. They found that better protection of property rights can affect several development outcomes, including better management of natural resources.

Despite the overwhelming evidence on the economic relevance of property rights however, only recently economists have begun to study their determinants by looking at the trade-off between the dispersed coercive power in a state of anarchy and the predation by a central authority. To illustrate, incomplete property rights allow agents with valuation lower than that of the original owners of economic value to inefficiently expropriate them distorting in this way their investment and effort exertion decisions. When instead, the state is entrusted the power to protect property, it might directly expropriate private parties if not sufficiently constrained by an efficient political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Development Economics|last=Besley, Timothy|first=and Maitreesh Ghatak|publisher=Elsevier|year=2010|isbn=|location=Amsterdam|pages=4525–4595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The necessity of strong protection of property for efficiency has been however criticized by a vast legal scholarship, originated from the seminal contribution by [[Guido Calabresi]] and [[Douglas Melamed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calabresi, Guido|first=and Melamed, A. Douglas|date=1972|title=Property Rules, Liability Rules and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=85 |pages=1089–1128|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that in the face of transaction costs sufficiently sizeable to prevent consensual trade, legalized private expropriation in the form of, for instance, liability rules can be welfare-increasing. [[Carmine Guerriero]] blends these two different strands of literature by linking property rights protection, transaction costs, and preference heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerriero|first=Carmine|date=2016|title=Endogenous Property Rights|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/686985|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=59 |issue=2|doi=10.1086/686985|pmid=|access-date=|pages=313–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; To elaborate, when property is fully protected, some agents with valuation higher than that of the original owners will be unable to legally acquire value because of sizable transaction costs. When the protection of property is weak instead, low-valuation potential buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. Hence, a rise in the heterogeneity of the potential buyers' valuations makes inefficient expropriation by low-valuation potential buyers be more important from a social welfare point of view than inefficient exclusion from trade and so induces stronger property rights.  Crucially, this prediction survives even after considering production and investment activities and it is consistent with a novel dataset on the rules on the acquisition of ownership through adverse possession and on the use of government takings to transfer real property from a private party to another private party prevailing in 126 jurisdictions. These data measure “horizontal property rights” and thus the extent of protection of property from “direct and indirect private takings,” which are ubiquitous forms of expropriation that occur daily within the rule of law and are thus different from predation by the state and the elites, which is much less common but has been the focus of the economics literature. To capture preference diversity, the author uses the contemporary genetic diversity, which is a primitive metric of the genealogical distance between populations with a common ancestor and so of the differences in characteristics transmitted across generations, such as preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Geography of Human Genes|last=Cavalli-Sforza, Luca L.|first=Paolo Menozzi, and Alberto Piazza|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regression analysis reveals that the protection of the original owners' property rights is the strongest where contemporary genetic diversity is the largest. Evidence from several different identification strategies suggests that this relationship is indeed causal.

== Property rights approach to the theory of the firm ==
The property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] paradigm was developed by [[Sanford J. Grossman|Sanford Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261404|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1986|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 691–719|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261729|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1990|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 1119–1158|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1086/261729|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that in the real world, contracts are incomplete and hence it is impossible to contractually specify what decisions will have to be taken in any conceivable state of the world. There will be renegotiations in the future, so parties have insufficient investment incentives (since they will only get a fraction of the investment's return in future negotiations); i.e., there is a [[hold-up problem]]. Hence, property rights matter, because they determine who has control over future decisions if no agreement will be reached. In other words, property rights determine the parties' future bargaining positions (while their bargaining powers, i.e. their fractions of the renegotiation surplus, are independent of the property rights allocation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bargaining position, bargaining power, and the property rights approach|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517651300030X|journal = Economics Letters|date = 2013|pages = 28–31|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.econlet.2013.01.011|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach to the theory of the firm can thus explain pros and cons of integration in the context of private firms.

== The role of property rights in economic and political development ==
Classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[Karl Marx]] generally recognize the importance of property rights in the process of economic development, and modern mainstream economics agree with such a recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Besley|first= Timothy|last2= Maitreesh|first2= Ghatak|date= 2009|editor-last= Rodrik|editor-first= Dani|editor2-last= Rosenzweig|editor2-first= Mark R|title= Property Rights and Economic Development|url= |journal= Handbook of Development Economics|publisher= New York: Elsevier|volume= V|pages= 4526–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely-accepted explanation is that well-enforced property rights provide incentives for individuals to participate in economic activities, such as investment, innovation and trade, which lead to a more efficient market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James|date= 2005|title= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth|url= |journal= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= 1|pages= 397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of property rights in Europe during the Middle Ages provides an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James A.|date= 2005|title= Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|journal= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= Volume 1|pages= 385–472|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 978-0-444-52041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this epoch, full political power came into the hands of hereditary monarchies, which often abused their power to exploit producers, to impose arbitrary taxes, or to refuse to pay their debts. The lack of protection for property rights provided little incentive for landowners and merchants to invest in land, physical or human capital, or technology. After the [[First English Civil War| English Civil War]] of 1642-1646 and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, shifts of political power away from the Stuart monarchs led to the strengthening of property rights of both land and capital owners. Consequently, rapid economic development took place, setting the stage for [[Industrial Revolution]].

Property rights are also believed to lower transaction costs by providing an efficient resolution for conflicts over scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Alchian|first= Armen|last2= Demsetz|first2= Harold|date= 1973|title= The Property Right Paradigm|url= |journal= The Journal of Economic History|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 16–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirically, using historical data of former European colonies, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson find substantial evidence that good economic institutions – those that provide secure property rights and equality of opportunity – lead to economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Acemoglu|first= Daron|last2= Johnson|first2= Simon|last3= Robinson|first3= James|date= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ4JBwLsz8cC|title= Handbook of Economic Growth|volume= 1|pages= 385–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property rights might be closely related to the evolution of political order, due to their protections of an individual's claims on economic rents.{{cn|date=August 2018}} North, Wallis and Weingast argue that [[origin of property rights | property rights originate]] to facilitate elites' rent-seeking activities. Particularly, the legal and political systems that protect elites' claims on rent revenues form the basis of the so-called "limited access order", in which non-elites are denied access to political power and economic privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= North|first= Douglass C|last2= Wallis|first2= John J|last3= Weingast|first3= Barry R|date= 2006|title= A conceptual framework for interpreting recorded human history|url= |journal= National Bureau of Economic Research|volume= 12795|pages= 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historical study of medieval England, for instance, North and Thomas find that the dramatic development of English land laws in the 13th century resulted from elites' interests in exploiting rent revenues from land ownership after a sudden rise in land price in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= North|first= Douglass C|last2= Thomas|first2= Robert P|date= 1971|title= The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Theoretical Model|url= |journal= The Journal of Economic History|volume= 31|issue= 4|pages= 777–803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the modern "open access order", which consists of a democratic political system and a free- market economy, usually features widespread, secure and impersonal property rights. Universal property rights, along with impersonal economic and political competition, downplay the role of rent-seeking and instead favor innovations and productive activities in a modern economy.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|Psychology|date=April 2009}}
[[Torture]] is the use of physical or psychological pain to control the victim or fulfill some needs of the perpetrator. The psychology of torture refers to the psychological processes underlying all aspects of torture including the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the immediate and long-term effects, and the political and social institutions that influence its use.

==The perpetrator of torture==
Research during the past 60 years, starting with the [[Milgram experiment]], suggests that under the right circumstances, and with the appropriate encouragement and setting, most people can be encouraged to actively torture others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7791278.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Health &amp;#124; People 'still willing to torture' |format= |work= BBC News| date=2008-12-19 | accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Conroy:'''&lt;blockquote&gt;"When torture takes place, people believe they are on the high moral ground, that the nation is under threat and they are the front line protecting the nation, and people will be grateful for what they are doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15861-2004May10.html| title=The Psychology of Torture | work=The Washington Post| author=Shankar Vedantam| date= May 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stages of the perpetrator's torture mentality include:&lt;br /&gt;
(Please note that not all perpetrators go through all of the stages listed)&lt;br /&gt;

* Reluctance:  The perpetrator is reluctant to participate or observe the administration of torture.
* Official encouragement: As the [[Stanford prison experiment]] and [[Milgram experiment]] show, in an official setting, many people will follow the direction of an authority figure (such as a superior officer) particularly if it is presented as mandatory, even if they have personal uncertainty. The main motivations for this appear to be a fear of loss of status or respect, and the desire to be seen as a "good citizen" or "good subordinate".
* Peer encouragement: The perpetrator begins to accept torture as necessary, acceptable or deserved, or to comply due to the need to conform to peer group beliefs.
* [[Dehumanization]]: The perpetrator sees victims as objects of curiosity and experimentation rather than as human beings.  The physical and psychological manipulations become just another opportunity to test the victim's response.
* [[Disinhibition]]: Sociocultural and [[situational]] pressures may cause perpetrators to undergo a lessening of moral inhibitions and as a result act in ways not normally accepted by law, custom and conscience.
* Self-perpetuating:  Within the organization, once torture becomes established as part of internally acceptable norms under certain circumstances, its use often becomes institutionalized and self-perpetuating over time.  What was once rarely used during extreme circumstances begins to be used more regularly with more reasons claimed to justify wider use.

Example:&lt;br /&gt;
  
One of the apparent ringleaders of the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prison torture]], [[Charles Graner]] Jr., exemplified the stages of dehumanization and disinhibition when he was reported to have said, "The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the corrections officer in me says, 'I love to make a grown man piss himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/121/12.0.html|title=The Religious Side of the Abu Ghraib Scandal|work=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As P. Saliya Sumanatilake concludes:&lt;br /&gt;

"Whether it be for securing a justifiable or reprehensible end, torture cannot be effectuated without invoking and focusing one's diffused innate cruelty. Accordingly, it is the prevalence of this congenital trait of heinousness that renders every human being a potential torturer: hence, the existence of torture! Moreover, it is the natural occurrence of such nascent evil within each successive generation of human beings that serves to propagate torture!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Why Do They Torture? A Study On Man's Cruelty|last = Sumanatilake|first = P. Saliya|publisher = Stamford Lake (Pvt.) Ltd.|year = 2015|isbn = 978-955-658-406-6|location = Colombo, Sri Lanka|pages = 331–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects of torture==

The effects of torture on the victim and the perpetrator are likely to be influenced by many factors.  Therefore, it is unlikely that providing diagnostic categories of symptoms and behavior will be applicable across countries with very different personal, political or religious beliefs and perspectives. There is always a question about applying diagnostic categories and descriptions of symptoms or behavior developed in Western societies to people from the developing countries with very different personal, political, or religious beliefs and perspectives. One of the most marked cultural differences may occur between [[individualism|individualist]] societies where realization of personal goals often takes priority over the needs of kin and societal expectations, and [[collectivism|collectivist]] societies in which the needs of family and prescribed roles take precedence over personal preferences. Another evident difference is the belief in a subsequent life in which suffering in this life is rewarded, and this has emerged in some studies of torture survivors in South East Asia.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Victims ===
Torture has profound and long-lasting physical and psychological effects. Torture is a form of collective suffering that is not limited to the victim. The victims' family members and friends are often also affected due to adjustment problems such as outbreaks of anger and violence directed towards family members.  According to research, psychological and physical torture have similar mental effects. Often torture victims suffer from elevated rates of the following:
*[[anxiety]]
*[[Depression (mood)|depression]]
*[[adjustment disorder]]
*[[Post-traumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]
*disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS)
*[[somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorders]]
*[[nightmare]]s
*intrusion
*[[insomnia]]
*[[libido|decreased libido]]
*memory lapses
*reduced capacity to learn
*sexual dysfunction
*social withdrawal
*emotional flatness
*[[headache]]s

No diagnostic terminology encapsulates the deep distrust of others which many torture survivors have developed, nor the destruction of all that gave their lives meaning. Guilt and shame about humiliation during torture, and about the survivor's inability to withstand it, as well as guilt at surviving, are common problems which discourage disclosure.  Additional stress may be added due to uncertainty about the future, any possibility of being sent back to the country in which the survivor was tortured, and the potential lack of close confidants or social support systems.  In addition, the presence of social isolation, poverty, unemployment, institutional accommodation, and pain can all predict higher levels of emotional distress in victims who survive torture.&lt;ref name="bjp.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2049463713483596|title=The psychological impact of torture|first1=Amanda C|last1=de C Williams|first2=Jannie|last2=van der Merwe|date=1 May 2013|publisher=|journal=British Journal of Pain|volume=7|issue=2|pages=101–106|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/2049463713483596|pmc=4590125|pmid=26516507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims with PTSD ===
The development of the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for American veterans of the Vietnam War can be understood as a political act which labeled the collective distress of a defeated USA as individual psychopathology. Proponents of this view, point to the de-politicization of the distress of torture survivors by describing their distress, disturbance, and profound sense of injustice in psychiatric terms. These are not only conceptual issues, because they may influence treatment outcomes.  Recovery is associated with reconstruction of social and cultural networks, economic supports, and respect for human rights.

The rich research on treatment of PTSDs in veterans has substantially informed treatment offered to torture survivors. It is more appropriate than extrapolation from work with civilian survivors of single events as individuals (assault, accidents) or as communities or groups (natural or man-made disasters). Some literature distinguishes between single-event trauma (type 1) and prolonged and repeated trauma, such as torture (type 2). There is no doubt that (disregarding concerns about the diagnosis) rates of PTSD are much higher in refugees than among people of a similar age in the countries where the refugees settle, and that, among refugees, rates of PTSD are even higher among those seeking asylum.

The argument that torture causes unique problems waxes and wanes, and is often associated with claims to particular expertise in treatment, and therefore claims on funding.   Gurr et al. describe how torture targets the person as a whole – physically, emotionally, and socially – so that PTSD is an inadequate description of the magnitude and complexity of the effects of torture. When the diagnosis of PTSD is applied, some survivors of torture who have very severe symptoms related to trauma may still not reach the criteria for diagnosis. Categories such as 'complex trauma' have been proposed, and it may be that the next iterations of the diagnostic compendia may modify the criteria

=== Perpetrator ===
Many people who engage in torture have various psychological deviations and often they derive sadistic satisfaction.  Torture may fulfill the emotional needs of perpetrators when they willingly engage in these activities. They lack empathy and their victims' agonized painful reactions, screaming and pleading give them a sense of authority and feelings of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/02/psychological-effects-of-torture.html | title=Psychological effects of torture | publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian | date=2010 | accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture can harm not only the victim but the perpetrators as well. After the fact, perpetrators will often experience failing mental health, PTSD, suicidal tendencies, substance dependency and a myriad of other mental defects associated with inducing physical or mental trauma upon their victims.

The perpetrators may experience flashbacks of torture, intense rage, suicidal and homicidal ideas, alienation, impulse deregulation, alterations in attention and consciousness, alterations in self-perception, alterations in relationships with others, inability to trust and inability to maintain long-term relationships, or even mere intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groundviews.org/2010/04/15/psychological-effects-of-torture/|title=Psychological effects of Torture|date=15 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture victims in healthcare settings===

For physicians, it is useful to recognize that symptoms of post-traumatic stress can complicate presentation and treatment. Pain predicts greater severity of both PTSD symptoms and major depression, and intrusive memories and flashbacks can exacerbate existing pain.&lt;ref name = Williams&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://bjp.sagepub.com/content/7/2/101.full.pdf+html | title=The psychological impact of torture | author=Amanda C de C Williams and Jannie van der Merwe | journal=British Journal of Pain | year=2013 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=101–106 | doi=10.1177/2049463713483596| pmc=4590125 | pmid=26516507}}&lt;/ref&gt; While under-recognition and under-treatment of torture victims is common, there are useful guidelines for evidence-based medical practice, although not specifically concerned with pain, and for evidence-based psychological practice.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Some people die during torture; many survivors are too disabled and destitute to find their way to safety. A large element of chance, and, to a lesser extent, resources and resilience, enable a minority to arrive in developed countries. Nevertheless, they often present multiple and complex problems, which the clinician can find overwhelming. For all these reasons, an interdisciplinary approach to assessment and treatment is therefore recommended, guarding against either disregarding significant psychological distress as inevitable in torture survivors or discounting physical symptoms by attributing them to psychological origin.

Rehabilitation and reparation are part of the rights of the torture survivor under the United Nations Convention, yet far less attention is paid to health needs on a national or international basis than to legal and civil claims. Collaborative efforts involving survivors themselves are needed to better understand the usefulness and limitations of existing assessment instruments and treatment methods. Some studies exist, such as that by Elsass et al. who interviewed Tibetan Lamas on the quantification of suffering in scales used to evaluate intervention with Tibetan torture survivors.
Education of medical and other healthcare personnel needs to address issues concerning treatment of torture survivors, who will be seen in all possible settings but not necessarily recognized or treated adequately. Teaching on ethics is also important, since medical students can have tolerant views of torture, and the complicity of medical and healthcare staff in torture continues in many countries. Medical staff are often in a key position to try to prevent torture and to help those who have survived.&lt;ref name="bjp.sagepub.com"/&gt;

== The psychologist's role in torture ==
In addition to providing treatment for victims of torture, psychologists have the skills and knowledge to conduct research regarding interrogation methods and determine when the methods used become torture.  The standards, policies, and procedures of each country's professional psychological association may influence the participation of psychologists in administering torture, researching torture methods, and evaluating the effectiveness of the results.  Kenneth Pope (2011) used direct quotes to indicate the American Psychological Association believes psychologists have a key role in eliciting information from people since interrogations require an understanding of psychological processes.  Each professional association sets the standards for ethics and expected professional behavior which may influence psychologist researchers who investigate interrogation or torture and clinical psychologists' participation in interrogations that use methods deemed to be consistent with torture.

For an example of policy that influences the use of torture by American psychologists, please see the [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx American Psychological Association Council of Representatives policy released in 2015].  For an example of an external review of whether psychologists adhered to the APA ethics and policy please see the [http://www.apa.org/about/policy/national-security.aspx Hoffman Report (2015)].

Due to differences in political power globally, professional psychological organizations in well-developed countries may have a greater influence on discovering and defining what constitutes torture.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moghaddam|first1=F|title=Interrogation policy and American psychology in the global context.|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=437–443|doi=10.1080/10781910701665782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological associations in less developed countries may choose to adopt the definitions, standards, and ethical positions regarding torture developed by the APA when they are unable to support research regarding torture themselves within their own culture.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"/&gt; The professional associations in well developed countries, such as the APA are likely to have a strong influence in defining the psychology of torture globally.&lt;ref name="Moghaddam"/&gt;

==The influence of social systems on torture==
People within an organization may be influenced to participate in torturing people.&lt;ref name="Annas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=G. J.|last2=Crosby|first2=S. S.|title=Post-9/11 torture at CIA "Black Sites" - Physicians and lawyers working together.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=2015|volume=372|issue=24|pages=2279–2281|doi=10.1056/nejmp1503428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culture and procedures of an organization provide the foundation to allow professionals, such as physicians, to violate the medical code of ethics in a manner that appears to align and meet the necessary standards of their employment.  Annas and Crosby (2015) reported that lawyers provided advanced confirmation that physicians who participated in the enhanced interrogation techniques used at CIA sites would be given immunity for their actions since they were deemed a necessary requirement to protect the country (see also; [[Milgram experiment]] ) .  

The physicians assisted by providing medical evaluations to ensure victims were healthy enough to undergo torture, developed methods of torture, ensured victims would survive the torture, and assisted victims to heal following torture procedures.  Working in a secret facility with policies and procedures that promoted an expectation that torture and enhanced interrogation practices were required to protect the nation and would not result in negative personal consequences resulted in a setting in which physicians were willing to ignore the [[Hippocratic oath]].&lt;ref name="Annas" /&gt;

The policies and procedures within the United States military have also been found to produce an environment in which torture and enhanced interrogation techniques were used.&lt;ref name="Arrigo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrigo|first1=J. M.|last2=Bennett|first2=R.|title=Organizational supports for abusive interrogations in the "War on Terror."|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=411–421|doi=10.1080/10781910701665592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the military has an excellent process for recruiting and training interrogators who use non abusive techniques successfully, changes in funding resulted in fewer highly trained interrogators being available.  As more interrogators were recruited after [[9/11]], they were not as rigorously assessed, trained, or mentored and did not demonstrate the same abilities as the previous generation of military interrogators.  In addition, the military rank of interrogators is not sufficient to control the decisions made when interrogation is needed.  Military interrogators may be ordered to perform techniques they know to be inappropriate and ineffective by higher ranking officers who have not been adequately educated about effective interrogation procedures.  The combination of a change in recruitment, reduced education and mentorship, and relatively low rank result in opportunities for torture and abuse to be used during interrogations.&lt;ref name="Arrigo" /&gt;

==How public beliefs influence the use of torture==
Fictional stories, movies, and television shows may influence the beliefs people have regarding the efficacy of torture as a means for rapidly obtaining life-saving information.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ames|first1=D. R.|last2=Lee|first2=A. J.|title=Tortured beliefs:  how and when prior support for torture skews the perceived value of coerced information.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=86–92.|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2015.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Mara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Mara|first1=S|title=On the imposition of torture, an extreme stressor state, to extract information from memory:  a baleful consequence of folk cognitive neurobiology.|journal=Journal of Psychology|date=2011|volume=219|issue=3|pages=159–166|doi=10.1027/2151-2604/a000063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who believe torture is an effective interrogation method are more supportive of using torture and enhanced interrogation techniques than those who do not think it provides accurate information.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt;  In addition, the information obtained through torture is also perceived as more valuable by people who support using torture than the same information obtained through non-abusive means of interrogation.  These findings suggest confirmation bias (perception is skewed toward what a person already believes) influences the support for torture and is influenced by many commercially available sources of fictional examples.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jannoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=R|title=Erroneous assumptions:  Popular belief in the effectiveness of torture interrogation.|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=4|pages=429–435|doi=10.1080/10781910701665766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21617">In [[differential geometry]], the '''Ricci curvature tensor''', named after [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]], represents the amount by which the [[volume element|volume]] of a narrow conical piece of a small   [[geodesic]] [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] in a curved [[Riemannian manifold]] deviates from that of the standard ball in [[Euclidean space]].  As such, it provides one way of measuring the degree to which the geometry determined by a given [[Riemannian metric]] might differ from that of ordinary Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space. The Ricci tensor is defined on any [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], as a [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].  Like the metric itself, the Ricci tensor is a [[symmetric bilinear form]] on the [[tangent space]] of the manifold {{harv|Besse|1987|p=43}}.&lt;ref&gt;It is assumed that the manifold carries its unique [[Levi-Civita connection]]. For a general [[affine connection]], the Ricci tensor need not be symmetric.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[relativity theory]], the Ricci tensor is the part of the [[curvature of spacetime]] that determines the degree to which matter will tend to converge or diverge in time (via the [[Raychaudhuri equation]]).  It is related to the matter content of the universe by means of the [[Einstein field equation]].  In differential geometry, lower bounds on the Ricci tensor on a Riemannian manifold allow one to extract global geometric and topological information by comparison (cf. [[comparison theorem]]) with the geometry of a constant curvature [[space form]].  If the Ricci tensor satisfies the vacuum Einstein equation, then the manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]], which have been extensively studied (cf. {{harvnb|Besse|1987}}).  In this connection, the [[Ricci flow]] equation governs the evolution of a given metric to an Einstein metric; the precise manner in which this occurs ultimately leads to the [[solution of the Poincaré conjecture]].

==Definition==
Suppose that {{math|(''M'', ''g'')}} is an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]], equipped with its [[Levi-Civita connection]] {{math|∇}}.  The [[Riemannian curvature tensor]] of {{mvar|M}} is the {{nowrap|(1, 3)}}-tensor defined by
:&lt;math&gt;R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X\nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y\nabla_XZ - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z&lt;/math&gt;
on [[vector field]]s {{math|''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''}}.  Let {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M}} denote the [[tangent space]] of {{mvar|M}} at a point {{mvar|p}}. For any pair of tangent vectors {{mvar|ξ}} and {{mvar|η}} in {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M}}, the Ricci tensor {{math|Ric}} evaluated at {{math|(''ξ'', ''η'')}} is defined to be the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the linear map {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M'' → ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M''}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta \mapsto R(\zeta,\eta) \xi.&lt;/math&gt;
In [[local coordinates]] (using the [[Einstein summation convention]]), one has
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric} = R_{ij}\,dx^i \otimes dx^j&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = {R^k}_{ikj}.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] and the [[Christoffel symbols]], one has
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha\beta} = {R^\rho}_{\alpha\rho\beta} =
\partial_{\rho}{\Gamma^\rho}_{\beta\alpha} - \partial_{\beta}{\Gamma^\rho}_{\rho\alpha}
+ {\Gamma^\rho}_{\rho\lambda} {\Gamma^\lambda}_{\beta\alpha}
- {\Gamma^\rho}_{\beta\lambda}{\Gamma^\lambda}_{\rho\alpha}
= 2 {\Gamma^\rho}_{\alpha[\beta,\rho]} +
2 {\Gamma^\rho}_{\lambda [\rho} {\Gamma^\lambda}_{\beta]\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, it is possible for there to be a disagreement on the [[Sign_convention#Curvature|sign convention]], since 

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\alpha\beta} =-{R^\rho}_{\alpha\beta\rho}   &lt;/math&gt;,

==Properties==

As a consequence of the [[Bianchi identities]],  the Ricci tensor of a Riemannian manifold is [[symmetric tensor|symmetric]], in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric}(\xi ,\eta) = \operatorname{Ric}(\eta ,\xi).&lt;/math&gt;
It thus follows that the Ricci tensor is completely determined by knowing the quantity {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} for all vectors {{mvar|ξ}} of unit length. This function on the set of unit tangent vectors is often simply called the '''Ricci curvature''', since knowing it is equivalent to knowing the Ricci curvature tensor.

The Ricci curvature is determined by the [[sectional curvature]]s of a Riemannian manifold, but generally contains less information. Indeed, if {{mvar|ξ}} is a vector of unit length on a Riemannian {{mvar|n}}-manifold, then {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is precisely {{math|(''n'' − 1)}} times the average  value of the sectional curvature, taken over all the 2-planes containing {{mvar|ξ}}.  There is an {{math|(''n'' − 2)}}-dimensional family of such 2-planes, and so only in dimensions 2 and 3 does the Ricci tensor determine the full curvature tensor. A notable exception is when the manifold is given a priori as a [[hypersurface]] of [[Euclidean space]]. The [[second fundamental form]], which determines the full curvature via the [[Gauss–Codazzi equations|Gauss–Codazzi equation]], is itself determined by the Ricci tensor and the [[Principal curvature|principal directions]] of the hypersurface are also the [[eigendirection]]s of the Ricci tensor. The tensor was introduced by Ricci for this reason.

If the Ricci curvature function {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is constant on the set of unit tangent vectors {{mvar|ξ}}, the Riemannian manifold is said to have constant Ricci curvature, or to be an [[Einstein manifold]].  This happens if and only if the Ricci tensor Ric is a constant multiple of the metric tensor {{mvar|g}}.

The Ricci curvature is usefully thought of as a multiple of the [[Laplacian]] of the metric tensor {{harv|Chow|Knopf|2004|loc=Lemma 3.32}}.  Specifically, in [[harmonic coordinates|harmonic]] local coordinates the components satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = -\tfrac12\Delta \left(g_{ij}\right) + \text{lower-order terms} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\nabla\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]], here regarded  as acting on the functions {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This fact motivates, for instance, the introduction of the [[Ricci flow]] equation as a natural extension of the [[heat equation]] for the metric. Alternatively, in a [[normal coordinates|normal coordinate system]] based at {{mvar|p}}, at the point {{mvar|p}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = -\tfrac23\Delta \left(g_{ij}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Direct geometric meaning==

Near any point {{mvar|p}} in a Riemannian manifold {{math|(''M'',''g'')}}, one can define preferred local coordinates, called [[geodesic normal coordinates]]. These are adapted to the metric so that geodesics through {{mvar|p}} correspond to straight lines through the origin, in  such a manner that the geodesic distance from {{mvar|p}} corresponds to the  Euclidean distance from the origin.  In these coordinates, the metric tensor is well-approximated by the Euclidean metric, in the precise sense that
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + O \left(|x|^2\right) .&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, by taking the [[Taylor expansion]] of the metric applied to a [[Jacobi field]] along a radial geodesic in the normal coordinate system, one has
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - \tfrac13 R_{ikjl}x^kx^l + O\left(|x|^3\right) .&lt;/math&gt;
In these coordinates, the metric [[volume element]] then has the following expansion at {{mvar|p}}:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mu_g = \left[ 1 - \tfrac16 R_{jk}x^jx^k+ O\left(|x|^3\right) \right] d\mu_{\rm Euclidean} ,&lt;/math&gt;

which follows by expanding the square root of the [[determinant]] of the metric.

Thus, if the Ricci curvature {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is positive in the direction of a  vector {{mvar|ξ}}, the conical region in {{mvar|M}} swept out by a tightly focused family of  geodesic segments of length &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; emanating from {{mvar|p}}, with initial velocity inside a small cone about {{mvar|ξ}}, will
have smaller volume than the corresponding conical region in Euclidean space, at least provided that  &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small. 
Similarly, if the Ricci curvature is negative in the direction of a given vector {{mvar|ξ}}, such a conical region in the manifold will instead have larger volume than it would in Euclidean space.

The Ricci curvature is essentially an average of curvatures in the planes including {{mvar|ξ}}. Thus if a cone emitted with an initially circular (or spherical) cross-section becomes distorted into an ellipse ([[ellipsoid]]), it is possible for the volume distortion to vanish if the distortions along the [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] counteract one another. The Ricci curvature would then vanish along {{mvar|ξ}}. In physical applications, the presence of a nonvanishing sectional curvature does not necessarily indicate the presence of any mass locally; if an initially circular cross-section of a cone of [[worldline]]s later becomes elliptical, without changing its volume, then this is due to tidal effects from a mass at some other location.

== Applications ==

Ricci curvature plays an important role in [[general relativity]], where it is the key term in the [[Einstein field equation]]s.

Ricci curvature  also appears in  the [[Ricci flow]] equation, where a time-dependent Riemannian metric is deformed in the direction of minus its Ricci curvature. This system of partial differential equations is a non-linear analog of the [[heat equation]], and was first introduced by [[Richard S. Hamilton]] in the early 1980s. Since heat tends to spread through a solid until the body reaches an equilibrium state of constant temperature, Ricci flow may be hoped to produce an equilibrium geometry for a manifold for which the Ricci curvature is constant. Recent contributions to the subject due to [[Grigori Perelman]] now show that this program works well enough in dimension three  to lead to a complete classification of compact 3-manifolds, along lines first conjectured by [[William Thurston]] in the 1970s.

On a [[Kähler manifold]], the  Ricci curvature determines the first [[Chern class]] of the manifold (mod torsion). However, the Ricci curvature has no analogous topological interpretation on a generic Riemannian manifold.

==Global geometry and topology==

Here is a short list of global results concerning manifolds with positive Ricci curvature; see also [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|classical theorems of Riemannian geometry]]. Briefly, positive Ricci curvature of a Riemannian manifold has strong topological consequences, while (for dimension at least 3), negative Ricci curvature has ''no'' topological implications. (The Ricci curvature is said to be '''positive''' if the Ricci curvature function {{math|Ric(''ξ'',''ξ'')}} is positive on the set of non-zero tangent vectors {{mvar|ξ}}.)  Some results are also known for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

#[[Myers theorem|Myers' theorem]] states that if the Ricci curvature is bounded from below on a complete Riemannian manifold by {{math|(''n'' − 1)''k'' &gt; 0}}, then the manifold  has diameter {{math|≤ {{sfrac|π|{{sqrt|''k''}}}}}}, with equality only if the manifold is [[Isometry|isometric]] to a sphere of a constant curvature {{mvar|k}}. By a covering-space argument, it follows that any compact  manifold of positive Ricci curvature must  have  finite [[fundamental group]].
#The [[Bishop–Gromov inequality]] states that if  a complete {{mvar|m}}-dimensional Riemannian manifold has non-negative Ricci curvature,  then the volume of a ball is less than or equal to the volume of a ball of the same radius in Euclidean {{mvar|m}}-space. Moreover, if {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')}} denotes the volume of the ball with center {{mvar|p}} and radius {{mvar|R}} in the manifold and {{math|''V''(''R'') {{=}} ''c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} denotes the volume of the ball of radius {{mvar|R}} in Euclidean {{mvar|m}}-space then the function {{math|{{sfrac|''v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')|''V''(''R'')}}}} is nonincreasing. (The last inequality can be generalized to arbitrary curvature bound and is the key point in the proof of [[Gromov's compactness theorem (geometry)|Gromov's compactness theorem]].)
#The Cheeger–Gromoll [[splitting theorem]] states that if a complete Riemannian manifold with {{math|Ric ≥ 0}} contains a  ''line'', meaning  a geodesic {{mvar|γ}} such that {{math|''d''(''γ''(''u''),''γ''(''v'')) {{=}} {{abs|''u'' − ''v''}}}} for all {{math|''u'', ''v'' ∈ ℝ}}, then it is isometric to a product space {{math|ℝ × ''L''}}. Consequently, a complete manifold of positive Ricci curvature can have at most one topological end.  The theorem is also true under some additional hypotheses for complete [[Lorentzian manifold]]s (of metric signature {{math|(+ − − ...)}}) with non-negative Ricci tensor ({{harvnb|Galloway|2000}}).

These results show that positive Ricci curvature has strong topological consequences.  By contrast, excluding the case of surfaces, negative
Ricci curvature is now known to have ''no'' topological implications; {{harvtxt| Lohkamp|1994}} has shown that any manifold of dimension greater than two admits a Riemannian metric of negative Ricci curvature. (For surfaces, negative Ricci curvature implies negative sectional curvature; but the point is that this fails rather dramatically in all higher dimensions.)

== Behavior under conformal rescaling ==

If the metric {{mvar|g}} is changed by multiplying it by a conformal factor {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''f''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Ricci tensor of the new, conformally-related metric {{math|''g̃'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''g''}} is given  {{harv|Besse|1987|p=59}} by

&lt;!--PLEASE DON'T CHANGE \Delta TO -\Delta.  The sign is correct for our Laplacian convention (and agrees with the cited source).--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\operatorname{Ric}}=\operatorname{Ric}+(2-n)\left[ \nabla df-df\otimes df\right]+\left[\Delta f -(n-2)\|df\|^2\right]g ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=Δ {{=}} ''d''*''d''}} is the (positive spectrum) Hodge Laplacian, i.e., the ''opposite'' of the usual trace of the Hessian.

In particular, given a point {{mvar|p}} in a Riemannian manifold, it is always possible to find metrics conformal to the given metric {{mvar|g}} for which the Ricci tensor vanishes at {{mvar|p}}. Note, however, that this is only pointwise assertion; it is usually impossible to make the Ricci curvature vanish identically on the entire manifold by a conformal rescaling.

For two dimensional manifolds, the above formula shows that if {{mvar|f}} is a [[harmonic function]], then the conformal scaling {{math|''g'' ↦ ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''f''&lt;/sup&gt;''g''}} does not change the Ricci tensor (although it still changes its trace with respect to the metric unless f=0).

==Trace-free Ricci tensor==
In [[Riemannian geometry]] and [[general relativity]], the '''trace-free Ricci tensor''' of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold {{math|(''M'',''g'')}} is the tensor defined by

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \operatorname{Ric}- \frac{S}{n}g ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Ric}} is the Ricci tensor, {{mvar|S}} is the [[scalar curvature]], {{mvar|g}} is the [[metric tensor]], and {{mvar|n}} is the dimension of {{mvar|M}}. The name of this object reflects the fact that its [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]]  automatically vanishes:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{ab}g^{ab}= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}, the trace-free Ricci tensor vanishes identically if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric} = \lambda g&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant {{mvar|λ}}.

In mathematics, this is the condition for {{math|(''M'',''g'')}} to be an [[Einstein manifold]]. In physics, this equation states that {{math|(''M'',''g'')}} is a solution of Einstein's vacuum field equations with [[cosmological constant]].

==Kähler manifolds==
On a [[Kähler manifold]] {{mvar|X}}, the Ricci curvature determines the [[curvature form]] of the [[canonical bundle|canonical line bundle]] {{harv|Moroianu|2007|loc=Chapter 12}}.  The canonical line bundle is the top [[exterior power]] of the bundle of holomorphic [[Kähler differential]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \wedge^n \Omega_X.&lt;/math&gt;

The Levi-Civita connection corresponding to the metric on {{mvar|X}} gives rise to a connection on {{mvar|κ}}. The curvature of this connection is the two form defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(X,Y)\,\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\,\operatorname{Ric}(JX,Y)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|J}} is the [[complex manifold|complex structure]] map on the tangent bundle determined by the structure of the Kähler manifold. The Ricci form is a [[closed and exact forms|closed]] 2-form. Its [[cohomology class]] is, up to a real constant factor, the first [[Chern class]] of the canonical bundle, and is therefore a topological invariant of {{mvar|X}} (for compact {{mvar|X}}) in the sense that it depends only on the topology of {{mvar|X}} and the [[homotopy class]] of the complex structure.

Conversely, the Ricci form determines the Ricci tensor by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric}(X,Y) = \rho(X,JY).&lt;/math&gt;

In local holomorphic coordinates {{mvar|z&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Ricci form is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = -i\partial\overline{\partial}\log\det\left(g_{\alpha\overline{\beta}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∂}} is the [[Dolbeault operator]] and

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha\overline{\beta}} = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z^\alpha},\frac{\partial}{\partial {\overline{z}}^\beta}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If the Ricci tensor vanishes, then the canonical bundle is flat, so the [[G-structure|structure group]] can be locally reduced to a subgroup of the special linear group {{math|SL(''n'','''C''')}}.  However, Kähler manifolds already possess [[holonomy]] in {{math|U(''n'')}}, and so the (restricted) holonomy of a Ricci-flat Kähler manifold is contained in {{math|SU(''n'')}}. Conversely, if the (restricted) holonomy of a {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional Riemannian manifold is contained in {{math|SU(''n'')}}, then the manifold is a Ricci-flat Kähler manifold {{harv|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|loc=IX, §4}}.

==Generalization to affine connections==
The Ricci tensor can also be generalized to arbitrary [[affine connection]]s, where it is an invariant that plays an especially important role in the study of [[projective differential geometry|projective geometry]] (geometry associated to unparameterized geodesics) {{harv|Nomizu|Sasaki|1994}}.  If {{math|∇}} denotes an affine connection, then the curvature tensor {{mvar|R}} is the (1,3)-tensor defined by

:&lt;math&gt;R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X\nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y\nabla_XZ - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z&lt;/math&gt;

for any vector fields {{math|''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''}}. The Ricci tensor is defined to be the trace:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ric}(X,Y) = \operatorname{tr}\big(Z\mapsto R(Z,X)Y\big).&lt;/math&gt;

In this more general situation, the Ricci tensor is symmetric if and only if there exist locally a parallel [[volume form]] for the connection.

{{Redirect|Bear arms}}{{See also|Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|Overview of gun laws by nation|Gun control}}

The '''right to keep and bear arms''' (often referred to as the '''right to bear arms''') is the people's right to possess [[weapons]] (arms) for their own defense.&lt;ref name=Halbrook1994p8&gt;{{cite book |last=Halbrook |first=Stephen P. |year=1994 |title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy) |url= |page=8 |publisher=The Independent Institute |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=0-945999-38-0 |oclc=30659789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only few countries recognize people's right to keep and bear arms and protect it on statutory level, and even fewer protect the right on constitutional level.

==Background==
In [[Old English]], ''beran'' (past tense ''bær'') means to bear, bring, bring forth, or produce; to endure or sustain; or to wear.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear (v.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] allowed [[Protestantism|Protestant]] citizens of [[England]] to "have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law" and restricted the ability of the [[English Crown]] to have a [[standing army]] or to interfere with Protestants' right to bear arms "when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law" and established that Parliament, not the Crown, could regulate the right to bear arms.&lt;ref name="c21WillMarSess2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2/introduction |title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar.

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation" subject to suitability and allowance by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''arms'' as used in the 1600s, the term refers to the process of equipping for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas Harper|title=arm (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used as a synonym for weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arm|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arm|website=Thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. In 1875, 17 percent of constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, "the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |title=U.S. Gun Rights Are Truly American Exceptionalism |work=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2016 |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-03-07/u-s-gun-rights-truly-are-american-exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789,&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt; [[Tom Ginsburg]] and colleagues "identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms.

Generally, where modern constitutions refer to arms at all, the purpose is "to allow the government to regulate their use or to compel military service, not to provide a right to bear them".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt; Constitutions which historically guaranteed a right to bear arms are those of [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Liberia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]] and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name=CCP&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |publisher=CCP: Comparative Constitutions Project |url=http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/arms-1200w-e1379117382415.png?6c8912 |title=Data Visualizations – Right to Bear Arms |date=2016 |accessdate=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of the Latin American examples were modelled on that of the United States.&lt;ref name=Elkins/&gt; At present, out of the world’s nearly 200 constitutions, three still include a right to bear arms: Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States; of these three, only the last does not include explicit restrictive conditions.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt;

Mexican constitution of 1857 first included right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 relativized the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.

Another change was included in 1971 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to [[Gun politics in Mexico|statutory authorization in Federal law]].

==Gun violence and the politics of the right to bear arms==
{{Weasel|section|date=September 2018}}
Legal restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators because they believe that they will reduce gun related violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/International/Story?id=3066193&amp;page=1 |title=U.K. Response to School Massacre: Ban Handguns |first=David |last=Wright |date=April 22, 2007 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/29/europe/union.php |title=EU legislators push tougher gun controls |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=November 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/world/europe/29iht-union.4.8532843.html |archivedate=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/01/us/clinton-calls-brady-law-a-success-and-backs-more-limits.html |title=President Clinton Calls Brady Law a Success and Backs More Limits |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their actions are frequently the result of grass roots pressure for such controls. The [[Brady Campaign|Brady]], [[Snowdrop Campaign]]s, and the [[Million Mom March]] are recent examples of campaigns calling for tighter restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms.

Accident statistics are hard to obtain, but much data is available on the issue of gun ownership and gun related deaths. The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A strong correlation is seen in both.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the 1989 and 1992 International Crime Surveys, data on gun ownership in eighteen countries have been collected on which WHO data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other means are also available. The results presented in a previous paper based on the fourteen countries surveyed during the first ICS and on rank correlations (Spearman's rho), suggested that gun ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other means. In the present analysis, four additional countries covered by the 1992 ICS only have been included, and Pearson's correlation coefficients r have been used. The results confirm those presented in the previous study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J. M. |editor3-last=van Dijk |title=Understanding Crime, Experiences of Crime and Crime Control - Acts of the International Conference, Rome, 18–20 Nov 1992 |pages=289–306 |location=Rome |publisher=United Nations International Crime &amp; Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) |isbn=92-9078-023-1 |chapterurl=http://www.unicri.it/wwk/publications/books/series/understanding/19_GUN_OWNERSHIP.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107174528/http://www.unicri.it/wwk/publications/books/series/understanding/19_GUN_OWNERSHIP.pdf |archivedate=2008-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

UNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that "widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide." Speculating on possible causes the researchers concluded that "all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a—fatal—role in this".&lt;ref name="UNICRI"&gt;{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J.

The research reporter found that guns were the major cause of homicides in 3 of the 14 countries it studied; Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States. Although the data seem to indicate that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that "reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point", citing the American example.&lt;ref name="UNICRI"/&gt;

In contrast to the 1993 study however, a more recent study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. Significant correlations between household gun ownership and rates of gun suicides for both genders, and gun homicide rates involving female victims were found. There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Killias |first=M. |last2=van Kesteren |first2=J. |last3=Rindlisbacher |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=Guns, Violent Crime, and Suicide in 21 Countries |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Criminology]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=429–448 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/5263789/GunsKilliasvKesteren.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Sandra Bundy was born on March 12, 1934 and grew up in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her father left the family when she was still a child. She has said she believes a lack of a father figure may have contributed to her problems with relationships later in life. She graduated in 1952 from Armstrong Technical, a D.C. public high school that is now closed. Bundy studied for two years at the (now) [[University of the District of Columbia]], but did not complete her degree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy was married five times. Two of her husbands beat her, giving her concussions. She had five children, though one daughter died as a toddler after a neighborhood boy lit the 3-year-old's dress on fire with matches. None of her children's fathers stayed in Bundy's life or paid child support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy participated in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights movement]] in the 1960s, including attending marches. She also started a union supporting an end to racial segregation in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wBPD1vvTCYC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22sandra+bundy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHopy5x6naAhVRS6wKHZA-D8sQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sandra%20bundy%22&amp;f=false|title=The Women's Movement Against Sexual Harassment|last=Baker|first=Carrie N.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521879354|location=|pages=78-80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Bundy worked as a [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] clerk during the day, and as a grocery store cashier at night, but was still having major financial problems and filed for bankruptcy. Her boss at the U.S. Department of Commerce said she couldn't receive any more promotions because she lacked a college degree and she decided to find a new job.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Harassment at Department of Corrections ===
Bundy, then a single mother of four children, joined the city government believing it offered opportunities for advancement and was hired by the [[District of Columbia Department of Corrections]] (DCDC) in 1970. She earned a yearly salary of $10,500, which was more than twice the starting salary of her old job, and was able to quit her second job as a night cashier. She was promoted several times and became a vocational rehabilitation specialist and helped former inmates find jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy alleges that four supervisors sexually harassed her between 1972-1975, including Arthur Burton, James Gainey, Lawrence Swain and Delbert Jackson.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzRL8f_Wlf4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22Sandra+Bundy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zl8LUuN-MC&amp;sig=KOoK4Du_GDt4li73UDStyU_rtsg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd_pqDxqnaAhVSiqwKHeaLBkY4FBDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sandra%20Bundy%22&amp;f=false|title=Hostile Environment: The Political Betrayal of Sexually Harassed Women|last=Mink|first=Gwendolyn|date=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0801436443|location=|pages=58-60|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her supervisor Arthur Burton began making sexual comments about her in 1974, and asked her several times to leave work and go home with him, though Bundy said no every time. One time Burton called Bundy's home in the evening, though her number was unlisted, and then hung up on her when she refused to meet with him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After a time, Bundy's former colleague James Gainey became her new supervisor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He began doing things in the office that made her uncomfortable, like patting her buttocks and calling her “fine Momma.” He once invited her on a vacation, which she refused. He often asked her to sleep with him, and once said, "I’ve got a pocketful of money. Let’s take the afternoon off to a motel and lay up." She said no to each of his advances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy's supervisors regularly criticized her for taking too much time off and poor work performance, though she had never received such criticisms before rejecting their advances. At one point, Gainey threatened to fire her. Bundy later learned she’d been overlooked for a promotion while her male colleagues had moved up or been recommended. When she complained to her supervisors' superior Lawrence Swain, he told her that "any man in his right mind would want to rape you."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next time she complained to him, he ignored her complaints and asked if she was dating anyone, adding, “Because if not, I want to take you to bed myself.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bundy v. Jackson|court=D.C.Cir.|reporter=F.2d|vol=641|opinion=934|pinpoint=940|date=1981|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/641/934/25673/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of a female colleague, she began keeping a diary and recording each incident.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy began having trouble sleeping, and lost weight. She often cried and once contemplated suicide. She started seeing a psychiatrist, and was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Years earlier, a colleague named Delbert Jackson had made several unsuccessful passes at Bundy and tried to get her to drink with him (she didn't drink), but when he was promoted to director of the DCDC she got desperate and went to him for help in April 1975. However, he and other boardmembers refused to concede she had a case.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Bundy sought help from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity]] officers at the DCDC, but they cautioned her against bringing unwarranted complaints. Bundy's black co-workers criticized her for bringing forth the suit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, Bundy filed an informal and then a formal complaint. 

=== ''Bundy v. Jackson'' case ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25476">'''Secondary consciousness''' is an individual's accessibility to their history and plans. The ability allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of [[primary consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;Edelman, G. M. (2003). Naturalizing consciousness: a theoretical framework. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 5520–5524.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary consciousness can be defined as simple awareness that includes [[perception]] and [[emotion]]. As such, it is ascribed to most animals. By contrast, secondary consciousness depends on and includes such features as self-reflective awareness, abstract thinking, volition and [[metacognition]].&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (1992). Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind. Basic Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined by [[Gerald Edelman]].

==Brief history and overview==
[[Image:RobertFuddBewusstsein17Jh.png|thumb|Representation of consciousness from the seventeenth century.]]

Since [[Descartes]]'s proposal of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], it became a general consensus that the mind had become a matter of [[philosophy]] and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness-  that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness.  Such notable neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness are [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Gerald Edelman]].  Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation play a critical role in high level cognition,&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (1999). The Feeling of What Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making ofConsciousness. Harcourt Brace, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (2003). Feelings of emotion and the self. In J. LeDoux, J. Debiec &amp; H. Moss (Eds.), Self: from Soul to Brain (Vol. 1001, pp. 253-261). New York: New York Acad Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers D J, Facing up to the problem of consciousness, J Cons Stud, 2 (1995) 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers D J, The conscious mind: In search of a fundamental theory (Oxford University Press, New York) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms [[primary consciousness]] and secondary consciousness.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;  Despite being an often criticized theory, Edelman’s theory of consciousness is regarded as the most neurobiologically sound and accurate description of consciousness to date.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The author puts forward the belief that consciousness is a particular kind of brain process; linked and integrated, yet complex and differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M.,  Tononi, G. (2000). A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution towards secondary consciousness==
Edelman argues that the [[evolutionary]] emergence of consciousness depended on the [[natural selection]] of neural systems that gave rise to consciousness, but not on selection for consciousness itself. He is noted for his theory of neuronal group selection, also known as [[Neural Darwinism]], which displays the belief that consciousness is the product of natural selection. He believes consciousness is not something separate from the real world, thus the attempt to eliminate [[Descartes]]’ "[[Mind-body dualism|dualism]]" as a possible consideration. He also rejects theories based on the notion that the brain is a computer or an instructional system. Instead, he suggests that the brain is a selectional system, one in which large numbers of variant circuits are generated [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]]. He claims the potential connectivity in the neural net "far exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe" &lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;Edelman, G. M. (2004). Wider than the sky: a revolutionary view of consciousness. Penguin Press Science, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic core hypothesis and re-entry===
'''Dynamic core hypothesis '''

Edelman elaborates on the dynamic core hypothesis (DCH), which describes the thalamocortical region- the region believed to be the integration center of consciousness. The DCH reflects the use and disuse of interconnected neuronal networks during stimulation of this region. It has been shown through computer models that neuronal groups existing in the [[cerebral cortex]] and [[thalamus]] interact in the form of synchronous [[oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner, A. G. (2007). Metastability, criticality and phase transitions in brain and its models. Biosystems, 90(2), 496–508&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between distinct neuronal groups forms the "dynamic core" and may help explain the nature of conscious experience.

''' Re-entry'''
{{Main|Reentry (neural circuitry)}}

Edelman integrates the DCH hypothesis into Neural Darwinism, in which [[metastable]] interactions in the thalamocortical region cause a process of selectionism through [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|re-entry]], a host of internal [[feedback]] loops. "Re-entry", as Edelman states, "provides the critical means by which the activities of distributed multiple brain areas are linked, bound, and then dynamically altered in time during perceptual categorization. Both diversity and re-entry are necessary to account for the fundamental properties of conscious experience." These re-entrant signals are reinforced by areas Edelman calls "degenerate". Degeneracy doesn't imply deterioration, but instead redundancy as many areas in the brain handle the same or similar tasks. With this brain structure emerging in early humans, selection could favor certain brains and pass their patterns down the generations. Habits once erratic and highly individual ultimately became the social norm.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt;

=== Exhibiting secondary consciousness in the animal kingdom===
While animals with [[primary consciousness]] have long-term memory, they lack explicit narrative, and, at best, can only deal with the immediate scene in the remembered present. While they still have an advantage over animals lacking such ability, [[evolution]] has brought forth a growing complexity in consciousness, particularly in [[mammals]]. Animals with this complexity are said to have secondary consciousness.
Secondary consciousness is seen in animals with [[semantic capabilities]], such as the four [[great apes]]. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex [[language]] made up of [[syntax]] and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of [[reptiles]] into mammals and then into [[birds]], the [[embryological]] development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich re-entrant activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt; The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual [[memory]] systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, G. M. (200). Second Nature:Brain Science and Human Knowledge. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-recognition'''

For the advocates of the idea of a secondary consciousness, self-recognition serves as a critical component and a key defining measure.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of self-recognition. In non-human species and in children, the "[[mirror test]]" has been used as an indicator of [[self-awareness]]. In these experiments, subjects are placed in front of a mirror and provided with a mark that cannot be seen directly but is visible in the mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Bischof-Köhler, D. (1991). The development of empathy in infants. In M.E. Lamb &amp; H. Keller (eds.), Infant Development. Perspectives from German speaking countries (245-273).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magpie"&gt;Prior, H., Schwarz, A., &amp; Gunturkun, O. (2008). Mirror-induced behavior in the magpie (Pica pica): Evidence of self-recognition. Plos Biology, 6(8), 1642-1650.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous findings in the past 30 years which display fairly clear evidence of possessors of self-recognition including the following animals:
* [[Chimpanzee]]s, [[orangutan]]s, pygmy chimpanzees, and [[gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gallup GG Jr (1970) Chimpanzees: self-recognition. ''Science'' 167: 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walraven V, van Elsacker L, Verheyen R (1995) Reactions of a group of pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus) to their mirror images: evidence of self-recognition. Primates 36: 145–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson FGP, Cohn RH (1994) Self-recognition and self-awareness in lowland gorillas. In: Parker ST, Mitchell RW, editors. Self-awareness in animals and humans: developmental perspectives. New York (New York): Cambridge University Press. pp. 273–290.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dolphins]] and [[elephants]]. Findings suggestive of self-recognition in mammals other than apes have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss D, Marino L (2001) Mirror self-recognition in the bottlenose dolphin: a case of cognitive convergence. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 98: 5937–5942.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plotnik JM, de Waal FBM, Reiss D (2006) Self-recognition in an Asian elephant. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103: 17053–17057.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Magpies]].&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt;
It should be mentioned that even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli DJ, Rulf AB, Landau KR, Bierschwale DT (1993) Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence. J Comp Psychol 107: 347–372.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Monkeys]], non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt CW (1998) Responses of gibbons (Hylobates lar) to their mirror images. Am J Primatol 45: 307–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Self-recognition study in the magpie'''

It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a [[neocortex]]. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in [[corvids]] was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less [[magpies]] are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="Magpie"/&gt;

''' Research on animal consciousness'''

Many researchers of consciousness have looked upon such types of research in animals as significant and interesting approaches. Ursula Voss of the Universität Bonn believes that the theory of protoconsciousness may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in this bird species, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep. She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as if we continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), we would be able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today’s world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Lucid vs. non lucid dreaming as a model==
In the last couple of decades, dream research has begun to focus on the field of consciousness. Through [[lucid dreaming]], [[NREM sleep]], [[REM sleep]], and waking states, many dream researchers are attempting to scientifically explore consciousness. When exploring consciousness through the concept of dreams, many researchers believe the general characteristics that constitute primary and secondary consciousness remain intact:
"Primary consciousness is a state in which you have no future or past, a state of just being…. no executive ego control in your dreams, no planning, things just happen to you, you just are in a dream. Yet, everything feels real…Secondary is based on language, has to do with self-reflection, it has to do with forming abstractions, and that is dependent of language. Only animals with language have secondary consciousness".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Circuitry/anatomy ===
There have been studies used to determine what parts of the brain are associated with [[lucid dreaming]], [[NREM sleep]], [[REM sleep]] and waking states. The goal of these studies is often to seek [[physiological]] correlates of dreaming and apply them in the hopes of understanding relations to consciousness.

''' Prefrontal cortex'''

Some notable, albeit criticized findings include the functions of the [[prefrontal cortex]] that are most relevant to the self-conscious awareness that is lost in sleep, commonly termed as ‘executive’ functions. These include self-observation, planning, prioritizing and decision-making abilities, which are, in turn, based upon more basic [[cognitive]] abilities such as attention, working memory, [[Time|temporal]] memory and behavioral inhibition &lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, E. (2001) The Executive Brain: Frontal Lobes and the Civilized Mind, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;12 Fuster, J.M. (1997) The Prefrontal Cortex: Anatomy, Physiology, and Neuropsychology of the Frontal.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental data which display differences between the self-awareness experienced in waking and its diminution in dreaming can be explained by deactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during REM sleep. It has been proposed that deactivation results from a direct inhibition of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons by [[acetylcholine]], the release of which is enhanced during REM sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Muzur, A. Pace-Schott, E.F. Hobson, JA (2002) The Prefrontal Cortex in Sleep. Trends Cogn Sci, 6(11), 475–481.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
[[File:Sleep EEG REM.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Polysomnography|Polysomnographic]] record of REM Sleep. [[EEG]] highlighted by red box. Eye movement highlighted by red line.]]
Experiments and studies have been taken out to test neural correlations of lucid dreams with consciousness in dream research. Although there are many difficulties in conducting lucid dreaming research (e.g. number of lucid subjects, ‘type’ of lucidity achieved, etc.), there have been studies with significant results.

In one study, researchers sought physiological correlates of lucid dreaming. They showed that the unusual combination of hallucinatory dream activity and wake-like reflective awareness and agentive control experienced in lucid dreams is paralleled by significant changes in [[electrophysiology]]. Participants were recorded using 19-channel [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG), and 3 achieved lucidity in the experiment. Differences between REM sleep and lucid dreaming were most prominent in the 40-Hz [[frequency]] band. The increase in 40-Hz power was especially strong at frontolateral and frontal sites.  Their findings include the indication that 40-Hz activity holds a functional role in the modulation of conscious awareness across different conscious states. Furthermore, they termed lucid dreaming as a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] state, or that lucidity occurs in a state with features of both REM sleep and waking. In order to move from non-lucid REM sleep dreaming to lucid REM sleep dreaming, there must be a shift in brain activity in the direction of waking.&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;Voss, U., Holzmann, R., Tuin, I., &amp; Hobson, J. A. (2009). Lucid Dreaming: A State of Consciousness with Features of Both Waking and Non-Lucid Dreaming. Sleep, 32(9), 1191-1200.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other well-known contributing scholars involved with lucid dream research and consciousness, yet primarily based in fields such as psychology and philosophy include:
*[[Stephen LaBerge]]- most known for his lucid dreaming education and facilitation. His technique of signaling to a collaborator monitoring his [[EEG]] with agreed-upon eye movements during REM sleep became the first published, scientifically-verified signal from a dreamer's mind to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Laberge, S. (1980). Lucid dreaming: An exploratory study of consciousness during sleep. (Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, 1980), (University Microfilms No. 80-24, 691)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaBerge, S. (1991). Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. New York: Ballantine Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Metzinger]]- known for his correlate of neuroscience and philosophy in understanding consciousness. He is praised for his ability to probe and link fundamental issues between these fields.&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1995) Conscious Experience. Imprint Academic, Thorverton und mentis, Paderborn, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (2000) Neural Correlates of Consciousness – Empirical and Conceptual Questions. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Tholey]]- most known for his research on rare, non-ordinary ego experiences and OBEs that arise with lucid dreaming. He has also studied the cognitive abilities of dream characters in lucid dreams through various experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Tholey, P. (1989). CONSCIOUSNESS AND ABILITIES OF DREAM CHARACTERS OBSERVED DURING LUCID DREAMING. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 68(2), 567-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tholey, P. (1989). Overview of the Development of Lucid Dream Research in Germany. Lucidity Letter, 8(2), 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protoconsciousness===
The theory of protoconsciousness, developed by [[Allan Hobson]], a creator of the [[Activation-synthesis hypothesis]], has been developed through dream research and involves the idea of a secondary consciousness. Hobson suggests that brain states underlying waking and dreaming cooperate and that their functional interplay is crucial to the optimal functioning of both. Ultimately, he proposes the idea that [[REM sleep]] provides opportunities to the brain to prepare itself for its main integrative functions, including secondary consciousness, which would explain the developmental and [[evolutionary]] considerations to be taken with birds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} This functional interplay which occurs during REM sleep constitutes a ‘proto-conscious’ state which preludes consciousness and can develop and maintain higher order consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J. A. (2009). REM sleep and dreaming: towards a theory of protoconsciousness. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 10(11), 803-U862. {{doi|10.1038/nrn2716}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIM model===
As the [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] has evolved, it has metamorphosed into the three-dimensional framework known as the AIM model. The AIM model describes a method of mapping conscious states onto an underlying [[physiological]] state space. The AIM model relates not just to wake/sleep states of consciousness, but to all states of [[consciousness]]. By choosing activation, input source, and mode of [[neuromodulation]] as the three dimensions, the proposers believe to have selected "how much information is being processed by the brain (A), what information is being processed (I), and how it is being processed (M).&lt;ref name="AIM"&gt;Hobson, J. A., Pace-Schott, E. F., &amp; Stickgold, R. (2000). Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 23(6), 793-+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobson, Schott, and Stickgold propose three aspects of the AIM model:

*Conscious states are in large part determined by three interdependent processes, the level of brain [[activation]] ("A"), the origin of inputs ("I") to the activated areas, and the relative levels of activation of aminergic ([[noradrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]]) and [[cholinergic]] [[neuromodulators]] ("M").&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;
*The AIM Model proposes that all of the universes’ possible brain-mind states can be exemplified with a three-dimensional state space, with axes A, I, and M (activation, input, and mode), and that the state of the brain-mind at any given instant of time can be described as a point in this space. Since the AIM model represents brain-mind state as a sequence of points, Hobson adds that time is a fourth dimension of the model.&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;
*The AIM model proposes that all three parameters defining the state space are continuous variables, and any point in the state space can in theory be occupied.&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;

===Criticism of lucid dreaming model===
Secondary consciousness, as it remains a controversial topic, has received often contrasting findings and beliefs regarding [[lucid dreaming]] as a model, which entails the true difficulty in understanding consciousness.

The most common of recent criticisms include:
* The analyzed circuitry involved in lucid dreaming, [[REM sleep]], [[NREM sleep]], and waking states used to determine reflective ability. If, as many scholars have come to suggest, typical non-lucid REM dreaming reflects [[primary consciousness]], the belief that typical non-lucid dreaming is accompanied by de-activation of the DL-PFC becomes significant. Although the [[Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex]] (DL-PFC) is believed to be the site of "executive [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] control", it has never been tested.
* The idea of "executive [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] control" and its articulation. Kuiken has stated that typical non-lucid REM dreaming may involve another form of self-regulative activity that is not related to activation of the DL-PFC. There is evidence that the subtle self-regulation characteristic of [[musical improvisation]] is similar in pattern to the activations and de-activations (including de-activation of the DL-PFC) that characterize REM sleep. It is probable that the loss of one conscious form of self-regulation during non-lucid dreaming creates the possibility for the adoption of an unconscious, but "fluid" form of self-regulation that resembles that of musical improvisation. It is possible, he believes, that non-lucid dreaming entails self-regulated but fluid openness to ‘what comes,’ rather than the direct self-monitoring and inhibition that enable ‘rational’ planning and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Kuiken, D. (2010). Primary and Secondary Consciousness During Dreaming. International Journal of Dream Research, 3(1), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a recent study, it has been proven that unconscious task-relevant signals can actively trigger and initiate an inhibition to respond, thereby breaking the alleged close correlation between consciousness and inhibitory control.&lt;ref&gt;van Gaal S., Ridderinkhof K.R., van den Wildenberg W.P.M., Lamme V.A.F.(2009). Dissociating Consciousness From Inhibitory Control: Evidence for Unconsciously Triggered Response Inhibition in the Stop-Signal Task. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 35 (4), 1129-1139.&lt;/ref&gt; This proves that self-regulative activities (a characteristic of secondary consciousness for many scholars) can occur independently of consciousness of consciousness.
* Using lucid dreaming as a model of secondary consciousness. Some scholars believe lucid dreaming does not constitute a single type of reflectiveness. It is already argued that there may be different kinds of reflectiveness that might define secondary consciousness, so the difficulty in using lucid dreaming as a model is greatly increased. For example, there may be a realization in a dream that will often go without gaining control. There are different amounts of ‘executive functions’ taken between lucid dreams, thus displaying how there are many different types of reflectiveness involved in ‘lucid’ dreaming.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Committee on Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards, "Animals as Sentinels of Environmental Health Hazards: Committee on Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards," National Academy Press: 1991, {{ISBN|0309040469}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People have long observed animals for signs of impending hazards or evidence of environmental threats. Plants and other living organisms have also been used for these purposes.

== Historical examples ==
There are countless examples of environmental effects on animals that later manifested in humans. The classic example is the "[[domestic canary|canary]] in the [[Coal mining|coal mine]]". The idea of placing a [[Atlantic canary|canary]] or other warm blooded animal in a mine to detect [[carbon monoxide]] was first proposed by [[John Scott Haldane]], in 1913 or later.&lt;ref name=acott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=JS Haldane, JBS Haldane, L Hill, and A Siebe: A brief resume of their lives. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6016 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boycott |first=A.

Bengston, Diane S. Henshel, "Environmental Toxicology and Risk Assessment: Biomarkers and Risk Assessment", ASTM International, 1996, {{ISBN|0803120311}}, p 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The birds, being more sensitive, would become sick before the miners, who would then have a chance to escape or put on protective [[respirators]].

In [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay, Japan]], [[Domestic cat|cats]] developed "[[Minamata disease|dancing cat fever]]" before humans were [[Minamata disease|affected]] due to eating mercury-contaminated fish.&lt;ref name="withrow"&gt;Stephen J. Withrow, David M. Vail, ''Withrow and MacEwen's Small Animal Clinical Oncology'', Elsevier: 2007, {{ISBN|0721605583}}, p. 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were recognized as early as 1939 to be more susceptible to tonsil cancer if they were kept in crowded urban environments.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; Studies similarly found higher disease rates in animals exposed to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; [[Yushō disease]] was similarly discovered when poultry began dying at alarming rates due to [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] poisoning, although not before approximately 14,000 people were affected.

== Characteristics ==
Animal sentinels must have measurable responses to the hazard in question, whether that is due to the animal's death, disappearance, or some other determinable aspect.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Many of these species are ideally [[Endangered species|unendangered]] and easy to handle. It is important that the species' range overlap with the range being studied.&lt;ref name="bds" /&gt; Often the ideal species is determined by the characteristics of the hazard.

For example, [[honey bee]]s are susceptible to [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Similarly both [[bats]] and [[swallows]] have been used to monitor pesticide contamination due to their diet of insects that may have been affected by the chemicals.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} By the same token, aquatic animals, or their direct predators, are used as sentinel species to monitor [[water pollution]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Some species may show effects of a contaminant before humans due to their size, their reproductive rate, or their increased exposure to the contaminant.&lt;ref name="bds"&gt;Arthur D. Bloom, Frederick de Serres, ''Ecotoxicity and Human Health: A Biological Approach to Environmental Remediation'', CRC Press: 1995, {{ISBN|1566701414}}, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific applications ==
[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at [[Sarin gas|Sarin nerve gas]] production plant.]]

=== Toxic gases ===
Canaries were iconically used in [[coal mines]] to detect the presence of [[carbon monoxide]]. The bird's rapid breathing rate, small size, and high metabolism, compared to the miners, led birds in dangerous mines to succumb before the miners, thereby giving them time to take action.

=== Air and water pollution ===
A number of animals have been used to measure varying kinds of air pollution. These include [[honey bee]]s for air pollution, [[bivalve molluscs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/index.php?rubrique=accueil&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt; for online water-quality survey and [[pigeon]]s for atmospheric lead.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Bats and swallows have been used to monitor pesticide contamination due to their diet of insects that may have been affected by the chemicals.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

Aquatic [[DDT]] pollution has been quantitatively measured in [[California]] fish. [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] has been measured through the analysis of fish livers.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|82}} [[Toxaphene]] concentrations were discovered far from the area of its use through analysis of [[trout]] in the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The evidence of atmospheric transport of the substance influenced the subsequent prohibition of its widespread use. [[Alligators]] may have been used to warn of hazardous contamination in [[Centreville, Mississippi]] retention ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Eugene Love Fair Jr. |publication-date=May 28, 2013 |title=Christmas v. Exxon Mobil |work= [[Mississippi Court of Appeals]] |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ms-court-of-appeals/1632483.html |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases ===
The discovery of [[West Nile virus]] in the Western Hemisphere was heralded by an outbreak of disease in crows and other wild birds. Other emerging diseases have demonstrated linkages between animal health events and human risk, including [[monkeypox]], [[SARS]], and [[avian influenza]]. In outbreaks of bubonic plague, rats begin dying out before humans.

=== Household toxins ===
[[Dog]]s may provide early warning of [[lead poisoning]] hazards in a home, and certain cancers in dogs and [[cat]]s have been linked to household exposures to [[pesticide]]s, [[cigarette]] smoke, and other carcinogens.

The '''sit-ups punishment''' (Uthak Baithak) is a form of punishment given in schools of Indian subcontinent, specially in [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Pakistan]]. In this punishment, one has to sit down and stand up continuously and count the number of sit-ups. It is a common punishment in schools. Generally students are asked to perform this with holding their ears with hands. For humiliation, it is done in front of other students. Normally given in the range of 10 to 100 sit up for boys and 10-50 sit up for girls.
==Variants==
There are many forms of this punishment.
===Simple Situps===
The student will do situps holding his ears. The hands should be ninety degrees with the body. Also he/she has to count loudly with every step. If the count is not hearable the term will repeat. Every term he/she has to sit fully so that his back touch the heals and to stand straight.
===Criss-Cross Earholding===
The punished will hold his/her left year with right hand and right ear with left hand. This may cause hardness and humilation to the punishment. It is famous mostly.
===Pairing Situps===
There will be more than one student and they will hold ears of one another and do the situps. This makes the punishment more hard as the punished have to take weight of anothers. Also criss-cross  earholding can be applied here. Then it will be extra hard to complete.
===Situps touching heals===
It is also varient used with the simple situps. Here the punished's heals should touch one another. This will cause friction between the knees for that he/she can fall. Criss-cross earholding can be applied here..
===Other Varients===
Doing situps in the sun, situps with leaving tough are other types of punishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2823">'''Species affinis''' (commonly abbreviated to: '''sp. aff.''',  '''aff.''', or '''affin.''') is [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] terminology in [[zoology]] and [[botany]]. In [[open nomenclature]] it indicates that available material or evidence suggests that the proposed [[species]] is ''related to'', has an ''[[Affinity (taxonomy)|affinity]]'' to, but is ''not identical to'', the species with the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''affinis'' can be translated as ''closely related to'', or ''akin to''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Oxford Latin Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=79 |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who inserts ''[[n.sp.]],'' or ''[[sp. nov.]], aff'' before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously [[Species description|undescribed]] species,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bengtson|first=P.|title=Open Nomenclature|url=http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|work=Palentology|accessdate=2 April 2014|year=1988|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071437/http://www.palass-pubs.org/palaeontology/pdf/Vol31/Pages%20223-227.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the [[holotype]] but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.

An example would be: a [[gastropod shell]] listed as [[Lucapina aff. aegis|''Lucapina'' aff. ''aegis'']] would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of ''[[Lucapina aegis]]'', but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling ''Lucapina aegis''. In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been [[Species description|described]].

The use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as [[cf.]], [[Species|sp.]], or ?,&lt;ref name="Bengtson 1988"/&gt; but the latter indicate that the species is ''uncertain'' rather than undescribed.

'''Splitting''' (also called '''black-and-white thinking''' or '''all-or-nothing thinking''') is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the [[dichotomy]] of both positive and negative qualities of the self and others into a cohesive, realistic whole. It is a common [[defense mechanism]] used by many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 224184 |year=1979 |last= Carser |first=D. |title= The defense mechanism of splitting: Developmental origins, effects on staff, recommendations for nursing care |journal= Journal of psychiatric nursing and mental health services |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=21–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual tends to think in extremes (i.e., an individual's actions and motivations are ''all'' good or ''all'' bad with no middle ground).

The concept of splitting was first described by [[Ronald Fairbairn]] in his formulation of [[object relations theory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The unique origins of Fairbairn's Theories | author=Rubens, R. L. | journal=Psychoanalytic Dialogues: the International Journal of Relational Perspectives | year=1996 | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=413–435 | doi=10.1080/10481889609539128}}&lt;/ref&gt; it begins as the inability of the infant to combine the fulfilling aspects of the parents (the good object) and their unresponsive aspects (the unsatisfying object) into the same individuals, instead seeing the good and bad as separate. In psychoanalytic theory this functions as a defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Textbook of Psychoanalysis | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kH0L1x8B88C&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor1-first=Glen O. | editor1-last=Gabbard | editor2-first=Bonnie E. | editor2-last=Litowitz | editor3-first=Paul | editor3-last=Williams | editor1-link=Glen Gabbard | edition=2nd | publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]] | year=2011 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_kH0L1x8B88C&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22defense+mechanism%22+Splitting+psychoanalysis 96] | isbn=978-1-58562-410-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships ==
Splitting creates instability in relationships because one person can be viewed as either personified virtue or personified vice at different times, depending on whether they gratify the subject's needs or frustrate them. This, along with similar oscillations in the experience and appraisal of the self, leads to chaotic and unstable relationship patterns, identity diffusion, and [[mood swings]]. The therapeutic process can be greatly impeded by these oscillations, because the therapist too can come to be seen as all good or all bad. To attempt to overcome the negative effects on treatment outcome, constant interpretations by the therapist are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, J. R., Prentice, N. M. &amp; Ainslie, R. C. (1996). "The splitting index: construction of a scale measuring the defense mechanism of splitting". ''Journal of Personality Assessment'' 66 (2), 414–430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Splitting contributes to unstable relationships and intense emotional experiences. Splitting is common during [[adolescence]], but is regarded as transient. Splitting has been noted especially with persons diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bpdresourcecenter.org/glossary.html What is Borderline personality disorder – Splitting].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bpd /&gt; Treatment strategies have been developed for individuals and groups based on [[dialectical behavior therapy]], and for couples.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, J. P. ''Repairing Intimacy'' (1992) and Linehan, M. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; There are also self-help books on related topics such as [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] and [[emotional self-regulation|emotional regulation]] that claim to be helpful for individuals who struggle with the consequences of splitting.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, B. 2004, Siegel, J. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Borderline personality disorder ==
{{Main article|Borderline personality disorder}}
Splitting is a relatively common defense mechanism for people with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=bpd&gt;{{cite journal | title=Defense Mechanisms Associated with Borderline Personality Disorder |author1=Mary C. Zanarini |author2=Jolie L. Weingeroff |author3=Frances R.

P. (2006). "Dyadic splitting in partner relational disorders". ''Journal of Family Psychology'', 20 (3), 418–422.&lt;/ref&gt; This school hypothesizes that they consequently experience love and [[sexuality]] as perverse and violent qualities which they cannot integrate with the tender, intimate side of relationships.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01405-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Freud_and_Beyond.html?id=4ODr9mxI53oC|authorlink=Stephen A. Mitchell (psychologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic personality disorder ==
{{Main article|Narcissistic personality disorder}}
People matching the diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder also use splitting as a central defense mechanism. Most often narcissists do this as an attempt to stabilize their sense of self positivity in order to preserve their [[self-esteem]], by perceiving themselves as purely upright or admirable and others who do not conform to their will or values as purely wicked or contemptible.&lt;ref&gt;Abdennur, ''the Narcissistic Principle of Equivalence'', pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive habit of splitting also implies the use of other related defense mechanisms, namely [[idealization and devaluation]], which are preventive attitudes or reactions to [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury]].&lt;ref name="Ref-1" /&gt;

== Depression ==
In [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[exaggerated]] all-or-nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called ''emotional amplifiers'' because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Typical all-or-nothing thoughts:
* My efforts are either a success or they are an abject failure
* Other people are either all good or all bad.
* I am either all good or all bad.
* [[You're either with us, or against us|If you're not with us, you're against us]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 63 and p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter [[Anna Freud]] explored how in healthy childhood development a splitting of loving and aggressive instincts could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;E. Young-Bruehl (2008). ''Anna Freud''. p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Melanie Klein#Thought{{!}}Melanie Klein: thought|Reparation (psychoanalysis)#Klein{{!}}Melanie Klein: reparation}}
There was, however, from early on, another use of the term "splitting" in Freud, referring rather to resolving ambivalence "by splitting the contradictory feelings so that one person is only loved, another one only hated&amp;nbsp;... the good mother and the wicked stepmother in fairy tales".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, with opposing feelings of love and hate, perhaps "the two opposites should have been split apart and one of them, usually the hatred, has been repressed".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991) p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Such splitting was closely linked to the defence of "[[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]&amp;nbsp;... The division of objects into congenial and uncongenial ones&amp;nbsp;... making 'disconnections'."&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the latter sense of the term that was predominantly adopted and exploited by Melanie Klein. After Freud, "the most important contribution has come from Melanie Klein, whose work enlightens the idea of 'splitting of the object' (''{{lang|de|Objektspaltung}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1973). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=PsvZpv0ZRw0C&amp;pg=430&amp;dq=%22Splitting+of+the+Object+%3D+D.\+Objektspaltung%22 Splitting of the Object (p. 430)"].&lt;/ref&gt; (in terms of 'good/bad' objects)".&lt;ref&gt;T. Bokanowski and S. Lewkowicz, ''On Freud's "Splitting of the ego in the process of defense"'' (London 2009) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; In her object relations theory, Klein argues that "the earliest experiences of the infant are split between wholly good ones with 'good' objects and wholly bad experiences with 'bad' objects",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) np [173].&lt;/ref&gt; as children struggle to integrate the two primary drives, love and hate, into constructive social interaction. An important step in childhood development is the gradual depolarization of these two drives.

At what Klein called the [[paranoid-schizoid position]], there is a stark separation of the things the child loves (good, gratifying objects) and the things the child hates (bad, frustrating objects), "because everything is polarised into extremes of love and hate, just like what the baby seems to experience and young children are still very close to."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Klein refers to the ''good breast'' and the ''bad breast'' as split mental entities, resulting from the way "these primitive states tend to deconstruct objects into 'good' and 'bad' bits (called 'part-objects')".&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, ''Klein'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The child sees the breasts as opposite in nature at different times, although they actually are the same, belonging to the same mother. As the child learns that people and objects can be good ''and'' bad at the same time, he or she progresses to the next phase, the [[depressive position]], which "entails a steady, though painful, approximation towards the reality of oneself and others":&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, ''Klein'' p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; integrating the splits and "being able to balance [them] out&amp;nbsp;... are tasks that continue into early childhood and indeed are never completely finished."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, ''Families'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Kleinians also utilize Freud's first conception of splitting, to explain the way "In a related process of splitting, the person divides his own self. This is called 'splitting of the ego'."&lt;ref name="Spaltung" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, ''Klein'' p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Klein herself maintained that "the ego is incapable of splitting the object—internal or external—without a corresponding splitting taking place within the ego".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Paul Holmes, ''The inner world outside'' (1992) p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably at least, by this point "the idea of splitting does not carry the same meaning for Freud and for Klein": for the former, "the ego finds itself 'passively' split, as it were. For Klein and the post-Kleinians, on the other hand, splitting is an 'active' defence mechanism".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2005) p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, by the close of the century "four kinds of splitting can be clearly identified, among many other possibilities" for post-Kleinians: "a coherent split in the object, a coherent split in the ego, a fragmentation of the object, and a fragmentation of the ego."&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Robert Hinshelwood, in Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otto Kernberg ==
{{Main article|Otto Kernberg}}
In the developmental model of Otto Kernberg, the overcoming of splitting is also an important developmental task.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt; The child has to learn to integrate feelings of love and hate. Kernberg distinguishes three different stages in the development of a child with respect to splitting:
* First stage: the child does not experience the self and the object, nor the good and the bad as different entities.
* Second stage: good and bad are viewed as different. Because the boundaries between the self and the other are not stable yet, the other as a person is viewed as either all good or all bad, depending on their actions. This also means that thinking about another person as bad implies that the self is bad as well, so it's better to think about the caregiver as a good person, so the self is viewed as good too. "Bringing together extremely opposite loving and hateful images of the self and of significant others would trigger unbearable anxiety and guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third stage: Splitting – "the division of external objects into 'all good' or 'all bad'"&lt;ref&gt;Kernberg, ''Borderline'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; – begins to be resolved when the self and the other can be seen as possessing both good and bad qualities. Having hateful thoughts about the other does not mean that the self is all hateful and does not mean that the other person is all hateful either.

If a person fails to accomplish this developmental task satisfactorily, borderline pathology can emerge. "In the borderline personality organization", Kernberg found 'dissociated ego states that result from the use of "splitting" defences'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brinich and Christopher Shelley, ''The Self and Personality Structure'' (Buckingham 2002) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; His therapeutic work then aimed at "the analysis of the repeated and oscillating projections of unwanted self and object representations onto the therapist" so as to produce "something more durable, complex and encompassing than the initial, split-off and polarized state of affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Brinich, ''Self'' p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Horizontal and vertical ==
[[Heinz Kohut]] has emphasized in his [[self psychology]] the distinction between horizontal and vertical forms of splitting.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (1971) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional psychoanalysis saw repression as forming a horizontal barrier between different levels of the mind – so that for example an unpleasant truth might be accepted superficially but denied in a deeper part of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut contrasted with this vertical fractures of the mind into two parts with incompatible attitudes separated by mutual disavowal.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (1971) p. 177 and p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transference ==
{{Main article|Transference}}
It has been suggested that interpretation of the transference "becomes effective through a sort of splitting of the ego into a reasonable, judging portion and an experiencing portion, the former recognizing the latter as not appropriate in the present and as coming from the past".&lt;ref name="Fenichel Neurosis p 570"&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, "in this sense, splitting, so far from being a pathological phenomenon, is a manifestation of self-awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1995) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, "it remains to be investigated how this desirable 'splitting of the ego' and 'self-observation' are to be differentiated from the pathological cleavage&amp;nbsp;... directed at preserving isolations".&lt;ref name="Fenichel Neurosis p 570" /&gt;

'''Stiefografie''', also called '''Stiefo''' or '''Rationelle Stenografie''' (Rational Shorthand), is a [[German language|German]] [[shorthand]] system. It was invented by Helmut Stief (1906–1977), a German press and parliamentary stenographer, and first published in 1966.

Helmut Stief was dissatisfied with the [[Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift]] so he created a much simpler alternative system. According to Stief the [[eponym]]ous shorthand system Stiefografie can be quickly learned within a very short time. There are only 25 characters to learn in the first level Grundschrift (business script). Stiefografie is in [[Germany]] the most popular form of the new stenography systems published since the 1950s.

==Writing==
The system has only a minimum number of rules. Like most systems of shorthand, Stiefografie is a [[phonetic]] system. Sounds and words are written as they are spoken. [[Silent letter]]s are ignored.

The [[consonant]] signs are made by simplifying the features of [[cursive]] [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters. Vowel signs are only used when a vowel stands at the end of a word. Vowels in the beginning or in the middle of words are represented symbolically by varying the position of the following consonant signs.

Stiefografie does not employ shading (variation of thickness of strokes) to distinguish [[vowel]] symbols. Shading is nowadays difficult to achieve with a [[ballpoint pen]],  a [[stylus]] or finger input for smart phones or tablet computers.

The [[punctuation]] marks [[full stop]], [[semicolon]] and [[comma]] are not used because they look like some brief forms of very frequent German words in Aufbauschrift (speed script and speech script) and could be confused with these words. These punctuation marks are replaced by different space intervals between the sentences and phrases.

==Division of the system==
Stiefografie shorthand is written in three levels: Grundschrift (business script), Aufbauschrift I (speed script) and Aufbauschrift II (speech script).

''Grundschrift'' can be produced at a rate of 100 to 120 syllables per [[minute]]. There are only 24 characters for consonants and combinations of consonants (e.g. sch, sp, st). Contrary to the practice in many English shorthand systems (e.g. [[Pitman Shorthand]]), vowels are never omitted. There are no brief forms for the most frequent [[syllable]]s and words of the German language in this first level.

''Aufbauschrift I'' can be produced up to 160 syllables per minute. There are 54 brief forms for the most frequent words and syllables in the German language and rules for forming free abbreviations. These brief forms are distinguishable by size and position (three of them: above, below, or on the base line). Special endings and syllables can be omitted.
 
There are more than additional 120 brief forms in ''Aufbauschrift II'' to write up to about 400 syllables per minute. It is possible to omit special consonants, vowels and syllables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10804">The term '''Stoic categories''' refers to [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ideas regarding [[category of being|categories of being]]: the most fundamental classes of being for all things. The Stoics believed there were four categories (substance, quality, disposition, relative disposition) which were the ultimate divisions. Since we do not now possess even a single complete work by [[Zeno of Citium]], [[Cleanthes]] or [[Chrysippus]] what we do know must be pieced together from a number of sources: [[Doxography|doxographies]] and the works of other [[philosophers]] who discuss the Stoics for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The present information comes from [[Plotinus]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], with additional evidence from [[Plutarch|Plutarch of Chaeronea]] and [[Sextus Empiricus]]. According to both Plotinus and Simplicius there were four Stoic categories, to wit:

* [[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον [''hypokeímenon'' "underlying"])
** The primary matter, formless substance (''ousia'') which makes up things.
* [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν [''poión'' "like what"])
** The way in which matter is organized to form an individual object. In Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath) which informs the matter.
* "somehow disposed" (πὼς ἔχον [''pós échon''])
** Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture.
* "somehow disposed in relation to something" (πρός τί πως ἔχον [''prós tí pos échon''])
** Characteristics which are related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects.

A simple example of the Stoic categories in use is provided by Jacques Brunschwig:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a certain lump of matter, and thereby a substance, an existent something (and thus far that is all); I am a man, and this individual man that I am, and thereby qualified by a common quality and a peculiar one; I am sitting or standing, disposed in a certain way; I am the father of my children, the fellow citizen of my fellow citizens, disposed in a certain way in relation to something else.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Brunschwig (2003), ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'', ed. Brad Inwood, page 228, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
[[Stoicism]], like [[Aristotelianism]] is derived from [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Socrates|Socratic]] traditions.  The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) — though not all things (τινά) — are [[Matter|corporeal]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] bodies and [[Abstract object|abstract]] ones, but rejected [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teaching that purely [[incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras|Anaxagoras']] idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

In addition, the Stoics differed from Aristotle in their sharp distinction between concrete and abstract terms. Technically speaking all four Stoic categories are of concrete bodies. For Aristotle ''white, whiteness, heat'', and ''hot'' were qualities. For the Stoics, however, quality refers to ''white'', but not ''whiteness; hot'', but not ''heat.'' Furthermore, they believed that there are concrete bodies with no corresponding abstraction, something that makes no sense in Aristotelian terms.

It was apparent that the mere distinction between concrete substance and concrete quality was not a sufficient basis for [[logic]]. [[Socrates]] in the [[Hippias Major]] had pointed out problems in Anaxagoras' approach, explaining all attributes through their presence in a body in the way one body may be contained in another. In that [[dialog]], Hippias tried to explain [[beauty]] to Socrates. Socrates finds fault with his explanations, that beauty is a beautiful maiden, that beauty is gold, that beauty is health, wealth and a long life.

Aristotle solved the problem in proposing that accidental attributes are non-substantial beings that [[Inherence|inhere]] in substances. He defines this presence saying ''"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject."'' (''[[Categories (Aristotle)|The Categories]]'' 1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 24–26)

Such incorporeal presence caused problems to the Stoics in saying that the [[Ousia|οὐσία]] of a thing is its [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]. It is easy to understand the problem. If there is an insubstantial being, ''in Athens'' somehow present in Socrates, causing him to be substantially present in Athens we seem to be faced with an infinite regression, for there would seem to be an insubstantial Socrates in the insubstantial Athens in Socrates, in Athens, etc. Ultimately, who is to say who is the real Socrates and what is the real Athens? Similar arguments can be made of Aristotle's other categories. Was there an insubstantial ''running'' in [[Archimedes]] causing him to run naked through the streets of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], shouting out his immortal "''[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]''"? Was there an insubstantial fist in Athena causing her to strike Aphrodite as the [[Iliad]] recounts?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once Hera spoke, Athena dashed off in pursuit,&lt;br /&gt;
delighted in her heart. Charging Aphrodite, &lt;br /&gt;
she struck her in the chest with her powerful fist.[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/homer/iliad21.htm] 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was the effort to solve the problems raised by the [[Platonists]] and [[Peripatetics]] that led the Stoics to develop their categories, ''somehow disposed'' and ''somehow disposed in relation to something.'' The fact that Stoicism, rather than either Platonism or Aristotelianism became the prominent philosophy of the ancient world is due in part to the approach they took to the problem.

According to [[Stephen Menn]] the first two categories, substance and quality, were recognized by [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]. The fourth category ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' seems to have been developed by the time of [[Aristo of Chios|Aristo]]. The third category, ''somehow disposed'' is first seen in [[Chrysippus]].

The need for relative terms, seen in the fourth category ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' is more obvious than the need for the third category ''somehow disposed'' and so it seems to have arisen first.

Aristotle had used relative terms in a somewhat general way. ''"Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be of something else or related to something else, are explained by reference to that other thing."'' (''The Categories'' 6&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 37–38) Thus he says that ''knowledge'' and ''the thing known'' are relatives. One can certainly consider knowledge as something properly existing in its subject. Aristotle himself recognized a much different kind of relationship. ''"In respect of relation there is no proper change; for, without changing, a thing will be now greater and now less or equal, if that with which it is compared has changed in quantity."'' ([http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.14.xiv.html#95 ''Metaphysics'' 1088&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 33–35]) In the first case, a relative term can be said to be something ''in'' its subject. In the second case, it can not. Thus, the need for ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' to explain how one thing can be relative to another without the presence of anything corporeal in a subject.

According to Stephen Menn, the third category, ''somehow disposed'' probably was recognized first in relation to the virtues. According to Socrates, virtue was a sort of knowledge. The wise man will act virtuously, since he will see it as the right thing to do. But the ignorant man can not avoid vice. The Stoic position held that a sage will possess all the virtues in their fullness. Aristo had argued that there is really only one virtue differentiated as ''somehow disposed in relation to something.'' This seemed to be too much like the [[Megarian school of philosophy|Megarian]] position. Chrysippus thus came to see the virtues as distinct bodies, inseparable from each other ''somehow disposed'' in themselves and not in relation to something. Thus the need for the third category.

==Neoplatonic critique==
Plotinus criticized both Aristotle's Categories and those of the Stoics. His student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] however defended Aristotle's scheme. He justified this by arguing that they be interpreted strictly as expressions, rather than as metaphysical realities. The approach can be justified, at least in part, by Aristotle's own words in ''The Categories.'' [[Boethius]]' acceptance of Porphyry's interpretation led to their being accepted by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy.

The Stoic scheme did not fare as well. Plotinus wrote...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Besides, if they make life and soul no more than this "pneuma,"
what is the import of that repeated qualification of theirs "in a
certain state," their refuge when they are compelled to recognize some
acting principle apart from body? If not every pneuma is a soul, but
thousands of them soulless, and only the pneuma in this "certain
state" is soul, what follows? Either this "certain state," this
shaping or configuration of things, is a real being or it is nothing.

If it is nothing, only the pneuma exists, the "certain state"
being no more than a word; this leads imperatively to the assertion
that Matter alone exists, Soul and God mere words, the lowest alone
is.

If on the contrary this "configuration" is really existent-
something distinct from the underlie or Matter, something residing
in Matter but itself immaterial as not constructed out of Matter, then
it must be a Reason-Principle, incorporeal, a separate Nature.[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/plotinus]

The '''timeline of racial tension in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''' lists events in [[African-American]] history in Omaha.  These included racial violence, but also include many firsts as the African-American community built its institutions.  Omaha has been a major industrial city on the edge of what was a rural, agricultural state.  It has attracted a more diverse population than the rest of the state. Its issues were common to other major industrial cities of the early 20th century, as it was a  destination for 19th and 20th century [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, and internal white and African-American migrants from [[Southern United States|the South]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Many early 20th century conflicts arose out of labor struggles, postwar social tensions and economic problems, and hiring of later immigrants and black migrants as [[strikebreakers]] in the [[meatpacking]] and stockyard industries. Massive job losses starting in the 1960s with the restructuring of the railroad, stockyards and meatpacking industries contributed to economic and social problems for workers in the city.

== 1950 to 2000 ==

According to several prominent Omaha historians, [[racial discrimination]] was a significant issue in Omaha from the 1950s through the 2000s (decade). Analyzing [[race relations]] in Omaha during the period they commented, "1968 rivals 1919 as probably the worst year in the history of twentieth-century America from the standpoint of violence and internal tension."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Cotrell, Dalhstrom and Dalhstrom. (2007) ''Upstream Metropolis: An urban biography of Omaha and Council Bluffs.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 361.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 three days of rioting swept the [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|Near North Side]], and in 1970 a policeman was killed by a suitcase bomb while answering a disturbance call at a house in [[North Omaha]]. However, as the 1966 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary ''[[A Time for Burning]]'' and the 1970s books of [[Lois Mark Stalvey]] illustrated, the violence apparently served a purpose as lines of communication were opened between the "[[West Omaha]] matron and the black laborer."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Cotrell, Dalhstrom and Dalhstrom. (2007) p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verbal abuse''' ('''verbal attack''' or '''verbal assault''') is when a person forcefully criticizes, insults, or denounces someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=assault|work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=Fifth|year=2016|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Verbal+assault|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the [[self-concept]] of the other person and produce negative emotions.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;''The Verbally Abusive Relationship'', Patricia Evans. Adams Media Corp 1992, 1996, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal abuse is a maladaptive mechanism that anyone can display occasionally, such as during times of high stress or physical discomfort. For some people, it is a pattern of behaviors used intentionally to control or manipulate others or to get revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=How Verbal Self-Defense Works|first=Suzette Haden|last=Elgin|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/vsd1.htm|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In schools and in everyday life, a person may engage in verbal abuse—[[bullying]] (which often has a physical component)—to gain status as superior to the person targeted and to bond with others against the target. Generally, the bully knows no other way to connect emotionally with others.&lt;ref&gt;''Controlling People: How to Recognize, Understand, and Deal with People Who Try to Control You'', Patricia Evans  pg. 191. 2002 by Adams Media Corp&lt;/ref&gt;

In romantic relationships, the verbal abuser may be responding to the partner's "separateness", i.e., independent thoughts, views, desires, feelings, expressions (even of happiness) which the abuser views as a threat, irritant or attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Controlling People: How to Recognize, Understand, and Deal with People Who Try to Control You'', Patricia Evans, Adams Media Corp 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some people believe the abuser has low [[self-esteem]] and then so, attempts to place their victim in a similar position, i.e., to believe negative things about themselves.

Because of the abuser's need for dominance and unwillingness to accept their partner as an equal, the verbal abuser is compelled to negate the perceptions of the partner, about the abuse, which causes more psychological pain to the victim.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This is also known as [[gaslighting|gas-lighting]] or [[Jekyll and Hyde]]-like behavior, because the abuser keeps the target of abuse off-balance with their hot-and-cold unpredictable behavior. This confusion adds to the pain caused by psychological abuse and keeps the victim off-balance.&lt;ref&gt;name="Forword"&gt;''Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them'', Susan Foreword, Bantam,2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can experience verbal abuse. Typically, in romantic or family relationships, verbal abuse increases in intensity and frequency over time.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; After exposure to verbal abuse, victims may develop [[clinical depression]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The person targeted by verbal abuse over time may succumb to any stress-related illness. Verbal abuse creates emotional pain and mental anguish in its target.

Despite the fact that verbal abuse does not leave bruising, verbal abuse can be as detrimental to a person's health as physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;''Why Does He Do That?'', Lundy Bancroft. [[Berkley Books]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaakov Teitel''' ({{lang-he-n|יעקב טייטל}}, born November 1972) is an American-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] religious nationalist, convicted for killing two people in 2009. Teitel, who had immigrated to Israel in 2000, settling in a [[West Bank]] [[Israeli settlement|settlement]],&lt;ref name="ynet"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3798629,00.html |title=Settler suspected of multiple hate crimes |work=[[Ynetnews]] |date= 1 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1125063.html |title=Settler admits to murder, series of bomb attacks |work=[[Haaretz]] |first=Amos |last=Harel |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934103,00.html |title=Accused Jewish Terrorist Jack Teitel |date= 3 November 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Randy |last=James |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; confessed to planning and committing various acts of terrorism and hate crimes against [[Palestinians]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wingers]], missionary [[Christians]], and police officers across Israel. Teitel was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], which he is currently serving.

== Early life ==
Yaakov Teitel was born in 1972 in [[Florida]], United States, and moved to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], when he was a teenager. His father, Mark, was a retired [[dentist]] who had served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and his mother, Dianne, was a medical secretary - both of whom became [[Haredi Jews]] later in life. Commonly known as Jack, Teitel attended [[university]] and received a bachelor's degree in [[psychology]], and in the mid-1990s, he began making regular visits to Israel. He was arrested in August 1997 on suspicion of murdering a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[shepherd]], but was released, and the case was eventually closed due to lack of evidence. Teitel subsequently returned to the United States, where he took a computer course with [[Microsoft]], and began working as a computer technician.

== Emigration to Israel ==
In 1999, Teitel immigrated to Israel and moved to the settlement of [[Shvut Rachel]], becoming an Israeli citizen under the [[Law of Return]] in December 2000. The following year, his parents and sister also emigrated to Israel, and settled in [[Beitar Illit]], an [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews|Ultra-Orthodox]] city in the [[Gush Etzion]] settlement bloc. In 2002, Teitel met Rivka Pepperman, a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born dance teacher originally from [[Broughton Park]], [[Manchester]], whose family had moved to Israel in 1981. They married the following year, and had four children. Teitel was summoned by [[Israel Defense Forces]] for preliminary checks, but was exempted from [[conscription]] due to his advanced age, medical history, and familial state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Gili Cohen6 hours ago |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/who-is-suspected-jewish-terrorist-yaakov-teitel-1.4998 |title=Who Is Suspected Jewish Terrorist Yaakov Teitel? |publisher=Israel News Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/21868/jewish-terrorist-god-proud-me |title=Jewish 'terrorist': God is proud of me |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle Thejc.com |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitel was considered an outcast in the settlement due to his limited proficiency in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and reclusive behavior. He hardly left his home, and did not regularly participate in services at the local synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.5227288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/the-two-faces-of-accused-terrorist-jack-teitel/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrorist acts and arrest ==
Teitel was arrested in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Har Nof]] neighborhood on October 7, 2009, while posting [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s praising the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting]]. He attempted to throw away a bag he was carrying, but it was retrieved, and was found to contain two [[handguns]]. Teitel was then turned over to [[Shin Bet]] for interrogation, while special police units raided his home and the homes of his brother-in-law, parents, and mother-in-law. The search of his property revealed a cache of guns, parts used in [[explosive]] devices, pellets used to maximize the impact of explosives, [[binoculars]], and flyers containing [[anti-gay]] incitement. The explosives were all detonated safely by the police, and a search of his home two days later found a [[bomb]] buried in the backyard.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt;

Israeli police revealed that Teitel, acting alone, confessed to a string of terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. Teitel confessed to having carried out a [[Ze'ev Sternhell#Attack|pipe-bomb attack against Ze'ev Sternhell]], as well as the murders of a Palestinian taxi driver and a [[West Bank]] shepherd in 1997, a 2006 attempted bombing near the settlement of [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin|Eli]], three bombings against police targets and a [[Christian]] monastery in 2007, and sending a [[booby-trapped]] package that injured a teenage boy to the home of a [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jewish]] family in [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]].&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=2 November 2009 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1102/1224257903312.html |title=Israeli police arrest West Bank settler over Palestinian killings |first=Mark |last=Weiss |accessdate=2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[CBN News]] |date=6 November 2009 |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2009/November/Suspect-Arrest-Announced-in-Ami-Ortiz-Case/ |title=Suspect Arrest Announced in Ami Ortiz Case |first=Chris |last=Mitchell |accessdate=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Haaretz |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1125062.html |title=Who is suspected Jewish terrorist Yaakov Teitel? |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Teitel's confession, his [[DNA]] was found to match DNA retrieved from Sternhell's home after the bombing attack.&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt; Teitel also confessed that he had planned to fly a remote-controlled toy plane containing explosives into the [[Tel Aviv]] gay pride parade, and that he planned a bombing against a [[Jerusalem]] gay bar. He also admitted that he planned to fire an improvised [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] against the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], but abandoned the plan over fear of injuring Jewish worshippers on the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=164915 |title=Leaks are prejudicing course of justice, complains Ya'acov Teitel's new attorney |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitel was also suspected of murdering two police officers in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], and confessed to the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting|gay centre shooting]] in Tel Aviv in 2009, though police stated that they were certain he was not involved in either.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257417385328&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Police clear Yosef Espinoza, suspected Teitel accomplice |first=Ben |last=Hartman |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date= 5 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discoveries, Teitel was held by Shin Bet in special custody for 48 hours, without being allowed to see an [[Lawyer|attorney]] or brought before a judge. The [[Petah Tikva]] District Court denied appeals from his attorney to meet with him, and subsequently extended both his remand and the special ordnance banning him from meeting his lawyer. All of Teitel's [[arraignment]]s were held behind closed doors, and a [[gag order]] was imposed on the case.&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt;

On 10 November 2009, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office declared that Teitel would be charged for the murder of the two Palestinians, incitement to racism, deploying explosive devices, and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1127200.html |title=Alleged Jewish terrorist to be charged with murdering two Palestinians |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |work=Haaretz |date= 10 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teitel's legal defense was provided by ''Honenu'', an organization which provides legal defense for Israelis accused of crimes against Arabs or the Israeli security forces. Honenu founder Shmuel Meidad suggested that Teitel may be [[Insanity|mentally unstable]], stating that, "It's my impression that this man is sick, but he's not nearly as sick as the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455202910&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Teitel's defense provided by 'Honenu' |first=Ben |last=Hartman |work=The Jerusalem Post |date= 7 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 2010, Jerusalem's district [[psychiatrist]] ruled Teitel unfit to stand trial. The evaluation was criticized by [[Israeli-Arab]] [[Knesset]] members, with [[Ahmad Tibi]] stating, "An Arab who shoots a Jew in Israel is a terrorist, but a Jew who shoots Arabs is insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jewish-terror-suspect-unfit-to-stand-trial-1.288172 |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |title=Jewish terror suspect 'unfit to stand trial' |work=Haaretz |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a new psychiatric evaluation, the district court overturned the previous ruling, and declared Teitel fit for trial, on 30 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3946310,00.html |first=Aviad |last=Glickman |title=Teitel deemed fit to stand trial |work=Ynetnews |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction ==

In February 2012, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office and Teitel's attorneys reached an agreement under which he would confess to two counts of murder. Teitel's attorneys confessed on his behalf, as Teitel himself announced that did not recognize the court's jurisdiction.
