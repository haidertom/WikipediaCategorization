'''''4′33″''''' (pronounced "'''Four minutes, thirty-three seconds'''" or just "'''Four thirty-three'''")&lt;ref name="Solomon 1998/2002"&gt;Solomon 1998/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; is a three-[[movement (music)|movement]] composition&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Pritchett, Kuhn, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 69–71,&amp;nbsp;86,&amp;nbsp;105,&amp;nbsp;198,&amp;nbsp;218,&amp;nbsp;231.&lt;/ref&gt; by American [[Experimental music|experimental]] composer [[John Cage]] (1912–1992). It was composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. The piece consists of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed,&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is commonly perceived as "four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Fetterman 1996, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard 2003, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the piece refers to the total length in minutes and seconds of a given performance, ''4′33″'' being the total length of the first public performance.&lt;ref&gt;Published score, Edition Peters 6777.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived around 1947–48, while the composer was working on ''[[Sonatas and Interludes]]'',&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; ''4′33″'' became for Cage the epitome of his idea that any sounds may constitute [[Definition of music|music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.classicalnotes.net/columns/silence.html| title = John Cage and the Avant-Garde: The Sounds of Silence| accessdate = April 4, 2007| last = Gutmann| first = Peter| authorlink = Peter Gutmann (journalist)| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a reflection of the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]], which Cage studied since the late 1940s. In a 1982 interview, and on numerous other occasions, Cage stated that ''4′33″'' was, in his opinion, his most important work.&lt;ref name="Kostelanetz 2003, 70"&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' describes ''4′33″'' as Cage's "most famous and controversial creation".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

==History of composition==

===Background and influences===
Silence played a major role in several of Cage's works composed before ''4′33″''. The ''Duet for Two Flutes'' (1934), composed when Cage was 22, opens with silence, and silence was an important structural element in some of the ''[[Sonatas and Interludes]]'' (1946–48), ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951) and ''Two Pastorales'' (1951). The ''Concerto for prepared piano and orchestra'' (1951) closes with an extended silence, and ''Waiting'' (1952), a piano piece composed just a few months before ''4′33″'', consists of long silences framing a single, short [[ostinato]] pattern. Furthermore, in his songs ''[[The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs]]'' (1942) and ''[[A Flower]]'' (1950) Cage directs the pianist to play a closed instrument, which may be understood as a metaphor of silence.&lt;ref&gt;Revill 1993, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time Cage mentioned the idea of a piece composed entirely of silence was during a 1947 (or 1948) lecture at [[Vassar College]], ''A Composer's Confessions''. Cage told the audience that he had "several new desires", one of which was
&lt;blockquote&gt;to compose a piece of uninterrupted silence and sell it to [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak Co]]. It will be three or four-and-a-half minutes long—those being the standard lengths of "canned" music and its title will be ''Silent Prayer''. It will open with a single idea which I will attempt to make as seductive as the color and shape and fragrance of a flower. The ending will approach imperceptibility.&lt;ref name="pritchett"&gt;Pritchett 1993, 59, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the time, however, Cage felt that such a piece would be "incomprehensible in the Western context," and was reluctant to write it down: "I didn't wish it to appear, even to me, as something easy to do or as a joke. I wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it."&lt;ref name="Revill 1993, 164"&gt;Revill 1993, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Alfred Leslie]] recalls Cage presenting a "one-minute-of-silence talk" in front of a window during the late 1940s, while visiting Studio 35 at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Stein, Judith |year=2009 |title=Interview: Alfred Leslie |magazine=[[Art in America]] |issue=January 2009 |page=92 |url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-alfred-leslie/ |access-date=October 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204172036/http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/interview-alfred-leslie/ |archive-date=December 4, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Cage visited the [[anechoic chamber]] at [[Harvard University]]. An anechoic chamber is a room designed in such a way that the walls, ceiling and floor absorb all sounds made in the room, rather than reflecting them as echoes. Such a chamber is also externally sound-proofed. Cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence, but he wrote later, "I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my [[nervous system]] in operation, the low one my blood in [[circulatory system|circulation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/artist/journal2.html |title=A few notes about silence and John Cage |date=November 24, 2004 |publisher=CBC.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212191730/http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/artist/journal2.html |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence, and yet heard sound. "Until I die there will be sounds. And they will continue following my death. One need not fear about the future of music."&lt;ref&gt;Cage 1961, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The realization as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of ''4′33″''.

Another cited influence&lt;ref name="Revill 1993, 164" /&gt; for this piece came from the field of the visual arts. Cage's friend and sometimes colleague [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had produced, in 1951, a series of white paintings, seemingly "blank" canvases (though painted with white house paint) that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung, the shadows of people in the room and so on. This inspired Cage to use a similar idea, as he later stated, "Actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of Robert Rauschenberg. His white paintings [...] when I saw those, I said, 'Oh yes, I must. Otherwise I'm lagging, otherwise music is lagging'."&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz 2003, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to an article called On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Works, John Cage writes "To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings came first; my silent piece came later."&lt;ref&gt;Cage, John. Silence: Lectures and Writings. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors===
Compositions that, like ''4′33″'', include no sounds produced by the performer, were conceived by a number of composers and writers before Cage. Examples include the following:
* [[Alphonse Allais]]'s 1897 ''Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man'', consisting of twenty-four blank measures.&lt;ref&gt;Allais, Alphonse. 1897. ''[[Album primo-avrilesque]]'', p. 23-26. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86263801/f29.image Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Allais was an associate of [[Erik Satie]], and given Cage's profound admiration for Satie, it is possible that Cage was inspired by the ''Funeral March''. When asked, Cage claimed he was unaware of Allais's composition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson 1991, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1903 novel ''La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet'', silent concerts are given by the Talpa people.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Gaston. 1903. ''La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet''. [http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/pdf/leroux_double_vie_t_longuet.pdf Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s 1919 "In futurum", a movement from the ''Fünf Pittoresken'' for piano. The Czech composer's meticulously notated composition is made up entirely of rests.&lt;ref&gt;Bek, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Harold Acton]]'s 1928 book ''Cornelian'' a musician conducts "performances consisting largely of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Humphrey. 1990. ''The Brideshead Generation: Evelyn Waugh and His Friends'', 153. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-44142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1947, jazz musician [[Dave Tough]] joked that he was writing a play in which "A string quartet is playing the most advanced music ever written. It's made up entirely of rests. [...] Suddenly, the viola man jumps up in a rage and shakes his bow at the first violin. 'Lout,' he screams, 'you played that last measure wrong.'"&lt;ref&gt;"New Jazz: 'All or Nothing at All'" (March 16, 1947) ''The Washington Post''. p. S7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yves Klein]]'s 1949 ''Monotone-Silence Symphony'' (informally ''The Monotone Symphony'', conceived 1947–48), an orchestral forty-minute piece whose second and last movement is a twenty-minute silence&lt;ref&gt;See sources and recordings at the [[Yves Klein]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; (the first movement being an unvarying twenty minute drone).
{{further|List of silent musical compositions}}
The musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has argued that ''4′33″'' is an example of [[Automatic behavior|automatism]].  Since the [[Romantic Era]] composers have been striving to produce music that could be separated from any social connections, transcending the boundaries of time and space. In automatism, composers wish to completely remove both the composers and the artist from the process of creation. This is motivated by the belief that what we think of as "self-expression" is really just an infusion of the art with the social standards that we have been subjected to since birth. Therefore, the only way to achieve truth is to remove the artist from the process of creation. Cage achieves that by employing chance (e.g., use of the ''[[I Ching]]'', or tossing coins) to make compositional decisions. In ''4′33″'', neither artist nor composer has any impact on the piece, so that Cage has no way of controlling what ambient sounds will be heard by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin 2009, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" | They missed the point. There's no such thing as silence. What they thought was silence, because they didn't know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.

|}
The premiere of the three-movement ''4′33″'' was given by [[David Tudor]] on August 29, 1952, in [[Maverick Concert Hall]], [[Woodstock, New York]], as part of a recital of contemporary piano music. The audience saw him sit at the piano and, to mark the beginning of the piece, close the keyboard lid. Some time later he opened it briefly, to mark the end of the first movement. This process was repeated for the second and third movements.&lt;ref&gt;The actions of Tudor in the first performance are often misdescribed so that the lid is explained as being open during the movements. Cage's handwritten score (produced after the first performance) states that the lid was closed during the movements, and opened to mark the spaces between.&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece remains controversial to this day, and is seen as challenging the very [[definition of music]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In defining [[noise music]] and its value, Paul Hegarty in ''Noise/Music: A History'' (2007) contends that Cage's ''4′33″'' represents the beginning of [[noise music]] proper. For Hegarty, noise music, as with ''4′33″'', is that music made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between "desirable" sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable "noise" that make up all noise music.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hegarty, ''Noise/Music: A History'' (2007) Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

''4′33″'' challenges, or rather exploits to a radical extent, the social regiments of the modern concert life etiquette, experimenting on unsuspecting concert-goers to prove an important point. First, the choice of a prestigious venue and the social status of the composer and the performers automatically heightens audience's expectations for the piece. As a result, the listener is more focused, giving Cage's ''4′33″'' the same amount of attention (or perhaps even more) as if it were Beethoven's Ninth.&lt;ref name="Taruskin 2009, 71"&gt;Taruskin 2009, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even before the performance, the reception of the work is already predetermined by the social setup of the concert. Furthermore, the audience's behavior is limited by the rules and regulation of the concert hall; they will quietly sit and listen to 4′33” of ambient noise. It is not easy to get a large group of people to listen to ambient noise for nearly five minutes, unless they are regulated by the concert hall etiquette.

The second point made by ''4′33″'' concerns duration. According to Cage, duration is the essential building block of all of music. This distinction is motivated by the fact that duration is the only element shared by both silence and sound. As a result, the underlying structure of any musical piece consists of an organized sequence of "time buckets".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin 2009, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; They could be filled with either sounds, silence or noise; where neither of these elements is absolutely necessary for completeness. In the spirit of his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], Cage managed to emancipate the silence and the noise to make it an acceptable or perhaps even integral part of his music composition. ''4′33″'' serves as a radical and extreme illustration of this concept, asking that if the time buckets are the only necessary parts of the musical composition, then what stops the composer from filling them with no intentional sounds?

The third point is that the work of music is defined not only by its content but also by the behavior it elicits from the audience.&lt;ref name="Taruskin 2009, 71" /&gt; In the case of Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring|Rite of Spring]]'', this would consist of widespread dissatisfaction leading up to violent riots. In Cage's ''4′33″'', the audience felt cheated by having to listen to no composed sounds from the performer. Nevertheless, in ''4′33″'' the audience contributed the bulk of the musical material of the piece. Since the piece consists of exclusively ambient noise, the audience's behavior, their whispers and movements, are essential elements that fill the above-mentioned time buckets.

In a 2013 [[TED Talk]], philosophy professor Julian Dodd argues that ''4′33″'' is witty [[conceptual art]], but does not meet the criteria for it to count as music, instead challenging the listener to question what the nature of music is.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=WTCVnKROlos&amp;t=13m38s|title=Is John Cage's 4′33″ music? Prof. Julian Dodd at TEDxUniversityOfManchester}}, June 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 TED Talk, psychologist Paul Bloom puts forward ''4′33″'' as one example to show that knowing about the origin of something influences our opinion about it as "that silence is different from other forms of silence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure?language=en#|title=Paul Bloom: The origins of pleasure - Talk Video - TED.com|author =Paul Bloom|work=ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions of the score===
Several versions of the score exist:&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph summarizes some of the findings from Solomon 1998/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four known later versions, one of which is in the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;Carol Vogel (November 15, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/arts/design/a-glenn-ligon-at-national-gallery-john-cage-at-moma.html A Moment of Silence at MoMA] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The original Woodstock manuscript (August 1952): conventional notation, dedicated to [[David Tudor]]. This manuscript is currently lost. Tudor's attempt at re-creating the original score is reproduced in Fetterman 1996, 74.
* The Kremen manuscript (1953): graphic, space-time notation, dedicated to [[Irwin Kremen]]. The movements of the piece are rendered as space between long vertical lines; a tempo indication is provided (60), and at the end of each movement the time is indicated in minutes and seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Fetterman 1996, 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Edition Peters No. 6777a. Kremen was given the score by Cage on June 5, 1953, for his 28th birthday. The score was later purchased for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] by [[Henry R. Kravis]] in honor of his wife, [[Marie-Josée Drouin]], the museum's president.&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;
* The so-called ''First Tacet Edition'': a typewritten score, lists the three movements using Roman numbers, with the word "[[Tacet|TACET]]" underneath each. A note by Cage describes the first performance and mentions that "the work may be performed by any instrumentalist or combination of instrumentalists and last any length of time." Edition Peters No. 6777 (out of print).
* The so-called ''Second Tacet Edition'': same as the First, except that it is printed in Cage's calligraphy, and the explanatory note mentions the Kremen manuscript. Edition Peters No. 6777 (i.e., it carries the same catalog number as the first ''Tacet Edition'') Additionally, a facsimile, reduced in size, of the Kremen manuscript, appeared in July 1967 in ''Source'' 1, no. 2:46–54; the ''First Tacet Edition'' is described in Nyman 1974, 3, but it is not reproduced in that book.

There is some discrepancy between the lengths of individual movements of the premiere performance, specified in different versions of the score. The Woodstock printed program specifies the lengths 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″, as does the Kremen manuscript, and presumably the original manuscript had the same indications. However, in the ''First Tacet Edition'' Cage writes that at the premiere the timings were 33″, 2′40″ and 1′20″. In the ''Second Tacet Edition'' he adds that after the premier a copy has been made for Irwin Kremen, in which the lengths of the movements were 30″, 2′23″ and 1′40″. The causes of this discrepancy are not currently understood, the original manuscript being still lost.&lt;ref name="Solomon 1998/2002" /&gt;

===''4′33″ No. 2''===
In 1962, Cage wrote '''''0′00″''''', which is also referred to as '''''4′33″ No. 2'''''. The directions originally consisted of one sentence: "In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action." At the first performance Cage had to write that sentence.

The second performance added four new qualifications to the directions: "the performer should allow any interruptions of the action, the action should fulfill an obligation to others, the same action should not be used in more than one performance, and should not be the performance of a musical composition."&lt;ref name="pritchett" /&gt;

===''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''===
In late 1989, three years before his death, Cage revisited the idea of ''4′33″'' one last time. He composed ''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'', the full title of which is ''One&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4′33″ (0′00″) + [[Image:GClef.svg|9px]]''. As in all [[Number Pieces|number pieces]], "One" refers to the number of performers required. The score instructs the performer to build a [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] in the concert hall, so that "the whole hall is on the edge of [[Audio feedback|feedback]], without actually feeding back." The content of the piece is the electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://johncage.org/pp/John-Cage-Work-Detail.cfm?work_ID=299 |title= One3 = 4'33" (0'0") + [G clef] |website= John Cage |access-date= 25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and recordings==
''4′33″'' has been recorded on several occasions: [[Frank Zappa]] recorded it as part of ''A Chance Operation: The John Cage Tribute'', on the Koch label, 1993; in 2002, [[James Tenney]] performed ''4′33″'' at Rudolf Schindler's historic [[Kings Road House]] in celebration of the work's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney's recording is archived on line via The Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound (SASSAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several performances of ''4′33″'' including a "techno remix" by [[New Waver]] were broadcast on Australian radio station [[ABC Classic FM]], as part of a program exploring "sonic responses" to Cage's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s376971.htm|title=ABC Classic FM music details for 11 July 2001|access-date=January 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425183449/http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s376971.htm|archive-date=April 25, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kouvaras|first=Linda|title=Loading the Silence: Australian Sound Art in the Post-Digital Age|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham|isbn=9781409441564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish electronic band [[Covenant (band)|Covenant]] concluded their 2000 album ''[[United States of Mind (album)|United States of Mind]]'' with a rendition of ''4′33″'' entitled "You Can Make Your Own Music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Alexander S.|date=2013|title=Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=43|isbn=9780199339624|quote=Industrial trio Covenant conclude their 2000 album ''United States of Mind'' with four minutes and thirty-three soundless seconds (on a track called "You Can Make Your Own Music"), nodding slyly to composer John Cage, whose silent ''4’33”'' of 1952 may be the ultimate open question of what constitutes music; but the other ten songs on Covenant's album are more or less all pop tunes with scarcely a trace of Cage's vital indeterminacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2004, at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London, the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] gave the UK's first orchestral performance of this work. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and one of the main challenges was that the station's emergency backup systems are designed to switch on and play music whenever apparent silence ([[dead air]]) lasting longer than a preset duration is detected. They had to be switched off for this performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/01_january/12/john_cage.shtml|title=BBC Press Office, Cage Uncaged|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tongue-in-cheek]] version was recorded by the staff of the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper on January 16, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jan/16/1?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Guardian recording of 4′33|date=January 16, 2004 | location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the work was voted to be number 40 in the ABC radio's [[Classic 100 piano (ABC)|Classic 100 piano countdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Classic 100 Piano |url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/classic100/piano.htm |publisher=[[ABC Classic FM]] |accessdate=25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A silence of four minutes and thirty-three seconds appears as the penultimate track of the 2009 [[Living Colour]] album [[The Chair in the Doorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Colour –  The Chair In The Doorway|url=https://www.discogs.com/Living-Colour-The-Chair-In-The-Doorway/master/236886 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2010, an international simultaneous performance of Cage's ''4′33″'' took place involving over 200 performers, amateur and professional musicians, and artists. The global orchestra, conducted live by Bob Dickinson, former member of post-punk group [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], via video link, performed the piece in support of the Cage Against The Machine campaign to bring ''4′33″'' to Christmas number 1 in 2010. A second performance took place on December 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We're pitching the silence of John Cage against the noise of Simon Cowell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8195729/Were-pitching-the-silence-of-John-Cage-against-the-noise-of-Simon-Cowell.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010|location=London|first=Norman|last=Lebrecht|authorlink=Norman Lebrecht| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110121140124/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/turner-prize/8195729/Were-pitching-the-silence-of-John-Cage-against-the-noise-of-Simon-Cowell.html| archivedate= January 21, 2011  | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 UK Christmas Number One campaign==
In the week leading up to Christmas 2010, a [[Facebook page]] was created to encourage people in the UK to buy a new rendition of ''4′33″'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/cageagainstthemachine|title=John Cage's ''4′33"'' for Christmas Number One 2010 |publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=October 28, 2010 |date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that it would prevent the winner of the [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|seventh series of ''The X Factor'']] from topping the [[UK Singles Chart]] and achieving the [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas number one]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowell’s second festive humiliation?|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|url=http://new.uk.music.yahoo.com/blogs/behind_the_music/27330/cowells-second-festive-humiliation/|publisher=[[Yahoo!

The '''Ain Sakhri Lovers''' figurine is a sculpture that was found in one of the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves near [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110811115432/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/p/phallic_figurine.aspx|title=British Museum - Ain Sakhri lovers figurine|date=2011-08-11|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is considered to be 11,000 years old and to be the oldest known representation of two people engaged in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=ahotw&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/vNEwNR8rSzGPSwSn3yeJwA A History of the World -7], BBC.co.uk, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The sculpture was identified in 1933 by {{ill|René Neuville|fr||de|}}, a French [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|consul]] in [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Neuville represented the French Republic as vice-consul at Jerusalem from 1928 to 1937 and as consul-general from 1946 to 1952; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;ots=FUqickvmd0&amp;dq=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;f=false footnote on page 301 of ''Les Mandats Francais Et Anglais Dans Une Perspective'' (in French)]; he is known for his work with [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids]] in the [[Levant]].&lt;/ref&gt; and prehistorian, when looking through random finds obtained by the French Fathers at [[Bethlehem]]. He found the stone whilst visiting a small museum with [[Henri Breuil|Abbé Breuil]].&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Neuville immediately identified it as important and was able to get an introduction to the [[Bedouin]] who had made the finds at Wadi Khareitoun. He was led to a location within the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves and it is from these caves that the sculpture gets its name. Excavations of the caves revealed that the cave had been used domestically thousands of years ago and the finds were [[Natufian]]. For this reason it is thought that the figurine was used domestically and had not been left there as part of a funeral.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The person who made the sculpture came from the [[Natufians]], an early [[Epipaleolithic]] culture whose members are thought to be the first humans to gather grass seeds that remained attached to their stems.&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; This is an important step in agriculture as it eventually allowed farmers to choose which seeds to eat and which to keep to sow the following season.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; These people hunted gazelle and are the first known to domesticate dogs,&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock1995"&gt;{{Citation |title=The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people |last=Clutton-Brock |first=Juliet |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Serpell, James |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-41529-2 |pages= |chapter=Origins of the dog: domestication and early history }}&lt;/ref&gt; sheep, and goats which also involves [[selective breeding]]. It has been speculated that the stability of having a managed food programme allowed the Natufians to create large communities of two to three hundred people and to create [[art]].&lt;ref name=trans&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00q2p68 A History of the World in 100 objects - Part 7], BBC Radio 4, 26 January 2010, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode7/ transcript], accessed 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The sculpture was made by carving a single "[[calcite]] cobble" which was picked away with a stone point to identify the position of the couple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although it lacks details, such as faces, it is considered to be a clever piece of sculpture. Artist [[Marc Quinn]] has noted that the figure looks different depending on the viewer's perspective, and may resemble a couple, a penis, breasts, or a vagina depending on this perspective,&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; or two testicles when viewed upside-down, from the bottom. Quinn compared it to a modern pornographic film where the action may include close-ups and long shots. It is clear that the figures in the couple are facing each other, but the gender of the figures can only be presumed.&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt;

==Importance and purchase==
After the death of René Neuville in 1952, it was purchased by the [[British Museum]] at Sotheby's in 1958 from M. Y. Neuville.&lt;ref name=bmdb&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1358965&amp;partid=1 figurine], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The object formed the basis of an episode of ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', a BBC radio programme in January 2010 about the dawn of agriculture.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The '''Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers''', a 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit organization]] established in 1994, identifies teenagers with exceptional creative talent and brings their remarkable work to a national audience through the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Alliance partners with nearly 100 Regional Affiliates across the country to provide creative teens with opportunities for recognition, exhibition, publication, and scholarships.

==Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards==
The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards provide scholarships for teenagers in the United States. The Awards program was created in 1923 by Maurice R. "Robbie" Robinson, founder of [[Scholastic Corporation]], and has been administered by the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers since 1994. Its past award recipients include [[Andy Warhol]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[wikipedia:Hughie_Lee-Smith|Hughie Lee-Smith]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[wikipedia:Charles_Wilbert_White|Charles White]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Stephen King]], [[John Updike]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Lena Dunham]], [[Paul Chan (artist)|Paul Chan]], [[Kay WalkingStick]], [[Zac Posen]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] among many others.

Established to ensure that literary and artistic talent were recognized in schools and communities across the country, the program began as a small writing contest; today, it offers recognition in 29 categories including architecture, sculpture, painting, photography, poetry, dramatic script, fashion, animation, and video games. The Awards are open to all students in grades 7&amp;ndash;12 from public, private, and home schools throughout the U.S. (and its territories), as well as American-run schools abroad and community programs serving eligible student populations.

==National Student Poets Program==
The program links the National Student Poets with audiences and neighborhood resources such as museums and libraries, and other community-anchor institutions and builds upon the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers' long-standing work with educators and creative teens through the prestigious Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Poets’ appointment events are hosted in cooperation with the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C., and held in conjunction with the [[National Book Festival]].

==Jurors==
The selection panels for both regional and national levels of the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards are composed of artists&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/teen-beat-2|title=Tean beat|last=Allen|first=Emma|date=March 24, 2014|website=The New Yorker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, writers, curators, critics, educators, and professionals from the nation’s leading creative industries&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;, some of whom are alums of the Scholastic Awards.

An '''anti-copyright notice''' is a specific statement that is added to a work in order to encourage wide distribution. Such notices are legally required to host such specific media; under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in [[International copyright agreements|international copyright law]], works are protected even if no [[copyright]] statement is attached to them. However, "[[anti-copyright]]" statements typically do not take the form of either sophisticated [[public copyright licenses]] or a simple dedication to the [[public domain]]; instead, they usually just encourage wide distribution.  Depending on jurisdiction, it is possible to denounce all claims to copyright in a work including [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] in a written disclaimer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An example of an anti-copyright notice is the following: "Anti-Copyright! Reprint freely, in ''any'' manner desired, even without naming the source." Where such notices are attached depends highly on the type of work. They are often found in [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]] magazines and books.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A copyright [[waiver]] might{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} state the following:

{{quote|The author of this work hereby waives all claim of copyright (economic and moral) in this work and '''immediately''' places it in the public domain; it may be used, distorted or destroyed in any manner whatsoever without further attribution or notice to the creator.}}

The [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]] was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with also law domains (e.g. [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[continental Europe]]) which have problems with the concept of ''dedicating into public domain'', as waiver statement with a fallback all-[[permissive license]].&lt;ref&gt;https://creativecommons.org/weblog/2009/03/11/13304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC0"&gt;[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unlicense]], published around 2010, has a focus on an [[anti-copyright]] message.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license The unlicense a license for no license] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324154539/http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |date=2016-03-24 }} on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Woody Guthrie]] used an anti-copyright notice on his songs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don’t give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that’s all we wanted to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4101], quoting from "Woody Guthrie: A Life."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, a number of organisations claim copyright of Guthrie's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Publisher_Contact.htm |title=Woody Guthrie Songs Publisher Contact |publisher=Woodyguthrie.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} would regard "anti-copyright" notices as being equivalent to a dedication of material into the [[public domain]] (as in the second example above).  Some of these disclaimers, however, are less accurate and need to be interpreted individually as the term anti-copyright has no accepted legal meaning.  For example, if just free distribution is encouraged, modification or lack of attribution is still illegal, making the material ineligible for collaborative writing projects like [[English Wikipedia]].  In such a case anti-copyright is not a true denial of copyright, but just a modification of the protection it affords copyright holders.

[[File:ArtBattleNC2012.jpg|thumb|Yared Nigussu shows his winning painting after an Art Battle]]
'''Art Battles''' are live competitive painting events that take place in cities across Canada.  Currently there are events in
Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Kamloops, and Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/living/home-decorating/culture-fix-exciting-monthly-painting-competition/ |title=Culture fix: Exciting monthly painting competition |work=[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]] |publisher=Rogers Communications. |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-12-15 |first=Alex |last=Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Pemberton and Simon Plashkes started Art Battle in Toronto in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grainger |first=Lia |url=http://metronews.ca/voices/urban-compass-toronto/10981/theres-no-easel-way-out-in-art-battle/ |title=There's no easel way out in art battle |work=[[Metro News]] |publisher=Free Daily News Group Inc. |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622195443/http://metronews.ca/voices/urban-compass-toronto/10981/theres-no-easel-way-out-in-art-battle/ |archivedate=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then there has been an event at The Great Hall on [[Queen Street West]] every month.

Several artists are given 20 minutes to create a painting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/living/article/873561--brush-with-greatness&lt;/ref&gt; Each audience member gets to vote on the painting they like the most by placing a ballot for that round (given at the door) in that artist's collection box.  There are 2 or 3 preliminary rounds in which the most popular artists move on to the final round.  The artist who gets the most ballots in the final round is declared the winner.  All the paintings are then auctioned off to the audience members.  Any painting that doesn't reach its minimum bid is destroyed with a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=3038846 |title=Art Battle brings a paint brawl to the walls of Queen West in Toronto |last=Grainger |first=Lia |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc |work=[[National Post]] |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian art''' is any [[art]] made in or about [[Australia]], or by Australians overseas, from [[Prehistory of Australia|prehistoric]] times to the present. This includes [[Indigenous Australian art|Aboriginal]], Colonial, [[Landscape]], [[Atelier Method|Atelier]], early-twentieth-century painters, print makers, photographers, and sculptors influenced by European modernism, [[Contemporary art]]. The visual arts have a long history in Australia, with evidence of Aboriginal art dating back at least 30,000 years. Australia has produced many notable artists of both [[Western art|Western]] and [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] schools, including the late-19th-century [[Heidelberg School]] plein air painters, the [[Antipodeans]], the Central Australian [[Hermannsburg School]] watercolourists, the [[Western Desert Art Movement]] and coeval examples of well-known [[High modernism]] and [[Postmodern art]].

[[File:William BARAK - Wurundjeri people - Corroboree - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|William Barak, ''Corroboree'', 1895]]
[[William Barak]] (c.1824-1903) was one of the last traditionally educated of the [[Wurundjeri]]-willam, people who come from the district now incorporating the city of Melbourne. He remains notable for his artworks which recorded traditional Aboriginal ways for the education of Westerners (which remain on permanent exhibition at the [[Ian Potter Centre]] of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and at the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]]). [[Margaret Preston]] (1875–1963) was among the early non-indigenous painters to incorporate Aboriginal influences in her works. [[Albert Namatjira]] (1902–1959) is a famous Australian artist and an [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] man. His landscapes inspired the [[Hermannsburg School]] of art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hermannsburgschool.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Elizabeth Durack]] are notable for their fusion of Western and indigenous influences. Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints - with styles such as the [[Western Desert Art Movement]] becoming globally renowned 20th-century art movements.

The [[National Gallery of Australia]] exhibits a great many indigenous art works, including those of the [[Torres Strait Islands]]  who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/ATSIArt/Index.cfm nga.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] has an extensive collection of indigenous Australian art. [http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/galleries/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander/] In May 2011, the Director of the Place, Evolution, and Rock Art Heritage Unit (PERAHU) at [[Griffith University]], [[Paul Taçon]], called for the creation of a national database for rock art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities/research/protect-australias-spirit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117223527/http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities/research/protect-australias-spirit |archivedate=17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Taçon]] launched the "Protect Australia’s Spirit" campaign in May 2011 with the highly regarded Australian actor [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJCcAElSYaU] Protect Australia's Spirit Interview with Prof. Paul Tacon and Jack Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign aims to create the very first fully resourced national archive to bring together information about rock art sites, as well as planning for future rock art management and conservation. The National Rock Art Institute would bring together existing rock art expertise from [[Griffith University]], [[Australian National University]], and the [[University of Western Australia]] if they were funded by philanthropists, big business and government. [[Rock Art Research]] is published twice a year and also covers international scholarship of rock art.

===Colonial era===
Early Western art in Australia, from 1788 onwards, is often narrated as the gradual shift from a European sense of light to an Australian one. The lighting in Australia is notably different from that of Europe, and early attempts at landscapes attempted to reflect this. It has also been one of transformation, where artistic ideas originating from beyond (primarily Europe) gained new meaning and purpose when transplanted into the new continent and the emerging society.&lt;ref name="Christopher Allen 1997"&gt;Art in Australia: From Colonization to Postmodernism. Christopher Allen (1997). Thames and Hudson, World of Art series.&lt;/ref&gt;

====British exploration and settlement (1770–1850)====
[[File:The Kongouro from New Holland (Kangaroo) NMM ZBA5754 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[George Stubbs]], ''[[The Kongouro from New Holland]]'', 1772]]
The first artistic representations of the Australia scene by European artists were mainly [[natural history]] illustrations, depicting the distinctive flora and fauna of the land for scientific purposes, and the topography of the coast. [[Sydney Parkinson]], the [[Botanical illustrator]] on [[James Cook]]'s 1770 voyage that first charted the eastern coastline of Australia, made a large number of such drawings under the direction of naturalist [[Joseph Banks]]. Many of these drawings were met with skepticism when taken back to Europe, for example claims that the [[platypus]] was a hoax. In the form of copies and reproductions, [[George Stubbs]]' 1772 paintings ''[[Portrait of a Large Dog]]'' and ''[[The Kongouro from New Holland]]''—depicting a dingo and kangaroo respectively—were the first images of Australian fauna to be widely disseminated in Britain.

Despite Banks' suggestions, no professional natural-history artist sailed on the [[First Fleet]] in 1788. Until the turn of the century all drawings made in the colony were crafted by soldiers, including British naval officers [[George Raper]] and [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]], and convict artists, including [[Thomas Watling]].&lt;ref name="James Gleeson 1971"&gt;James Gleeson, Australian Painting. Edited by John Henshaw. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these drawings are by unknown artists, most notably the [[Port Jackson Painter]]. Most are in the style of naval draughtsmanship, and cover natural history topics, specifically birds, and a few depict the infant colony itself.

[[File:John Glover - A view of the artist's house and garden, in Mills Plains, Van Diemen's Land - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|John Glover, ''A View of the Artist's House and Garden'', 1835]]
Several professional natural-history illustrators accompanied expeditions in the early 19th century, including [[Ferdinand Bauer]], who travelled with [[Matthew Flinders]], and [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], who travelled with a French expedition led by [[Nicolas Baudin]]. The first resident professional artist was [[John Lewin]],&lt;ref name="James Gleeson 1971" /&gt; who arrived in 1800 and published two volumes of natural history art. Ornithologist [[John Gould]] was renowned for his illustrations of the country's birds.&lt;ref name="James Gleeson 1971" /&gt; In the late 19th century [[Harriet Morgan|Harriet]] and [[Helena Scott]] were highly respected natural history illustrators&lt;ref&gt;http://australianmuseum.net.au/Beauty-from-Nature-art-of-the-Scott-Sisters&lt;/ref&gt;
Lewin's ''Platypus'' (1808) represents the fine detail and scientific observation displayed by many of these early painters.

As well as inspiration in natural history, there were some ethnographic portraiture of [[Aboriginal Australian]]s, particularly in the 1830s. Artists included [[Augustus Earle]] in [[New South Wales]]&lt;ref name="James Gleeson 1971" /&gt; and [[Benjamin Duterrau]], [[Robert Hawker Dowling|Robert Dowling]] and the sculptor [[Benjamin Law (sculptor)|Benjamin Law]], recording images of [[Tasmanian Aborigines]].

The most significant landscape artist of this era&lt;ref name="Christopher Allen 1997" /&gt; was [[John Glover (artist)|John Glover]]. Heavily influenced by 18th-century European landscape painters, such as [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Salvator Rosa]], his works captured the distinctive Australian features of open country, fallen logs, and blue hills.&lt;ref name="Bernard Smith 2001"&gt;Australian Painting: 1788-2000. Bernard Smith with Terry Smith and Christopher Heathcote (2001). Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conrad Martens]] (1801–1878) worked from 1835 to 1878 as a professional artist, painting many landscapes and was commercially successful. His work has been regarded as softening the landscape to fit European sensibilities.&lt;ref name="James Gleeson 1971" /&gt; His watercolour studies of Sydney Harbour are well regarded, and seen as introducing [[Romantic art#Romantic visual arts|Romantic]] ideals to his paintings.&lt;ref name="Bernard Smith 2001" /&gt; Martens is also remembered for accompanying scientist [[Charles Darwin]] on [[HMS Beagle]] (as had [[Augustus Earle]]).

====Gold rushes and expansion (1851–1885)====
[[File:Eugene VON GUÉRard - North-east view from the northern top of Mount Kosciusko - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Eugene von Guérard, ''North-east view from the northern top of Mount Kosciusko'', 1863]]
From 1851, the [[Victorian Gold Rush]] resulted in a huge influx of settlers and new wealth. [[S. T. Gill]] (1818–1880) documented life on the Australian gold fields,&lt;ref name="James Gleeson 1971" /&gt; however the colonial art market primarily desired landscape paintings, which were commissioned by wealthy landowners or merchants wanting to record their material success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/OceantoOutback/pdf/O2OEDUKIT.pdf nga.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Piguenit]]'s (1836–1914) "Flood in the Darling" was acquired by the National Gallery of New South Wales in 1895.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McCulloch, Alan McCulloch, Susan McCulloch &amp; Emily McCulloch Childs: ''McCulloch’s Encyclopedia of Australian Art'' Melbourne University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artists of note included [[Eugene von Guerard]], [[Nicholas Chevalier]], [[William Strutt]], [[John Skinner Prout]] and [[Knut Bull]].

[[Louis Buvelot]] was a key figure in landscape painting in the later period. He was influenced by the [[Barbizon school]] painters, and so using a ''[[plein air]]'' technique, and a more domesticated and settled view of the land, in contrast to the emphasis on strangeness or danger prevalent in earlier painters. This approach, together with his extensive teaching influence, have led his to dubbed the "Father of Landscape Painting in Australia".&lt;ref name="Bernard Smith 2001" /&gt;

A few attempts at art exhibitions were made in the 1840s, which attracted a number of artists but were commercial failures.  By the 1850s, however, regular exhibitions became popular, with a variety of art types represented.  The first of these exhibitions was in 1854 in [[Melbourne]].  An art museum, which eventually became the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], was founded in 1861, and it began to collect Australian works as well as gathering a collection of European masters. Crucially, it also opened an Art School, important for the following generations of Australian-born and raised artists.

[[Henry James Johnstone|H. J. Johnstone]], a professional photographer and student of Buvelot, painted the large-scale bush scene ''Evening Shadows'' (1880), the first acquisition of the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and possibly Australia's most reproduced painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/TLF/01/ 'Evening shadows, backwater of the Murray, South Australia'], Art Gallery of South Australia.

====Australian impressionists (1885–1900)====
{{see also|Heidelberg School}}
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - s0273V1962 - Van Gogh Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Peter Russell]], ''[[Vincent van Gogh (Russell painting)|Vincent van Gogh]]'', 1886]]
The origins of a distinctly Australian painting tradition is often associated with the [[Heidelberg School]] of the late 19th century. Named after a camp [[Tom Roberts]] and [[Arthur Streeton]] established in [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] (then a rural suburb on the outskirts of [[Melbourne]]), these painters, together with [[Frederick McCubbin]], [[Charles Conder]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and others, began an impressionistic ''plein air'' approach to the Australian landscape that remains embedded in Australia's popular consciousness, both in and outside the art world.

Many of their most famous works depict scenes of pastoral and outback Australia. Central themes of their art include manual labour, conquering the land,&lt;ref name = "Christopher Allen 1997"/&gt; and an idealisation of the rural pioneer.&lt;ref name = "Bernard Smith 2001"/&gt; By the 1890s most Australians were city-dwellers, as were the artists themselves, and a romantic view of pioneer life gave great power and popularity to images such as ''[[Shearing the Rams]]''.&lt;ref name="Bernard Smith 2001"/&gt; In this work Roberts uses formal composition and strong realism to dignify the shearers&lt;ref name = "Bernard Smith 2001"/&gt; whilst the relative anonymity of the men and their subdued expressions, elevate their work as the real subject, rather that the specific individuals portrayed.&lt;ref name = "Christopher Allen 1997"/&gt;

In their portrayal of the nobility of rural life, the Heidelberg artists reveal their debt to [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Bastien-Lepage]] and [[Courbet]], but the techniques and aims of the French [[Impressionist]]s provide more direct inspiration and influenced their actual practise. In their early and extremely influential [[9 by 5 Impression Exhibition|Exhibition of 9 by 5 Impressions]] of small sketches, their impressionistic programme was clear, as evidenced from their catalogue: ''"An effect is only momentary: so an impressionist tries to find his place... it has been the object of artists to render faithfully, and thus obtain first records of effects widely differing, and often of very fleeting character."''&lt;ref name="Bernard Smith 2001"/&gt;

Other significant painters associated with the Heidelberg painters were [[Walter Withers]], who won the inaugural [[Wynne Prize]] in 1896,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Alan McCulloch, Golden Age of Australian Painting: Impressionism and the Heidelberg School&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jane Sutherland]], a student of McCubbin. Born and raised in Sydney, impressionist [[John Peter Russell]] spent much of his career in Europe, where he befriended the likes of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Claude Monet]]. He also wrote letters home to his friend, Tom Roberts, updating him on developments in French impressionism.

===Nationhood===
====Federation era (1901–1914)====
In 1901, the six self-governing Australian colonies [[Federation of Australia|federated]] to form a unified nation. Artists such as [[Hans Heysen]] and [[Elioth Gruner]] built on the Australian landscape tradition of the Heidelberg painters, creating grand, nationalist pastoral landscapes. Others moved on to successful careers in London and Paris, such as [[Rupert Bunny]] and [[Hugh Ramsay]].

== Institutions ==

Australia has major art museums and galleries subsidised by the national and state governments, as well as private art museums and small university and municipal galleries. The [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[Queensland Art Gallery|Gallery of Modern Art]] and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] have major strengths in collecting the art of the Asia Pacific Region. Others include the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]], which has a significant Australian collection of Western art. [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney]] and the privately owned [[Museum of Old and New Art]] in Hobart, Tasmania and [[White Rabbit Gallery]] in Sydney are widely regarded as autonomously discerning collections of international contemporary art.

Other institutions include the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] in Adelaide, Newcastle Art Gallery, the [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery of Australia]], the [[National Museum of Australia]], the [[Canberra Museum and Gallery]], the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]] in Hobart, the [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory]] in Darwin, and the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]] in Perth. The [[State Library of New South Wales]] holds a significant collection comprising over a [http://guides.sl.nsw.gov.au/picturescollections quarter of a million artworks] many from the Colonial period. More material is held by other National and State libraries.

== Art market ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The boom and bust cycle in contemporary art is evident in the 1980s colonial art boom ending at the time of the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]] and the exit of many artists and dealers, followed by the 2000s boom in Aboriginal dot painting and Australian late modernist painting, which ended at the time of the global financial crisis and growing collector and public interest in the international contemporary art circuit.

A 5% resale royalty scheme commenced in 2010 under which artists receive 5% of the sale price when eligible artworks are resold commercially for $1000 or more. Between 10 June 2010 and 15 May 2013, the scheme generated over $1.5 million in royalties for 610 artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.gov.au/visual-arts/resale-royalty-scheme Resale Royalty Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some buyers object to paying any resale royalty while others do not mind a royalty going directly to the artists. However, they worry about further red tape and bureaucratic interference.

In 2014/15 there was a rediscovery of colonial art at auction. Affordable 20th-century rural scene painting is buoyant. While the inflated northern hemisphere art markets had anticipating a massive correction in the Australian art market which transitioned to the middle market.

Socially oriented art events such as art fairs and biennials have continued to grow in size and popularity in the contemporary art scene. The smaller commercial galleries have struggled to remain in business in the 2010s in spite of a functioning economy, although there is little consensus on the reasons for this.

==Australian visual arts in other countries==

The museum for Australian Aboriginal art "La grange"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-bf.ch/ fondation-bf.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; (Neuchâtel, Switzerland) is one of the few museums in Europe that dedicates itself entirely to Aboriginal art.

'''''Barddas''''' is a book of material compiled and written by the Welsh writer and [[literary forger]] [[Iolo Morganwg]]. Though purported to be an authentic compilation of ancient Welsh [[bard]]ic and [[druid]]ic theology and lore, its contents are largely Iolo's own invention. The work was published by [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]] for the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]] in two volumes, 1862 and 1874.&lt;ref name="Löffler2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marion Löffler|title=The literary and historical legacy of Iolo Morganwg, 1826-1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIBnAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2007|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-2113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baynes1833"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Spencer Baynes|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA319|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=1833|publisher=C.

==Publication==
Following [[Iolo Morganwg]]'s death in 1826, his son [[Taliesin Williams]] set about collecting and publishing his unpublished manuscripts. This resulted in three volumes, including ''The Iolo Papers'' in 1848, published a year after Taliesin Williams' unexpected death. Subsequently, Iolo's papers were purchased by [[Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover|Benjamin]] and [[Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover|Augusta Hall]], who made them accessible to other scholars. [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]], alias "Ab Ithel", was among the first to take up the offer; he edited the two volumes now known as ''Barddas'' for the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]], which appeared in 1862 and 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Williams claimed the ''Barddas'' material was based on authentic ancient manuscripts originally compiled by the 16th-century antiquarian [[Llywelyn Siôn]]. In reality, almost all of it was either Iolo's own work, or heavily edited by him. Volume I is divided into three sections. The first section, "Symbols", chiefly discusses "[[coelbren (alphabet)|coelbren]]", a supposed Bardic [[alphabet]] devised by Iolo. The second section, "Theology", is the most significant. It discusses Iolo's elaborate philosophy and cosmology, which he claimed was the actual belief system of the ancient bards, though it is really a variegation of Iolo's own unconventional Christian beliefs and interpretation of Welsh tradition.&lt;ref name=Matthewsxvi&gt;Matthews, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maryjones.us/jce/barddas.html |title= Jones |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section includes a "[[catechism]]" in the form of a question and answer session regarding the cycle of [[re-incarnation]]. It discusses the "circles of being" from [[Annwn]] (lowest state, [[Hades]] or Fairyland) through circles of Abred (probation state), Gwynfyd (perfect [[liberty]]) and Ceugant (infinity).&lt;ref name="Rolleston2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. W. Rolleston|title=Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AKmnxWMnGQC&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=30 January 2010|publisher=Digireads.com Publishing|isbn=978-1-4209-3507-3|pages=227–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a number of "Triads" apparently derived from authentic [[Welsh Triads]]; according to scholar [[Rachel Bromwich]] this suggests Iolo had access to versions of the triads long before they were widely known or collected.&lt;ref name=Matthewsxvi/&gt; The third section, "Wisdom", contains esoteric lore that may date to the 16th and 17th century, though not to ancient druidic tradition as Iolo claims. Volume II was left unfinished at Williams' death; it is largely a guidebook for bards and [[gorsedd]]s.&lt;ref name=Matthewsxvi/&gt;

'''''Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association''''', 564 U.S. 786 (2011), is a [[landmark case]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that struck down a 2005 [[California]] law banning the sale of certain violent [[video game]]s to children without parental supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediacoalition.org/VSDA-v.-Schwarzenegger- |title=Schwarzenegger v.

The ruling was seen as a significant victory for the [[video game industry]]. Several of the Court's justices suggested that the issue might need to be re-examined in the future, considering the changing nature of video games and their continuously improving technology.

[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|left|A typical ESRB rating label will identify the appropriate age group and specific content descriptors for each rated game.]]
To counteract these increasing complaints and attempts at legislation, the video game industry in the United States created the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | title = Game industry put focus on ratings years ago | first = Mike | last = Snider | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | work = [[USA Today]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702035618/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-06-28-video-game-ratings_n.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over the violence in the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | title = ESRB Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = [[ESRB]] | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103954/http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 | archivedate = 2011-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the [[Family Entertainment Protection Act]], a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Joseph Lieberman]], and [[Evan Bayh]], would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | title = FTC Undercover Shopper Survey on Enforcement of Entertainment Ratings Finds Compliance Worst for Retailers of Music CDs and the Highest Among Video Game Sellers | date = 2011-04-20 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110817072723/http://ftc.gov/opa/2011/04/violentkidsent.shtm | archivedate = 2011-08-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the [[British Board of Film Classification]], the [[Australian Classification Board]], and Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]].

== The California law ==
[[File:Leland Yee.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Former-California Senator [[Leland Yee]] introduced CA Law AB 1179, the law debated in the case.]]
In 2005, the [[California State Legislature]] passed AB 1179, sponsored by then-[[California State Senator]] [[Leland Yee]], which banned the sale of violent video games to anyone under age 18 and required clear labeling beyond the existing ESRB rating system.  The law would have a maximum $1000 fine for each infraction. The definition of "violent video game" used a variation of the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test used previously by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to define when [[obscene]] speech is not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="gamasutra analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6191/video_game_regulation_and_the_.php | title = Video Game Regulation and the Supreme Court: Schwarzenegger v.

The law was a second attempt by Senator Yee to enact restrictions for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a [[child psychologist]] led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed that the government had strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | title = Lawmaker defends law banning sale of violent video games to minors | date = 2010-04-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-02 | first = Ben | last = Fritz | work = Los Angeles Times | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031194737/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/29/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100429 | archivedate = 2010-10-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | title = Schwarzenegger Signs California Video Games Bill | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2004-09-22 | accessdate = 2010-11-02 | first = David | last = Jenkins | first2 = Simon | last2 = Carless | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101109172729/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=4324 | archivedate = 2010-11-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges ==

=== The District Court opinion ===
Before the California bill was signed into law, the ESA and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA), now known as the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA), were preparing a lawsuit to overturn the law, fearing that the "violent video game" definition would affect many titles that the ESRB has otherwise labeled appropriate for younger players, and threaten to harm the video game industry.&lt;ref name="gamespot signed" /&gt; The VSDA filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and was later joined by the ESA. The two groups succeeded in obtaining a preliminary injunction in December 2005 to block enforcement of the law during the case; U.S. District Judge [[Ronald M. Whyte]] cited in his preliminary decision: "The plaintiffs have shown at least that serious questions are raised concerning the States' ability to restrict minors' First Amendment rights in connection with exposure to violent video games, including the question of whether there is a causal connection between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children."&lt;ref name="arstech injunction"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars | title = California game law blocked | first = Ken | last = Fisher | date = 2005-12-22 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100812143845/http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5825.ars | archivedate = 2010-08-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Whyte ultimately ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the law violated the First Amendment, and that there was an insufficient showing of proof that either video games differed from other media or that there was established causality between violent video games and violent behavior.&lt;ref name="NDCalifDecision"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v.

=== The Ninth Circuit appeal ===
[[File:Arnold Schwarzenegger 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Then-Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] led the appeal of the lower courts' decisions.]] California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] appealed the ruling in September 2007, stating that he would "vigorously defend this law" and that he and the people of California have "a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultra-violent actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | title = Schwarzenegger To Appeal California Game Law Ruling | first = James | last = Dobson | date = 2007-08-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-01 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101111025315/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15064 | archivedate = 2010-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed Whyte's decision in 2009.&lt;ref name="9thCirDecision"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n, et al. v. Schwarzenegger, et al. |vol=556 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=950 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2008 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Circuit considered the constitutionality of the law; given the timeframe of the law's passing relative to litigation, it was referred to as the "Act" in the court's opinion. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's Summary Judgment for the VSDA by holding:
#The Act is a presumptively invalid content-based restriction on speech, so it is subject to strict scrutiny and not the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York''.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ginsberg v. New York |vol=390 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=629 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1968 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/390/390.US.629.47.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Act violates rights protected by the First Amendment because the state has not demonstrated a compelling interest, has not tailored the restriction to its alleged compelling interest, and there exists a less-restrictive means that would further the State's expressed interest.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Schwarzenegger |vol=556 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=950 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2009 |url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/20/0716620.pdf |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Act's labeling requirement is unconstitutionally compelled speech under the First Amendment because it does not require the disclosure of purely factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial Opinion.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court first addressed the VSDA's argument that the entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of "violent video game" in the Act is unconstitutionally broad. However, the statute had a [[severability clause]]&lt;ref name="California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;1746.5"&gt;California Civil Code §&amp;nbsp;1746.5.&lt;/ref&gt; so the court went through the severability test set forth in ''Hotel Employees &amp; Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Davis''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hotel Employees &amp; Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Superior Court |vol=35 |reporter=Cal. 4th |opinion=935 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2005 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the definition for "violent video game" is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of "violent video game," it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt; Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to the passage of the Act and the legislative body would have adopted the Act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sonoma County Org.  of Pub. Employees v. County of Sonoma |vol=23 |reporter=Cal. 3d |opinion=296 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1979 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definition sections were only included to avoid the possibility that a court would rule the terms unconstitutionally vague; the court found that the legislature would still have enacted the statute without this definition section.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court next went on to determine what level of scrutiny should be applied in reviewing the Act's prohibitions. The defendants insisted that the "variable obscenity" standard from ''Ginsberg v. New York'' should be used.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg" /&gt; However, the court held that the "variable obscenity" standard does not apply to violence. The Court in ''Ginsberg'' was careful to place substantive limits on its holding, and concern in ''Ginsberg'' regarded only "sex material," not violence. The court declined to extend the application of the "variable obscenity" standard to violence, so strict scrutiny was applied instead.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

In applying the strict scrutiny standard, the court recognized that "content-based regulations are presumptively invalid,"&lt;ref name="bulk.resource.org"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota |vol=505 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=377 |pinpoint=382 |court= |date=1992 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/505/505.US.377.90-7675.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to survive invalidation, the Act had to fulfill two qualifications:
#Restrictions "must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government interest."
#"If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose, the legislature must use that alternative."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc. |vol=529 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=803 |pinpoint=813 |court= |date=2000 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/529/529.US.803.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court invalidated the statute on both accounts. First, the court said that in considering its decision, the court limited the purpose of the Act to the actual harm to the brain of a child playing a violent video game. As a result, the state was required to show that "the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Turner Broad.

Second, the court held that the defendants did not demonstrate the absence of less restrictive alternative means. In fact, video games already comply with a [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|voluntary rating system]] that rates video games based on their topics and age appropriateness. This is a clear example of a less restrictive means. The court noted that the least restrictive means is not the same as the most effective means.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

The court also evaluated the constitutionality of the Act's labeling provision, which requires that a label be affixed to the front of every package the state deems to be a "violent video game." Generally, "freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. |vol=547 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=47 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2006 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court has upheld compelled commercial speech where it is the inclusion of "purely factual and uncontroversial information" in advertising.&lt;ref name="Zaruder v 2166"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Zaruder v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel |vol=471 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=626 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2985 |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/471/471.US.626.83-2166.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labeling requirement of "violent video game" is not factual information. The Act has not clearly and legally provided a way to determine if a video game is violent so the sticker does not convey factual information. Consequently, the court found that the Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Schwarzenegger Ninth" /&gt;

=== Supreme Court appeal ===
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice Antonin Scalia, along with those supporting the ESA side of the case, questioned whether violent video games should be treated differently from other media with similar violence regularly exposed to minors, such as the fairy tale of [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]
Gov. Schwarzenegger again appealed to the Supreme Court, looking to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as ''Schwarzenegger v.

[[Oral argument]]s were held on November 2, 2010. To California's attorney, the Justices voiced concern on the distinction between video games and other commercial works such as films and comic books. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wondered if the law with its vague definition of "violence" could also be applied to [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]].&lt;ref name="wsj nov2" /&gt; To the ESA and other trade groups, the Justices suggested that California and other states do have precedence to protect minors from certain forms of violence, though under narrower terms than the California law.&lt;ref name="wsj nov2"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704462704575590333558912068 | title = Court Voices Doubts on Violent Videogame Law | first = Brent | last = Kendall | date = 2010-11-02 | accessdate = 2010-11-02 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150724141900/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704462704575590333558912068 | archivedate = 2015-07-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[John Roberts]] argued that while companies can provide parental filters on such violent games, "any 13-year-old can bypass [them] in about five minutes."&lt;ref name="nytimes nov02" /&gt; Several questions centered on the controversial game ''[[Postal 2]]'', where the player can urinate on non-player characters and set them ablaze, among other violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/31316/Analysis_from_the_Supreme_Court_Schwarzenegger_v_EMA.php | title = Analysis: Inside The U.S. Supreme Court On 'Schwarzenegger v.

== Opinion ==
[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the majority opinion in the case.]]
On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 opinion striking down the California law as unconstitutional on the basis of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  It first held that "video games qualify for First Amendment protection": 

{{quote|Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world).  That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.}}

Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 ''[[Ginsberg v. New York]]'' case, "speech about violence is not obscene," and California's statute was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | title = States May Not Ban Sale, Rental of Violent Videogames to Minors | first = David | last = Kravits | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629093204/http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/violent-video-games-scotus/ | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the [[Brothers Grimm]], which are regularly given to children to read, "contain no shortage of gore" that are also present in video games.&lt;ref name="forbes decision" /&gt; The decision further compared video games to classical works like ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', stating that "Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society..., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature."&lt;ref name="time decision"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | title = Supreme Court: 'Video Games Qualify for First Amendment Protection' | first = Evan | last = Narcisse | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183606/http://techland.time.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-games-qualify-for-first-amendment-protection/ | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia's decision also stated that the current self-moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that "filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest" requiring a law to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | title = 1st Amendment beats ban in video game battle | first = Stephen | last = Tolito | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118153215/http://ingame.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/06/27/6957472-1st-amendment-beats-ban-in-video-game-battle | archivedate=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no "compelling" link between violent video games and its effects on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gazJYGtwgygMOKo0UkFFbt2IQ41g?docId=CNG.8685d6a6040541cc62b1b2322b148bc7.681 | title = Top US court zaps violent videogame sales ban | work = [[Agence France-Presse]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision cited one medical report that asserted that cartoons like ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' generate the same effects in children as in games like ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' or imagery of guns.&lt;ref name="forbes decision" /&gt;

=== Alito's concurrence ===
Justice [[Samuel Alito]] wrote a separate [[concurring opinion|concurrence]] supporting the majority decision, and was joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]]. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its "threshold requirement" that guides what material would be covered by the law was too broad, he questioned the potential [[double standard]] that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars | title = Puritans and Lady Godiva: why two justices voted to uphold California's video game law | first = Nate | last = Anderson | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215548/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/puritans-and-lady-godiva-why-two-justices-voted-to-uphold-californias-video-game-law.ars | archivedate = 2011-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show," referencing the book '' Infinite Reality '' which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: Alito Expresses Uncertainty About Violent Games' Effects | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110702003152/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35463/Supreme_Court_Decision_Alito_Expresses_Uncertainty_About_Violent_Games_Effects.php | archivedate = 2011-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissents ===
Justices [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] dissented, each authoring a separate dissent. Justice Thomas, in his dissent, considered that historically, the Founding Fathers "believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children," and that the intent of the First Amendment "does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians."&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | title = Supreme Court Decision: The Dissenters' Side | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115001/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35471/Supreme_Court_Decision_The_Dissenters_Side.php | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet decision" /&gt;

Breyer wrote separately, concerned that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from ''Ginsberg'' and ''Miller''. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?"&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt; Breyer further argued that "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," and that "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression."&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20074680-281/u.s-supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-game-law/ | title = U.S. Supreme Court strikes down violent video game law | first =Declan | last = McCullagh | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 [[Federal Trade Commission]] study.&lt;ref name="gamasutra dissent" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
The ruling was praised by the video game industry, which had expected the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that "The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | title = Video Game Industry Celebrates Supreme Court Victory | first = Frank | last = Cifaldi | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110630223419/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35461/Video_Game_Industry_Celebrates_Supreme_Court_Victory.php | archivedate = 2011-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO [[John Riccitiello]] asserted that the decision "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/business-technology-hardware-amp-equipment-us-video-games-sector-snap_8537172.html | title = Sector Snap: Game cos. cheer Supreme Court ruling | work = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate  =2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision.  Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association [[Chris Dodd]] recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that "We applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the far-reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law."&lt;ref name="ew reactions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-game-violence/ | title = Supreme Court rules against law restricting video game violence | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first = Jeff | last = Labrecque | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110630082722/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/27/supreme-court-video-game-violence/ | archivedate = 2011-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups that supported the California law were critical of the decision. California State Senator Leland Yee was very critical of the decision, claiming that "It is simply wrong that the video game industry can be allowed to put their profit margins over the rights of parents and the well-being of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/06/author-of-violent-video-games-law-blasts-supreme-court-decision/1 | title = Author of violent video games law blasts Supreme Court decision | first = Brett | last = Molina | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee stated he would review the opinions and attempt to reintroduce a new bill within the constitutionality of the decision, and claimed it was "disappointing the court didn't understand just how violent these games are."&lt;ref name="forbes decision"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/27/entertainment-us-supreme-court-violent-video-games_8537064.html | title = Court overturns ban on video game sales to kids | first = Jesse | last = Holland | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate =2011-06-27 | work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; James Steyer of [[Common Sense Media]] also criticized the decision, citing that "If parents decide a violent game is okay for their kid, that's one thing, but millions of kids are not able to judge the impact of ultra-violence on their own."&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35473/Analysis_Despite_Ruling_Threats_Remain_For_The_Games_Industry.php | title = Analysis: Despite Ruling, Threats Remain For The Games Industry | first = Chris | last = Morris | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629094614/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35473/Analysis_Despite_Ruling_Threats_Remain_For_The_Games_Industry.php | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Schlafly|Andy Schlafly]], who had submitted a brief to the court on behalf of the Eagle Forum and Legal Defense Fund, heavily criticized the majority opinion, believing that "the court's latest disregard of parental rights is on a crash course with technological advances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-06-27-Violent-videos-warp-young-minds_n.htm | title = Opposing view: Violent videos warp young minds | first = Andy | last = Schlafly | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701113428/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-06-27-Violent-videos-warp-young-minds_n.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Winter of the [[Parents Television Council]] asserted that the Court's decision "replaces the authority of parents with the economic interests of the video game industry."&lt;ref name="ew reactions" /&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' opined that the California law "did nothing to infringe on the rights of adults" while dealing with "reasonable limitations on minors' access to extremely violent games that even the video game industry acknowledges are inappropriate," and that with the high bar for any future legislation, the onus is on the video game industry to maintain its self-policing of video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-high-courts-misguided-decision-on-violent-video-games/2011/06/27/AGilYDoH_story.html | title = The high court's misguided decision on violent video games | work = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221239/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-high-courts-misguided-decision-on-violent-video-games/2011/06/27/AGilYDoH_story.html | archivedate = 2014-03-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts believed that while this was a major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb &amp; Loeb believed that similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments."&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis" /&gt; Other analysts cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards "privacy and security" of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that [[Playdom]] had to pay for violating privacy of its younger users.&lt;ref name="gamasutra decision analysis" /&gt; Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | title = Violent Video Game Debate: Where Do We Go From Here? | first = David | last = Daw | date = 2011-06-27 | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215655/http://www.pcworld.com/article/231288/violent_video_game_debate_where_do_we_go_from_here.html | archivedate = 2011-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Schiesel of the ''[[New York Times]]'' proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that [[video games as an art form|video games are a form of art]], questioning the industry "Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock or will you rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?"&lt;ref name="nytimes schiesel"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | title = Supreme Court Has Ruled; Now Games Have a Duty | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Seth | last = Schiesel | date = 2011-06-28 | accessdate = 2011-06-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701202527/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/arts/video-games/what-supreme-court-ruling-on-video-games-means.html | archivedate = 2011-07-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a "dangerous enemy" in that game.&lt;ref name="nytimes schiesel" /&gt;

In January 2012, the state of California agreed to pay the ESA $950,000 for reimbursing the ESA's legal fees during the Supreme Court trial, atop approximately $350,000 in fees from the previous trials at lower courts.  The ESA stated that it will use an unspecified portion of this money to help create after-school programs in "underserved" communities in the Oakland and Sacramento areas to help teach students job skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/california-paying-950000-for-failed-supreme-court-fight-6349243 |title=California paying $950,000 for failed Supreme Court fight |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-01-26 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |first2=Brendan |last2=Sinclair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206095142/http://www.gamespot.com/news/california-paying-950000-for-failed-supreme-court-fight-6349243 |archivedate=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of defending the case is estimated around $1.8 million, including the State's own legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/19/4274796/failed-legal-fight-over-video.html |title=Failed legal fight over video games costs California nearly $2 million |first=Jim |last=Sanders |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222015544/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/02/19/4274796/failed-legal-fight-over-video.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Kenneth Doroshow and Paul M. Smith, the lawyers for the EMA who argued the case, were presented with the Ambassador Award by the [[International Game Developers Association]] [[Game Developers Choice Awards]]. The Ambassador Award "honors an individual or individuals who have helped the game industry advance to a better place, either through facilitating a better game community from within, or by reaching outside the industry to be an advocate for video games".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Game Developers Choice Online Awards – Ambassador Award Archive | url = http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/ambassador.html | publisher = UBM Tech | date = March 2012 | accessdate = November 16, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130202090125/http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/ambassador.html | archivedate = February 2, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a seminar given in November 2014, Justice [[Elena Kagan]] expressed her thoughts on the decision in this case, noting that for herself, she faced a difficult decision between what she felt was right – allowing parents to decide what their children should watch and play – and what the state of the law was, and in hindsight, was still not sure if they made the right decision. She noted that she along with four others on the  court effectively added language to the decision that would preempt any future laws that attempted to restrict game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/supreme-court-justice-second-guesses-decisive-vote-in-gaming-free-speech-case/ | title = Supreme Court justice second-guesses decisive vote in gaming free speech case | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2015-01-08 | accessdate = 2015-01-08 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150108044005/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/supreme-court-justice-second-guesses-decisive-vote-in-gaming-free-speech-case/ | archivedate = 2015-01-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Gallagher, CEO of the ESA, observed in 2017 that the same [[moral panic]] that led to concerns over video games and resulting in this case were starting to appear for newer video game systems that can further blur lines between the virtual and real world, such as [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], and [[mixed reality]], and anticipates that there will be further tests of the applicability of First Amendment protection these new forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/02/gaming-beat-the-supreme-court-now-its-time-to-defend-ar-and-vr/ | title = Gaming beat the Supreme Court — now it's time to defend AR and VR | first = Jeff | last = Grubb | date = May 2, 2017 | accessdate = May 2, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170503002612/https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/02/gaming-beat-the-supreme-court-now-its-time-to-defend-ar-and-vr/ | archivedate = May 3, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion ===
A national telephone poll conducted in the second quarter of 2011 by [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s [[Fairleigh Dickinson University#PublicMind|PublicMind]] showed that a majority of American voters (57%) agreed that states should have the "right to regulate the sale of video games [that are violent] in order to protect minors; the same way states regulate tobacco, alcohol and pornography." On the other hand, 39% of voters agreed with the Court's majority that "parents should make the decision" about what video games they purchase for their children, and what constitutes "too violent." These voters agreed with the statement "states do not have the right to decide that some video games are too violent for [minors], any more than they have the right to decide what literature or fairy tales are too violent." The poll was conducted before the Court released its decision on June 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="publicmind.fdu.edu"&gt;Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, (June 6, 2011).

'''Capital City Distribution''' was a [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based [[comic book]] [[direct market|distributor]] which operated from 1980 to 1996 when they were acquired by rival [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]. Under the name '''Capital Comics''', they also published comics from 1981 to 1984.

During most of its years of operation, Capital City introduced many supply chain innovations and controlled much of the American [[Midwest]]'s comics distribution market. More so than their rivals Diamond and [[Heroes World Distribution]], Capital City supported independent publishers as much as big mainstream companies like [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Heidi. [http://www.comicsbeat.com/the-unbeleivable-world-of-80s-comics-sales/ "The unbelievable world of 80s comics sales,"] ''The Beat'' (12/01/2014).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Capital City also published over 400 pages of printed material a month, including ''Internal Correspondence'', which provided sales figures to their clients; and ''Advance Comics'',&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt; their monthly catalog showcasing upcoming comic books, toys, and other pop-culture related items it distributed to comic book specialty shops.

== Distributor ==

=== Origins ===
In the 1970s, [[Milton Griepp]] and John Davis were running a small Madison-based distributor called [[Wisconsin Independent News Distributors]] (WIND). Forced to sell their assets to [[Big Rapids Distribution]], Griepp and Davis later turned the tables in 1980 when they took over much of Big Rapids' bankrupt business to form Capital City.&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Booker&gt;Booker, M. Keith, editor. ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'' (ABC-CLIO, 2014), p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Capital City's first acts was to utilize the personnel of another former Big Rapids' acquisition, [[Well News Co.]] of Columbus, Ohio, to become the nucleus of an early distribution branch. In 1982, Capital City acquired the Berkeley, California-based [[Common Ground Distributors]], which had been started by [[Robert Beerbohm]] in the late 1970s (and had been initially supplied by Big Rapids).

Capital City's Wisconsin location was relatively near [[World Color Press]]'s main printing plant in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. (During that period World Color printed most American comic books, including those of the two industry giants [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].)&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;Carlson, KC. [http://westfieldcomics.com/blog/interviews-and-columns/kc-column-scaling-mount-baron/ "KC Column: Scaling Mount Baron,"] Westfield Comics (Nov. 16, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, Capital City operated out of a large warehouse in Madison that they shared with their largest account, [[mail-order]] retailer [[Westfield Comics]].&lt;ref name="KC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Booker /&gt;

=== 1984 expansion and rise to prominence ===
Griepp became Capital City's CEO in 1984.&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt; That same year, with the demise of one of the larger independent publisher/distributors, [[Pacific Comics]], Pacific's distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by Capital City and rival distributor [[Bud Plant Inc.]] Capital City also opened an expanded facility in [[Sparta, Illinois]], in the old space of another defunct rival, [[Sea Gate Distributors]], alongside the comic-book printing plant.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

By 1988, Capital City and its main surviving rival [[Diamond Comics Distributors]] had control of at least 70% of the comics distribution market between them.

In 1994, Capital created controversy by announcing penalties for publishers who didn't deliver their products within promised deadlines; this move followed an industry-wide push for 30-day returnability, a practice formerly in use when comics were primarily distributed in newsstands.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Capital Announces Controversial Penalty Fees for Publishers: Move Follows Industry-wide Push for 30-day Returnability," ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), pp. 17–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point, Capital City's Canadian affiliate, STV, had warehouses in Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City; and Capital City had another freight forwarder operating out of Seattle, Washington.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Acquisition by Diamond ===
1995 saw a major restructuring of the direct market distribution system, caused by [[Marvel Comics]]'s late-1994 purchase of third-ranked distributor [[Heroes World Distribution]] and decision to distribute its titles in-house.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Capital City" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Marvelutionary War Declared: Unprecedented Upheaval in Direct Market," ''The Comics Journal'' #175 (March 1995), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the loss of one-third of its business (Marvel's market share) Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel's main rival [[DC Comics]]; and despite intense efforts on the part of Davis and Griepp,&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg131.html "Tales From the Database: Diamond Ended Up With 50% of the Comics Market,"] Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dark Horse Comics]] and [[Image Comics]] as well.

Capital City reacted by suing Marvel for the loss of their business, resulting in a settlement allowing them to continue distributing Marvel product until October 1995&lt;ref&gt;"Marvel goes exclusive, Capital sues Marvel, Marvel settles with Capital, Marvel buys Skybox, DC/Diamond announcement expected," ''The Comics Journal'' #175 (March 1995), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; (for everyone else, Marvel went exclusive with Heroes World starting in July).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1995.html "1995 Comic Book Sales Figures: Comics Preordered by North American Comics Shops as Reported by Capital City Distribution and Diamond Comic Distributors"], The Comics Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Capital City was able to sign exclusive deals with [[Kitchen Sink Press]], [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], and [[Viz Comics]]—as well as acquiring the Gary, Indiana-based distributor [[Friendly Frank's]].&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Capital City Acquires Friendly Frank's," ''The Comics Journal'' #178 (July 1995), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by 1996 Capital faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out.

In July 1996 Capital City was acquired by Diamond. At the time of sale, Capital had over $150 million in annual sales.&lt;ref name="ICv2"&gt;[http://icv2.com/about/ "Who We Are: Milton Griepp," ICv2.com.] Accessed October 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquisition brought an estimated $50 million in sales revenue to Diamond,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328|title=FindArticles.com {{!}} CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectively awarded Diamond complete control of the comics distribution system.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"/&gt; Most of Capital City's 100 employees in Madison and another 100 in Sparta lost their jobs in the deal,&lt;ref&gt;Daykin, Tom. "Comic book distributor to fold: Battered by competitive forces, Capital City Distribution sells assets," ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' (July 27, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; though a few key staff members, including co-founder John Davis, joined Diamond's staff.&lt;ref&gt;"Davis and Former Capital City Employees Join Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #192 (Dec. 1996), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling Capital, Griepp became an industry consultant, and since early 2001, has operated [[ICv2]] ("''Internal Correspondence'' vol. 2"), an online trade magazine covering "[[geek culture]]."&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt;

== Publisher ==
In 1981, Capital City decided to enter the comic book publishing field as well. Under the name '''Capital Comics''', they launched a black-and-white comics title, ''[[Nexus (comics)|Nexus]]'', a futuristic superhero series by [[Mike Baron]] and [[Steve Rude]], and distributed it through their own system.&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;Sanford, Jay Allen. [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/aug/19/two-men-and-their-comic-books/ "Two Men and their Comic Books]," ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' (Aug. 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Bruning]] was a key part of Capital Comics' staff, acting as Editor-In-Chief and Art Director until the company ceased operation in 1984. Besides ''Nexus'', the other titles published by Capital were ''[[Badger (comics)|Badger]]'' and ''[[Whisper (comics)|Whisper]]''. In 1984, after publishing only a handful of issues of their three titles, Capital shut down its publishing operation.&lt;ref&gt;"Capital Comics Suspends Operations," ''The Comics Journal'' #89 (May 1984), pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Its titles were taken over by the new independent publisher [[First Comics]].

=== Titles published ===
* ''Nexus'': two series, 1981 and 1983, nine issues

'''José Antonio Julio Onésimo Sánchez Ferlosio''', better known as '''Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio''' ([[Madrid]], April 8, 1940 - July 1, 2003), was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[singer-songwriter]], and the author of numerous songs performed by other artists, such as [[Rolando Alarcón]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Soledad Bravo]], [[Víctor Jara]], [[Quilapayún]] and [[Joaquín Sabina]].

He was the son of the writer and founding member of the [[Falange]], [[Rafael Sánchez Mazas]], brother of the writer [[Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio]] and the mathematician and philosopher Miguel Sánchez Ferlosio.

== Politics ==

Though his father was one of the founding member of the fascist Falange, Ferlosio was a leftist militant whose politics gradually moved further away from [[Stalinism]] and orthodox leftism towards anarchism following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. He was first a militant in the [[Communist Party of Spain|Partido Comunista de España]], but after visiting the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] and seeing the repressive and hypocritical government there, as well as becoming influenced by his friend the poet [[Agustín García Calvo]], he turned away from all forms of communism and considered himself an anarchist. His new stance could be summed up in his belief that "ideas are for men, and not men for ideas".

== Discography ==

Ferlosio, a prolific composer, only recorded a small part of his repertoire. His official discography includes only one LP ''A Contratiempo''. However, many artists have adapted his songs.

Marriage is the legally or formally recognized intimate and complementing union of two people as spousal partners in a personal relationship (historically and in most jurisdictions specifically a union between a man and a woman).

The basic elements of a marriage are: (1)&amp;nbsp;the parties' legal ability to marry each other, (2)&amp;nbsp;mutual consent of the parties, and (3)&amp;nbsp;a marriage contract as required by law.

In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[marriage]], the union between a man and a woman is instituted and ordained by [[God in Christianity|God]] as the lifelong relationship between one man as [[husband]], and one woman as [[wife]]. The Apostle Paul gave a similar directive when he wrote, "Let marriage be held in honour among all".{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|13:4}} Conservative Christians consider marriage as the [[eros|most intimate]] of human relationships, a gift from God, and a sacred institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.focusonthefamily.com/marriage/gods-design-for-marriage/honoring-marriage. Accessed 15 Jan. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestantism|Protestants]] consider it to be sacred, holy, and central to the community of faith. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] consider marriage a [[Sacrament]].

Though it is presumed that [[Jesus]] never married, He taught the importance and sacredness of lifelong marriage. He quoted from both Genesis&amp;nbsp;1 and 2{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|19:3-5|9}} that God had created humanity as male and female,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27|9}} and that in marriage "the two become one flesh".{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|2:24|9}} Then He added: "So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|19:6|9}}

While marriage is honored throughout the Bible and affirmed among Christians, there is no suggestion that it is necessary for everyone. Single people, who either have chosen to remain unmarried or who have [[Widowhood#Terminology|lost their spouse]], are neither incomplete in Christ nor personal failures.&lt;ref name="Staggs"&gt;{{citation |last1=Stagg |first1=Evelyn |author1-link=Evelyn Stagg |first2=Frank |last2=Stagg |author2-link=Frank Stagg (theologian) |title=[[Woman in the World of Jesus]] |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Westminster |year=1978 |isbn=0-664-24195-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Christians seek to uphold the seriousness of wedding vows. Yet, they respond with compassion to deep hurts by recognizing that [[divorce]], though less than the ideal, is sometimes necessary to relieve one partner of intolerable hardship, unfaithfulness or desertion.&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt; While the voice of God had said, "I hate divorce",{{Bibleref2c|Malachi|2:16}} some authorities believe the divorce rate in the church is nearly comparable to that of the culture at large.&lt;ref name=Desai&gt;Amy Desai, J.D. [http://www.focusonthefamily.com/marriage/divorce_and_infidelity/should_i_get_a_divorce/how_should_a_christian_view_marriage_and_divorce.aspx How Should a Christian View Marriage and Divorce?] Accessed 15 Jan. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians today hold three competing views as to what is the biblically-ordained relationship between husband and wife. These views range from [[Christian egalitarianism]] that interprets the New Testament as teaching complete ''equality of authority and responsibility'' between the man and woman in marriage, all the way to [[Patriarchy]] that calls for a “return to complete patriarchy” in which relationships are based on male-dominant power and authority in marriage:&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

1. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] believe in an equal partnership of the wife and husband with neither being designated as the leader in the marriage or family. Instead, the wife and husband share a fully ''equal partnership'' in both their marriage and in the family. Its proponents teach "the fundamental biblical principle of the equality of all human beings before God".

"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}

According to this principle, there can be no moral or theological justification for permanently granting or denying status, privilege, or prerogative solely on the basis of a person's race, class, or gender.&lt;ref name=Groothuis&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca M. "Sexuality, Spirituality and Feminist Religion". [http://www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/sexuality-spirituality-and-feminist-religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515014220/http://www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content%2Fsexuality-spirituality-and-feminist-religion |date=2013-05-15 }} Accessed 8 Mar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

2. [[Complementarianism|Christian Complementarians]] prescribe husband-headship—a male-led hierarchy. This view's core beliefs call for a husband’s “loving, humble headship" and the wife’s "intelligent, willing submission" to his headship. Without necessarily using the term "obey", they believe women have "different but complementary roles and responsibilities in marriage".&lt;ref name=Comp&gt;Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW). Core Beliefs. {{cite web |url=https://www.cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206132921/https://www.cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }} Accessed 5 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Biblical patriarchy]], though not at all popular among mainstream Christians, prescribes a strict male-dominant hierarchy. This view makes the husband the “ruler” over "his" wife and “his” household.&lt;ref&gt;https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/summaries-of-the-egalitarian-and-complementarian-positions; 1/15/2018/&lt;/ref&gt; Their organization's first tenet is that "God reveals Himself as masculine, not feminine. God is the eternal Father and the eternal Son, the Holy Spirit is also addressed as 'He,' and Jesus Christ is a male". They consider the husband-father to be 'sovereign' over ''his'' household—the family leader, provider, and protector. They call for a wife to be ''obedient'' to her ''head'', (her husband).&lt;ref name=Patriarchy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626134919/http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx "The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy". Visual Forum Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Polygamy in Christianity|Christian authorities used to permit]] [[polygamy]] (specifically [[polygyny]]) in the past, but this practice, besides being illegal in Western cultures, is now considered to be out of the Christian mainstream and continues to be practiced only by fringe fundamentalist sects.

==Family authority and responsibilities==

[[File:Pukirev ner brak.jpg|thumb|Orthodox betrothal depicted by [[Vasily Vladimirovich Pukirev]], 1862.]]

Much of the dispute hinges on how one interprets the [[New Testament Household Code]] ''(Haustafel)'' which has as its main focus hierarchical relationships between three pairs of social classes that were controlled by Roman law: husbands/wives, parents/children, and masters/slaves. The Code, with variations, occurs in four epistles (letters) by the [[Apostle Paul]] and in 1&amp;nbsp; Peter. The Roman law of ''Manus'' gave the husband nearly absolute autocratic power over his wife, including life and death. The law of ''Patria Potestas'' (Latin for "Rule of the Fathers") gave a husband equally severe power over his children and slaves. [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]]&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.187ff}} finds the basic tenets of the Code in [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the household in Book&amp;nbsp;1 of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and in [[Philo]]'s ''Hypothetica 7.14''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=
(7.14) Do not these objects appear to you to be of greater importance than any other pursuit can possibly be? Therefore they do not go to interpreters of laws to learn what they ought to do; and even without asking, they are in no ignorance respecting the laws, so as to be likely, through following their own inclinations, to do wrong; but if you violate or alter any one of the laws, or if you ask any one of them about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty; and the husband appears to be a master, endowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a father to teach them to his children...

In a [[Tübingen]] dissertation,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch. James E. ''The Origin and Intention of the Colossian Haustafel.'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; by James E. Crouch concludes that the early Christians found in Hellenistic Judaism a code which they adapted and Christianized.

The Staggs believe the several occurrences of the [[New Testament Household Code]] in the Bible were intended to meet the needs for ''order'' within the churches and in the society of the day. They maintain that the New Testament Household Codes are attempts by Paul and Peter to Christianize the harsh Codes for Roman citizens who had become followers of Christ. The Staggs write that there is some suggestion in scripture that because Paul had taught that they had newly found freedom "in Christ", wives, children, and slaves were taking improper advantage of the ''Haustafel'' both in the home and the church. 
"The form of the code stressing reciprocal social duties is traced to Judaism's own Oriental background, with its strong moral/ethical demand but also with a low view of woman.... At bottom is probably to be seen the perennial tension between freedom and order.... What mattered to (Paul) was 'a new creation'{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|6:15}} and 'in Christ' there is 'not any Jew not Greek, not any slave nor free, not any male and female'.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}&lt;ref name=Staggs/&gt;

Such codes existed in Greek tradition. Two of these Christianized codes are found in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21-33}} (which contains the phrases "husband is the head of the wife" and "wives, submit to your husband") and in {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18-4:1}}, which instructs wives to subordinate themselves to their husbands.

The importance of the meaning of "head" as used by the [[Apostle Paul]] is pivotal in the conflict between the Complementarian position and the Egalitarian view. The word Paul used for "head", transliterated from Greek, is ''kephalē''. Today's English word "cephalic" ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ᵻ|k}} {{Respell|sə|FAL|ik}}) stems from the Greek ''kephalē'' and means "Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head." A thorough concordance search by [[Catherine Kroeger]] shows that the most frequent use of "head" ''(kephalē)'' in the New Testament is to refer to "the anatomical head of a body". She found that its second most frequent use in the New Testament was to convey the metaphorical sense of "source".&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark. "Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'". ''Priscilla Papers,'' Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Alan F. "A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings. ''Priscilla Papers, '' Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egalitarian authors such as Margaret Howe agree with Kroeger, writing that "The word 'head' (in {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&amp;nbsp; Corinthians&amp;nbsp;11:3}} and other similar passages) must be understood not as 'ruler' but as 'source{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Howe, Women and Church Leadership (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayne Grudem criticizes commonly rendering ''kephalē'' in those same passages only to mean "source", and argues that it denotes "authoritative head" in such texts as {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians&amp;nbsp;11:3}}. They interpret that verse to mean that [[God the father]] is the authoritative head over the [[Jesus Christ|Son]], and in turn Jesus is the authoritative head over the church, not simply its source. By extension, they then conclude that in marriage and in the church, the man is the authoritative head over the woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/tj/kephale_grudem.pdf Wayne Grudem, "Does Kefale ("Head") Mean "Source" Or "Authority Over" in Greek Literature? A Survey of 2,336 Examples"] Trinity Journal ns 6.1 (Spring 1985): 38-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential way to define the word "head", and hence the relationship between husband and wife as found in Bible, is through the example given in the surrounding context in which the word is found.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:20-33}} In that context the husband and wife are compared to Christ and his church. The context seems to imply an authority structure based on a man sacrificing himself for his wife, as Christ did for the church; a love-based authority structure, where submission is not required but freely given based on the care given to the wife.&lt;ref&gt;Wickstrom, Mark. ''The Gospel of Grace.'' Beaver Pond Press, 2008.{{ISBN|978-1-59298-232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biblical references on this subject are debated depending on one’s school of theology. The [[Historical-grammatical method|historical grammatical method]] is a [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. Thus references to a patriarchal Biblical culture may or may not be relevant to other societies. What is believed to be a timeless truth to one person or denomination may be considered a cultural norm or minor opinion to another.

=== {{anchor|Egalitarian view}} Egalitarian view ===
{{See also|Christian egalitarianism}}

Christian Egalitarians (from the French word "égal" meaning "equal") believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy—a full and equal partnership between the wife and husband. They emphasize that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to ''obey'' her husband. While "obey" was introduced into marriage vows for much of the church during the Middle Ages, its only New Testament support is found in {{Bibleref2|1pet|3:6||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;3:6}}, with that only being by implication from Sarah's obedience to Abraham.&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt;{{rp|p.190}} Scriptures such as {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} state that in Christ, right relationships are restored and in him, "there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female."&lt;ref name=CBE&gt;Christians for Biblical Equality. "Men, Women and Biblical Equality". Ltd. CBE on the Web at "Biblical Equality", 1989. [www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/men-women-and-biblical-equality.] Accessed 5 Mar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Egalitarians interpret scripture to mean that God intended spouses to practice ''mutual submission'', each in equality with the other. The phrase "mutual submission" comes from a verse in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21}} which precedes advice for the three domestic relationships of the day, including slavery. It reads, "Submit to one another ('mutual submission') out of reverence for Christ", wives to husbands, children to parents, and slaves to their master. Christian Egalitarians believe that full partnership in marriage is the most biblical view, producing the most intimate, wholesome, and reciprocally fulfilling marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Aída Besançon, William Spencer. ''Marriage at the Crossroads''. InterVarsity Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Egalitarian view&lt;ref&gt;Christian Egalitarian view as differentiated from humanistic egalitarianism&lt;/ref&gt; of marriage asserts that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.&lt;ref name=Groothuis2&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. "The Bible and Gender Equality." [www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; A foundational belief of Christian Egalitarians is that the husband and wife are created equally and are ordained of God to "become one", a biblical principle first ordained by God in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}}, reaffirmed by Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4-6}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:6-8}}, and by the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:30-32}}. Therefore, they see that "oneness" as pointing to [[gender equality]] in marriage. They believe the biblical model for Christian marriages is therefore for the spouses to share equal responsibility within the family—not one over the other nor one under the other.

David Dykes, theologian, author, and pastor of a 15,000-member Baptist church, sermonized that "When you are in Christ, you have full equality with all other believers". In a sermon he entitled "The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross", he said that some theologians have called one particular Bible verse the Christian ''[[Magna Carta]]''. The Bible verse reads: "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." ({{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28|NIV}}). Acknowledging the differences between men and women, Dykes writes that "in Christ, these differences don't define who we are. The only category that really matters in the world is whether you are '''in Christ'''. At the cross, Jesus destroyed all the made-made{{Clarification|date=August 2018}} barriers of hostility:" ethnicity, social status, and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Dykes, David O. "[http://www.preaching.com/sermons/11682921/page-3/ The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross]". (Senior Pastor of Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} passage comes after the apostle Paul tells us he would not submit to what was "hypocritical" to the Gospel.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|2:1-14}} The apostle Peter had affirmed the truth of the Gospel regarding the Gentiles with his words, but his actions compromised it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/2013-02-28-preparing-womens-history-month-arise-e-newsletter Quient, Allison.

Those of the egalitarian persuasion point to the biblical instruction that all Christian believers, irrespective of gender, are to submit or be subject "to one another in the fear of God"{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|KJV|Eph.&amp;nbsp;5:21&amp;nbsp;KJV}} or "out of reverence for Christ".{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|NIV|NIV}} [[Gilbert Bilezikian]] writes that in the highly debated Ephesians&amp;nbsp;5 passage, the verb "to be subject" or "to be submitted" appears in verse&amp;nbsp;21 which he describes as serving as a "hinge" between two different sections. The first section consists of verses 18-20, verse 21 is the connection between the two, and the second section consists of verses 22-33.&lt;ref name=Bilezikian&gt;Bilezikian, Gilbert. ''Beyond Sex Roles.'' Baker Book House, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8010-0885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.153}} When discussion begins at verse 22 in Ephesians&amp;nbsp;5, Paul appears to be reaffirming a chain of command principle within the family. However,

{{Quotation|...when interpretation begins with verse 21, the entire passage describes mutual submission within the family. The wife submits to her husband in everything "as unto the Lord." If her husband makes a request unworthy of her Lord, her primary loyalty is "unto the Lord." ...Instruction about submission is four times longer for husbands than for wives. The greatest burden of submission is clearly placed on the husband.&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Bruce. "The Christian Family: Mutual Submission or Chain of Command?" ''Mainstream Messenger'', Vol. 1, No. 3. November 1998. Online: http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mob2/family.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Advocates of [[Christian egalitarianism]] believe that this model has firm biblical support:
*The word translated "help" or "helper" in {{bibleref2|Genesis|2:18}} until quite recently was generally understood to subordinate a wife to her husband. The KJV translates it as God saying, "I will make a help meet for him". The first distortion was extrabiblical: the noun "help" and the adjective "meet" traditionally have been combined into a new noun, "helpmate". Thus, wives were often referred to as her husband's "helpmate". Next, from the word "help" were drawn inferences of authority/subjection distinctions between men and women. "Helper" was taken to mean that husband was boss and wife his domestic. It is now realized that of the 21 times the Hebrew word 'ezer is used in the Old Testament, in eight of those instances the term clearly means "savior"—another word for Jehovah God. For example, {{Bibleref2|Psalm|33:20}} says "the Lord…is our help ('ezer) and shield". {{Bibleref2|Psalm|121:1-2}} reads "I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help ('ezer) come from? My help ('ezer) comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth." That Hebrew word is not used in the Bible with reference to any subordinate person such a servant.&lt;ref name=Bilezikian/&gt;{{rp|p.28}} Thus, forms of 'ezer in the Hebrew Bible can mean either "to save" or "to be strong" or have the idea of power and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, R. David. ''Biblical Archaeology Review''. Jan/Feb 1983, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "two becoming one" concept, first cited in {{bibleref2|Gen.|2:24}}, was quoted by Jesus in his teachings on marriage and recorded almost identically in the gospels of both Matthew and Mark.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|19:4–6}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|10:7–9}} In those passages Jesus reemphasized the concept by adding a divine postscript to the Genesis passage: "So, they are no longer two, but one" (NIV).
*The Apostle Paul also quoted the Genesis 2:24 passage in {{bibleref2|Ephesians|5:1}}&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt; Describing it as a "profound mystery", he analogizes it to "Christ and the church".{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:32}} Then Paul states that every husband must love his wife as he loves himself.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph.|5:33}}
*Jesus actually ''forbids'' any hierarchy of relationships in Christian relationships. All three [[synoptic gospels]] record virtually the same teaching of Jesus, adding to its apparent significance:&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-567-04073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Matt.|20:25–26||Matt.&amp;nbsp;20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mark|10:42-45}} {{bibleref2c|Luke|22:25-27}}
*The [[Apostle Paul]] calls on husbands and wives to be subject ''to each other'' out of reverence for Christ—mutual submission.{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21}}
*As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the other. In truth, they are one.&lt;ref name="Staggs" /&gt; Bible scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] and Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] write that husband-wife equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually fulfilling marriages. They conclude that the Apostle Paul's statement, sometimes called the "Magna Carta of Humanity"&lt;ref&gt;Jewett, Paul K. ''Man as Male and Female: A Study in Sexual Relationships from a Theological Point of View.'' Eerdmans, 1990, p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-1597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}, applies to all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is ''neither male nor female'': for you are all ''one'' in Christ Jesus."
*The Apostle Peter calls husbands and wives "joint heirs of the grace of life" and cautions a husband who is not considerate to his wife and does not treat her with respect that his prayers will be hindered.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|3:7||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;3:7}}
*Each of the six times [[Aquila and Priscilla|Aquila and his wife Priscilla]] are mentioned by name in the New Testament, they are listed together. Their order of appearance alternates, with Aquila mentioned first in the first, third and fifth mentions, and Priscilla (Prisca) first in the other three.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|18:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:18|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:26|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|16:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:19|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:19|KJV}} King James Version&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisions of the Bible put Priscilla first, instead of Aquila, in Acts 18:26, following the Vulgate and a few Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Acts%2018:26 Acts 18:26 multi-version]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that Priscilla was the head of the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Among spouses, it is possible to submit without love, but it is impossible to love without submitting mutually to each other.{{Bibleref2c|Col.|3:8-9}}

The egalitarian paradigm leaves it up to the couple to decide who is responsible for what task or function in the home. Such decisions should be made rationally and wisely,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:15}} not based on gender or tradition. Examples of a couple's decision logic might include:
*which spouse is ''more competent'' for a particular task or function;
*which has ''better access'' to it;
*or if they decide both are similarly competent and have comparable access, they might make the decision based on who ''prefers'' that function or task, or conversely, which of them ''dislikes it less'' than the other. The egalitarian view holds that decisions about managing family responsibilities are made rationally through cooperation and negotiation, not on the basis of tradition (e.g., "man's work" or "woman's" work), nor any other irrelevant or irrational basis.&lt;ref name="UMC"&gt;{{cite web

=== Complementarian view ===
{{See also|Complementarianism}}

Complementarians hold to a hierarchical structure between husband and wife. They believe men and women have different gender-specific roles that allow each to ''complement'' the other, hence the designation "Complementarians". The Complementarian view of marriage holds that while the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, husbands and wives are given different functions and responsibilities by God that are based on gender, and that male leadership is biblically ordained so that the husband is always the senior authority figure. They state they "observe with deep concern" "accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the intelligent, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the loving, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ Core Beliefs{{snd}} the "Danvers Statement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082957/http://cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |date=2014-06-26 }}.

Scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 11:3: "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God", (KJV) are understood as meaning the wife is to be subject to her husband, if not unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galaxie.com/article/jbmw16-2-12 Meyer, Jason C..

[[Roman Catholic Church]] teaching on the role of women includes that of Pope Leo XIII in his 1880 encyclical ''Arcanum'' which states:
{{Quotation|The husband is the chief of the family and the head of the wife. The woman, because she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, must be subject to her husband and obey him; not, indeed, as a servant, but as a companion, so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honor nor dignity. Since the husband represents Christ, and since the wife represents the Church, let there always be, both in him who commands and in her who obeys, a heaven-born love guiding both in their respective duties."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo XIII Encyclical 1880 Arcanum {{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622095840/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html |archivedate=2009-06-22 |df= }} 1880 Arcanum]&lt;/ref&gt; This position was affirmed in the 1930 encyclical ''Casti Connubii,'' which invokes {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22}}, "Let women be subject to their husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ is the head of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121930_casti-connubii_en.html, Pope Pius XI, Casti Connubii]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though each of their churches is autonomous and self-governed, the official position of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (the largest Protestant denomination in the United States) is:
{{Quotation|The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp Southern Baptist Convention, Basic Beliefs] 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Biblical patriarchy===
{{see also|Biblical patriarchy|Pater familias}}

The patriarchal model of marriage is clearly the oldest one. It characterized the theological understanding of most Old Testament writers. It mandates the supremacy, at times the ultimate domination, of the husband-father in the family. In the first century Roman Empire, in the time of Jesus, Paul, and Peter, it was the law of the land and gave the husband absolute authority over his wife, children, and slaves—even the power of life or death. It subordinates all women.

Biblical patriarchy is similar to [[Complementarianism]] but with differences of degree and emphasis. Biblical patriarchists carry the husband-headship model considerably further and with more militancy. While Complementarians also hold to exclusively male leadership in both the home and the church, Biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/ballot_box/should_christians_support_a_wo.aspx Should Christians Support a Woman for the Office of Civil Magistrate?].&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed should not have careers outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/called_to_the_home_called_to_r.aspx Called to the Home — Called to Rule].&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarchy is based on authoritarianism—complete obedience or subjection to male authority as opposed to individual freedom. Patriarchy gives preeminence to the male in essentially all matters of religion and culture. It explicitly deprives all women of social, political, and economic rights. The marriage relationship simply reinforced this dominance of women by men, providing religious, cultural, and legal structures that clearly favor patriarchy to the exclusion of even basic human dignity for wives.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Are “The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy” Biblical? Part 1". {{cite web |url=http://rethinkingvisionforum.org/2011/08/11/are-%E2%80%9Cthe-biblical-tenets-of-patriarchy%E2%80%9D-biblical-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114657/http://rethinkingvisionforum.org/2011/08/11/are-%E2%80%9Cthe-biblical-tenets-of-patriarchy%E2%80%9D-biblical-part-1/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }} 16 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in classical patriarchy, the wives and children were always legally dependent upon the father, as were the slaves and other servants. It was the way of life throughout most of the Old Testament, religiously, legally, and culturally. However, it was not unique to Hebrew thought. With only minor variations, it characterized virtually every pagan culture of that day—including all Pre-Christian doctrine and practice.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

While Scripture allowed this approach in Old Testament times, nowhere does the Bible ordain it. In the Hebrew nation, patriarchy seems to have evolved as an expression of male dominance and supremacy, and of a double standard that prevailed throughout much of the Old Testament. Its contemporary advocates insist that it is the only biblically valid model for marriage today. They argue that it was established at Creation, and thus is a firm, unalterable decree of God about the relative positions of men and women.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/446579/patria-potestas]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical patriarchists see what they describe as a crisis of this era being what they term to be a systematic attack on the "timeless truths of biblical patriarchy". They believe such an attack includes the movement to "subvert the biblical model of the family, and redefine the very meaning of fatherhood and motherhood, masculinity, femininity, and the parent and child relationship."&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt; Arguing from the biblical presentation of God revealing himself "as masculine, not feminine", they believe God ordained distinct gender roles for man and woman as part of the created order. They say "Adam’s headship over Eve was established at the beginning, before sin entered the world". Their view is that the male has God-given authority and mandate to direct "his" household in paths of obedience to God. They refer to man's "dominion" beginning within the home, and a man’s qualification to lead and ability to lead well in the public square is based upon his prior success in ''ruling his household''.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as "two-point Complementarianism" (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as "three-point" or "full" complementarianism (male leadership in family, church ''and society'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/men_and_women_and_the_creation.aspx Men and Women and the Creation Order, Part 1 - Vision Forum Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriarchists teach that "the woman was created as a helper to her husband, as the bearer of children, and as a "keeper at home", concluding that the God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household. Biblical patriarchists consider that "faithfulness to Christ requires that (Biblical patriarchy) be believed, taught, and lived". They claim that the "man is...the image and glory of God in terms of authority, while the woman is the glory of man". They teach that a wife is to be ''obedient'' to her "head" (husband), based upon [[Old Testament]] teachings and models.

==Biblical foundations and history==

Christians believe that marriage is considered in its ideal according to the purpose of [[God in Christianity|God]]. At the heart of God's design for marriage is companionship and intimacy.

The biblical picture of marriage expands into something much broader, with the husband and wife relationship illustrating the relationship between [[Bride of Christ|Christ and the church]].

It is also considered in its actual occurrence, sometimes involving failure. Therefore, the Bible speaks on the subject of [[divorce]].&lt;ref name="Staggs" /&gt; The New Testament recognizes a place for singleness. [[Salvation]] within Christianity is not dependent on the continuation of a biological lineage.&lt;ref name="EOC" /&gt;

[[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Old Testament,&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet scholars doubt that it was common among average Israelites because of the wealth needed to practice it.&lt;ref&gt;Gene McAfee [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t120.e0669 "Sex"] The Oxford Companion to the Bible. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[biblical patriarchs]] and [[kings of Israel]] are described as engaged in polygamous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dale Martin]] [https://vimeo.com/8581466 lecture].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Betrothal]] (''[[erusin]]''), which is merely a binding promise to get married, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Marriage|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a wife was regarded as property in biblical times, the betrothal (''erusin'') was effected simply by purchasing her from her father (or [[parental guardian|guardian]]);&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; the girl’s consent is not explicitly required by any biblical law.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt;

Like the adjacent Arabic culture ([[Pre-Islamic Arabia|in the pre-Islamic period]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 81&lt;/ref&gt; the act of marriage appears mainly to have consisted of the groom fetching the bride, although among the [[Israelites]] (unlike the Arabs) the procession was a festive occasion, accompanied by music, dancing, and lights.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; To celebrate the marriage, week-long feasts were sometimes held.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt;

In Old Testament times, a wife was regarded as [[Personal property|chattel]], belonging to her husband.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; The descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wives were usually looked after with care, and [[bigamy|bigamous]] men were expected to ensure that they give their first wife food, clothing, and sexual activity.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; A divorced couple could get back together unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

=== Jesus on marriage, divorce, and remarriage ===
[[File:Christian-Marriage-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|Sometimes used as a [[symbol]] for Christian marriage: Two gold wedding rings interlinked with the Greek letters ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'' (X) and ''[[Rho (letter)|rho]]'' (P)—the first two letters in the Greek word for "Christ" (see [[Labarum]])]]

The Bible clearly addresses marriage and divorce. Those in troubled marriages are encouraged to seek counseling and restoration because most divorces are neither necessary nor unavoidable.&lt;ref name=Desai/&gt;

{{Quotation|"Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh"? So they ''are'' no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."|{{Bibleref2|Matt.|19:4–6}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:7–9}}}}

In both Matthew and Mark, Jesus appealed to God's will in creation. He builds upon the narratives in where male and female are created together{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} and for one another.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Genesis|2:24}} Thus Jesus takes a firm stand on the permanence of marriage in the original will of God. This corresponds closely with the position of the Pharisee school of thought led by [[Shammai]], at the start of the first millennium,&lt;ref name="Git910"&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 9:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah]]'' ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] only), 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' (Jerusalem Talmud only), 1:16b&lt;/ref&gt; with which Jesus would have been familiar. By contrast, [[Rabbinic Judaism]] subsequently took the opposite view, espoused by [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], the leader of the other major Pharisee school of thought at the time; in Hillel's view, men were allowed to divorce their wives for any reason.&lt;ref name="Git910" /&gt;

Some hold that marriage vows are unbreakable, so that even in the distressing circumstances in which a couple separates, they are still married from God’s point of view. This is the Roman Catholic church’s position, although occasionally the church will declare a marriage to be “null” (in other words, it never really was a marriage).&lt;ref&gt;"Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Matrimony". [www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; William Barclay (1907-1978) has written:
{{Quotation|There is no time in history when the marriage bond stood in greater peril of destruction than in the days when Christianity first came into this world. At that time the world was in danger of witnessing the almost total break-up of marriage and the collapse of the home…. Theoretically no nation ever had a higher ideal of marriage than the Jews had. The voice of God had said, "I hate divorce" (in {{Bibleref2|Malachi|2:16}})|William Barclay&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, William. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Westminster John Knox Press, Rev Upd edition (December 1, 2001). {{ISBN|978-0664224912}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jesus brought together two passages from Genesis, reinforcing the basic position on marriage found in Jewish scripture. Thus, he implicitly emphasized that it is God-made ("God has joined together"), "male and female,"{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} lifelong ("let no one separate"), and monogamous ("a man…his wife").&lt;ref name="Stagg NT"&gt;Stagg, Frank.''New Testament Theology''. Broadman, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] used the image of marriage and the family to teach the basics about the [[Kingdom of God]]. He inaugurated his ministry by blessing the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast at Cana]]. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he set forth a new commandment concerning marriage, teaching that lustful looking constitutes [[adultery]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|5:28}} He also [[Supersessionism|superseded a Mosaic Law]] allowing divorce with his teaching that "…anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality (Gk. ''porneia''),&lt;ref&gt;Thayer and Smith. "Greek Lexicon entry for Porneia". ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt; causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery".{{Bibleref2c|Mt|5:32||cf. Mt. 5:32}} {{Bibleref2c|Mt|19:19}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk|10:11}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk|16:18}} Similar Pauline teachings are found in {{Bibleref2|1cor|7:10–11|ESV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 7:10–11}}. The exception clause—"except for…"—uses the Greek word ''porneia'' which is variously translated "fornication" (KJV), "marital unfaithfulness" (NIV 1984), "sexual immorality" (NIV 2011), "unchastity" (RSV), ''et&amp;nbsp;al''. ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon, KJV'' says ''porneia'' includes a variety of sexual "deviations" to include "illicit sexual intercourse, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, intercourse with animals, etc., sexual intercourse with close relatives…."{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|18}}

[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] says that manuscripts disagree as to the presence in the original text of the phrase "except for fornication".&lt;ref name="Stagg NT"/&gt;{{rp|pp.300–301}} Stagg writes: "Divorce always represents failure…a deviation from God's will…. There is grace and redemption where there is contrition and repentance…. There is no clear authorization in the New Testament for remarriage after divorce." Stagg interprets the chief concern of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:32}} as being "to condemn the criminal act of the man who divorces an innocent wife…. Jesus was rebuking the husband who victimizes an innocent wife and thinks that he makes it right with her by giving her a divorce". He points out that Jesus refused to be trapped by the [[Pharisees]] into choosing between the strict and liberal positions on divorce as held at the time in Judaism. When they asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:3}} he answered by reaffirming God's will as stated in Genesis {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|1:27}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|2:24}}, that in marriage husband and wife are made "one flesh", and what God has united man must not separate.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:4-6}}&lt;ref name="Stagg NT"/&gt;{{rp|pp.300–301}}

There is no evidence that Jesus himself ever married, and considerable evidence that he remained single. In contrast to Judaism and many other traditions,&lt;ref name="EOC"&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey Bromiley. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity.'' Brill Academic Publishers (November 2000). {{ISBN|90-04-11695-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.283}} he taught that there is a place for voluntary singleness in Christian service. He believed marriage could be a distraction from an urgent mission,&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''The Gospel according to women: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west,'' Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was living in a time of crisis and urgency where the [[Kingdom of God]] would be established where there would be no marriage nor giving in marriage:

{{Quotation|
"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the [[World to Come|age to come]], [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]]."|{{bibleref2|Luke|18:29–30}}
}}

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:28-30|NIV}} Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he affirms that at the resurrection "people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven."

=== New Testament beyond the Gospels ===

The [[Saint Paul|Apostle Paul]] quoted passages from Genesis almost verbatim in two of his New Testament books. He used marriage not only to describe the kingdom of God, as Jesus had done, but to define also the nature of the 1st-century Christian church. His [[theology|theological view]] was a Christian development of the [[Old Testament]] parallel between marriage and the relationship between God and [[Israel]]. He analogized the church as a bride and Christ as the bridegroom─drawing parallels between Christian marriage and the relationship between Christ and the [[Christian Church|Church]].

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century.]]

There is no hint in the New Testament that Jesus was ever married, and no clear evidence that Paul was ever married. However, both Jesus and Paul seem to view marriage as a legitimate calling from God for Christians. Paul elevates singleness to that of the preferable position, but does offer a caveat suggesting this is "because of the impending crisis"—which could itself extend to present times (see also [[Pauline privilege]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Corinthians|7:1,7-9,17,26-28,38,40|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's primary issue was that marriage adds concerns to one's life that detract from their ability to serve God without distraction.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family.'' Paulist Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8091-4118-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Corinthians|7:32-35|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have speculated that Paul may have been a widower since prior to his conversion to Christianity he was a [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] and member of the [[Sanhedrin]], positions in which the social norm of the day required the men to be married. But it is just as likely that he never married at all.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, Jay E. ''Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the Bible,'' Zondervan, 1986, {{ISBN|0-310-51111-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, Paul acknowledges the mutuality of marital relations, and recognizes that his own singleness is "a particular gift from God" that others may not necessarily have. He writes: "Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."{{Bibleref2c|1Co|7:8||1&amp;nbsp;Cor 7:8}}

[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] indicates that [[bishop]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s must be "husbands of one wife", and that women must have one husband. This is usually understood to legislate against polygamy rather than to require marriage:

{{quotation|Now the overseer (bishop) is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:2||1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;3:2}}}}

{{quotation|A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:12||1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;3:12}}}}

{{quotation|The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint (or ordain) elders in every town, as I directed you. An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.|{{Bibleref2|Titus|1:5-6}}}}

In the Roman Age, female widows who did not remarry were considered more pure than those who did.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walcot: On Widows and their Reputation in Antiquity. In: Symbolae Osloenses, Volume 66, Issue 1. 1991: pp.5-26&lt;/ref&gt; Such widows were known as ''one man woman'' (''enos andros gune'') in the epistles of Paul.{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:9||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:9}} Paul writes:
{{Quotation|No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds".|{{Bibleref2|1Tim|5:9-10||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:9-10}}}}

Paul allowed widows to remarry.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|7:39-40||1&amp;nbsp;Cor.&amp;nbsp;7:39-40}} {{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:11-16||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:11-16}} Paul says that only ''one-man women'' older than 60 years{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:9-10||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:9-10}} can make the list of Christian widows who did special tasks in the community, but that younger widows should remarry to hinder sin.

=== Marriage and early Church Fathers ===

Building on what they saw the example of Jesus and Paul advocating, some early [[Church Fathers]] placed less value on the family and saw [[celibacy]] and freedom from family ties as a preferable state.

[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Nicene Fathers]] such as [[Augustine]] believed that marriage was a sacrament because it was a symbol used by Paul to express Christ's love of the Church. However, there was also an apocalyptic dimension in his teaching, and he was clear that if everybody stopped marrying and having children that would be an admirable thing; it would mean that the [[Kingdom of God]] would return all the sooner and the [[End times|world would come to an end]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''Gospel According to Women.'' Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view reflects the [[Manichaean]] past of Augustine.

While upholding the New Testament teaching that marriage is "honourable in all and the bed undefiled,"&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 13:4&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that "yet, whenever it comes to the actual process of generation, the very embrace which is lawful and honourable cannot be effected without the ardour of lust...This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer accounted sin in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except from sin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15071.htm Augustine, "On Marriage and Concupiscence," Book I], cp. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Tertullian]] and Gregory of Nyssa were church fathers who were married. They each stressed that the happiness of marriage was ultimately rooted in misery. They saw marriage as a state of bondage that could only be cured by celibacy. They wrote that at the very least, the virgin woman could expect release from the "governance of a husband and the chains of children."&lt;ref&gt;Scholer, David M.''Women in early Christianity.'' Garland Publishing, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-1074-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.151}}

[[Tertullian]] argued that second marriage, having been freed from the first by death,"will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication," partly based on the reasoning that this involves desiring to marry a woman out of sexual ardor, which a Christian convert is to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.vi.ix.html "Chapter IX.—Second Marriage a Species of Adultery"] ANF04. Tertullian, Part Fourth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also advocating celibacy and virginity as preferable alternatives to marriage, [[Jerome]] wrote: "It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity. No one can make a comparison between two things if one is good and the other evil."&lt;ref&gt;''Classical library from 'Select Letters of St. Jerome,''&amp;nbsp;' Letter 22. tr. by F. A. Wright. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[First Corinthians]] 7:1 he reasons, "It is good, he says, for a man not to touch a woman. If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.vi.vi.I.html "Against Jovinianus," Book 1], Cps. 7,13,16,33&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[John Chrysostom]] wrote: "...virginity is better than marriage, however good.... Celibacy is...an imitation of the angels. Therefore, virginity is as much more honorable than marriage, as the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ, Himself, is the glory of virginity."&lt;ref&gt;St. John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on First Corinthians, NPNF, s. 1, v. 12, pp. 248–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, said that the first commandment given to men was to increase and multiply, but now that the earth was full there was no need to continue this process of multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;St. Cyprian, "Of the Discipline and Advantage of Chastity," ''ANF,'' v. 5, p.1251.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of marriage was reflected in the lack of any formal [[liturgy]] formulated for marriage in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]]. No special ceremonial was devised to celebrate Christian marriage—despite the fact that the Church had produced liturgies to celebrate the [[Eucharist]], [[Baptism]] and [[Confirmation]]. It was not important for a couple to have their nuptials blessed by a [[priest]]. People could marry by mutual agreement in the presence of witnesses.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

At first, the old Roman pagan rite was used by Christians, although modified superficially. The first detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates from the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. This system, known as Spousals, persisted after the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

The Catholic Church allowed marriages to take place inside churches only starting with the 16th century, beforehand religious marriages happened on the porch of the church.&lt;ref name=monger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monger|first1=George P.|year=2004|chapter=Christian Weddings|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JlWxBYs40C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=marriage+ceremony+%22early+christianity%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OQX7VNjyPMKsUaGlgfAM&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBzgK|title=Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=ABC CLIO|pages=70–71|isbn=9781576079874|oclc=469368346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that God himself is the author of the sacred institution of marriage, which is His way of showing love for those He created. Marriage is a divine institution that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God. Holy Matrimony is another name for sacramental marriage. Marriage is intended to be a faithful, exclusive, lifelong union of a man and a woman. Committing themselves completely to each other, a Catholic husband and wife strive to sanctify each other, bring children into the world, and educate them in the Catholic way of life. Man and woman, although created differently from each other, complement each other. This complementarity draws them together in a mutually loving union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1602–1605|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P51.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valid marriage of baptized Christians is one of the seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic sacraments]]. The sacrament of marriage is the only sacrament that a priest does not administer directly; a priest, however, is the chief witness of the husband and wife's administration of the sacrament to each other at the wedding ceremony in a Catholic church.

The Roman Catholic Church views that Christ himself established the sacrament of marriage at the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast of Cana]]; therefore, since it is a divine institution, neither the Church nor state can alter the basic meaning and structure of marriage. Husband and wife give themselves totally to each other in a union that lasts until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|page=1643|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P55.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priest]]s are instructed that marriage is part of God's natural law and to support the couple if they do choose to marry. Today it is common for Roman Catholics to enter into a "mixed marriage" between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic. Couples entering into a mixed marriage are usually allowed to marry in a Catholic church provided their decision is of their own accord and they intend to remain together for life, to be faithful to each other, and to have children which are brought up in the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1633–1637|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman Catholic teaching, marriage has two objectives: 
•the good of the spouses themselves
•and the procreation and education of children (1983 code of canon law, c.1055; 1994 catechism, par.2363). Hence "entering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, P. "Sacrament of Holy Matrimony."&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal procedure for a priest to ask the prospective bride and groom about their plans to have children before officiating at their wedding. The Roman Catholic Church may refuse to marry anyone unwilling to have children, since procreation by "the marriage act" is a fundamental part of marriage.&lt;ref name="humanae_vitae"&gt;[[Pope Paul VI]]."Humanæ Vitæ." 1968-7-25. Accessed: 2009-7-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus usage of any form of [[contraception]], [[in vitro fertilization]], or [[birth control]] besides [[Natural Family Planning]] is a grave offense against the sanctity of marriage and ultimately against God.&lt;ref name="humanae_vitae" /&gt;

=== Protestantism ===

[[File:Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox, 1729 by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''The Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox'' by [[William Hogarth]], c. 1729 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|N.Y.]]).]]

==== Purposes ====

Essentially all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations hold marriage to be ordained by God for the union between a man and a woman. They see the primary purposes of this union as intimate companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings.&lt;ref&gt;UMC&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants generally approve of [[birth control]] and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God. While condoning [[divorce]] only under limited circumstances, most Protestant churches allow for divorce and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family,'' Paulist Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8091-4118-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian fundamentalism|Conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] take a stricter view of the nature of marriage. They consider marriage a solemn [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] between wife, husband and [[God]]. Most view sexual relations as appropriate only within a marriage. Divorce is permissible, if at all, only in very specific circumstances (for example, sexual immorality or abandonment by the non-believer).

The [[United Methodist Church]], the second largest Protestant denomination in the United States, specifically holds that "the covenant of marriage was established by God who created us male and female for each other".&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Karen B. Westerfield|title=American Methodist Worship|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780190454203|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodists further teach that marriage is "God's gift and covenant intended to imitate [[New Covenant|God's covenant with humankind]]"&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"/&gt; that "Christians enter in their [[baptism]]."&lt;ref name="Church2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church 2016|date=16 December 2016|publisher=United Methodist Publishing House|language=English|isbn=9781501833250|page=623|quote=For the church, the marriage covenant is gounded in the covenant between God and God's people into which Christians enter in their baptism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rite]] used in the [[Free Methodist Church]] proclaims that marriage is "more than a legal contract, being a bond of union made in heaven, into which you enter discreetly and reverently."&lt;ref name="Tucker2011"/&gt;

==== Roles and responsibilities ====

Roles and responsibilities of husband and wives now vary considerably on a continuum between the long-held male dominant/female submission view and a shift toward equality (without sameness)&lt;ref&gt;Steil, Janice M. ''Marital Equality: Its Relationship to the Well-Being of Husbands and Wives.'' Sage. 1997. {{ISBN|0-8039-5251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the woman and the man.&lt;ref&gt;Throckmorton, Anne. [http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=3654 "The Lives of Wives: Their Changing Roles."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805222142/http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=3654 |date=2012-08-05 }} University of Virginia, January 9, 2008. Accessed 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable debate among many Christians today—not just Protestants—whether equality of husband and wife or male headship is the biblically ordained view, and even if it is biblically permissible. The divergent opinions fall into two main groups: [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] (who call for husband-headship and wife-submission) and [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] (who believe in full partnership equality in which couples can discover and negotiate roles and responsibilities in marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/august/8.55.html |title=Editor's Bookshelf: Creating Husbands and Fathers |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Neff |first=David |date=2004-08-01 |work=Christianity Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no debate that {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:12-32|NIV}} presents a historically benevolent husband-headship/wife-submission model for marriage. The questions are (a)&amp;nbsp;how these [[New Testament household codes]] are to be reconciled with the calls earlier in Chapter 5 (cf. verses 1, 18, 21) for mutual submission among all believers, and (b)&amp;nbsp;the meaning of "head" in v.23. It is important to note that verse 22 contains no verb in the original manuscripts:&lt;ref name="Staggs"/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5}} (NIV)
::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children 2 and walk in the way of love....
::&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; be filled with the Spirit....
::&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
::&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Wives, ''[submit yourselves]'' to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
::&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; for we are members of his body. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
{{main|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}

[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Ilja Repin (1894, Russian museum).jpg|thumb|''The Wedding of [[Nicholas II]] and [[Grand duke|Grand Duchess]] [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]'', by [[Ilya Repin|Ilya Yefimovich Repin]], 1894 ([[Russian Museum|Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]).]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriage is treated as a [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament), and as an [[ordination]]. It serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union before God.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7105 Fitzgerald, Thomas.

Christianitytoday.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is considered a [[martyr]]dom as each spouse learns to die to self for the sake of the other. Like all Mysteries, Orthodox marriage is more than just a celebration of something which already exists: it is the creation of something new, the imparting to the couple of the [[Divine grace|grace]] which transforms them from a 'couple' into husband and wife within the [[Body of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt;

[[File:Wedding ring Louvre AC924.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine [[wedding ring]], depicting Christ uniting the bride and groom, 7th century, [[niello]]ed gold ([[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]]).]]

Marriage is an [[icon]] (image) of the relationship between Jesus and the Church. This is somewhat akin to the Old Testament [[prophet]]s' use of marriage as an analogy to describe the relationship between God and Israel. Marriage is the simplest, most basic unity of the church: a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] where "two or three are gathered together in Jesus' name."{{bibleref2c|Mt|18:20|KJV}}&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt; The home is considered a consecrated space (the ritual for the Blessing of a House is based upon that of the Consecration of a Church), and the husband and wife are considered the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of that congregation. However, they do not "perform" the Sacraments in the [[house church]]; they "live" the Sacrament of Marriage. Because marriage is considered to be a [[pilgrimage]] wherein the couple walk side by side toward the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], marriage to a non-Orthodox partner is discouraged, though it may be permitted.

Unlike Western Christianity, Eastern Christians do not consider the sacramental aspect of the marriage to be conferred by the couple themselves. Rather, the marriage is conferred by the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] acting through the priest. Furthermore, no one besides a bishop or priest—not even a [[deacon]]—may perform the Sacred Mystery.

The external sign of the marriage is the placing of wedding [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] upon the heads of the couple, and their sharing in a "Common Cup" of wine. Once crowned, the couple walk a circle three times in a ceremonial "dance" in the middle of the church, while the choir intones a joyous three-part antiphonal hymn, "Dance, [[Isaiah]]"

The sharing of the Common Cup symbolizes the transformation of their union from a common marriage into a sacred union. The wedding is usually performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] at which the couple receives [[Holy Communion]]. Traditionally, the wedding couple would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, and there is a special prayer said by the priest at the removal of the crowns.

Divorce is discouraged. Sometimes out of ''[[economia]]'' (mercy) a marriage may be dissolved if there is no hope whatever for a marriage to fulfill even a semblance of its intended sacramental character.&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt; The standard formula for remarriage is that the Orthodox Church joyfully blesses the first marriage, merely performs the second, barely tolerates the third, and invariably forbids the fourth.&lt;ref name="Hapgood"&gt;{{Citation|last =Hapgoood|first =Isabel F.|year =1922|publicationdate=1975|title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=2nd|pages =291–305, 604–605|place =Englewood, N.J.|publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:07Thessaloniki Agia Sophia09.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Church prepared for a wedding ([[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]], [[Thessaloniki]].)]]

[[Early church]] texts forbid marriage between an Orthodox Christian and a [[Heresy|heretic]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] (which would include all non-Orthodox Christians). Traditional Orthodox Christians forbid [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s with other denominations. More liberal ones perform them, provided that the couple formally commit themselves to rearing their children in the Orthodox faith.

All people are called to celibacy—human beings are all born into [[virginity]], and Orthodox Christians are expected by [[Sacred Tradition]] to remain in that state unless they are called into marriage and that call is sanctified.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"&gt;Gregory (Grabbe), Bishop. ''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective.'' Liberty, Tenn: St. John of Kronstadt Press, 1986
&lt;/ref&gt; The church blesses two paths on the journey to salvation: [[monasticism]] and marriage. Mere celibacy, without the sanctification of monasticism, can fall into selfishness and tends to be regarded with disfavour by the Church.&lt;ref name="Grabbe" /&gt;

Orthodox priests who serve in [[parish]]es are usually married. They must marry prior to their ordination. If they marry after they are ordained they are not permitted to continue performing sacraments. If their wife dies, they are forbidden to remarry; if they do, they may no longer serve as a priest. A married man may be ordained as a priest or deacon. However, a priest or deacon is not permitted to enter into matrimony after ordination. Bishops must always be monks and are thus celibate. However, if a married priest is widowed, he may receive monastic tonsure and thus become eligible for the episcopate.

The Eastern Orthodox Church believes that marriage is an eternal union of spouses, but in Heaven there will not be a procreative bond of marriage.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The [[miaphysitism|Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] hold views almost identical to those of the ([[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] allows second marriages only in cases of adultery or death of spouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/coptic-pope-resists-court-ruling-divorce-remarriage Coptic Pope resists court ruling on divorce, remarriage | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt].

{{See also|Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormonism and polygamy}}
In the teachings of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[celestial marriage|celestial (or eternal) marriage]] is a [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] between a man, a woman, and [[God in Mormonism|God]] performed by a [[priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] authority in a [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of the church.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt; Celestial marriage is intended to continue forever into the [[afterlife]] if the man and woman do not break their covenants.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-38-eternal-marriage "Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, eternally married couples are often referred to as being "[[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]]" to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt; (Thus, "families are forever" is a common phrase in the LDS Church.) A celestial marriage is considered a requirement for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt;

In some countries, celestial marriages can be recognized as civil marriages; in other cases, couples are civilly married outside of the temple and are later sealed in a celestial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 3.5.&lt;/ref&gt; (The church will no longer perform a celestial marriage for a couple unless they are first or simultaneously legally married.) The church encourages its members to be in good standing with it so that they may marry or be sealed in the temple. A celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a "cancellation of a sealing" may be granted, but only by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carries somewhat of a stigma in the Mormon culture; the church teaches that the "gospel of Jesus Christ—including repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love—provides the remedy for conflict in marriage."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/topics/divorce "Gospel Topics: Divorce"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: "No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry. Nor should he counsel a person to divorce his or her spouse. Those decisions must originate and remain with the individual. When a marriage ends in divorce, or if a husband and wife separate, they should always receive counseling from Church leaders."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 7.2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In church temples, members of the LDS Church perform vicarious celestial marriages for deceased couples who were legally married.

==== New Church (or Swedenborgian Church) ====

[[The New Church]] teaches that marriage love (sometimes translated "conjugial love") is "the precious jewel of human life and the repository of the Christian religion" because the love shared between a husband and a wife is the source of all peace and joy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/conjugial-love-rogers/contents/4570 Conjugial Love 457]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] coined the term "conjugial" (not to be confused with the more general term for marriage, "conjugial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/conjugial-love-rogers/contents/980|title=Conjugial Love 98|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjugial |title=Conjugial &amp;#124; Define Conjugial at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to describe the special love experienced by married partners.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.

==== Jehovah's Witnesses ====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] view marriage to be a permanent arrangement with the only possible exception being adultery. Divorce is strongly discouraged even when adultery is committed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/world-view/things-jehovah-s-witnesses-believe-marriage-efe80a14d1d56e08}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the wronged spouse is free to forgive the unfaithful one. There are provisions for a domestic separation in the event of "failure to provide for one's household" and domestic violence, or spiritual resistance on the part of a partner. Even in such situations though divorce would be considered grounds for loss of privileges in the congregation. Remarrying after death or a proper divorce is permitted. Marriage is the only situation where any type of sexual interaction is acceptable, and even then certain restrictions apply to acts such as oral and anal sex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Married persons who are known to commit such acts may in fact lose privileges in the congregation as they are supposed to be setting a good example to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Watchtower]] September 15, 2006, March 15, 1983, November 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]], many Lutheran, reformed and united churches in [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], some reformed churches in [[Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches]] does not administer sacramental marriage to same-sex couples, but blesses same-sex unions through the use of a specific liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toronto.anglican.ca/uploads.php?id=4d83da6cc1ad3 Toronto.Anglican.ca:Pastoral guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Christian Church, and other more conservative [[Protestant]] denominations do not perform or recognize same-sex marriage because they do not consider it as marriage at all. The '''Global Anglican Future Conference''' ('''GAFCON''') consisting of the Church of Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda; Churches of South Cone, Australia, parts of England, Canada, USA and Church of India through the Jerusalem Conference condemned same-sexual preferences and marriages as not biblical and sin against God.

'''Cipher''' is an American [[hardcore punk]], [[metalcore]] band that formed in 1996 in [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], New York. Cipher's core line-up consisted of Maurice "Moe" Mitchell (vocals), Danny "Cipher" Bobis (drums), Chris Fry (guitar) and Krys Maniecki (bass).&lt;ref name="All Music"&gt;[[Eduardo Riverdavia|Riverdavia]]  [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p413376|pure_url=yes}}|Cipher Biography].  Allmusic.  Retrieved April 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The band's earliest demo's released when they were High School Juniors. These releases were marked by a noticeably more metal and progressive sound than their contemporaries in the Long Island Hardcore scene. Another distinct element of Cipher's sound was Moe Ciphers vocals which were expressed as rhythmic, staccato yells rather than screams which drew some comparisons to Hip hop.  Cipher's music addressed socio-political activism, hardcore scene politics and identity.

Later releases became progressively pointed in their political critiques and complex in their musical structure.  The release of the EP ''Protoculture'' marks a distinct change in artistic direction for Cipher.  The four song recording was the first time Cipher put together a compilation of work written for the express purpose of being released as a unit.  The outcome was a treatment on [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]], spiritual indecision, and the role of the individual in changing her/his reality.

Cipher has released three demos (Serial, 99 cent Demo, 2),  one EP (''Protoculture''),  one 6&amp;nbsp;inch EP (''Burnt Halos''), and one music video (for "Reaching Higher States" off the ''Antidote'' album).  The band has become highly regarded in the Hardcore underground as a consistent voice of radical political dissent and musical experimentation.   In 2003, the band was featured in James Spooner's cult classic documentary ''[[Afro-Punk (film)|Afro-Punk]]''.  In 2005, Cipher released their first non-DIY, nationally distributed release, ''Children of God's Fire''. ''Children of God's Fire'' has gone on to become an emblematic record in the band's history and an influential record, seen as a needed departure from the apolitical recordings popular in mainstream heavy music.

Since their 2005 release ''Children of God's Fire'', the band had several line-up changes with the exception of founding members Danny Bobis and Maurice Mitchell.

In 2010, the band released their second major release, ''The Joyous Collapse''. The record is Cipher's attempt at chronicling the internal contradictions and struggles of daily life, our many overlapping identities, and the many forms of oppression we encounter in society. To support the release, the band embarked on a 48 date DIY Summer Tour from the east coast to the west coast of North America. The Band suffered many hardships during this tour, most notably their van breaking down along the way.

On July 24, 2011, founding member Danny Bobis went missing while surfing in Indonesia. Tragically, on July 28, 2011 after 4 days of searching Bobis' body was found.

Cipher has since been on hiatus pending further detail.

On August 23, 2014, Cipher performed at Afropunk with both newer and older members headed by founding member Maurice Mitchell. The group also did an interview for Afropunk stating, "I know Danny was feeling every single moment of it. I know Danny was rocking with us."

On July 27, 2017, many of the past members reunited to perform at THIS IS HARDCORE in Philadelphia, PA. 

== Politics ==
Cipher's politics have developed throughout the years.  Cipher's early politics were not born out of a coherent ideology.   Their earliest recordings include vague [[anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] statements and ruminations on [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes.  These records provide insights into Cipher's future political leanings but are notably unrefined in their execution.  Although never explicitly a "straightedge band", all four original band members either identified as straightedge or led a drug-free lifestyle, independent of straightedge culture and politics.  To this day both Danny Cipher and Moe Cipher continue to lead striaghtedge / drug-free lifestyles.  Although not explicitly a "[[vegan]] or vegetarian band", three of the four original band members were either vegan or vegetarian.  To this day Moe Cipher maintains a vegan lifestyle.  In 1998 Cipher's music took on a distinctly revolutionary racial consciousness and an explicitly anti-racist bent.  By 2000 Cipher's politics had become more oppositional in nature and more urgent in its push for dramatic [[social change]].  At this point, Cipher's politics had matured to a balanced challenge of race, class, and gender in contemporary society.  The most noticeable shift in this period of Cipher's political development was a pronounced gender critique.  This enhanced [[feminist critique]] is most noticeable on songs like "Woman," featured on Antidote.  By 2005 Cipher had adopted on a "total-liberation" ethos, exposing a need for total social upheaval in order to develop a new society that respected the autonomy of all living beings, human and animal as well as the Earth's environment.  Cipher's political message promotes [[animal rights]] although not all the current members of Cipher are vegan.  This represents a continuation of the politics Cipher had in its inception when most members were vegan or vegetarian.  Additionally, their understanding of a revolutionary future would not necessitate all humanity to align under ridged guidelines of behavior.  Cipher suggests a path to total liberation in stages.  An initial stage would require organizing with people where ever they are in their political consciousness.  Such a posture relies on points of commonality and solidarity rather than points of difference.

'''Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics'''  is an activity dedicated to the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of objects of historical and personal value made from [[plastics]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of [[plastic]] material whether they are [[Synthetic plastic|synthetic]] or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=2874019|title=Our Plastic Age|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards [[biodegradable plastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/what-you-can-do-keep-plastic-out-ocean.html|title=What You Can Do to Keep Plastic out of the Ocean {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Odile|date=Spring 2014|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material, a Maturing Profession spring 2014. Conservation of plastics|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/pdf/v29n1.pdf|journal=Conservation Perspectives the GCI Newsletter|volume=|pages=4–9|via=The Getty Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification and composition of plastics  ==
All plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.

== Identifying plastics ==
Identification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Plastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to  check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=Care and Identification of Objects Made from Plastic|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/08-04.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=|pages=|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technology like, [[Optical spectrometer|Optical Spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infared spectroscopy]] along with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other forms of identification include [[elemental analysis]], thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.

[http://www.modip.ac.uk/ MoDiP], the Museum of Design in plastics,  has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects  manufacturing date,  manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modip.ac.uk/resources/curators_guide/A-Z_plastics|title=A - Z of plastics materials {{!}} Museum of Design in Plastics, MoDiP|website=www.modip.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.

== Common plastics ==
These are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:
* Cellulose Esters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/preserving.html|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material a Maturing Profession (Feature)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plasticized PVC,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ([[Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl Chloride]], PVC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic|title=Everything You Need To Know About PVC Plastic|last=Staff|first=Creative Mechanisms|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary.

* [[Cellulose nitrate|Cellulose Nitrate]]
* [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]]
* [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized Rubber]] 
* [[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]]

[[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]] have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.

== Deterioration ==
Perhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/identification-of-plastics-by-looking-touching-and-smelling|title=Identification of plastics by looking, touching and smelling|work=Blog|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know  the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.

=== Causes of deterioration  ===
The cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:

# '''Age'''-  when plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century they were composed of semi-organic material, thus these over the years these objects have deteriorated due to lack of research and improper handling of these plastics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Without enough time to care for objects the older objects have deteriorated. 
# '''Chemical''' - Depending on the objects' chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react overtime. Other chemical reactions come from heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives and biological attacks as these can cause a reaction in the polymer to speed up deterioration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chemical reactions are also caused by objects coming into contact with water and oxygen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# '''Storage-'''  When objects are improperly stored is when contamination and deterioration can occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area as this causes the polymers to react to the environment and will begin to deteriorate and possible contaminate surrounding objects. Storage should also be thought of as when an object is on exhibit as this is when the object is on display with lights and its temperature and humidity can fluctuate, being able to create a plan to adjust the exhibit case while on display can help prevent any damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Improper handling''' - This is due in part to improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on material that do not support those cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also when handling the objects human error can occur that can cause abrasions or scratches.

=== Types of deterioration  ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to  As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.

* '''Photo-oxidative degradation''' refers to plastic object degrading by being exposed to UV and Visible Light although the type of wavelength that will damage the plastic depends on the composition of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Balijit|date=2007|title=Mechanistic Implications of Plastic Degradation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=93|pages=561–584|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; In General however, plastic will be affected by light and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible. 
* '''[[Thermal degradation of polymers|Thermal degradation]]''' affects the whole unit of the polymer that the object is composed of and is affected by the temperature and amount of light the object is exposed to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* '''Ozone-Induced degradation''' will deteriorate saturated and  unsaturated polymers when the polymer is exposed to "ozone in the air" will speed the process of deterioration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A test is conducted to see if the objects has been exposed by taking small samples and analyzed using an [[FTIR]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''[[Catalysis|Catalytic Degradation]]''' Mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons
* '''[[Biodegradation]]''' is when the surface or the strength of the plastic changes, these properties allow it to decompose or mineralize by carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''Decomposition of Hydroperoxides''' is when metal and metal ions are found on the plastic material as this can also lead to the deterioration of the object&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Physical and Chemical processes leading to deterioration  of original properties of plastic|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/4_Degradation/2_Physical_and_chemical_processes/4_2_PhysicalAndChemicalProcessesLeadingToDeterioration.pdf|journal=Processes Leading to the Deterioration of Plastics|volume=|pages=|via=POPART}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}Additional effects of deterioration

For plastics composed of [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]] the  most common sign of  deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar ([[Vinegar syndrome]]),  its surface will have  a white powder residue  and it will begin to shrink.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Cellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce [[butyric acid]] which has a "vomit odor".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride]]) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Preventative care  ==
=== Handling ===
Safety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.

=== Storage environment ===
Proper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|date=2014|title=A Safe Space Storage Strategies for Plastics|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/storage.html|journal=Conservation Perspectives|volume=29|pages=|via=http://getty.edu/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus  understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.

Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.

=== Long-term storage equipment ===
Adsorbents such as "activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites"  are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and [[Cellulose acetate film|vinegar syndrome]] which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate  benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''[http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Wrapping%2C-Lining-%26-Support-Materials/Marvelseal%26%23174%3B-360-Barrier-Film-%2850-ft-%29/p/M3650 Oxygen Impermeable bags]''' are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.

== Conservation   ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.

=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however,  solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/5_Active_conservation/1_Conservation_of_plastics_in_collections/5_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Studies in Active Conservation of Plastic Artefacts in Museums|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|publisher=POPART|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.

Light cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of  an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eryag-laser|title=Er:YAG laser - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laganà|first=Ana|date=2014|title=Looking through Plastics: Investigating options for the treatment of scratches, abrasions, and losses in cast unsaturated polyester works of art|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/cons_plastics/related_mats.html|journal=COM-CC 17th Triennial Conference Preprints,|volume=|pages=|via=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/art_LA/paper_2014_icom_cc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filling ===
Fillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting  of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-journal/the-use-of-lasers-in-the-conservation-of-museum-objects-made-from-plastics|title=The use of lasers in the conservation of museum objects made from plastics|work=Blog|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damian Le Bas''' (30 January 1963, [[Sheffield]] – 9 December 2017, [[Worthing]]) was a British artist associated with the [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] (or "Art Brut") label, as well a leading exponent of the "Roma Revolution" in art. 

==Life==
Le Bas was of [[Irish traveller|Irish Traveller]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/high-profile-stories-of-children-expose-europes-anti-roma-prejudice/article15200641/|title=High-profile stories of children expose Europe’s anti-Roma prejudice|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Bas attended the [[Royal College of Art]].&lt;ref name="SS_Ob"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/oct/29/life1.lifemagazine4|title=Outsider dealing|last=Steward|first=Sue|date=29 October 2000|work=The Observer|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived and worked with his wife, the [[Romani people|Romany]] artist [[Delaine Le Bas]],&lt;ref name="SS_Ob" /&gt; in [[West Sussex]] on the south coast. He was the father of writer [[Damian_Le_Bas_(writer)|Damian Le Bas]].

== Collections ==
Since 1987 several of Le Bas' pieces are held in the Musgrave-Kinley Collection of works by key Outsider artists, administered by [[Monika Kinley]], until her death in 2014.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/06/monika-kinley|title=Monika Kinley obituary|last=Dempsey|first=Andrew|date=6 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/damian-le-bas-britischer-kuenstler-ueberraschend-gestorben-a-1182758.html|title=Britischer Künstler: Damian Le Bas ist tot|date=11 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; His more recent work is found, among others, in the collections of Perpetuum Mobile.

==Exhibitions==
He exhibited frequently in the UK and Germany, and his works have been shown at Moderna Museet in Sweden,&lt;ref name="perpetualmobile"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perpetualmobile.org/the-invisible-faces-of-europe-panel-debate-europas-osynliga-ansikten-paneldebatt/?lang=en|title=The Invisible Faces of Europe: Pop-Up Exhibition and Panel Debate - Perpetual Mobile|date=2015-11-30|work=Perpetual Mobile|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan, France, Finland and the United States. He was well-known in Outsider Art circles, and was exhibited as part of a survey-show of [[Art brut|Art Brut]] at Malmö Konsthall in 1991.&lt;ref name="damianlebasartbrut"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://damianlebasartbrut.com/2016/03/09/sarlingar-art-brut-outsider-art-malmo-konsthallas-katalog/|title=SARLINGAR, Art Brut, Outsider Art ( 1991, Malmo konsthallas katalog )|date=2016-03-09|work=Damian Le Bas {{!}} Art Brut|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a participant of the [[Prague Biennale|Prague Biennale 3]].&lt;ref name="praguebiennale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguebiennale.org/3/eng/|title=PRAGUEBIENNALE3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404063523/http://www.praguebiennale.org/3/eng/|archivedate=4 April 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=4 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, the Traveller - Romani - Gypsy experience became a recurrent theme in his work. Le Bas was invited to participate in the 1st Roma Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/paradise-lost-first-roma-pavilion-venice-biennale|title=Paradise Lost: The First Roma Pavilion at the Venice Biennale|year=2007|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a driving force behind the Perpetual Romani-Gypsy Pavilion in Venice in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perpetualmobile.org/perpetual-roma-gypsy-pavilion-supporters/?lang=en|title=SUPPORTERS of the PERPETUAL ROMA-GYPSY PAVILION - Perpetual Mobile|date=2009-09-09|work=Perpetual Mobile|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the co-initiator of the 4th Roma Pavilion which took place in Berlin in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perpetualmobile.org/safe-european-home-berlin-2/?lang=en|title=The 4th Roma Pavilion: SAFE EUROPEAN HOME?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Dau al Set''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdaw əl ˈsɛt}}), the first post-[[World War II]] artistic movement in [[Catalonia]], was founded in [[Barcelona]] in September 1948 by poet [[Joan Brossa]].  The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Dada]]ist movements. In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] Dau al Set means "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.

== History ==
Dau al Set first began as an [[avant-garde]] artistic collective led by [[Joan Brossa]], a Catalan poet, in  September 1948. [[Joan Brossa]] established the group in response to the period’s conservative reigning government, which gained power after the [[Spanish Civil War]] known as the "[[:es:Guerra Civil Española|Guerra Civil]]". Under the new [[Fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Francisco Franco]]  radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in [[art and culture in Francoist Spain]]. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/revista-dau-al-set-modest-cuixart-2016|title=Revista Dau al Set. Modest Cuixart|website=www.macba.cat|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artistic groups were replaced with [[Art and culture in Francoist Spain|Nationalist Fascist Art]], which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed.

In 1949, with help from [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]'s private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a language prohibited under the [[Francoist Spain|Franco Regime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cirlot|first=Lourdes|date=December 2008|title=El grupo Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; consisting of four to twelve pages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco Lahoz|first=Amado|date=December 2008|title=Sumario de la revista Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[broadsheet]] style and never bound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve.

In 1952, Dau al Set founding member [[Antoni Tàpies]] left the group to promote his own independent work in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Informalism|Informal]] art styles. The following year [[Joan Ponç]] left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixcart]] left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Style ==
Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of [[Surrealism]], but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from [[Joan Brossa|Joan Brossa's]] personalized style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/revista/dau-al-set-1948-1956/detall|title=Dau al Set (1948-1956) - lletrA - Literatura catalana a internet|last=Catalunya|first=Universitat Oberta de|website=lletra.uoc.edu|language=ca|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Dau-al-set/14686|title=Dau al set|website=www.elcultural.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from [[Joan Ponç]]. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixart's]] work often contained images of fantasy influenced by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, [[Antoni Tàpies|Antoni Tápies]] often emulated the style of [[Paul Klee]] with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.

== Influences ==
Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]].  Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of [[cubism]], [[collage]]s, [[cut-up technique]], [[photomontage]]s, and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Max Ernst]].

Another influence on Dau al Set was [[Surrealism]], a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.

== Members ==
There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet [[Joan Brossa]], a philosopher [[Arnau Puig]], three artists [[Joan Ponç]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], and [[Modest Cuixart]], as well as a dual painter and editor [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Manolo Millares]]. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Dau al Set has had a lasting impact throughout history the most notable being the continuation of the avant-garde in Spain throughout a repressive regime. Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the [[Informalism|Informalist]] movement seen in Spain during the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteespana.com/grupodaualset.htm|title=Grupo Dau al Set|website=www.arteespana.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the [[Grup d'Elx|Grup d’Elx]] and El Paso, with important artists such as [[Joan Castejón]], [[Eusebio Sempere]] or [[Manolo Millares]]. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is [[Antoni Tàpies]] who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

'''Defiant Theatre''' was a [[Chicago]]-based [[theatre]] company founded in 1993 by a group of students from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], which includes [[Nick Offerman]]. The eclectic troupe specialized in productions that emphasized inventive [[stagecraft]], perverse and controversial topics, and skillful [[stage combat]]. While the company is highly regarded for original plays such as ''Action Movie: The Play'' and ''Godbaby'', Defiant Theatre received notable attention for productions of plays by [[Caryl Churchill]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Sarah Kane]], and [[William Shakespeare]]. [[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago Magazine]] named Defiant the "Best Experimental Theatre" in their August 1999 Best of Chicago issue. The company disbanded in 2004.

'''Design for behaviour change''' is a sub-category of [[design]], which is concerned with how design can shape, or be used to influence human behaviour.&lt;ref name=lockton&gt;Lockton, D., Harrison, D., Stanton, N.A. (2010). The Design with Intent Method: a design tool for influencing user behaviour. ''Applied Ergonomics'', 41 (3), 382-392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Niedderer_etal_2014"&gt;Niedderer, K., Mackrill, J., Clune, S., Lockton, D., Ludden, G., Morris, A., Cain, R., Gardiner, E., Gutteridge, R., Evans, M., Hekkert, P. (2014). ''Creating Sustainable Innovation through Design for Behaviour Change: Full Project Report.'' University of Wolverhampton &amp; Project Partners.&lt;/ref&gt;  All approaches of design for [[Behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]] acknowledge that artefacts have an important influence on human behaviour and/or behavioural decisions. They strongly draw on [[Behavioural change theories|theories of behavioural change]], including the division into personal, behavioural, and environmental characteristics as drivers for behaviour change.&lt;ref name="Niedderer_etal_2014"/&gt; Areas in which design for behaviour change has been most commonly applied include health and wellbeing, sustainability, safety and social context, as well as crime prevention.

== History ==
Design for behaviour change developed from work on design psychology (also: behavioural design) conducted by Don Norman in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D. A. (1988). ''The psychology of everyday things.'' Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Norman’s [[The Design of Everyday Things|‘psychology of everyday things’]] introduced concepts from ecological psychology and human factors research to designers, such as affordances, constraint feedback and mapping. They have provided guiding principles with regard to user experience and the intuitive use of artefacts, although this work did not yet focus specifically on influencing behavioural change.

The models that followed Norman’s original approach became more explicit about influencing behaviour, such as emotion design&lt;ref&gt;Desmet, P.M.A., Hekkert, P. (2002). The basis of product emotions. In W. Green and P. Jordan (Eds.), ''Pleasure with Products, beyond usability.'' London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 60-68.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[persuasive technology]].&lt;ref name="Fogg"&gt;Fogg, B.J. (2003). ''Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do.'' [[Morgan Kaufmann]], San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps since 2005, a greater number of theories have developed that explicitly address design for behaviour change. These include a diversity of theories, guidelines and toolkits for behaviour change (discussed below) covering the different domains of health, sustainability, safety, crime prevention and social design. 
With the emergence of the notion of behaviour change, a much more explicit discussion has also begun about the deliberate influence of design although a review of this area from 2012&lt;ref&gt;Zachrisson, J. and Boks, C. (2012). Exploring behavioural psychology to support design for sustainable behaviour research. ''Journal of Design Research'', 10 (1/2): 50- 66.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified that a lack of common terminology, formalized research protocols and target behaviour selection are still key issues. Key issues are the situations in which design for behaviour change could or should be applied; whether its influence should be implicit or explicit, voluntary or prescriptive; and of the ethical consequences of one or the other.

== Issues of behaviour change ==

In 1969, Herbert Simon's understanding of design as "devising courses of action to change existing situations into preferred ones" acknowledged its capacity to create change.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H.A. (1969). ''The science of the artificial,'' Cambridge, MIT press, p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the role of design in influencing human behaviour has become much more widely acknowledged.&lt;ref name=lockton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T., Wyatt. J. (2010). Design Thinking for Social Innovation. ''Stanford Social Innovation Review,'' Winter 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consolvo, S., Everitt, K., Smith, I., Landay, J.A. (2006). Design requirements for technologies that encourage physical activity. ''SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in computing systems'', ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, T. (2008). ''Design Futuring: Sustainability, Ethics and New Practice,'' Oxford, Berg Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Niedderer_2013"&gt;Niedderer, K. (2013). Mindful Design as a Driver for Social Behaviour Change. ''Proceedings of the IASDR Conference 2013''. Tokyo, Japan: IASDR.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further recognised that design in its various forms, whether as objects, services, interiors, architecture and environments, can create change that is both desirable as well as undesirable, intentional and unintentional.

Desirable and undesirable effects are often closely intertwined whereby the first is usually intentionally designed, while the latter might be an unintentional effect. For example, the impact of cars has been profound in enhancing social mobility on the one hand, while transforming cities and increasing resource demand and pollution on the other. The first is generally regarded as a positive effect. The impact of associated road building on cities, however, has largely had a detrimental impact on the living environment. Furthermore, resource use and pollution associated with cars and their infrastructure have prompted a rethinking of human behaviour and the technology used, as part of the [[sustainable design]] movement, resulting for example in schemes promoting less travel or alternative transport such as trains and bike riding. Similar effects, sometimes desirable, sometimes undesirable can be observed in other areas including health, safety and social spheres. For example, mobile phones and computers have transformed the speed and social code of communication, leading not only to an increased ability to communicate, but also to an increase in stress levels with a wide range of health impacts&lt;ref&gt;Ilstedt Hjelm, S. (2003) Research + Design: The Making of Brainball, ''Interactions,'' vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt; and to safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, L. (2005). Mobile phones and the evolution of social behaviour. ''Behaviour &amp; Information Technology'', vol. 24, n. 2, pp.111-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking lead from Simon, it could be argued that designers have always attempted to create "preferable" situations. However, recognising the important but not always benevolent role of design, Jelsma emphasises that designers need to take moral responsibility for the actions which take place with artefacts as a result of humans interactions:

"artefacts have a co-responsibility for the way action develops and for what results. If we waste energy or produce waste in routine actions such as in the household practices, that has to do with the way artefacts guide us"&lt;ref name="Jelsma"&gt;Jelsma, J. (2006). Designing `Moralized' Products. In Verbeek, P.P., Slob, A. (eds.), User Behavior and Technology Development: Shaping Sustainable Relations Between Consumers and Technologies. Berlin: Springer, pp.221-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, design for behaviour change acknowledges this responsibility and seeks to put ethical behaviour and goals higher on the agenda. To this end, it seeks to enable consideration for the actions and services associated with any design, and the consequences of these actions, and to integrate this thinking into the design process.

== Approaches ==

To enable the process of behavioural change through design, a range of theories, guidelines and tools have been developed to promote behaviour change that encourages pro-environmental and social actions and lifestyles from designers as well as user.

=== Theories ===

* [[Persuasive technology]]: how computing technologies can be used to influence or change the performance of target behaviours or social responses.&lt;ref name="Fogg"/&gt;
* Research at Loughborough Design School which collectively draws on [[Behavioral economics|behavioural economics]], using mechanisms such as feedback, constraints and affordances and persuasive technology, to promote sustainable behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, D. (2007). ''Designing for Behavioural Change: Reducing the Social Impacts of Product Use through Design.'' PhD Thesis, Loughborough University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, D. (2009). Design for sustainable behaviour: strategies and perceptions. ''Design Studies,'' 30, 704-720.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhamra, T., Lilley, D., Tang, T. (2008). Sustainable Use: Changing consumer behaviour through product design. In: Cipolla, C., Peruccio, P. (eds.) ''Changing the Change.'' Torino, Italy: Allemandi Conference Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang, T. (2010). ''Towards Sustainable Use: Designing Behaviour Intervention to Reduce Household Environmental Impact.'' PhD thesis, Loughborough University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang, T., Bhamra, T. (2008). Changing Energy Consumption Behaviour through Sustainable Product Design. ''International Design Conference 2008.'' Dubrovnik, Croatia.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Design for healthy behaviour: drawing on the [[Transtheoretical model|trans-theoretical model]], this model offers a new framework to design for healthy behaviour, which contends that designers need to consider the different stages of decision making which people go through to durably change their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ludden, G.D.S., Hekkert, P. (2014). Design for healthy behavior. Design interventions and stages of change. ''9th International Conference on Design and Emotion,'' Bogota, Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mindful design: based on Langer's theory of [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]&lt;ref&gt;Langer, E.J. (1989). ''Mindfulness.'' New York: Addison Wesley Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langer, E.J. (2010) ''Counterclockwise.'' London, UK: Hodder and Stoughton.&lt;/ref&gt; mindful design seeks to encourage responsible user action and choice. Mindful design seeks to achieve responsible action through raising critical awareness of the different options available in any one situation.&lt;ref&gt;Niedderer, K. (2007). Designing Mindful Interaction: The Category of the Performative Object. ''Design Issues'', 23 (1), 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Niedderer_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niedderer, K. (2014). Mediating Mindful Social Interactions through Design. In A. Ie, C. T. Ngnoumen and E. Langer (eds.) ''The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Mindfulness,'' vol 1. Wiley, Chichester, UK, 345-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Socially responsible design: this framework or map takes the point of the intended user experience, which distinguishes four categories of product influences: decisive, coercive, persuasive and seductive to encourage desirable and discourage undesirable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Tromp, N., Hekkert, P., Verbeek, P. (2011). Design for socially responsible behaviour: A classification of influence based on intended user experience. ''Design Issues,'' 27 (3), 3-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community based social marketing with design: this model seeks to intervene in shared social practices by reducing barriers and amplifying any benefits. To facilitate change, the approach draws on psychological tools such as prompts, norms, incentives, commitments, communication and the removal of barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Clune, S. (2010). Design for Behavioural Change. ''Journal of Design Strategies,'' 4, 68-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Practice orientated product design: This applies the understanding of [[social practice theory]] – that material artefacts (designed stuff) influence the trajectory of everyday practices – to design. It does so on the premise that this will ultimately shift everyday practices over time&lt;ref&gt;Kuijer, L. (2014). ''Implications of Social Practice Theory for Sustainable Design'' (PhD), Department of Industrial Design. Delft University of Technology, Delft p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, K., Quist, J., and Bakker, C., (2009). Co-design, social practices and sustainable innovation: involving users in a living lab exploratory study on bathing, ''Joint actions on climate change conference'', Aalborg, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modes of transitions framework: The framework draws on [[human-centered design]] methods to analyze and comprehend transitions as a way for designers to understand people that go through a process of change (a transition). It combines these with scenario-based design to provide a means of action.&lt;ref&gt;Kursat Ozenc, F. (2014). Modes of Transitions: Designing interactive products for Harmony and Well-Being. ''Design Issues'', 30(2): 30-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guidelines and toolkits ===

User experience design approaches:
* [[Operant conditioning|Optimal Reinforcement]]: By controlling when and how a person is rewarded, their behavior and be subtly shaped over time. In Optimal reinforcement, behavior is monitored using a device like a smartphone and rewards are delivered through a user experience. 
* Seductive interaction design and 'Mental Notes' toolkit: This approach focuses on what makes people change their behaviour through interaction with objects or their environment which they perceive as pleasurable, exciting, and positive. Under the label 'Mental Notes', this card-based toolkit brings together 50+ insights from psychology to use as a reference and brainstorming tool for web-designers.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S.P. (2011). ''Seductive Interaction Design: Creating Playful, Fun and Effective User Experiences.'' Berkeley, CA: New Riders.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S.P. (2014). ''Mental Notes: Bring a little psychology to Web design''. URL: http://getmentalnotes.com [accessed 9/10/2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
* 'Evil by Design': an approach to seductive design from the opposite end, it traces people's susceptibility to persuasive techniques and how they can be abused by companies to lure customers.&lt;ref&gt;Nodder, C. (2013). ''Evil by Design: Interaction Design to Lead Us into Temptation.'' Indianapolis, IN: Whiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

User-centered approaches:
* Design for Sustainable Consumption Behaviour: based on a combination of consumption behaviour and behavioural intervention strategies, in an industry context, it develops behavioural solutions to reduce [[resource consumption]]&lt;ref&gt;Selvefors, A., Pedersen, K., Rahe, U. (2011). ''Design for sustainable consumption behaviour: systematising the use of behavioural intervention strategies.'' Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Designing Pleasurable Products and Interfaces, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* User-centered design for sustainable behaviour: this proposes strategies to encourage industry to design products which lead users to adopt more environmentally friendly behaviours&lt;ref&gt;Wever, R., van Kuijk, J., Boks, C. (2008). User‐centered design for sustainable behaviour. ''International Journal of Sustainable Engineering,'' 1 (1), 9-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical cross-disciplinary syntheses:
* Behaviour Grid: this model maps 15 ways in which behaviour can change. It is based on a systemic understanding and requires the three elements of motivation, ability, and a trigger to coincide.&lt;ref&gt;Wendel, S. (2013). ''Designing for Behavior Change: Applying Psychology and Behavioral Economics'', O'Reilly Media.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brains, Behavior &amp; Design Toolkit: this toolkit offers a set of behavioural tendencies that can be addressed through design, including: [[loss aversion]], [[endowment effect]], [[status quo bias]], [[affective forecasting]] error, context-dependent preferences, affective-cognitive decision making, [[Introspection illusion|introspection]] and [[consideration override]].&lt;ref&gt;Pfarr, N. and Gregory, J. (2010). Cognitive Biases and Design Research: Using insights from behavioural economics and cognitive psychology to re-evaluate design research methods. ''DRS2010 conference proceedings.'' Montreal, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Design with Intent: this toolkit has united multiple tools and techniques for enabling, motivating or constraining action to encourage the user to adopt desirable action. The toolkit takes a functional approach, which considers motivation (internal constraint) as well as enabling and constraining behaviour (external constraint through design)&lt;ref&gt;	Lockton, D. (2010). ''Design with Intent.'' Available online: &lt;http://www.danlockton.com/dwi/Main_Page&gt; [Accessed 18 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lockton /&gt;
* Dimensions of Behaviour Change Tool: a detailed method and card deck aiming to guide designers through the process of specifying techniques for influencing behaviour in environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;Daae, J., Boks, C. (2014). Dimensions of Behaviour Change. ''Journal of Design Research'' (in press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches:
* Product-Impact Tool: useful in assessing the impact that technical products have on user behaviour. It was for example used to assess the Dutch RFID public transport e-payment system.&lt;ref&gt;Dorrestijn, S. (2012). The Product Impact Tool: Designing for user-guiding and user-changing. In J. I. Van Kuijk (Ed.), ''Design for Usability: Methods &amp; Tools - A Practitioner's Guide.'' Delft: Design United/IOP-IPCR Design for Usability research project, pp. 110-119.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Designing moralized products: this model sees products as 'drivers of routine action'. The design process incorporates user logic (cognitive models) drawn from everyday routines and responding 'scripts' to direct and encourage the desired interaction with products.&lt;ref name="Jelsma"/&gt;
* MINDSPACE Model: Developed by the UK Cabinet Office to help inform policy design to achieve affective behaviour change, this guide presents a checklist of influences on behaviour for use in policy making.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, P., Hallsworth, M., Halpern, D., King, D., Metcalfe, R., Vlaev, I. (2009) ''MINDSPACE - Influencing behaviour through public policy.'' London: Cabinet office &amp; Institute for Government.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, P., Hallsworth, M., Halpern, D., King, D., Metcalfe, R., Vlaevf, I. (2012).  Influencing behaviour the MINDSPACE way. J''ournal of Economic Psychology'', 33(1), 264-277.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Architectural design against crime: makes the reader / designer revisualise the environment and its management in relation to human behaviour to prevent crime.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, T.D. (2000) C''rime Prevention through Environmental Design: Applications of Architectural.'' Woburn, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical discussion ==

Design for behaviour change is an openly value-based approach that seeks to promote ethical behaviours and attitudes within social and environmental contexts. 
This raises questions about whose values are promoted and to whose benefit. While intrinsically seeking to promote socially and environmentally ethical practices, there are two possible objections:
The first is that such approaches can be seen a paternalistic, manipulative and disenfranchising where decisions about the environment are being made by one person or group for another with or without consultation.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Sunstein, C.R. (2008). ''Nudge: improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness.'' London, UK: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second objection is that this approach can be (ab)used, for example in that apparently positive goals of behaviour change might be made simply to serve commercial gain without regard for the envisaged ethical concerns.
The debate about the ethical considerations of design for behaviour change is still emerging, and will develop with the further development of the field.

=== Artificial intelligence in behavior change ===

The use of [[Machine learning|3rd wave AI]] techniques to achieve behavior change, intensifies the debate over behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/artificial-intelligence-in-behavioral-and-mental-health-care/luxton/978-0-12-420248-1|title=Artificial Intelligence in Behavioral and Mental Health Care - 1st Edition|first=|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are more effective than previous techniques, but like AI in other fields it is also more opaque to both users and designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1146753/ai-is-now-so-complex-its-creators-cant-trust-why-it-makes-decisions/|title=AI's brightest minds are still figuring out how to understand their creations — Quartz|first=Dave|last=Gershgorn|website=qz.com|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberta Bonetti, African Arts, Autum 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  are functional coffins made by specialized carpenters in the [[Greater Accra Region]] in [[Ghana]]. These colourful objects which have developed out of the [[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|figurative palanquins]] are not only coffins, but considered real works of art, were shown for the first time to a wider Western public in the exhibition ''Les Magiciens de la terre'' at the ''Musée National d’Art Moderne'' in Paris in 1989. The seven coffins which were exposed in Paris were done by [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop|Kane Kwei]] (1922–1992) and by his former assistant [[Paa Joe]] (b.1947).&lt;ref&gt;A Deathbed of a Living Man.

==Origin and Meaning==
The reason that mainly the southern Ghana-based [[Ga people]] use such elaborate coffins for their funerals is explained by their religious beliefs regarding the afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive. This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the importance, success and usage of an exclusive coffin during a burial.

Fantasy coffins are only seen on the day of the burial when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people’s professions. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool coffin, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various animals, such as lions, cockerels and crabs can represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why these coffins are also called proverbial coffins (''abebuu adekai'') or in the Ga language "okadi adekai".

==History==

[[Image:Drawing by Ataa Oko, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|Figurative palanquin]]; drawing by [[Ataa Oko]] from Ghana]] 
Among the Christians the use of custom coffins is relatively new and began in the [[Greater Accra Region]] around 1950. These coffins were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 52-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians had taken over the figurative coffins from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and coffins already since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance'', in: African Arts, Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, S. 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of these figurative coffins is usually attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologist Roberta Bonetti&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Bonetti, ''Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adeka''i, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached the same conclusion as [[Regula Tschumi]] considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: „[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its „invented“ inventor, Kane Kwei“.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially [[Regula Tschumi]] question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 57, 221-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ataa Oko]] (b.1919), of La, according to a few sources, could have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have started this innovative art form the early 1950s.

== Making the coffins ==
Figurative coffins are produced only to order. Every master craftsman employs one or more apprentices, who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. The coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interests of durability, items produced for museums are constructed from mahogany or some other high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. 
A coffin will take two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenters’ level of experience. In urgent cases several carpenters will work on a single item. All woodworking is done using the simplest tools, without the aid of electrical appliances. 
The painting of the figural coffins can take up to two days to finish.Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of them are even well known on the western art market for their hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together which patterns and colours to use for a coffin.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi.

[[Image:Paa Joe mit Sandalettensarg 2006.jpeg|thumb|[[Paa Joe]] 2006]]
[[Paa Joe]] was born in 1947 in the region of Akwapim, Ghana. He did his apprenticeship with Kane Kwei in [[Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal District|Teshie]], but left his master 1974. In 1976 he opened his own workshop in Nungua. In 1989 he was invited at the exhibition "Les Magiciens de la terre" in Paris. Since then his coffins have been shown all over the world. In 2005 they were exhibited in the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York and [[Jack Bell]] Gallery London. 2006 he participated in the exhibition "Six Feet Under" at the ''[[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Kunstmuseum Bern]]''. In 2007, he opened a new workshop in Pobiman near Accra.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 242-43.&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2013 he was in an Artist residence in UK with his son Jacob making a lion coffin, and 2016 the Artdocs film "Paa Joe and the Lion" made by Benjamin Wigley and Anna Griffin (producer) came out.

===Eric Kpakpo===
Eric Kpakpo was born in 1979 in Nungua, Ghana. He learned carpentry from 1994 until 2000 at Paa Joe's workshop in Nungua. He remained there as a master carpenter until 2006 when he opened his own coffin studio in La.

===Daniel Mensah===
[[image:Daniel Mensah "Hello" 2006. Foto Regula Tschumi.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Mensah]] (Hello), 2006]]
[[Daniel Mensah]], also called "Hello", was born in 1968 in Teshie, Ghana. He did his six-year apprenticeship with Paa Joe in Nungua. He then spent eight more years with [[Paa Joe]]. Only in 1998 did he open his own studio, "Hello Design Coffin Works", in Teshie. He participated in various art exhibitions and in some European film projects. In 2011, he had an exhibition in the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]].

===Ataa Oko===
[[Image:Ataa Oko, his third wife with a battleship coffin about 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Ataa Oko]] and his third wife with a battleship coffin, c.1960]]
[[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) was born in the coastal town of La, Ghana. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. [[Ataa Oko]] was, until 2002, not in contact with foreigners, he only made coffins for Ghanaian customers and thus remained unknown in Western art circles.  In 2006, his work was for the first time exhibited at the art museum in [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;Six Feet Under, 2006. Art Museum Bern, and "Six Feet Under" 2007/2008 in the Deutsches Hygienemuseum, Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;  Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko had developed his own form of artistic language. His work is therefore different from those artists which come out of Kane Kwei's tradition. Therefore, it differs not only in terms of design, materials, but overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Ataa Oko, Ex. Cat., [[Collection de l'art brut]] (Hg), Infolio, 2010, p. 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2005 to his death in 2012, he became a painter under the supervision of anthropologist [[Regula Tschumi]]. 2010/11 he had his first one-man show in a western Art museum, in the [[Collection de l'Art Brut]] in Lausanne.

'''Feather tights''' is the name usually given by art historians to a form of costume seen on [[Late Medieval]] depictions of angels, which shows them as if wearing a body suit with large scale-like overlapping downward-pointing elements representing feathers, as well as having large wings.  Other sources use '''feathered angels''' to describe the style. The style is assumed to derive from actual costumes worn by those playing angels in medieval religious drama, with the "feathered" elements presumably flaps or [[lappet]]s of cloth or leather sewn onto a body suit.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1964), 168; Plate 10.1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GgsSKtb9iRwC&amp;pg=PA144 here shows a modern production at York] attempting to recreate the effect, sadly with very baggy suits.&lt;/ref&gt;  The feathers on angels in art can often to be seen to stop abruptly at the neck, wrists and ankles, sometimes with a visible hemline, reflecting these originals.&lt;ref&gt;As for example on the Holy Thorn Reliquary; Tait 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Magdalene's hair suit''' is another iconographic feature, with a background in hagiographic legend, whose depiction apparently borrows from religious drama.

Historians of English churches tend to refer to the feather tights style as 15th century, and by implication essentially English,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1964), 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= fowler&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler | first = Harold North | title = A History of Sculpture | year =2005 | location = | publisher = Kessinger | isbn = 978-1-4179-6041-5 |page =237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be seen in several major late medieval European works from the late 14th to early 16th centuries.  These include the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], made by a court goldsmith in Paris in the 1390s,&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 43&lt;/ref&gt; and on two wooden angels from South Germany around 1530 ([[Museum Kunstpalast]] [[Düsseldorf]], right), as well as two stone ones hovering over the ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'' by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] at [[Maidbronn]] (1526), and others on [[Veit Stoss]]'s wooden [[altarpiece]] at [[Bamberg Cathedral]] (1520–23).&lt;ref&gt;Mellinkoff, 22; Kahrsniz and Bunz, 405&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a figure with greenish-black feathers, in [[Matthias Grünewald]]'s [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] of 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Russell; until Mellinkoff's book largely on this figure, he was often taken to be the [[Archangel Michael]], as [https://books.google.com/books?id=gQvRh-Z1cfEC&amp;pg=PA167 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Norwich or Durham?)" in the "3rd quarter of the 14th century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8780&amp;CollID=28&amp;NStart=1894 Egerton Genesis Picture Book] or MS Egerton 1894, British Library; see Joslin, Mary Coker and Carolyn Coker Joslin Watson.

It is believed that this practice arose from medieval [[liturgical drama]]s and [[mystery play]]s, in which the actors portraying angels wore garments covered with feathers to emphasize their power of flight,&lt;ref name = coe/&gt; often standing on "clouds" of wool.&lt;ref name= anderson&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Mary Désirée | title = The Medieval Carver | year = 1935 | location = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = |language =  |page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costumed angels also might be introduced for one-off special occasions: at the coronation of Henry VII's queen, [[Elizabeth of York]], in 1487 an angel swinging a large [[censer]] was lowered from the roof of [[Old St Paul's]], and at the marriage of their son [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] in 1501, the [[archangel Raphael]] was part of the ceremony, with "goldyn and glyteryng wingis and ffedyrs of many and sundry colours".&lt;ref&gt;Roof angels&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathering might be used as a substitute for other clothing, or under [[vestment]]s or [[Saint Michael]]'s armour.&lt;ref name= rush&gt;{{cite book | last = Rushforth | first =Gordon McNeil  | title = Medieval Christian imagery: as illustrated by the painted windows of Great Malvern Priory Church, Worchestershire, together with a description and explanation of all the ancient glass in the church | year = 1936 | location = | publisher = The Clarendon Press | isbn = |language =  |page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feathered tights are not to be confused with the feathers of the extra pairs of wings traditionally attributed to [[cherubim]] and other higher [[Christian angelic hierarchy|orders of angels]], which are often shown pointing downwards covering the legs.

==Mary Magdalene's hair suit==
[[File:Mary Magdalene 01.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of altarpiece by [[Jan Polack]], c. 1500]]
A similar depiction of the penitent [[Mary Magdalene]] appears in some Southern German works around mostly 1500, but with body hair rather than feathers. The earliest may be in the scene of Mary's last [[Holy Communion]] in [[Lucas Moser]]'s Altar with scenes from the life of the Magdalene in [[Tiefenbronn]], from 1432.  [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]'s carved figure in the [[Münnerstadt]] Altar (1490-1492), now [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]], Munich is the best known.  According to medieval legend the Magdalene had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a prostitute and her life as a follower of Jesus. Her story became conflated in the West with that of [[Saint Mary of Egypt]], a 4th-century prostitute turned hermit, whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert.  In earlier medieval depictions Mary's long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty, but in these her hair is more naturalistic and does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;Witcombe, 279, 282; Johnston, 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead she has a coat of hair somewhat like a dog's, ending rather neatly at the neck, wrists and ankles, suggesting derivation from a theatrical costume, as with the feather suits. The suits, which are mainly consistent in depiction, do not cover her breasts or knees, or sometimes elbows.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;  The bare patches on the knees and elbows probably are meant to have been worn bare by Mary praying on her knees, resting her elbows on a rock ledge, as she is often shown in later paintings of the Penitent Magdalen. The lack of hair on the breasts presumably follows the pattern of body hair typical of mammals and familiar to late medieval Germans from farm animals such as sheep and cattle.
[[File:Tilman Riemenschneider Magdalena BNM img01.jpg|thumb|[[Tilman Riemenschneider]], part of the [[Münnerstadt]] Altar (1490-1492)]]
  
Most such images depict the "Ascension" or ''Elevation of Mary Magdalene'', showing the regular visits of angels to Mary's desert home (actually in [[Provence]] in the South of France according to the legend) to raise her into the air and feed her heavenly food.  In the words of [[William Caxton]]'s English translation of the ''[[Golden Legend]]'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the blessed Mary Magdalene, desirous of sovereign contemplation, sought a right sharp desert, and took a place which was ordained by the angel of God, and abode there by the space of thirty years without knowledge of anybody. In which place she had no comfort of running water, ne solace of trees, ne of herbs. And that was because our Redeemer did do show it openly, that he had ordained for her refection celestial, and no bodily meats. And every day at every hour canonical she was lifted up in the air of angels, and heard the glorious song of the heavenly companies with her bodily ears. Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet meats, and then was brought again by the angels unto her proper place, in such wise as she had no need of corporal nourishing.&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Mary Magdalen", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume4.asp#Mary%20Magdalene "Life of Mary Magdalen"], [[William Caxton]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moser's altar shows the scene of her last [[Holy Communion]] after her return to the world and just before her death, as recounted in the ''Golden Legend'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;... [Saint [[Maximin of Trier|Maximinus]]] saw the blessed Mary Magdalene standing in the quire or choir yet among the angels that brought her, and was lift up from the earth the space of two or three cubits. And praying to our Lord she held up her hands, and when S. Maximin saw her, he was afraid to approach to her. And she returned to him, and said: Come hither mine own father, and flee not thy daughter. And when he approached and came to her, as it is read in the books of the said S. Maximin, for the customable vision that she had of angels every day, the cheer and visage of her shone as clear as it had been the rays of the sun. And then all the clerks and the priests aforesaid were called, and Mary Magdalene received the body and blood of our Lord of the hands of the bishop with great abundance of tears, and after, she stretched her body tofore the altar, and her right blessed soul departed from the body and went to our Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Caxton, as previous passage quoted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[relief]] panels on the inside of the shutters of the Münnerstadt Altar show four scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene, with her covered in body hair in the last two, showing her last Communion and burial (these are still in the church).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, 93-95; [[:File:Münnerstadt, St Maria Magdalena 008.JPG|Image, also with replica main statue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag of [[Melbourne]]''' is the official flag for the city of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It was based on the design of the arms component of the [[coat of arms of Melbourne]], which in turn was based on the 1848 common seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne Day - About our day|url=http://www.melbourneday.com.au/about.html|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag features a white background divided into four quadrants by the red cross of [[Saint George]], patron saint of England. On both sides of each arm of the cross are narrow red bars known as a cotise. In the centre there is a Royal Crown, signifying the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarchy]].

The four quadrants divided by the cross each feature a design representing an important sector of Melbourne's economy in the mid 19th century. The designs are:
* a [[Wool|fleece]] hanging from a red ring, representing the wool industry;
* a black bull standing on a hillock, representing the cattle industry;
* a three masted [[tall ship]] in full sail at  sea, representing trade and shipping;
* a spouting [[whale]] at sea, representing the whaling industry.

The Melbourne Flag is flown at various places, including: [[Melbourne Town Hall]]; on the Lord Mayor of Melbourne's car; at Enterprize Park, the location where the settlement began; and on the replica of tall ship [[Enterprize Replica|Enterprize]].

[[File:Hendrik Cornelisz Vroom image.jpg|thumbnail|Engraving of the artist, ca. 1762]]
'''Hendrik Cornelisz Vroom''' (c.1562 &amp;ndash; February 4, 1640 (buried)) was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] painter credited with being the founder of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[marine art]] or seascape painting.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/82222 Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom entry]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Beginning with the "birds-eye" viewpoint of earlier Netherlandish marine art, his later works show a view from lower down, and more realistic depiction of the seas themselves. He is not to be confused with his son and pupil [[Cornelis Vroom]].

==Biography==
[[File:Hendrik Cornelisz. Vroom Gezicht op Delft vanuit het westen.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Delft]] seen from the west; one of the earliest cityscapes in the Netherlands, and the earliest of Delft]]
[[File:VROOM Hendrick Cornelisz Arrival of a Dutch Three master at Schloss Kronberg.jpg|thumb|right|Arrival of a Dutch Three master at [[Kronborg Castle]], Helsingør]]
Vroom was born in [[Haarlem]]. Much of what is known of his life comes from his biography by [[Karel van Mander]], who devoted four pages to him in his "[[Schilder-boeck]]", which reads as an adventure story, complete with freezing his pants to a mountain top and nearly starving to death on a rock with a group that discussed cannibalism as a possible survival strategy.

Though it is unknown at what age he started on his travels, Vroom was born into a family of artists and began his career as a pottery ([[faience]]) painter and when his mother remarried, was no older than 19 when he rebelled against his stepfather who insisted he stick to pottery painting, by boarding a ship for Spain ([[Sevilla]]) and from thence via [[Livorno]] and [[Florence]] to Rome.&lt;ref name=Mander&gt;{{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}} [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0261.htm Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom] in [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Schilderboeck'', 1604, courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Florence]] he was patronized around 1585–87 by Cardinal [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]], later Grand Duke of Tuscany.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; While there he became a pupil of [[Paulus Bril]].&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; He went back and forth to [[Venice]], where he earned money as a [[Maiolica|majolica]] painter.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; 

When he returned north, he travelled via Milan, Genoa, [[Albisola]] (a ceramics center where he again earned money painting ceramics), Turin (where he met the Haarlem painter [[Jan Kraeck]]), and Lyon (via a mountain pass where his pants froze to the summit rock).&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; From there he travelled to Paris, where he met a painter from Leiden, and from there he went to [[Rouen]], where he became mortally ill but was saved by a woman who bandaged his head.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; 

There he boarded a ship homewards and was back in Haarlem in 1590, the year he married, before travelling to [[History of Gdańsk#As part of the Kingdom of Poland (1454/66–1793)|Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]]) to visit his uncle, Frederick Henricksz, who was city architect there, and where he painted an altarpiece.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; 

During his next journey, this time to Portugal, he survived shipwreck, but was threatened with execution as "an English pirate" - from which he was saved by being recognized as a Catholic from his salvaged devotional paintings, which convinced the monks on the beach that he and his companions were not "heathen Protestants" (Vroom, having been to Italy, had coached his fellow survivors in the catechism).&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;  Having been granted free passage, Vroom travelled to St. Huves ([[Setubal]]), where he recorded his adventures in a painting that he sold to a painter there.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;  

When he decided to return to Haarlem, he got off the ship at the last minute due to a premonition, being called a "crazy painter".&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; The ship sank in the [[Øresund]] near [[Helsingor]] and in Haarlem Vroom was reported dead.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt; However, he had written to his wife, who thus discovered he was still alive.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;  He eventually died in Haarlem, in his late seventies.

==Tapestry designs==
When he did return to Haarlem, it was as an artist of international repute and soon afterwards he received two commissions for tapestry designs, one of which, from [[Lord Howard of Effingham]], was for a series of ten tapestries depicting the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] of 1588, by the English under Howard’s overall command as Lord Admiral.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;  [[Brussels tapestry|Executed in Brussels]] in 1592–95, the tapestries later decorated the [[House of Lords]], Westminster, and were fortunately recorded in engravings before they were destroyed by fire in 1834.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;

==Legacy==
Vroom recorded important engagements of the Dutch and English fleets in his oil paintings, giving a detailed portrayal of ships. Most of the pieces described by Van Mander are lost, and his greatest commissions were obtained after Van Mander's death. Vroom's large and decorative battles, ceremonial scenes and beach views introduced novel compositional devices to be taken up by younger Dutch marinists. The Haarlem marine painters [[Hans Goderis]], [[Cornelis Verbeeck]] and [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] were all directly influenced by him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodorus Schrevelius]] in his "Harlemias"&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] and his pupils included [[Aert Anthonisz]], [[Nicolaes de Kemp]], [[Jan Porcellis]], and his sons [[Cornelis Hendriksz Vroom]] and [[Frederik Hendricksz Vroom]].&lt;ref name=RKD /&gt;

==Works==
Among his more famous historical scenes included the 1607 [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]] and the arrival of various dignitaries in [[Amsterdam]], including [[Protestant]] leader [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] of [[Bohemia]] who had been exiled by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

[[File:IXS Enterprise.jpg|thumb|The IXS ''Enterprise'' as imagined by Mark Rademaker]]

'''IXS ''Enterprise''''' is a conceptual [[Faster-than-light|interstellar superluminal]] [[spacecraft]] designed by [[NASA]] scientist Dr. [[Harold G. White]], revealed at SpaceVision 2008, designed for the goal of achieving [[Warp drive|warp travel]]. The conceptual spacecraft would make use of a modified version of the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Dr. White is currently running the [[White–Juday warp-field interferometer]] experiment in order to develop a [[proof of concept]] for Alcubierre-style warp travel, if possible. The Alcubierre drive uses [[exotic matter]] (not to be confused with [[antimatter]]) to travel faster than light.

While the concept had been out since 2008 the design of IXS ''Enterprise'' was popularized in June 2015 after a series of media outlets reported on the conceptual artwork done by Dutch artist Mark Rademaker in collaboration with NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillip|first1=Abby|title=This is the amazing design for NASA’s Star Trek-style space ship, the IXS ''Enterprise''|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/06/11/this-is-the-amazing-design-for-nasas-star-trek-style-space-ship-the-ixs-enterprise/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Rademaker, over 1,600 hours have been spent on the conceptual artwork that he created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Chaka|title=Warp Speed Tests: NASA Advanced Propulsion Names Latest Model ''Enterprise'' After Star Trek|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15393/20140622/warp-speed-tests-nasa-advanced-propulsion-names-latest-model-enterprise-after-star-trek.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy required to power the warp drive, according to White,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peckham|first1=Matt|title=NASA Actually Working on Faster-than-Light Warp Drive|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/09/19/nasa-actually-working-on-faster-than-light-warp-drive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is approximately the [[negative energy|negative]] (negative energy is required for the Alcubierre drive concept to function) [[mass–energy equivalence]] of ''[[Voyager 1]]'', which has a mass of approximately 700 [[kilograms]]. Using E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, −700 kilograms of mass is equivalent to ~−63 [[exajoules]] of energy (this number is not definitive and can be further reduced). The ship has two thick outer rings (to reduce required energy) that generate the warp field—a contraction of space ahead, and expansion of space behind it. The space inside the rings is optimized to fit more space for cargo, crew and equipment.

[[File:John Linnell by John Linnell.jpg|right|thumb|Self-portrait of John Linnell, circa 1860]]
[[File:John Linnell - Wheat - Google Art Project.jpg|300px|thumb|Wheat, circa 1860]]
'''John Linnell''' (16 June 1792 – 20 January 1882) was an [[England|English]] [[landscape painter|landscape]] and [[portrait]] [[painting|painter]] and [[engraving|engraver]]. Linnell was a [[naturalist]] and a rival to [[John Constable]]. He had a taste for Northern European art of the [[Renaissance]], particularly [[Albrecht Dürer]]. He also associated with [[William Blake]], to whom he introduced [[Samuel Palmer]] and others of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]].

==Life and work==
Linnell was born in [[Bloomsbury]], London. His father was a carver and gilder and Linnell was brought into contact with artists from an early age, and was drawing and selling portraits in chalk and pencil at the age of 10. His first artistic instruction was received from [[Benjamin West]], and he spent a year in the house of [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] the water-colour painter, where he had [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Hunt]] and [[William Mulready]] as fellow-pupils, and made the acquaintance of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Edward William Godwin|Godwin]] and other men of mark. In 1805 he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where he obtained medals for drawing, modelling and sculpture. He was trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of Varley's "Burial of Saul."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[File:John Linnell - Hanson Toot, View in Dovedale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|View in [[Dovedale]], 1815]]

In later life he occupied himself with the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], publishing, in 1833, a series of outlines from [[Michelangelo]]'s frescoes in the [[Sistine Chapel]], and, in 1840, superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures in [[Buckingham Palace]], one of them, a [[Titian]] landscape, which he engraved in [[mezzotint]]. At first he supported himself mainly by miniature painting and execution of larger portraits, such as the likenesses of Mulready, [[Richard Whately]], Peel and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Several of his portraits he engraved in line and mezzotint.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He painted many subjects like the "St John Preaching," the "Covenant of Abraham," and the "Journey to Emmaus," in which, while the landscape is usually prominent the figures are of sufficient importance to supply the title of the work. But it is mainly in connexion with paintings of pure landscapes that his name is known. His works commonly deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape, which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset. They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing in colour.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Linnell commanded large prices for his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill, Surrey, where he lived till his death on 20 January 1882, painting with unabated powers until within the last few years of his life. He devoted himself to painting landscapes notably of the [[North Downs]] and [[The Weald|Kentish Weald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton and Lyles|first=Andrew Wilton and Anne Lyles, Royal Academy of Arts (Great Britain), National Gallery of Art (U.S.)|title=The great age of British watercolours, 1750-1880|year=1993|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=9783791312545|pages=339}} page 318&lt;/ref&gt;  His leisure was occupied with a study of the [[Bible]] in the original, and he published several pamphlets and treatises of Biblical criticism. Linnell was one of the best friends and kindest patrons of [[William Blake]]. He gave him the two largest commissions he received for single series of designs—£150 for drawings and engravings of ''The Inventions to the Book of Job'', and a like sum for those illustrative of [[Dante Aligheri]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was a friend of the painter [[Edward Thomas Daniell]]. A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, [[Hampstead]]. The plaque mentions that William Blake stayed with Linnell as his guest.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757-1827) &amp; LINNELL, JOHN (1792-1882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Nuremberg]], he trained under [[Johann Christoph Weigel]] and came to England in 1744 with his brother Tobias–an engraver of architecture–and lived there the rest of his life. He worked with [[Philip Miller]] of [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].  He signed his early works J. S. Müller or J. S. Miller, but after 1760 used the signature of John Miller.  His works included a 20-part series ''Illustratio Systematis Sexualis Linnaei'' (Illustration of the Sexual System of Linnaeus), which helped popularize the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] to English readers. He also produced collaborative works such as ''Botanical Tables'' (1785), with [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]]. Furthermore, he painted landscapes, which, as well as some of his engravings, he exhibited with the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]] and at the [[Royal Academy]] from 1762 to 1788. He was twice married, and had in all twenty-seven children: two of his sons, [[John Frederick Miller]] and James Müller or Miller, also became known as illustrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Miller, John (1715?-1790?)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Concept and development ===

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=What I hope people get from [the show] is that by losing everything, it's possible to become something better. At least in real life, I have a much more reasonably paced life than I ever had when I was slightly banana head. In losing some of my ambition, it made it so I can have relationships and a better life. That has been learned throughout the ages: You mean money and prestige doesn't make people happy? Nope.|source= --Bamford explaining the series for ''[[Vulture.com]]''&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt;}}

The show came to be when Mitch Hurwitz approached Maria Bamford and asked her if she had an idea for a series, reportedly in 2013.&lt;ref name="Fox 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fox | first=Jesse David | title=Maria Bamford Walks You Through Lady Dynamite, Her Mitch Hurwitz-Produced New Show | website=Vulture | date=May 20, 2016 | url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/first-look-at-maria-bamfords-lady-dynamite.html | accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the pitch was telling a story about a [[mental breakdown]]. The project was no more than talks for years. Later, Hurwitz attached Pam Brady to the project to write and direct. Bamford described this process as "extremely slow".&lt;ref name="Fox 2016"/&gt;

The use of [[nonlinear narrative]] in the show was part of Bamford's pitch. It is used to portray the different mental states people can go through, and also how they overcome it. In that way, the show's [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s serve as "a reminder of that journey."&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt; Bamford describes the show's narrative structure as "''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]'', with me."

Bamford, who is a stand-up comedian, decided not to use stand-up comedy as a device in her show. When asked about her decision, she explained: "Even though that is a reasonable way of telling the story, I do have a self-conscious feeling of "I don't want to see the same thing over and over"".&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt; This decision is depicted in the pilot episode of the series.

===Writing===
Maria Bamford was involved in the writing process, but she did not write any episode herself. In spite of the show being based on Bamford's real life, the writers had freedom to modify her experiences for creative purposes. For example, in the pilot episode, Maria puts a bench in front of her house in an effort to promote a sense of community in her neighborhood. This idea came from Bamford's real life.

Even though she did not take a hands-on approach in the writing of the series, she was in the writers' room often, to discuss ideas and "hang out" with the writers.&lt;ref name="Fox 2016" /&gt; Writing credits include [[Kyle McCulloch]], former ''[[South Park]]'' writer, and [[Jen Statsky]], former ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' writer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/jen-statsky-jimmy-fallon-twitter-broad-city-lady-dynamite/|title=Jen Statsky on the art of the one-liner, writing for late night, and comedy with 'heart'|last=Peyser|first=Eve|date=31 August 2015|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing===
Former ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' collaborators [[Max Winkler (director)|Max Winkler]] and [[Andrew Fleming]] directed episodes for ''Lady Dynamite''. [[Rob Cohen]] (''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''), [[Academy Awards|Academy award]]-winner [[Jessica Yu]] and [[Ryan McFaul]] also directed episodes.

[[Patton Oswalt]] plays a cop who disapproves of Maria's park bench, but he breaks character to advise her not to do the cliche stand-up motif in sitcoms.

The site's critical consensus reads, "Maria Bamford's ''Lady Dynamite'' is a vibrant, subversive, sweet, meta-fictional ride - but also a courageous, boundary-busting and ultimately deep portrayal of a troubled psyche."&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes s1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/lady-dynamite/s01/|title=Lady Dynamite: Season 1 (2016)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the season has a score of 85 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="Metacritic s1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/lady-dynamite|title=Lady Dynamite: Season 1 reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has garnered attention because of its depiction of mental illness.&lt;ref name="The Frisky 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Biphobia In 'Lady Dynamite' Is The Only Thing Holding It Back From Perfection | website=The Frisky | date=July 11, 2016 | url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-07-11/the-biphobia-in-lady-dynamite-is-the-only-thing-holding-it-back-from-perfection/ | accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clausen 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Clausen | first=Evelyn Anne | title=We've Never Had a TV Depiction of Mental Illness Quite Like Lady Dynamite | website=Slate Magazine | date=June 23, 2016 | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/06/23/we_ve_never_had_a_tv_depiction_of_mental_illness_quite_like_maria_bamford.html | accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Syme 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Syme | first=Rachel | title=Maria Bamford Mines Mental Illness for Her Sitcom, 'Lady Dynamite' | website=The New York Times | date=2016-05-31 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/arts/television/maria-bamford-mines-mental-illness-for-her-sitcom-lady-dynamite.html | accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=How 'Lady Dynamite' Helps Fans Cope With Mental Illness | website=Vocativ | date=2016-07-02 | url=http://www.vocativ.com/332988/how-lady-dynamite-helps-fans-cope-with-mental-illness/ | accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kang 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kang | first=Inkoo | title=Lady Dynamite: Maria Bamford Tries To Blow Up the Sitcom For Netflix | website=MTV News | date=2016-05-24 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2884780/lady-dynamite-maria-bamford-tries-to-blow-up-the-sitcom-for-netflix/ | accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the show as "[having] its own bizarre-sincere voice and its own dream logic" and "something else, in a good way: a journey to the center of Ms. Bamford's mind that dives through fantasy after loopy fantasy and emerges with something real."&lt;ref name="Poniewozik 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Poniewozik | first=James | title=Review: 'Lady Dynamite' Finds Surreal Humor in Mental Illness | website=The New York Times | date=May 18, 2016 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/arts/television/review-lady-dynamite-netflix.html | accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the show's style, ''The New York Times'' noted that "The show's creators, [[Pam Brady]] (''[[South Park]]'') and [[Mitch Hurwitz]] (''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''), have constructed a multipurpose fun house; we jump about in time and flit from meta-show to memoir to hallucination."&lt;ref name="Poniewozik 2016"/&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described Bamford's performance saying that "the actress and comedian, whose presence has rarely been used as well as it is here, manages the neat trick of being both believably guileless and winningly sharp."&lt;ref name="Ryan 2016" /&gt; ''Variety'' also praised the show's guest stars, stating: "the entire show gains a great deal of energy from a varied array of game guest actors, including [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], [[Brandon Routh]], and [[Bridget Everett]], all of whom appear delighted to be in Bamford's playfully serious orbit."

Critics have compared the series to ''[[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]]'', ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', ''[[Review (TV series)|Review]]'' and ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' because of the way it uses [[meta-humor]], [[absurdist humor]] and how it deals with [[mental health]].&lt;ref name="Ryan 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ryan | first=Maureen | title=TV Review: 'Lady Dynamite' | website=Variety | date=May 17, 2016 | url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/lady-dynamite-review-maria-bamford-1201770459/ | accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Saunders | first=Tristram Fane | title=Lady Dynamite, Netflix, review: 'the world is finally ready for Maria Bamford' | website=The Telegraph | date=May 25, 2016 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2016/05/25/lady-dynamite-the-world-is-finally-ready-for-maria-bamford---rev/ | accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latin Quarter''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musical ensemble|band]] formed in 1983. They were popular in Germany and northern Europe and had one top 20 single ''Radio Africa'' in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Work: Understanding the Cultural Industries|page=102|editor=Andrew Beck|date=2003|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally split up in 1990, but re-formed in 2011. The band toured Germany and UK
and have released their latest album ''Pantomime of Wealth'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinquartermusic.com/en/news/|title=Latin Quarter - News|publisher=Latin Quarter Music|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their sound mixes elements of [[pop (music)|pop]], [[rock (music)|rock]], [[reggae]] and [[folk music|folk]] with largely [[political]] based [[lyrics]].

==Career==
Latin Quarter were formed in late 1983 by Steve Skaith and Mike Jones who were both members of the left wing political group [[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]].&lt;ref name="Censoring"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5296787/Censoring_Popular_Music_the_experience_of_Latin_Quarter|title=Censoring Popular Music: the experience of Latin Quarter|publisher=Academia.edu|first=Mike|last=Jones|date=May 2000|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their political viewpoint is often reflected in the choice of subject matter and lyrics of Latin Quarter's output. Jones describes their first album ''[[Modern Times (Latin Quarter album)|Modern Times]]'' as "a veritable manifesto".&lt;ref name="Censoring"/&gt; The album failed to chart in Britain but was a top twenty hit in Germany and Sweden and sold well throughout Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5296787/Censoring_Popular_Music_the_experience_of_Latin_Quarter|title=Censoring Popular Music: the experience of Latin Quarter|last=Jones|first=Mike|date=2000-05-30|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

They released a total of five studio [[record album|albums]] plus two [[Compilation album|compilations]] during their first incarnation, and achieved chart success with the [[Single (music)|single]] "Radio Africa", which reached number 19 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book|title=British Hit Singles &amp; Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-904994-10-7|edition=19th|location=London|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones claims they were the only western pop act to release a contemporary album in [[East Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5296787/Censoring_Popular_Music_the_experience_of_Latin_Quarter|title=Censoring Popular Music: the experience of Latin Quarter|last=Jones|first=Mike|date=2000-05-30|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The main members between 1985-1987 was Steve Skaith (vocals, guitar), Richard Wright (guitar, vocals), Mike Jones (lyrics), Greg Harewood (bass), Yona Dunsford (vocals, keyboards) and Carol Douet (vocals, percussion).

After low sales of their third album ''Swimming Against the Stream'' in the UK, they originally split up in 1990. Skaith, Wright and Jones continued as Latin Quarter, but the next two albums ''Long Pig'' and ''Bringing Rosa Home'', were only released in continental Europe. 

Latin Quarter collaborated with [[The Bhundu Boys]] on the latter's 1993 ''Friends on the Road'' album, including a re-working of "Radio Africa" and two new songs written by members of both bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/friends-on-the-road-mw0000187065|title=Friends on the Road - The Bhundu Boys - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|work=AllMusic|accessdate=24 September 2014|first=Bob|last=Tarte}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the first band to be managed by [[Ignition Management|Marcus Russell]] (who is from [[Ebbw Vale]] along with Mike Jones in the band) later the manager of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/politics-international-relations/profile/marcus-russell/|title=Politics and International Relations: Marcus Russell, Honorary Fellow|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the band split up in 1998 Steve Skaith went to live in Mexico where he met and formed the Steve Skaith Band with Mexican musicians, and released the albums ''Mexile'' 2003, ''Empires and Us'' 2005 and ''Imaginary Friend'' 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steveskaithband.bandcamp.com/|title=bandcamp|last=|first=|date=2018-02-18|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He then returned to England and re-recorded some early Latin Quarter songs on ''Latin Quarter Revisited'' 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steveskaithband.bandcamp.com/music|title=Steve Skaith Band|website=Steve Skaith Band|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Skaith and lyricist Jones re-formed Latin Quarter with original vocalist Yona Dunsford, bass player Greg Harewood and keyboard player Steve Jeffries. They released the albums ''Ocean Head'' in 2012 and ''Tilt'' in 2014. [[Chris Rea]] was a guest star playing slide guitar on the ''Tilt'' album&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discussionsmagazine.com/2014/06/politics-pop-music-exclusive-interview.html|title=Interview|last=|first=|date=2014-06-04|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Steve Skaith re-recorded acoustic versions of Latin Quarter-songs on ''Bare Bones'' in 2015. In September 2016 Latin Quarter released ''The Imagination of Thieves'', now featuring Skaith, Jeffries, Martin Ditcham (Drums), Yo Yo Buys (Bass and Guitars) and Mary Carewe (vocals).

On 14 February 2018 the new track ''Pantomime of Wealth'' was released as a digital release on [[Westpark Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://westparkmusic.bandcamp.com/|title=westparkmusic|last=|first=|date=2018-02-17|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The album with the same name was released 13 April 2018.

'''Leo Castelli''' (born '''Leo Krausz'''; September 4, 1907&amp;nbsp;– August 21, 1999) was an Italian-American [[art dealer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2D61038F930A1575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Russel, John.

"Leo Castelli." Salon.com, September 11, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the movements which Castelli showed were [[Surrealism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]],   [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Minimal Art]], [[Conceptual Art]], and [[Neo-expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1UEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |first=David|last=Bourdon|publisher=Life Magazine|date=May 1970|title=Whats Up in Art, The Castelli Clan|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Leo Castelli was born Leo Krausz,&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Dwight Garner (May 18, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/books/19book.html A Smooth Operator, at the Vanguard of the Gallery World in the 1960s] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Trieste]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the second of three children of Italian and Austro-Hungarian Jewish origin.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"&gt;[[Peter Schjeldahl]] (June 7, 2010), [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/06/07/100607crbo_books_schjeldahl Leo the Lion - How the Castelli gallery changed the art world] ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Ernest Krauss, a Hungarian by birth, who had gone to Trieste as a young man and married wealthy heiress Bianca Castelli,&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;Myrna Oliver (August 24, 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/24/news/mn-3077 Leo Castelli; Influential Dealer Promoted Careers of Artists From Johns to Warhol] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from a family of coffee importers&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Gerald Clarke (February 26, 1979), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073021,00.html Dealer Leo Castelli Sold the World on Pop Art, and Now He's Cleaning Up] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which had long been based there.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;John Russell (August 23, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/arts/leo-castelli-influential-art-dealer-dies-at-91.html Leo Castelli, Influential Art Dealer, Dies at 91] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, which the family spent in Vienna (where Leo Castelli learned perfect German), they returned to Trieste.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The family changed its name to "Krausz-Castelli" and then "Castelli" in the mid-1930s, when Mussolini's government required names to be Italianized.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

After earning a law degree at the [[University of Milan]] in 1924, Castelli returned to Trieste, where his father had secured a job for him with an insurance company.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; In 1932, he went to work for an insurance company in Bucharest, where he married [[Ileana Sonnabend|Ileana Schapira]] one year later. After their marriage, the couple honeymooned in Vienna and bought their first artwork, a [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] watercolor.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Castelli's father-in-law, Mihai Schapira, helped him to be transferred in 1935 to the [[Banca d'Italia]] in Paris. There, Ileana's taste and money helped him start his first gallery at [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, which was named for its co-director, the decorator René Drouin,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; and situated between the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel]] and the couturier [[Elsa Schiaparelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Castelli's FIRST STEPS in the art world: a "Surrealist" event in Paris in '39 – by Michèle C. Cone. [[Artnet]], July 21, 2010. http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/cone/leo-castelli-surrealist-design7-21-10.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Specializing in surrealistic art,&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; the gallery opened in July 1939, with a show of modern and antique furniture, including commissioned pieces by Drouin, [[Max Ernst]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], [[Leonor Fini]] (a former girlfriend of Castelli's from Trieste), [[Eugene Berman]], and other artists in the force field of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Ileana's connections enabled the couple to flee to America at the start of World War II. Castelli's parents did not escape but died in Budapest, hounded by members of Hungary's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon (June 11, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/Solomon-t.html Leo Castelli’s New York Story] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would remain married for more than 25 years, and were friends and partners even after their divorce, when Ileana married Michael Sonnabend and that couple opened its own gallery.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; Castelli arrived in the United States in 1941, by way of Marrakesh, Tangier, Algeciras, Vigo and Havana.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; He took graduate history courses in economic history&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;  at [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; until volunteering for the Army, serving in the intelligence service in Europe. After the liberation of France, he was sent to Bucharest as an interpreter for the Allied commission that controlled the city. As a result of Castelli's military service, he was given American citizenship.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Returning to New York, Castelli took a managerial position with his father-in-law's clothing factory.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

==Leo Castelli Gallery==
In New York, the Castellis were two of only three non-artist members (the other was dealer [[Charles Egan Gallery|Charles Egan]])&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; of the Club, an influential coterie founded in 1949 that included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. Castelli's first exercise as a private dealer came through Drouin, in 1947: some hundred canvases by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], consigned by his widow, Nina.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; His first American curatorial effort was the [[Ninth Street Show]] of 1951, a seminal event in the emergence of Abstract Expressionism. He soon attached himself to the pioneering gallerist [[Sidney Janis]], one of the early proponents of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lamster (May 23, 2010), [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/23/entertainment/la-ca-leo-castelli-20100523 Book Review: A dealer and his galaxy of art stars in 'Leo and His Circle"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, he opened the Leo Castelli Gallery in a townhouse at 4 E. 77th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in New York City. From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, the gallery was perhaps the most prominent commercial venue for art in the world.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Daniel Grant (February 24, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703960804576120434103905642 Leo Castelli's Cache Of Art-History Gold] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the gallery showcased European [[Surrealism]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and other European artists. However the gallery also exhibited American [[Abstract Expressionism]]. [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Norman Bluhm]] were some artists who were included in group shows.

In 1958, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] joined the gallery, signaling a turning away from [[Abstract Expressionism]], towards [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptual Art]].[[File:Warhol Flowers, offset lithograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelli Gallery's first [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] exhibition, ''Flowers'', November, 1964]] From the early 1960s through the late 70s, [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Salvatore Scarpitta]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Lawrence Weiner]] and [[Joseph Kosuth]] joined the stable of Castelli artists. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first one-man shows.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli opened a temporary annex, the Castelli Warehouse, on West 108th Street, with a show organized by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], of environmental sculpture by nine artists, including Nauman, Serra, and [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; In 1971 Leo Castelli opened a downtown [[SoHo]] branch of the Leo Castelli Gallery at 420 West Broadway, in a building bought by the Hague Art Delivery Company and a cooperative of dealers: Castelli took the second floor; his former wife's [[Sonnabend Gallery]] the took the third floor, and [[André Emmerich]] (later replaced by [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]]) took the top floor; while John Weber, (former director of the [[Virginia Dwan (art dealer)|Dwan Gallery]]) rented his gallery on the fourth floor. In the 1980s, Castelli opened a second larger downtown exhibition space at a 142 Greene Street also in [[SoHo]]. He later mounted joint shows with [[Mary Boone]], of [[Julian Schnabel]], in 1981, and [[David Salle]], in 1982.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Castelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons, desertions were initially rare among his artists. When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate work in that time.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli also was known for spotting new talent and insisting on European exposure for his American artists, leading to Rauschenberg in 1964 becoming the first American to win the [[Venice Biennale]]'s international grand prize in painting.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; His most important clients included [[Museum Ludwig|Peter Ludwig]] and [[Giuseppe Panza]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;

Castelli's second wife, Antoinette Fraissex du Bost,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; opened Castelli Graphics, an art gallery devoted to the prints and photographs of Castelli Gallery and other artists.&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/obituaries/antoinette-castelli-58-dies-president-of-graphics-gallery.html Antoinette Castelli, 58, Dies; President of Graphics Gallery] ''New York Times'', September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple also had a son together, Jean-Christophe Castelli, but Antoinette Castelli died in 1987.&lt;ref name="NYT87"/&gt; In 1995 Leo Castelli married the Italian art historian Barbara Bertozzi Castelli.

In 2015, Bertozzi Castelli opened a one-room satellite gallery at 1046 Madison Avenue, near 80th Street, with [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]]'s installation ''Lead and Felt'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie M. Sheets (September 24, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/arts/design/richard-prince-takes-a-new-approach-to-cowboys.html Changing Galleries] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Castelli received the rosette of the [[French Legion of Honor]], allegedly in exchange for donating works by Johns to the [[Centre Pompidou]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; The mayor of Trieste made him the honorary director of the [[Revoltella Museum]]. In 1998, the [[National Arts Club]] awarded Castelli its Centennial Medal of Honor. On this occasion, [[Dennis Hopper]] called Castelli "the godfather of the contemporary art world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phoebe Hoban]] (March 29, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/29/style/the-night-a-pearl-beyond-price.html A Pearl Beyond Price] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a traveling exhibit honoring the 25th anniversary of Castelli Gallery visited the [[San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art|La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The [[Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale|Museum of Art]], Fort Lauderdale, showed "Three Decades of Exploration: Homage to Leo Castelli", an exhibit of more than 30 works by artists discovered, shown and encouraged by Castelli in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Rober Hurlburt (November 1, 1987), [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-11-01/features/8702030168_1_leo-castelli-american-art-contemporary-art Exhibition A Tribute To Noted Art Dealer] ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] presented "Leo Castelli: a tribute exhibition". In 1996, [[Gagosian Gallery]] mounted the exhibition "Leo Castelli: An Exhibition in Honor of His Gallery and Artists" in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Many artists have enshrined Castelli in their works. [[Elaine de Kooning]] and [[Richard Artschwager]] painted his portrait, Warhol made a silkscreen of him in a jacket and tie. Frank Stella named a work after him, in 1992 he posed for the French artist [[Klaus Guingand]] who immortalized his shadow, and a sculpture by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], ''Leo'', places a brain at the center of a target.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Strickland (May 12, 1991), [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/12/nyregion/leo-castelli-meets-film-maker-and-fan.html Leo Castelli Meets Film Maker and Fan] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, on the occasion of Castelli's death, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published a eulogy by [[James Rosenquist]].

In 1988, when there were no tax deductions for gifts to museums, Castelli gave one of the icons of postwar American art, Robert Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' (1955) to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1992, amid rumors that Castelli was negotiating to sell his archives to the [[Getty Center]] in Los Angeles, his collection was said to be worth some $2 million.&lt;ref name="CAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/arts/design/19voge.html|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Castelli Archives Going to Smithsonian|publisher=New York Times|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Castelli's heirs – his widow, Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, and his two children, Jean-Christopher Castelli and Nina Castelli Sundell – announced the donation of the gallery's archives from 1957 through 1999 to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Archives of American Art]]. Castelli had been interviewed for the archive's oral-history project in 1969, 1973 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

The Leo Castelli Gallery continues to operate at 18 East 77th Street in New York under the direction of his wife showing many of the same artists from the gallery's past.&lt;ref name="CAG" /&gt; The Leo Award, presented annually by the [[Independent Curators International (ICI)|Independent Curators International]] (ICI), is named after the late Castelli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artinfo.com/news/story/818024/is-dasha-zhukova-the-next-leo-castelli-possible-da-vinci-found-on-scottish-farm-and-more-must-read-art-news Is Dasha Zhukova the Next Leo Castelli?] ''ARTINFO'', August 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miniature art''' or '''painting in little''' is a genre that focuses on art (especially painting, engraving and sculpture) with a long history that dates back to the scribes of the medieval ages. Miniature art societies, such as the World Federation of Miniaturists (WFM), provide applicable definitions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfm.org/definitions.htm Size definitions of miniature painting] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020204032723/http://www.worldfm.org/definitions.htm |date=2002-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An often-used definition is that a piece of miniature art can be held in the palm of the hand, or that it covers less than 25 square inches or 100&amp;nbsp;cm². Subjects are depicted in 1/6 actual size, and in all paintings the spirit of miniaturisation should be maintained.

Miniature art has been made for over 1000 years and is prized by collectors. The U.S. [[White House]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], [[Astolat Dollhouse Castle]], and museums around the world have collections of miniature paintings, drawings, original prints and etchings, and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

These productions are often used to analyze or comment on [[current events]] and issues by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Miranda |year=2007 |title=The mocking mockumentary and the ethics of irony |journal=Taboo: The Journal of Culture and Education |publisher= |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |url=http://freireproject.org/files/Taboo2007BoratIssue.pdf#page=52 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726065500/http://freireproject.org/files/Taboo2007BoratIssue.pdf#page=52 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While mockumentaries are usually [[comedy|comedic]], [[pseudo-documentary|pseudo-documentaries]] are their dramatic equivalents. However, [[pseudo-documentary]] should not be confused with [[docudrama]], a fictional [[genre]] in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events. Also, [[docudrama]] is different from [[docufiction]]; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements.

Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries, with [[B roll]] and talking heads discussing past events, or as ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' pieces following people as they go through various events. Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became relatively easy to locate.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; A very early example was a short piece on the "[[Spaghetti tree|Swiss Spaghetti Harvest]]" that appeared as an [[April Fools' Day|April fools']] joke on the British television program ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in 1957.

The term "mockumentary", which originated in the 1960s, was popularized in the mid-1980s when ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' director [[Rob Reiner]] used it in interviews to describe that film.&lt;ref name=Roscoe&gt;{{Cite book |last=Roscoe |first=Jane |author2=Craig Hight  |title=Faking it: Mock-documentary and the Subversion of Factuality |year=2001 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-5641-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=mockumentary, ''n''. |year=2010 |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/mockumentary |accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lT-ONdy2ck&amp;t=1m|title=Paul Shaffer on Late Night, March 20, 1984|first=|last=Don Giller|date=26 December 2015|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly [[improvisational theatre|improvised]], as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality. Comedic mockumentaries rarely have [[laugh track]]s, also to sustain the atmosphere, although exceptions exist.

Music "is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between [[diegesis|diegetic]] and extradiegetic music"&lt;ref name=Nardi&gt;{{cite book |last= Nardi |first= Carlo |editor1-last= Giuffre |editor-first= Liz |editor2-last= Hayward |editor2-first= Philip |title=Music in Comedy Television: Notes on Laughs |publisher= Routledge |date=2017 |pages=73–87 |chapter=The Mockumentary Sitcom: The Discomfort of Fake Realism |isbn=978-1138193581 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Early examples==
Early work, including [[Luis Buñuel]]'s 1933 ''[[Land Without Bread]]'', [[Orson Welles]]'s 1938 radio broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'', various [[April Fools' Day]] news reports, and ''vérité''-style film and television during the 1960s and 1970s, served as precursor to the genre.&lt;ref name=Roscoe/&gt; Early examples of mock-documentaries include ''The Connection'' (1961), ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', 1964, (written by [[Alun Owen]], purporting to describe several days in the lives of [[The Beatles]], that would be the first feature-length mockumentary), ''[[David Holzman's  Diary]]'', 1967, ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1272023/ Pat Paulsen for President]'', 1968, ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', 1969, ''[[I clowns|The Clowns]]'', 1970, by [[Federico Fellini]] (a peculiar [[hybridity|hybrid]] of [[documentary]] and [[fiction]], a docufiction), and ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', 1978. [[Albert Brooks]] was also an early popularizer of the mockumentary style with his film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', 1979, a spoof of a [[PBS]] documentary.

[[Woody Allen]]'s ''Take the Money and Run'' is presented in documentary-style with Allen playing a fictional criminal, Virgil Starkwell, whose crime exploits are "explored" throughout the film.&lt;ref name="Trompe"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pbJHd6i9nwC&amp;pg=PA343|title=Trompe (-)l'oeil: Imitation &amp; Falsification|last2=Sy-Wonyu|first2=Aïssatou|publisher=University of Le Havre Press|year=2002|isbn=2877753344|series=Publications de l'Université de Rouen|volume=324|page=343|first1=Philippe|last1=Romanski}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackson Beck]], who used to narrate documentaries in the 1940s, provides the voice-over narration. Fictional interviews are interspliced throughout, especially those of Starkwell's parents who wear [[Groucho Marx]] noses and mustaches. The style of this film was widely appropriated by others and revisited by Allen himself in films such as ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983) and ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=Trompe/&gt;

Early use of the mockumentary format in television comedy may be seen in several sketches from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (1969–1974), such as "[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes|Hell's Grannies]]", "[[Piranha Brothers]]", and "[[The Funniest Joke in the World]]". ''[[The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour]]'' (1970–1971) also featured mockumentary pieces which interspersed both scripted and real-life man-in-the-street interviews, the most famous likely being "The Puck Crisis" in which hockey pucks were claimed to have become infected with a form of [[Dutch elm disease]].

''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', developed from an early series of sketches in the comedy series ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'', is a 1978 television film in mockumentary style about ''[[The Rutles]]'', a fictional band that parodies ''[[The Beatles]]''.

==Since 1980==
===In film===
Since the beginning of the 1980s, the mockumentary format has got considerable attention. The 1980 [[South Africa]]n film ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' (along with its [[The Gods Must Be Crazy II|1989 sequel]]) is presented in the manner of a [[nature documentary]], with documentary narrator [[Paddy O'Byrne]] describing the events of the film in the manner of a biologist or anthropologist presenting scientific knowledge to viewers. In 1982, ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'' is a Cold-War era American "mockumentary" film that made use of archival government footage from the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NI4dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=%22atomic+cafe%22+mockumentary |title=The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |date=2014-09-01 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199838851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.horrorview.com/movie-reviews/atomic-cafe-the |title=The Atomic Café (1981) |website=Horrorview |quote=Straddling the fence between surrealism and pop culture is this eccentric "mockumentary," subsumed entirely by stock footage from the height of the Cold War. "The Atomic Café" is pieced together with a certain clairvoyant vision that captivates and inspires as the seamless fluency of the film builds to a denouement. In the same neighborhood as "[[Dr. Strangelove]]," this cynically festive mock-serious piece /../ Because the documentary is just that, fashioned entirely out of a seamless montage of newsreel footage, government archives, and military training films, the movie itself is just a deadpan reflection of history's charade executed with an assertive wry humor that makes us question the sanity of Cold War politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody Allen's 1983 film ''[[Zelig]]'' stars Allen as a curiously nondescript enigma who is discovered for his remarkable ability to transform himself to resemble anyone he is near, and Allen is edited into historical archive footage.&lt;ref name=Trompe/&gt; In 1984, [[Christopher Guest]] co-wrote and starred in the mockumentary ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'', directed by [[Rob Reiner]]. Guest went on to write and direct other mockumentaries including ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'', and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', all written with costar [[Eugene Levy]].&lt;ref name=Trompe/&gt;

[[Tim Robbins]]' 1992 film ''[[Bob Roberts]]'' was a mockumentary centered around the senatorial campaign of a right-wing stock trader and folksinger, and the unsavory connections and dirty tricks used to defeat a long-term liberal incumbent played by [[Gore Vidal]]. ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man Bites Dog]]'' is a 1992 [[Belgian]] [[black comedy]] crime mockumentary written, produced, and directed by [[Rémy Belvaux]], [[André Bonzel]], and [[Benoît Poelvoorde]]. In 1995, [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Costa Botes]] directed ''[[Forgotten Silver]]'', which claimed [[New Zealand]] "director" Colin McKenzie was a pioneer in filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/colin-mckenzie/biography|title=Colin McKenzie - NZ On Screen|website=Nzonscreen.com|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the film was later revealed to be a mockumentary, Jackson received criticism for tricking viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=F Is for Phony: Fake Documentary And Truth's Undoing |first1=Craig |last1=Hight |first2=Jane |last2=Roscoe |chapter=Forgotten Silver: A New Zealand Television Hoax and Its Audience |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXaFokB-qx4C&amp;pg=PA172 |pages=171–173 |editor=[[Alexandra Juhasz]] and Jesse Lerner |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=2006 |isbn=0816642516 |volume=17 |series=Visible Evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, director [[Mike Clattenburg]] wrote and directed a [[short film]] titled ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|One Last Shot]],'' which was shot in black-and-white. The film followed the exploits, in [[documentary style]], of Ricky ([[Robb Wells]]) and Julian ([[John Paul Tremblay]]), two criminals doing what they did just about every day. In 1999 a sequel [[feature film]] ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|Trailer Park Boys]],'' also in black-and-white, was released. Both films serve as prequels to the ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'' television series. In 1999, ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]]'' by [[Michael Patrick Jann]] used the mockumentary style to narrate a fictional small-town beauty pageant as a way to satirize [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]].

''[[Dark Side of the Moon (film)|Dark Side of the Moon]]'' is a 2002 French mockumentary by director [[William Karel]]. The premise for the film is the theory that the television footage from the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing was faked and actually recorded in a studio by the [[CIA]] with help from director [[Stanley Kubrick]]. ''[[FUBAR (film)|FUBAR]]'' is a 2002 Canadian mockumentary film, directed by [[Michael Dowse]], based on the lives of two lifelong friends and head-bangers living out their lives, constantly drinking beer. ''[[King of Bollywood]]'' is a 2004 film, in fact, the first Indian film in the mockumentary genre. Directed by [[Piyush Jha]] it starred the late [[Om Puri]] and British supermodel [[Sophie Dahl]]. It tells the story of an aging Bollywood Superstar and showcases the hilarity, colour, and zany-ness of his many comeback attempts.  ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'' is a 2004 mockumentary presenting an [[alternative history]] in which the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] won the [[American Civil War]]. 

''[[First on the Moon]]'' (Russian: Первые на Луне, ''Pervye na Lune'') is a 2005 Russian mockumentary about a fictional 1930s Soviet landing on the Moon. ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' is a controversial yet successful film from 2006 which uses this style, as does ''[[Brüno]]'', a similar film from 2009. [[Sony Pictures Animation]] released their second animated feature, ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' in 2007, which was the first of its kind to incorporate the mockumentary style into animation. ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'', a 2007 Spanish film by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, uses journalism aesthetics to approach a horror universe set up in a real building in [[Barcelona]]. The film was [[remake|remade]] in the [[United States]] as the 2008 film [[Quarantine (2008 film)|''Quarantine'']]. As the first installment of the ''[[REC (film series)|REC film series]]'', it was followed by three sequels; ''[[REC 2]]'' in 2009, ''[[REC 3: Genesis]]'' in 2012, and ''[[REC 4]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: ‘[REC]4 Apocalypse’ Teaser Poster Sees Red!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3231637/exclusive-rec4-apocalypse-teaser-poster-sees-red/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting LLC|accessdate=22 June 2013|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Ropes (2011 film)|On the Ropes]]'' is a 2011 mockumentary film written and directed by [[Mark Noyce]]. The film follows a fictional martial-arts instructor and his rivalry with a local boxing gym.

''[[What We Do In The Shadows]]'' is a 2014 horror/comedy mockumentary film directed and written by [[Taika Waititi]] and [[Jemaine Clement]]; the aforementioned directors also star in the production. The film is centered on vampire flatmates living in [[Wellington]]. ''[[Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping]]'' is a 2016 mockumentary musical comedy starring [[Andy Samberg]] as Connor4Real, an over-the-top parody of a commercial pop star. It is filmed in the style of a typical concert documentary such as ''[[Katy Perry: Part of Me]]'' and ''[[Justin Bieber: Never Say Never]]''. ''[[Population Zero]]'' (2016) a mockumentary environmental scare film starring activism film maker [[Julian T. Pinder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2056034/bio|title=Julian T.

===In television===
The 1983 ''[[The Comic Strip Presents...]]'' film ''[[Bad News (band)|Bad News Tour]]'' was a spoof [[rockumentary]] about a British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band.  It preceded ''Spinal Tap'' by a year, but is not known to have been an influence on the U.S. film. The film led to LPs being released and the band really touring, and was followed by a sequel, ''More Bad News'' in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad News – the Spoof Heavy Metal Band|url=http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/A447950|work=BBC h2g2|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Stella Street]]'' was a mockumentary which ran on the BBC from 1997 to 2001. It was written by [[Phil Cornwell]], [[John Sessions]], and [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]], and featured Cornwell and Sessions playing all the characters between them. The series was shot on handheld [[camcorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stella Street|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/stellastreet/|work=BBC Comedy|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Operation Good Guys]]'', another low-budget BBC sitcom, ran for three series starting in 1997.

In television, the most notable mockumentaries in the 2000s have been: [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]]'s ''[[The Games (Australian TV series)|The Games]]'' (1998–2000), Canadian series ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'' (2001–present), the British shows ''[[Marion and Geoff]]'' (2000), ''[[Twenty Twelve]]'' (2011–2012) (which follows the fictional Olympic Deliverance Commission in the run-up to the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]]) and [[W1A (TV series)|W1A]], which follows the main characters of [[Twenty Twelve]] as they start work at the BBC, ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' (2001) and its [[The Office|many international offshoots]], ''[[Come Fly with Me (2010 TV series)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (2010), which follows the activity at a fictional airport and its variety of staff and passengers. British comedy duo [[Jennifer Saunders]] and [[Dawn French]] often presented short mockumentaries as extended sketches in their TV show ''[[French &amp; Saunders]]''.  Discovery Channel opened its annual Shark Week on 4 Aug 2013 with ''[[Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives]]'', a mockumentary about the survival of the [[megalodon]].

The series ''[[Documentary Now!]]'' (2015–present) on [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]], created by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumni, spoofs celebrated [[documentary film]]s by parodying the style and subject of each documentary. Hight argues that television is a natural medium for mockumentary, as it provides "for extraordinarily rich sources of appropriation and commentary" &lt;ref&gt;Hight, Craig. 2014. "Mockumentary." In Encyclopedia of Humor Studies, Salvatore Attardo, Thousand Oaks: Sage, pp.  515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===On radio===

'''Neomodern''' or '''neomodernist''' art is a reaction to the complexity of [[postmodern architecture]] and [[eclecticism]], seeking greater simplicity.

==Architecture==
Neomodern architecture continues [[Modern architecture|modernism]] as a dominant form of architecture in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in corporate offices. It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[New Classical Architecture|new classical]] and [[neo-eclectic]] styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for [[starchitect]] inspired uniqueness. 
Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional.

==Artist group==
The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by [[Guy Denning]]&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;Sherwin, Brian. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2006/11/art-space-talk-guy-denning.html "Art Space Talk: Guy Denning"], myartspace.com, 14 November 2006. Retrieved 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that the diversity of contemporary art was being stifled by the state supported art institutions and organisations. The group have no common style or media but there is a bias towards figurative painting. Original artists listed: [[James Butler (artist)|Jim Butler]], [[David Cobley]], [[Emily Cole]], [[Mark Demsteader]], [[Guy Denning]], [[Ian Francis]], [[Juno Doran]], [[Ghislaine Howard]], [[David Jamin (artist)|Jamin]], [[Maya Kulenovic]], [[Mark Stephen Meadows]], [[Antony Micallef]], [[Motorboy]], [[Carol Peace]], [[Graeme Robbins]], [[Harry Simmonds]], [[Tom Wilmott]], [[Franklin Torres]], [[Kit Wise]] and [[Claire Zakiewicz]].

The group coalesced in the context of the "intense centralization of Soviet Culture" and the decline of the avant garde culture of [[Leningrad]], as "leftist" groups were becoming increasingly marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Kharms, Daniil.

Founded in [[1928 in poetry|1928]] by [[Daniil Kharms]] and [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]], OBERIU became notorious for provocative performances which included circus-like stunts, readings of what was perceived as nonsensical verse, and theatrical presentations, such as Kharms's ''Elizabeth Bam'', that foreshadowed the European [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. The presentations took place in venues ranging from theaters and university auditoriums to dormitories and prisons. The group's actions were derided as "literary [[hooliganism]]" in the ever-more conservative press of the late 1920s. It was chastised even more in the early 1930s, and many of its associates were arrested. The OBERIU has often been called "the last Soviet avant-garde."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Phillipe Jaccard's book on Daniil Kharms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some scholars say that the OBERIU manifesto was penned mostly by the poet [[Nikolay Zabolotsky]] with the help of Kharms. The core of the group included [[Daniil Kharms]], [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]], [[Nikolay Zabolotsky]], [[Konstantin Vaginov]], Igor Bakhterev, and others, including actors, musicians and filmmakers. 

The Russian artist [[Kazimir Malevich]] gave the OBERIU shelter in his newly created arts institute, letting them rehearse in one of the auditoriums. It is reported that he said to the young "Oberiuty" (as they are called in Russian): "You are young trouble makers, and I am an old one. Let's see what we can do." Malevich also gifted a book of his own ("God Is Not Cast Down") to founder Daniil Kharms with the relevant inscription "Go and stop progress!"

==Decline==
In the 1930s, Socialist Realism and Stalin's purges precluded the formation of any such "leftist" or "radical" public artistic groupings. After about 1931, The OBERIU held no more public performances, and most of those involved showed their writing only to a small circle of friends, though Zabolotsky went on to become a marginally accepted Soviet poet. 

Though the group was held together for a while by common interest, some split away. Zabolotsky seems to have had a falling out with Vvedensky. In the 1930s Kharms and Vvedensky became more closely involved with a group of friends who met semi-regularly for what they called "conversations."{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Yakov Druskin]], a Christian philosopher and music-theorist (he wrote on [[Bach]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]]), was a key member of this group. Druskin and his friend Leonid Lipavsky (a children's writer under the name of Leonid Savelyev, and an amateur mathematician and author of philosophical tracts) had known Alexander Vvedensky in high-school, and had become friends with Kharms and Zabolotsky as well. Lipavsky actually wrote down a number of the "conversations." [[Nikolay Oleynikov]], an editor at the children's publishing house which had long employed the young poets of the OBERIU as writers and translators of children's literature, became part of this group by the mid-thiries. 

This later grouping, which had no public outlet, is generally called the "chinari" (i.e. "the titled ones") group in Russian literary scholarship, though it is uncertain that they ever formalized a name for the group, nor that they called themselves "chinari" with any consistency. Thus, the names "OBERIU" and "chinari" are somewhat interchangeable in the scholarship. The borders between the two groups are (and were) permeable, and the only basic continuity is the presence of Kharms and Vvedensky.

==Influence==
Though short-lived, the OBERIU seems to have had lasting effects on Russian culture. Since the late 1980s a kind of cult fervor has grown in Russia around these long-forgotten writers. And, in fact, the ideas and art of the OBERIU had been influential even in the 1960s and 1970s, in what is called the "unofficial" art world of the Soviet Union. Some writers and artists of that period would proudly admit the influence of the OBERIU, in others it is clear enough. The OBERIU was seen as something of a missing link from the old Russian avant-garde to the new one. Poets like [[Genrikh Sapgir]], [[Alexei Khvostenko]], [[Anri Volokhonsky]], [[Lev Rubinstein]], [[Dmitri Prigov]], [[Timur Kibirov]], [[Eduard Limonov]] were certainly familiar with the OBERIU writers through "[[samizdat]]" publications circulating in the underground art scene, and their writing reflects that knowledge, though in very different ways for all of them. Leningrad avant garde musical group [[N.O.M.]] borrows heavily from OBERIU movement citing [[Kharms]] and [[:ru:Олейников, Николай Макарович|Oleynikov]] as lyrical influences. They paid homage to Kharms, Oleynikov by releasing An Album Of Real Art with songs based on their lyrics. Novosibirsk [[punk rock]] musician [[Egor Letov]] cited [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Vvedensky]] as an influence for his lyrics.

==OBERIU in English==

An anglophone edition of OBERIU writings translated by [[Eugene Ostashevsky]], [[Matvei Yankelevich]], [[Genya Turovskaya]], Thomas Epstein and Ilya Bernstein was published by the Northwestern University Press in 2006. Several translations of Kharms's short stories, notebooks, letters, poems and diaries have been published over the years, for instance by George Gibian (Norton Library, 1974), Matvei Yankelevich (Overlook Press, 2007), Anthony Anemone and Peter Scotto (Academic Studies Press, 2013) and most recently Alex Cigale (Northwestern University Press, 2017). Kharms's poems were also translated by [[Roman Turovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;http://polyhymnion.org/lit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Poems by Kharms (8), Vvedensky (1) and Zabolotsky (6) are included in The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry edited by Robert Chandler, Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski published 2015.

'''Paid content''' is content on the Internet &amp;ndash; such as text, graphics, video and downloads &amp;ndash; which is paid for. Paid content is usually copyrighted.&lt;ref name="BruckBuchholz2005-55"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter A. Bruck|author2=Andrea Buchholz|author3=Zeger Karssen|author4=Ansgar Zerfass|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7A-aNhSzLj8C&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-25093-7|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== High-value content ===

Some internet content has always historically been paid for &amp;mdash; until recently there has been little discussion about paying for scientific, technical and medical (STM) content as well as certain trade information.&lt;ref name="BruckBuchholz2005-67"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter A. Bruck|author2=Andrea Buchholz|author3=Zeger Karssen|author4=Ansgar Zerfass|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7A-aNhSzLj8C&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-25093-7|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== News media ===

Printed newspaper circulation has fallen steadily since the advent of the internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/business/media/28circ.html
| work=The New York Times
| first=Richard
| last=Pérez-Peña
| title=Newspaper Circulation Continues to Decline Rapidly
| date=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in 2008 in the USA alone newspapers lost $64.5 billion in market value.&lt;ref name="KayeQuinn2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Kaye|author2=Stephen Quinn|title=Funding Journalism in the Digital Age: Business Models, Strategies, Issues and Trends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2AHZOzmk98C&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=15 February 2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0685-9|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; As newspapers' online readership has increased, the newspaper industry has been forced to re-evaluate their business models in the light of falling advertising revenues. While online editions of newspapers have been extremely popular, advertising rates online are lower than for print media, and revenues from them have not been sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from print.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye &amp;amp; Quinn, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Rupert Murdoch]] proposed a method of [[micropayment]]s for online newspaper content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/07/rupert-murdoch-charging-websites | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clark | title=News Corp will charge for newspaper websites, says Rupert Murdoch | date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From June 2010, certain [[News International]] titles were only available as paid content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8588432.stm
| title = Times and Sunday Times websites to charge from June 
| date = 26 March 2010
| publisher = BBC News
| accessdate = November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===

The music industry has had some success in creating new markets of legal downloading where lower costs and accessibility have led to success, and some suggest there are parallels between the major victims of digitalisation – the music industry and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/05/what-can-newspapers-and-magazines-learn-from-record-labels/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806221456/http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/05/what-can-newspapers-and-magazines-learn-from-record-labels/ |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP3 file can often be duplicated, passed on and exchanged – without capacity boundaries or losses suffered by an individual. These features of MP3 files as an example of digital content are one of the main reasons for the huge revenue collapses in the music and media industry since the existence of the Internet. [[Online game]]s, however, as an example of digital services, is only a right to participate when the purchased input is offered and traded. This right can be traded and passed on,  but, contrary to MP3 files, the vendor forfeits the benefit of this right at the moment it is passed on.

=== Online gaming ===

Paid content differ from [[paid services]] in the way that digital content can be passed on and be used by different individuals. Digital services can be characterized as a right which can be exercised, but not passed on without it being lost. The difference can be made clear by considering the differences between an MP3 music file and online games.

== Payment models ==

There is some evidence of opportunity for revenue already – custom publishing is one area proven to be thriving in the online media world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/05/the-case-for-digital-custom-publishing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530074211/http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/05/the-case-for-digital-custom-publishing/ |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the common payment system implemented in Slovakia and Slovenia by Piano Media. In this model publishers agree to go behind a paywall simultaneously and then start to charge the customer for access to all newspapers and all articles. While not all content is paid, exclusive content is and the model enables publishers who are unable to erect a pay-wall by themselves to start earning revenue outside of advertising from the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=William|title=A National Paywall That Works|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/a_national_paywall_that_works.php|accessdate=14 Feb 2012|magazine=Columbia Journalism Review|date=14 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased accessibility and interactivity of online journalism has also created new opportunity in the guise of crowdsourcing, enabling people to get investigative journalists working on stories that they themselves have suggested and funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/05/crowdfunding-journalism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516235959/http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/05/crowdfunding-journalism/ |archivedate=2009-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some success in new models for paid content is being found in the use of [[paywalls]], especially "soft" paywalls, which blend into [[freemium]] models.  Newspapers, in particular, have been implementing paywalls in an attempt to increase revenue, which has been diminishing due to a decline in print subscriptions and advertising revenue.  The approaches to paywall implementation range.  For example, ''The New York Times'' experimented with a metered paywall, on which they spent a reported $40 million to code and took 14 months to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulley|first=Brett|title=New York Times Fixes Paywall Flaws to Balance Free Versus Paid on the Web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-28/new-york-times-fixes-paywall-glitches-to-balance-free-vs-paid-on-the-web.html|date=28 January 2011|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other publications have turned to providers to implement a solution for them, such as [[Weekly World News]], which announced in January 2013 that they would be utilizing a pay model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horgan|first=Richard|title=Wacky Tabloid Weekly World News Turns to LA Paywall Firm|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/weekly-world-news-media-pass-matthew-mitchell-neil-mcginnis_b79766|publisher=FishbowlLA/MediaBistro|date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of [[pay what you want]] has also proven successful, at least for special promotions.

Pay After Reading (PAR) is a new business model and the principle for paid Internet content. This principle was applied for the first time  by Slydoo on their Travel guides generator and means that the end users has access to information available in the database, not public, not free of charge, however, payment for the information occurs only after downloading / reading this information. The main reason for this approach is to overcome the natural block that has any user who should pay for the information / content without the detail knowledge of this information upfront. The author (Radomir Adamek) of this principle assumed that this model will become usual for most applications working with paid content.

=== Content on mobile services ===

In comparison to content on the traditional internet, content for mobile services has never been free.&lt;ref name="BruckBuchholz2005-57"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter A. Bruck|author2=Andrea Buchholz|author3=Zeger Karssen|author4=Ansgar Zerfass|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7A-aNhSzLj8C&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-25093-7|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition travelled in Canada from 7 June 1989 - 15 Feb 1990. 

The exhibition was a major survey, featuring nearly 16 hours of running time, covering 14 years of production, and providing an "opportunity to gain an historical perspective on the use of the medium by Canadian feminist film producers."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== Exhibition Details ==
The curator used the exhibition to address women's position in television and Canadian video production&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The chronological start of the show was [[Lisa Steele]]’s piece "Birthday Suit: Scars and Defects," produced in 1974.  The other pieces, of which there were 32 tapes (counting Anne Ramsden’s trilogy ''Manufactured Romance'' as a single work), were organized by theme into seven programmes: "The Body Politic", "Requiem for Romance", "The Personal is Political", "Memory", "Mythology", "Desire", and "She Works Hard for Her Money".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A common theme amongst many of the tapes is "elements of feminist video intervention (recording our histories, the personal as political, reclaiming the female body as subject rather than spectacle)".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other issues covered by the video work include lesbian sex, nudity, sexual harassment, and "slashing".

'''Road of Hope in Color''' (Spanish: '''Ruta de Esperanza en Color'''; Macedonian: '''Патот на Надежта во Боја'''; Croatian: '''Put Nade u Boji''') is an [[art exhibition]] and a movement against [[cancer]] that proposes the creation by law of an art workshop for each Regional Hospital along [[Chile]], to benefit cancer patients and those who must face long-term illness, thereby improving the system of [[Public health|Public Health]].

It consists of 28 [[oil painting]]s on canvas, 12 of which were painted from February to August 2011 over the treatment of six sessions of [[chemotherapy]] of a 79-year-old patient diagnosed with cancer in December 2010, Prof. Dora Formas. Two renowned European artists, Tome Mishev and Chendo, contributed six works, each created especially for this exhibition. Marysol Salval, a Spanish artist who lives in Chile, contributed four paintings. The background music of the exposition is donated by [[Simon Trpčeski]], piano soloist from the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] of [[London]]. In addition, this initiative is being supported by ADICA (Professional Diplomats Association) and FALP (Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation against cancer).

The collection opened in the Cultural Center “[[Palacio de La Moneda]]” and is planned to be presented in cities in Chile, United States, Spain, [[Croatia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It is a tribute to women as a symbol of fertility, creative force, beauty, harmony, and spiritual strength. It has depth and complexity, expressing theology, mythology and how they confuse each other to this day; it encourages reflection and perhaps a metaphysical concept along with other philosophical disquisitions. The Road of Hope in Color is a masterful expression of love for life. Each work reflects the symbolism of life, death and resurrection, spiritual peace, the [[Eucharist]] and the hope for renewal of faith.

[[File:ReinaTodoslosSantos.jpg|thumb|Regalia accessories for ''Our Lady of All Saints''. Note the solid brass ''Aureola'' or halo. Spain, 2008.]] 
A '''''{{lang|es|santo}}''''' ([[English language|English]]: '[[Saint (Catholicism)|saint]]') is a piece of one of various religious art forms found in [[Spain]] and areas that [[Spanish Empire|were colonies]] of the [[Kingdom of Spain]], consisting of wooden or ivory statues that depict various saints, [[angel]]s, or [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] titles, or one of the personages of the [[Holy Trinity]]. A '''''{{lang|es|santero}}''''' (female: '''''{{lang|es|santera}}''''') is a craftsperson who makes the image. Some ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' which have gained greater public devotion among the faithful have also merited [[Pope|papal]] approval through [[canonical coronation]]s.  ''{{lang|es|Santos}}'' remain a living tradition of [[religious iconography]] and [[folk art]] in [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]] and some other [[Caribbean]] islands, [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], especially [[New Mexico]].

==History and terminology==
[[Icon]]s and other religious images were crucial for the conversions of indigenous peoples to [[Roman Catholic Church]], which was itself an integral part of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. However, long distances, inefficient methods of transportation, and high demand for such artworks limited the ability of ecclesiastical authorities to supply [[Diocese|parish]] churches, especially those in remote outposts, with works of religious art from the Kingdom of Spain.
 
The practice of creating ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' began in Spain, where [[mannequin]]-style religious images were commonly [[Vestment|vested]] in ornate religious clothing, often expensive and funded by religious devotees. An early known example is the 1555 statue of [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], already vested during the time of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]]. Customarily, jewels are various accessories were also added onto larger ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', a tradition still carried on today. While larger pieces are typically used in churches, many smaller ones are personal or family items of reverence, or kept as decorations.&lt;ref name="TourismBultos" /&gt; ''{{lang|es|Santos}}'' are also common throughout [[Latin America]], the [[Spanish West Indies|Spanish Caribbean]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], as well as the [[Philippines]], with distinct styles and traditions in each area.

''{{lang|es|Santo}}'' statues and statuettes, carved [[Sculpture#Types of sculpture|in the round]], are commonly known as '''''{{lang|es|revultos}}''''' or informally as '''''{{lang|es|bultos}}'''''. They are usually made of wood.  Larger scenic pieces, including multiple statues or done in [[bas relief]], or simply painted on wood panels, and which may include non-figural iconography, are called '''''{{lang|es|retablos}}''''', originally [[Reredos|altar backboards or screens]], though today often adapted to secular artistic purposes in the [[Chicano art movement]] {{crossref|(for more information, see [[Retablo]])}}.

Among ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'', two distinct types are often noted, the '''''{{lang|es|bastidor}}''''' ('frame', 'structure') style, a mannequin intended to be dressed with clothing and accessories, and the '''''{{lang|es|detallado}}''''' ('detailed') style, with adornments painted on permanently (though sometimes also featuring added items). ''{{lang|es|Bastidores}}'' often have interchangeable or posable arms, and sometimes feature a cage-like lattice (thus the name) to hold and shape the vestments.

[[Ivory]] was often cited as the best and most expensive material for carving ''{{lang|es|santos}}''. [[Elephant ivory]], especially of African origin, has been restricted or banned from sale, distribution, or commercialization in Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and many other countries.  While exact laws vary by jurisdiction (from total bans to legal sale of antiques only), ivory is now rarely used.  While the most economical modern type of ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' are made of [[Synthetic resin|resin]] or [[fiberglass]], and mass-produced, traditional examples are still made primarily of wood, sometimes with metal accessories.

==In the Philippines==
[[File:Our Lady of La Naval de Manila.jpg|Our Lady of La Naval de Manila.jpg|thumb|Often called the "Grandest Marian icon" in the Philippines, the image of [[Our Lady of La Naval de Manila]] is an ivory statue, with gold bullion embroidered vestments and jeweled crowns among its regalia. ''{{lang|es|Santo}}'' collectors also own medium-sized replicas of this image.]]

The ''{{lang|es|santero}}'' culture in the Philippines is widely prevalent among [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Filipino Catholics]], having been influenced by [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|centuries of Spain colonial rule]] and various forms of [[folk Catholicism]]. The earliest recorded vested ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' in the Philippines is the [[Santo Niño de Cebu]], a baptismal gift given by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to [[Rajah Humabon]]'s [[Queen consort|consort]] in 1521.

In the Spanish period, only the nobility (such as the ''{{lang|es|[[Principalía]]}}'') and the rich could afford to have Santo, due to their elaborate ornamentation and design. The procurement and maintenance of Santo is today still considered costly, with the most expensive type of Santo are ones made of ''{{lang|es|marfil}}'' (ivory). From a religious perspective, the practice of owning and maintaining ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' images are often regarded as a mild [[Catechism]] for people, especially with regards to the iconographic attributes attached to specific images. A custodian or family of custodians of a ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' are termed ''{{lang|es|camarero}}'' (female: ''{{lang|es|camarera}}'', plural ''{{lang|es|camararos}}''), which in modern Spanish means '[[waiting staff]]'.

The most well-known ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' in the Philippines are often Marian titles, such Our Lady of Manaoag and [[Our Lady of La Naval de Manila]], while those of [[Jesus Christ]] are the [[Santo Niño de Cebu]] and the [[Black Nazarene]]. ''{{lang|tl|[[Santol (fruit)|Santol]]}}'' (cottonfruit, ''[[Sandoricum koetjape]]'') is a favorite material for the figures in the Philippines, as is the wood of ''[[Elaeocarpus calomala]]'', while ''{{lang|tl|batikulín}}'' (''Litsea leytensis'') wood is highly sought after and more expensive, given its resistance to [[termite]]s.

== In the United States ==
[[File:Bulto, Harwood.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial]] ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' or ''{{lang|es|bulto}}'' in a common style, with more [[caricature]]-like than realistic features; Harwood Museum, [[Taos, New Mexico]]]]
The tradition of wooden ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' carving was preserved as a folk art in [[Northern New Mexico]] and [[Colorado#Southern region|Southern Colorado]], where isolated villages remain relatively secluded to this day.  Of particular note is the village of [[Cordova, New Mexico]] which has produced several well-known ''{{lang|es|santeros}}''; one was [[George López]], who was awarded the [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1982.

In this region, traditional ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'', unless made for specific church needs, are usually small, and intended for the home, or for the local church or {{lang|es|[[Morada (building)|morada]]}}.  They are typically ''{{lang|es|detallados}}'', without many if any accessories (that is, with clothing and the like carved and painted on the statuettes, though often bearing a separate wooden staff or other bit of regalia).  They are most often made of [[Populus fremontii|cottonwood]], [[pine]] or [[aspen]].&lt;ref name="TourismBultos"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bultos |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=NewMexico.org |publisher=New Mexico State Tourism Department |location=Santa Fe |date=2011 |url= http://www.newmexico.org/hispanic/learn/bultos.php |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110424071708/http://www.newmexico.org/hispanic/learn/bultos.php |archive-date=April 24, 2011 |dead-url=yes |access-date=June 30, 2016}} {{tertiary source|date=June 2016|reason=This is a very weak source, just a couple of sentences obviously summarizing something else that is not cited there.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are multi-piece, with hands, head, and other details carved separately and added to a body that is otherwise carved from single block of wood.  Nevertheless, the region also has a long tradition of larger, articulated, and often bloody [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] ''{{lang|es|bultos}}''.  A ''{{lang|es|santero}}'' usually carves a ''{{lang|es|bulto}}'' with a knife or other [[wood carving]] tools, and then covers it with [[gesso]], a mixture of native [[gypsum]] and glue, to prepare it for painting.&lt;ref name="TourismBultos" /&gt; Some contemporary ''{{lang|es|santeros}}'' still use paints from homemade pigments.&lt;ref name="TourismBultos" /&gt;

Some ''{{lang|es|santeros}}'' supplement their income by making ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'' to sell to tourists, especially at the annual [[Santa Fe International Folk Art Market]] and [[Santa Fe Spanish Market|Spanish Market]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Santa Fe Spanish Market: Santa Fe Plaza |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=NewMexico.org |publisher=New Mexico State Tourism Department |location=Santa Fe |date=2016 |url= http://www.newmexico.org/event/?eid=28680 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160630120818/http://www.newmexico.org/event/?eid=28680 |archive-date=June 30, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including whimsical items, such as ''{{lang|es|bultos}}'' of [[Saint Patrick]], who does not figure in Spanish Catholicism.  One such ''{{lang|es|San Patricio}}'' figurine, by Santa Fe ''{{lang|es|santero}}'' [[Frank Brito Sr.]] (1022–2005) is in the permanent collection of the [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]] since 1997,;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Search Collections: Saint Patrick Missionary of Ireland |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=AmericanArt.SI.edu |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |location=Washington DC |date=2016 |url= http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=36143 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160630105741/http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=36143 |archive-date=June 30, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; many more traditional ''{{lang|es|santos}}'' and other carvings by him are in the [[Museum of International Folk Art]], along with those of other ''{{lang|es|santeros}}'' from various parts of the world.  Entire [[Nativity scene]]s in ''{{lang|es|bulto}}'' style are also popular tourist items.

==Attire and accessories==
[[File:Museummanaoagaajf.JPG|thumb|Regalia associated with the shrine of a ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' of [[Our Lady of Manaoag]], in the Ecclesiastical Museum of the Philippines. Many ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' collectors also seek accessories and vestments like these.]]
The wardrobe items of more elaborate ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', especially "'{{lang|es|bastidor}}'' mannequins, are often expensive, such as the ones woven with gold thread; the most expensive type is known in the Philippines as ''{{lang|tl|inuod}}'' (Tagalog: 'wormed'), which uses a form of French [[gold bullion]] thread to make embroidered floral patterns on the statue's clothing.

Headdresses are also an integral part of a ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', often encrusted with [[costume jewelry]] (such as paste and rhinestones) or real precious stones, to symbolize the spiritual wealth of the saint. The most common headdress for images is the ''{{lang|es|aureola}}'' ([[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) behind or above the head, while regal figures wear an additional ''{{lang|es|corona}}'' ([[crown (headgear)|crown]] or [[coronet]]).  A halo decorating the perimeter of the face, known as a ''{{lang|es|resplendor}}'' or ''{{lang|es|rostrillo}}'', is commonly found but not restricted to images of Mary, mother of Jesus. Images of Jesus are identified with the ''{{lang|es|Tres Potencias}}'', a set of three rays protruding from the head at acute angles, and these are never used for any other subject. Triangular haloes are exclusive to rare images of the Trinity, and some saints occasionally bear a ''{{lang|es|luna}}'', moon-shaped headband.  While there are cheap plastic crowns, haloes, and other metal accessories associated with ''{{lang|es|santos}}'', others are made of [[aluminium]] or, traditionally, [[tin]] ([[tinwork]] remains a major [[folk art]] form in general in Mexico and New Mexico). These adornments are sometimes [[Gilding|gold-plated]] for a richer effect. A more expensive type in the Philippines is made of solid brass, and ''{{lang|tl|pukpók}}'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for 'hammered') by an artisan. The costliest type of crowns are those made of solid [[sterling silver]] or [[gold]], often reserved for wealthy clerics and cathedrals.  Another style is called ''{{lang|es|estofado}}'', referring to dented holes placed on gold or silver foiling on the halos or the body of a statue, creating a reflective effect when placed in the light.

Other wooden, metallic, or composite accessories, which depend on the iconographic attributes of the subject, range from a long baton for some Marian images, a [[scepter]] or staff for various saints, a ''{{lang|la|[[globus cruciger]]}}'' (usually for images of the [[Christ Child]]), a [[rosary]], wings, flowers, a weapon or weapons used in a saint's [[martyrdom]], or some other object associated with the figure (e.g. small animals with [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]).

Another costly item involved in the maintenance of a large ''{{lang|es|santo}}'' is the  ''{{lang|es|carroza}}'' (carriage), often used to bear the statute during religious processions in rural Mexico and the Philippines, such as those of a town [[festival|fiesta]], and [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]]. These often have embossed metal decorations, and cloths forming a skirt to hide the wheels of the carriage, along with scenery for [[Tableau vivant|tableaux]] representing episodes from the [[Gospels]], such as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] narrative.

The '''Statue of Hope''' is an [[allegorical figure]] that is typically a private [[memorial]] or [[monument]] displayed in a [[graveyard]] or [[cemetery]]. [[Hope]] is one of the [[Seven Virtues]] of the [[Christian religion]].

==History==

Most commonly used in the [[Victorian era]] and believed to be popularized by the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s dedication in 1886. Prior to this, other images such as [[Saint Philomena]] whose authorization of devotion began in 1837 &lt;ref&gt;''It is Time to Meet St. Philomena'' By Dr. Mark Miravalle 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Goddess of Hope statue sculpted in 1817,&lt;ref&gt;''Kierkegaard and His Contemporaries'': Pages 375–405; Thorvaldsen: An Introduction to his Work 2003&lt;/ref&gt; displayed similar characteristics.

One of the earliest signed Statue of Hope memorials was carved by [[Odoardo Fantacchiotti]] in 1863 for the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] of Samuel Reginald Routh of [[England]] in the [[Protestant]] Cemetery of [[Florence]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunders of White Silence, the Protestant cemetery of Florence, Italy'', Julia Bolton Holloway 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation was completed in 1791. The [[Custom House, Dublin]] [[Ireland]] features a 16 foot (about 5 meter) tall statue of a female resting on an anchor atop the dome. This statue has been called both the Statue of Hope&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic World", The Catholic Publication House, New York, Page 831, Vol. XIX April–September 1874&lt;/ref&gt; and the Statue of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopædia Britannica", The Sixth Edition, Page 367, Vol. VII, 1823&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

In the [[United States]], these statues were commonly carved out of limestone or [[marble]] and were usually unsigned. The Wilson memorial pictured on the right was sculpted using [[Indiana Limestone]] which was quarried nearby. Towards the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century, some were cast with [[zinc]], commonly referred to as [[White Bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;The Foundry Magazine, Vol.35 No. 5, January 1910, Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious symbolism==

A female, typically shown wearing [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stola]] and [[Palla (garment)|Palla]] garments, stands with one arm resting on or holding an [[anchor]]. This is often an [[Anchored cross]] meaning hope&lt;ref&gt;Keister, Douglas, ''Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography''. Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith Publishers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary symbol of the statue. Further, the [[New Testament]], Hebrews 6:19 states ''Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William and Cheetam, Samuel, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', London, England: J. R Burr Publishing Co., Page 81, Vol.1, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the opposite arm is raised with the index finger of the hand pointing towards the sky. This symbolizes the pathway to heaven. A hand held over the heart symbolizes faith. Other key elements can be a broken chain attached to the anchor or sometimes hanging from the neck. This symbolizes the cessation of life. Many statues have a single [[five pointed star]] rather than a [[circle of stars]]. The [[Star (heraldry)|star]] is on the top of the forehead, usually on a [[Crown of Immortality]] or [[diadem]], and represents the immortal [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Art, Ancient and Modern'', Harry A Bliss 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Funeral''''' is an 1878 plaster sculpture by [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]] (1841-1905), first exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] that year, where it won a medal of honour. He then produced a marble version for the Salon of 1883. Both works showing [[Adam and Eve]] bearing the body of their son [[Abel]]. The plaster original is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

'''''The Ricotta Eaters''''' is a c.1580 oil on canvas painting by [[Vincenzo Campi]], showing four figures eating a round [[ricotta]]. The artist himself entitled it ''Buffonaria'', which links its four figures to [[Commedia dell'arte]] characters, with the artist himself shown in the costume of [[Pantalone]]. The work is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], which was given it by Jacques Bernard in 1875.

'''WHUT-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 32 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 33), is a Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]) [[network affiliate#Member stations|member]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to the [[United States|American]] [[capital city]] of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, District of Columbia]]. The station is owned by [[Howard University]], an [[historically black college]], and is [[sister station|sister]] to [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[urban contemporary]] radio station [[WHUR-FM|WHUR]] (96.3 FM). WHUT's studios are located on the Howard University campus, and its transmitter is located in the [[Tenleytown]] neighborhood in the [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest quadrant]] of Washington.

==History==
Channel 32 was founded on September 29, 1980 as '''WHMM-TV'''. The station was the first [[African-American]] owned and operated [[Public broadcasting|public]] [[non-commercial educational|educational]] station in the United States. In 1998, the station changed its [[call sign]] to WHUT, standing for Howard University Television, the station's branding.
[[File:WHUT-TV, Howard University.jpg|thumb|left|WHUT-TV station in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Since its founding, WHUT has won 11 [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and 8 [[Communications Excellence to Black Audiences]] Awards. Despite this success, budget cuts have forced the station to roll back programming hours in recent years. As of October 21, 2007, digital channel 33 was on the air with a simulcast of the programming on analog channel 32. By November 21, 2007, the station had corrected an earlier problem with the lack of PSIP data so that digital receivers could lock on to it. Today, WHUT airs a variety of standard PBS programming, as well as programs produced by Howard University, and international programs focusing on regions such as the [[Caribbean]] and [[Africa]].

Soon after the start of preparations for the [[Broadcast incentive auction#Spectrum reallocation|2016-17 spectrum reallocation auction]], Howard University announced that it was considering the sale of WHUT-TV's channel 33 allocation in the auction in order to alleviate longstanding financial issues at the university. The station was entered into the auction when it began in March 2016. Because of WHUT-TV's status as the only black-owned public television station in the United States, the decision attracted sustained opposition from faculty and community members who feared the loss of a rare minority voice in public media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard University May Sell Rights to Its Public TV Station’s Spectrum |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/business/howard-university-may-sell-rights-to-its-public-tv-stations-spectrum.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 December 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard announced WHUT-TV was withdrawn from the auction on February 16, 2017; the official reason was that the station's asking price had become low enough through the [[reverse auction]] process that it was apparent selling would not produce sufficient proceeds to justify ending operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Howard University decides it won’t sell WHUT in spectrum auction |url=https://current.org/2017/02/howard-university-decides-it-wont-sell-whut-in-spectrum-auction/ |work=Current}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Washington, D.C. TV stations became a test market for [[Mobile DTV]], and WHUT was one of the participating stations.&lt;ref name=Special&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/314792-Special_Report_Mobile_DTV_Heats_Up.php |title=Special Report: Mobile DTV Heats Up |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-13 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WHUT-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 32, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former UHF analog channel 32.

WHUT-TV commenced [[ATSC-M/H]] (Mobile DTV) broadcasting on February 27, 2011. WHUT-TV is the last remaining Washington-market broadcaster to broadcast an M/H signal. The signal nominally contains a feed of its main programming in standard definition on 32.1 and an audio feed of [[WAMU]] on 32.2, although neither stream contains audio or video data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHUT TSReader Capture 02/26/2018|url=https://rabbitears.info/atscinfo/dc-dca/27772-0_0.htm|website=RabbitEars.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windows Color System''' (WCS) is a platform for [[color management]], first included with [[Windows Vista]], that aims to achieve color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/WCS.mspx Windows Color System]&lt;/ref&gt; Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of [[color calibration]] automatic and transparent, as an evolution of [[ICC profile]]s.

Windows Color System features a ''Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine'' (CITE) at its core. It is backed up by a color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than three), alternative [[color space]]s and [[high dynamic range imaging|high dynamic range]] coloring, using a technology named ''Kyuanos''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reuveni|first1=Noam|title=Windows Vista to use Canon Color Management|url=http://cameras.reviewed.com/content/Windows-Vista-to-use-Canon-Color-Management|website=Reviewed.com Cameras|date=13 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own [[Color management#Gamut mapping|gamut mapping]] algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also supports floating point calculations to minimize [[round-off error]]s, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a [[color translation]] according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.

WCS features explicit support for LCD as well as CRT monitors, projectors, printers, and other imaging devices and provides customized support for each. WCS uses color profiles according to [[CIECAM02]], defined using [[XML]], to define how the color representation actually translates to a visible color. [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] V4 color profiles are also supported. [[Windows Photo Gallery]] and Photo Viewer only support the deprecated V2 standard and show dark images when used with V4 profiles, [[Windows Imaging Component]], the [[HD Photo]] format, [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] print path and XPS documents all support color management.

'''Zazpiak Bat''' is a [[heraldic]] nickname for the Basque [[coat of arms]] which includes the arms of the seven provinces mentioned, stressing their unity. It was designed by the historian Jean de Jaurgain in 1897 for the ''Congrès et Fêtes de la Tradition basque'' celebrated at [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]. 

==Name==
''Zazpiak Bat'' is a motto attributed to [[Basque people|Basque]] [[explorer]] [[Antoine-Thomson d'Abbadie]] in the late nineteenth century, from the [[Basque language|Basque]] words ''zazpiak'' meaning 'the seven' and ''bat'' meaning 'one', translates as "the seven [are] one" and refers to the seven [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] traditional provinces. However, it was first cited in 1836 by a friend and collaborator of Antoine d'Abbadie's, the [[Soule]]tin [[Agosti Xaho]] (''Etudes grammaticales sur la langue euskarienne'', dedicated to the ''Zazpirak Bat''). The motto is based on a similar one fashioned by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] society [[Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País]] in 1765, ''Irurac bat'', 'the three [are] one', after the provinces currently making up the [[Basque Autonomous Community]]), while a like variant was created too in the 19th century known as ''Laurak bat'' ('the four [are] one', after the four Basque provinces in Spain), a motto quoted and celebrated by the Provincial Government of Navarre in 1866.

==History==
[[File:ETA Pasajes 2003 06 28.jpg|thumb|[[Batasuna]] mural painting in [[Gipuzkoa]] (2003), featuring the modern version of ''Zazpiak Bat'' along with [[arrano beltza]], [[lauburu]], and [[Ikurriña]]]]

The original Zazpiak Bat features a design of traditional arms of six Basque territories, namely [[Álava]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and [[Biscay]] (the three which make the [[Basque Autonomous Community]]) plus [[Navarre]] (both in [[Spain]]); and the two that are part of the French department of the [[Pyrénées Atlantiques]] - [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]]. The coat of arms of the third traditional province, [[Lower Navarre]] is subsumed under the coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], therefore omitted and represented by the latter. The modern design is based on the current simplified heraldry of these territories. 

===Laurak Bat===
{{main|Coat of arms of Basque Country (autonomous community)}}
Laurak Bat with the four Basque provinces in Spain was adopted as the [[Coat of arms of Basque Country (autonomous community)|coat of arms]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque autonomous community]]. The [[coat of arms of Navarre]] was originally included in the fourth quarter of the shield, but following a protest from the [[Unión del Pueblo Navarro|UPN]] led government of [[Navarre]], the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] forced the Basque government to remove the chains of Navarre from the Basque insignia. The red background of the Navarrese insignia currently occupies the fourth quarter of the coat of arms of the Basque Country.
