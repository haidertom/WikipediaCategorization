'''ACeS''' ('''PT Asia Cellular Satellite''') was a regional [[satellite]] [[telecommunications]] company based in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. It offered [[GSM]]-like satellite telephony services to Asian market. The coverage area included [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Vietnam]], [[China]] and [[India]]. The company operated the [[Garuda 1]] satellite, launched on February 12, 2000. A second satellite (Garuda 2) was planned but never materialized. ACeS was formed by a joint venture of PT. Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN), [[Lockheed Martin]] Global Telecommunication (LMGT), Jasmine International Overseas Ltd of Thailand and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. ([[PLDT]]). ACeS services were marketed by National Service Providers (NSPs) in six countries; PT. Pasifik Satelit Nusantara in Indonesia, ACeS Regional Services in Thailand, Smart ACeS in the Philippines, TMTouch/[[Celcom]] in Malaysia, AVCO in [[Nepal]] and [[Mobitel (Sri Lanka)|Mobitel]] in Sri Lanka.

The satellite and most network operations were controlled by ACeS Network Control Center in [[Batam]] Island, Indonesia. The NSPs operated ground stations which provided links to the terrestrial telephone networks.

ACeS has been assigned the virtual country code +88220, an [[International Networks (country code)|international networks]] code rather than a [[Global Mobile Satellite System|GMSS]] code as the system does not operate globally. The company currently supplies only one handset type, the [[Ericsson]] R190, which derived many components from GH688 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acesinternational.com/corporate/index.php?fuseaction=Product.term-mobile ACeS - ASIA Cellular Satellite]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822223714/http://www.acesinternational.com/corporate/index.php?fuseaction=Product.term-mobile |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R190 is a dual-mode Satellite/GSM phone which automatically switches to satellite mode when terrestrial GSM network is not available. It accepts standard [[GSM]] [[SIM card]]s, and since ACeS has international roaming agreements with many GSM networks worldwide, the phone can be used in virtually any country. The handset supports most standard services such as call forward and call waiting but does not support short message service (SMS) in satellite mode. The demise of Ericsson mobile phone business in 2001 has left ACeS with no other handset available to offer to its customers {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. As Ericsson left the mobile phone business, production of the R190 was then continued by ACeS and rebranded to be the ACeS R190. Additionally ACeS has developed a land phone version, the ACeS FR-190, that allowed many villages and rural areas throughout Asia access to basic telephony services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acesinternational.com/corporate/index.php?fuseaction=Product.term-fixed |title=ACeS - Fixed Phone |publisher=ACeS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222012110/http://www.acesinternational.com/corporate/index.php?fuseaction=Product.term-fixed |archivedate=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its conception, ACeS network was designed to serve up to 2 million subscribers. It aimed for markets unserved by regular terrestrial cellular networks, such as rural areas, forestry, mining and marine industries. However, sales grew slowly and after five years of operation ACeS had fewer than 20,000 subscribers. The company failed to attract more customers, and eventually it was considered by many as a commercial failure. In 2014 ACeS ceased operation altogether.

'''Andreas Meyer''' (born 9 April 1961 in [[Basel]]) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] manager and [[Jurist|lawyer]]. Since 1 January 2007, he has been Chairman of the Management Board of the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB).

== Life ==
Andreas Meyer passed his [[Matura#Matura in Switzerland|Matura type B]] at the Gymnasium [[Muttenz]] in 1980. He then studied law at the [[University of Basel|Universities of Basel]] and [[University of Fribourg|Fribourg (Switzerland]]). The son of a railwayman worked as a car cleaner at SBB during his studies. In 1989, he completed and passed his lawyer's exams in the [[Canton (country subdivision)|Canton]] of [[Basel-Landschaft]] and in 1995 he received an MBA from [[INSEAD]] in [[Fontainebleau]].

He began his career as a legal consultant at [[ABB Group|ABB]] in 1990, and later as an assistant to the management and project manager at the SBB subsidiary, W + E Environment Technology in [[Zürich]]. From 1996 to 1997, he worked as managing director at the German plant construction company, [[Deutsche Babcock]] in [[Oberhausen]] and [[Bitterfeld]].

From 1997 to 2006, Andreas Meyer worked in various positions at [[Deutsche Bahn]] AG. He joined DB Energie as Managing Director and became Chairman of the Management Board in 2000. In 1997, he was entrusted with the task of selling the Energy Saving Party. Through renovations, he was able to convince the concern group of a long-term preservation of the Energy Division of the DB Group. In 2004, he became Chairman of the Management Board of DB Stadtverkehr At the same time, he was also a member of the Executive Board of DB Personenverkehr. From 2005, Meyer was also a member of the Deutsche Bahn AG‘s Executive Board.

On 23 June 2006, Meyer, with effect from 1 January 2007, was unanimously elected by SBB's Board of Directors, from 30 candidates, to succeed Benedikt Weibel. Ten of the candidates had extensive interviews. In the 2014 fiscal year, he received a fixed salary of CHF 580,000, as well as a performance-related share of CHF 492,000. With a total of around CHF 1.1 million as income, Meyer is therefore the highest paid employee in a company close to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. In 1996, the total income for SBB CEO Benedikt Weibel was CHF 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handelszeitung.ch/management/sbb-chef-meyer-ist-topverdiener-beim-bund-806348 |title=SBB-Chef Meyer ist Topverdiener beim Bund |date=1 July 2015 |publisher=Handelszeitung |access-date=11 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ktipp.ch/artikel/d/wer-hat-dem-wird-gegeben/ |title=Wer hat, dem wird gegeben |author=Gery Schwager |date=16 April 2012 |publisher=Konsumenteninfo Zürich |access-date=11 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
As a result of Meyers's change of position from Deutsche Bahn to SBB, there was controversy about his income in 2008. Within SBB's 2007 annual report, it was shown that Meyer had received an additional bonus on top of his bonus and an extraordinary contribution to the pension fund: SBB Immobilien acquired Meyers German residence and organized its sale to facilitate his change of location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://company.sbb.ch/de/medien/medienstelle/medienmitteilungen/detail.html/2008/3/56076 |title=SBB-Chef Andreas Meyer erhielt 2007 100 000 Franken mehr Lohn als sein Vorgänger |date=30 August 2008 |publisher=Schweizerische Bundesbahnen |access-date=11 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/SBBChef-kassiert-Rekordbonus/story/23516519 |title=SBB-Chef kassiert Rekordbonus |author=MatthiasPfander |date=26 March 2015 |publisher=Tages Anzeiger |access-date=11 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the media and public debates surrounding this decision, a parliamentary inquiry was initiated by the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]], [[Josef Zisyadis]].

== Family ==
Andreas Meyer is married, a father of three children and lives in [[Muri bei Bern]]. He grew up together with his brother in a railroad family in [[Birsfelden]] in Basel.

'''Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Software''' is [[software]] used in the [[finance]] and [[legal]] industries to meet the legal requirements for [[financial institutions]] and other regulated entities to prevent or report [[money laundering]] activities.  There are four basic types of software that address anti-money laundering:
transaction monitoring systems, [[currency transaction report]]ing (CTR) systems, customer identity management systems and compliance management software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/anti-money-laundering/anti-money-laundering-software/|title=What Is Anti Money Laundering Software? I ComplyAdvantage|last=|first=|date=|work=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent enactment of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] in the United States and the establishment of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF).  By 2010 many jurisdictions globally required [[financial institutions]] to monitor, investigate and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in their respective country.

An entire industry developed around providing software to analyze transactions in an attempt to identify transactions or patterns of transactions, called [[structuring]], which requires a [[Suspicious activity report|SAR]] filing, or other suspicious patterns that qualify for SAR reporting. Financial institutions faced penalties for failing to properly file CTR and SAR reports, including heavy fines and regulatory restrictions, even to the point of charter revocation.

==Types==
There are four basic types of software addressing AML business requirements:
* Transaction monitoring systems, which focus on identification of suspicious patterns of transactions which may result in the filing of [[Suspicious Activity Report]]s (SARs) or Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs).  Identification of suspicious (as opposed to normal) transactions is part of the KYC requirements.
* [[Currency Transaction Report]]ing (CTR) systems, which deal with large cash transaction reporting requirements ($10,000 and over in the U.S.)
* Customer identity management systems which check various negative lists (such as [[OFAC]]) and represent an initial and ongoing part of [[Know your customer]] (KYC) requirements. Electronic verification can also check against other databases to provide positive confirmation of ID such as (in the UK: electoral roll; the "share" database used by banks and credit agencies; telephone lists; electricity supplier lists; post office delivery database
* Compliance software to help firms comply with AML regulatory requirements; retain the necessary evidence of compliance; and deliver and record appropriate training of relevant staff.  In addition, it should have audit trails of compliance officers activities in particular pertaining to the handling of alerts raised against customer activity. 

===Transaction monitoring software===
These software applications effectively monitor bank customer transactions on a daily basis and, using customer historical information and account profile, provide a "whole picture" to the bank management. Transaction monitoring can include cash deposits and withdrawals, wire transfers and ACH activity. In the bank circles, these applications are known as "AML software".

Each vendor's software works somewhat differently.  Some of the modules which should be present in an AML software are:
*Know Your Customer
*Entity Resolution
*Transaction Monitoring
*Compliance Reporting
*Alert based case management
*Investigation Tools
*Document management to hold the customer related documentation such as account opening package, customer identification documents, etc...
*Delivery of AML Training
*Customer due diligence checks, including electronic verification
*Automated Standard operating procedures e.g. workflow engine/
*Dissemination of AML policies and procedures

===Customer Identity Management Systems===
The definition for Customer Identity Management Systems varies in different regions and jurisdictions. Most vendors include the following features in their solutions:
*Sanction List Check
*Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Check
*False Positive Recording
*Single Scan and Batch Scanning
*Auditing and Reporting

===Machine learning for money laundering detection===
There are solutions based on artificial intelligence, which are characterized by much better efficiency in detecting money laundering, comparing to rule-based approach. Especially, deep neural networks  are able to discover complex interdependencies between various activities performed to launder money. This translates into fewer false alarms and more accurate detection. In the near future, transaction monitoring systems will be based on machine learning rather than on rules and scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Criminology and penology |crimes}}

In [[criminology]], '''blue-collar crime''' is any crime committed by an individual from a lower [[social class]] as opposed to [[white-collar crime]] which is associated with crime committed by someone of a higher-level social class. While blue-collar crime has no official legal classification, it holds to a general net group of crimes. These crimes are primarily small scale, for immediate beneficial gain to the individual or group involved in them. This can also include personal related crimes that can be driven by immediate reaction, such as during fights or confrontations. These crimes include but are not limited to: Narcotic production or distribution, sexual assault, theft, burglary, assault or murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/blue-collar-crime-definition-statistics-examples.html|title=Blue-Collar Crime: Definition, Statistics &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=Study.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
Blue-collar crime is a term used to identify crime, normally of a small scale nature in contrast to “white-collar crime”, and is generally attributed to people of the lower class. During the 1910s through to the 1920s in America, manual labourers often opted for blue shirts, so that stains gained from days at work were less visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/explainer/2012/05/blue_collar_white_collar_why_do_we_use_these_terms_.html|title=Working Man's Blues|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2012-05-01|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As during that time period and geographic location manual labour was often or almost exclusively assigned to the lower classes, the term was more permanently attributed to them as defining low income earners. This has carried on to the modern day, therefore meaning crime committed by lower classes. It is important to note that blue-collar crime does not exclusively address low income earners in work, but also includes the unemployed who are also members of the lower classes.

==Crime and unemployment==
The International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ILO) defines the unemployed as persons above a specified age who, during the reference period, were without work, were currently available for work, and were seeking work. The process of [[industrialisation]] encouraged working-class incorporation into [[society]] with greater social mobility being achieved during the twentieth century. But the routine of policing tends to focus on the public places where the economically marginal live out more of their lives, so regulation falls on those who are not integrated into the mainstream institutions of economic and political life. A perennial source of conflict has therefore involved working-class youth but, as long-term structural unemployment emerged, an underclass was created. [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argues that the majority class did not need the unemployed to maintain and even increase its standard of living, and so the condition of the underclass became hopeless. Box (1987) sums up the research into crime and unemployment at pp96–7:
:The relationship between overall unemployment and crime is inconsistent. On balance the weight of existing research supports there being a weak but none-the-less significant causal relationship. However, properly targeted research on young males, particularly those from disadvantaged ethnic groups, which considers both the meaning and duration of unemployment, has yet to be done. The significance of unemployment will vary depending on its duration, social assessments of blame, previous experience of steady employment, perception of future prospects, comparison with other groups, etc. Hence, there is likely to be a causal relationship between relative deprivation and crime, particularly where unemployment is perceived as unjust and hopeless by comparison with the lot of other groups. Thornberry and Christenson (1984) analysed data from a longitudinal cohort study of [[juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] in [[Philadelphia]] and found (at p405):
:Unemployment exerts a rather immediate effect on criminal involvement, while criminal involvement exerts a more long-range effect on unemployment. What this and other [[empiricism|empirical]] research demonstrates is that crime-rates, especially for property offences, were higher during periods of unemployment than of employment. This suggests that holding constant other variables, the same youths commit more crimes while unemployed. This is not surprising since unemployment provides an incentive to commit offences and erodes the social controls which would otherwise encourage conformity. But crime also rose during the so-called period of affluence, prompting the [[Right Realism]] of [[James Q. Wilson]] and his associates in the [[United States]] who argued that the criminal justice system was failing, and the [[Left realism|Left Realism]] attributed to Jock Young, which argued for situational changes to reduce the availability of criminal opportunities in the environment. More generally, the growth of [[anomie]] (see [[Durkheim]] and, more recently, the [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain Theory]] proposed by [[Robert King Merton|Merton]]), predicted a strong correlation between unemployment and property crime. But Cantor and Land (1985) found a negative association for unemployment and property crime in the United States. They argued that unemployment decreases the opportunity for property crime since it reflects a general slowdown in.

However, there is an explanation for this correlation between unemployment and tendencies towards crime. A study found that both social standing in the classes and the employment status of offenders found them more likely to be detained, arrested and prosecuted by Law Enforcement. Further it came to the conclusion that unemployed persons were more likely to be dealt harsher punishments, and be looked upon unfavourably by the justice system, based on their employment status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=108423|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservatism]] alleges the failure of [[State (polity)|state]] agencies charged with the task of [[socialisation]] to instil self-discipline and [[morality|moral]] values resulting in permissiveness, a lack of conformity, and liberalisation. The "evidence" that there are new affluent criminals allows populist politicians to deny any link between inner-city deprivation and crime. The left avoids the issue of morality and crime which denies earlier work in [[Marxist criminology]] linking crime and the [[culture]] of [[egotism|egoism]] stimulated by economic advance under [[capitalism]] as a more amorally materialistic culture emerges. As Durkheim asserted, moral education cannot be effective in an economically unjust society. Thus, additional research is required, using a more complex model of crime and control to include variables such as opportunities or incentives relative to a country's standard of living, potential punishment, chance of being caught, law enforcement efforts and expenditures on theft and property crime relative to other crimes, size of the country's criminal population, education levels, and other socio-economic factors. A further factor currently being researched is the role of the media in the social construction of "hot spots" or dangerous places within a city. Crime is a substantial element in media news reporting. Media research is now determining whether the coverage of crime is spatially representative of where crime occurs, or disproportionately presents crime as occurring in certain areas of a city, thereby skewing public perceptions and the political response (see Paulsen: 2002).

In Australia a study undertaken, focusing on Aboriginal Australians, researched into the varying crime rates between similar communities. Some of these communities that they compared lived in both similar geographically and demographically. What they found was that the offence rate was likely tied to a cultural aspect of the community that existed. They found that the upbringing of families to their youngers, as well as how the community developed, has a far larger effect on blue-collar related crimes than employment or income.(McCausland &amp; Vivian, 2010).

Rather than unemployment being the sole or a primary contributing factor towards crime rates, there is evidence pointing towards a greater set of factors that can even contribute towards unemployment itself. According to this study the factors that lead to crime should be collected into different clusters: personality of the individual, family, school, peers and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/AbstractDB/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=207632|title=Abstracts Database - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Through the combination of an algorithm and a personal check, they "match" the most suitable consultant with the project's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-hundert.com/startups/comatch-the-berlin-consulting-marketplace-startup-2/|title=Comatch - Berlin Consulting Marketplace Startup - the Hundert - Female Startup Founders Europe|website=the Hundert - Female Startup Founders Europe|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the platform is not available for everyone: after the registration, an assessment based on the CV and personal interviews takes place. In the end, only 50% are passing the quality assessment and will be accepted. Most of the registered consultants worked for the big top tier consultancies like [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]] or [[Roland Berger (company)|Roland Berger]]. 

The registration and requesting projects are free for consultants and clients, a cost of 15% of the daily rate only occur after successful matching for the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/berufsleben/unternehmensberater-wie-freiberufliche-consultants-arbeiten-a-1077159.html|title=Freiberufliche Consultants: Jetzt mach ich die Überstunden für mich|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

COMATCH GmbH was founded in October 2014 by the former [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] consultants Dr. Christoph Hardt and Dr. Jan Schächtele with the support of Venture Capital Company Atlantic Labs (Christophe Maire). The startup launched its website in March 2015.

'''Camillo Castiglioni''' (22 October 1879 – 18 December 1957) was an Italian-Austrian financier and banker, and was the wealthiest man in Central Europe during [[World War I]]. Nicknamed “Austrian [[Hugo Stinnes|Stinnes]]”, he was active in [[aviation]]'s pioneering days and invested in the [[arts]].

==Early life==
Castiglioni was born in [[Trieste]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], to the chief rabbi. It is not known when Camillo developed his interest in aviation, but it is known that he was passionate about flying. Camillo's education was primarily law, gaining employment as an attorney and legal officer of a bank in [[Padua]], quickly learning international finance and how to manage capital.

He was the son of a rubber maker, so naturally Camillo found work with the Austro-American ''Gummiwarenfabrik AG'' (rubber products) in [[Vienna]] as an Agent for the Kaufmann automobile tire division in [[Constantinople]]. Camillo found great success in this position, demonstrating his abilities to negotiate and structure financial deals. In fact, Camillo was so successful, he was promoted to Director of the export department of the parent company in Vienna.

Around 1901, along with Viktor Silberer and Franz Hinterstoissera Camillo helped to create the Viennese aero club (later Austrian aero club). He eventually was made deputy director, then in 1904 he was appointed to General Director of the company. Through his experience in the rubber and tire production field, Camillo saw the birth of aviation as an industry, going from a ballooning hobby, to makeshift glider craft requiring tires, to fully operational aircraft operated by engines. He met many influential men in his business, and came to realize that aviation sparked not only his passion for flight, but also recognized the tremendous financial opportunity of aviation's potential as an industry.

In order to draw from the arising enthusiasm for airplanes and ballooning, as well as to take advantage of the lucrative business the hobby generated, Camillo established one of his first companies, ''[[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft|Luftfahrzeug-Gesellschaft]]'', in 1907. Being a pure commercial firm – it acquired the Etrich balloon patents and sold balloon fliers in Austria Hungary. There were many contests that these inspired balloon drivers entered, and Camillo was no different- he bought his own balloon and successfully took his balloon driver examination on 24 August 1909.

==Aviation financing==
During the First World War, became one of the richest and most influential financiers in Central Europe.

The first major investor in the series production of aircraft.
1914 Purchased the German aircraft company [[Hansa- und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke]], which employed [[Ernst Heinkel]] as its chief designer. Acquired a majority holding in [[Austro-Daimler]] with its chief designers [[Puch]] and [[Porsche]].  Press "Czar" and sponsor of the arts (financed [[Max Reinhardt]] and helped him to organize the [[Salzburg Festival]]). After a series of setbacks, his financial empire broke up in 1926. He retired to [[Switzerland]], then to [[Milan]] where he set up a private bank and once again amassed a considerable fortune. After the Second World War, negotiated a large US loan for his friend [[Josip Broz Tito]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. When Tito refused to pay his commission, Castiglioni succeeded in getting Yugoslavian assets in Italy worth millions sequestered. 1916 Awarded the [[Franz Joseph Order]] with ribbon on the [[Military Service Cross]] for his services to aviation 1918 with the [[St-Georges Order]] for his achievements in the war material production.

Castiglioni became rich in ventures during the period of inflation, acquiring a majority interest in ''[[Alpine Montan AG]]''. The Austrian aviation company ''[[Österreichische Luftfahrtsgesellschaft]]'' was founded by him.

==BMW influence==
Castiglioni significantly influenced the development of BMW AG in its early years. The granting of a license agreement by Austro-Daimler to the Rapp-Werke in 1917 was partly attributable to Castiglioni. 1918 At Castiglioni's insistence the Wiener Bankverein (Vienna) acquired the majority of BMW's share capital. 1922 Castiglioni purchased all the equipment relating to engine construction, the associated know-how and the rights to the name "Bayerische Motoren Werke AG" from the BMW AG, which was renamed Süddeutsche Bremse AG. Castiglioni in turn renamed the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke to BMW AG and allowed the renamed company to continue production at the BFW plant. From the establishment of BMW AG until November 9, 1922 and then from 1924 to 1929, he was a member of the Supervisory Board and President of BMW AG. 1928 Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

His was one of the voices that urged BMW in 1928 to purchase the Eisenach Automobilwerke. Due to financial difficulties in 1929 he was obliged to surrender his holding of BMW shares to a consortium of banks ([[Deutsche Bank]], [[Disconto-Gesellschaft|Disconto]], [[Bankhaus Hagen]] etc.).

A consortium led by the Deutsche Bank and the Diskonto-Gesellschaft purchased the BMW shares previously held by Camillo Castiglioni, who was facing problems of liquidity.

==Failed speculation and bankruptcy==
In February 1924, Castiglioni partnered with [[Fritz Mannheimer]], and later other influential bankers to speculate on the [[devaluation]] of the [[French franc]]. They [[Short (finance)|shorted]] hundreds of millions of franc, eventually causing the franc to drop almost 40% in less than a month. By the beginning of March 1924, one [[United States dollar]] was worth 28 francs. Then, however, investment bank [[Lazard]], on the behalf of [[Banque de France]] and powered by [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morgan Syndicate Lends $100,000,000 To Bank of France |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/03/13/archives/morgan-syndicate-lends-100000000-to-bank-of-france-credit-here.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=1924-03-13 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; bought immense amounts of francs, causing the franc to rise again, to 15 franc per dollar. Castiglioni, Mannheimer and their partners lost millions.

In September 1924, the Austrian [[Depositenbank]], of which Castiglioni had been president, collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Austria Is Shaken by Big Bank Crash |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/09/30/archives/austria-is-shaken-by-big-bank-crash-castiglioni-richest-man-in-the.html |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=1924-09-30 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A warrant for his arrest on a charge of fraud was issued, but Castiglioni had been taken care to be in Italy when the crash came. The Austrian State said that if he deposited $4,200,000 (${{Inflation|US|4200000|1924}} in present-day value), he could return unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,736356,00.html |work=[[Time Magazine]] |publisher= |date=1924-10-06 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Castiglioni built up a large art collection and a theatre in [[Vienna]].  He was the richest man in Central Europe and much beloved by the Viennese whom he assisted financially on Sundays and odd occasions. He was also a patron of the arts and for some time supported the famed producer [[Max Reinhardt]], for whom he built a theater. So fond was he of appearing in the public limelight that he lived with all the pomp and ceremony of royalty, even traveling in the Kaiser Karl's private parlor car, which he bought.

Because of his famous banking activities, his life was documented in a 1988 movie on television titled ''[[Camillo Castiglioni oder die Moral der Haifische]]'' (in English: ''Camillo Castiglioni, or the morality of sharks''), directed by [[Peter Patzak]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], and parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], '''consultant''' is the title of a senior hospital-based [[physician]] or [[surgeon]] who has completed all of his or her [[Medical specialist|specialist]] training and been placed on the '''specialist register''' in their chosen speciality.  Their role is entirely distinct to that of [[general practitioner]]s, or GPs.

Consultants accept ultimate responsibility for the care of all the patients referred to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The role of the consultant|url= http://bma.org.uk/-/media/files/pdfs/developing%20your%20career/becoming%20a%20doctor/role%20of%20consultant.pdf |publisher=British Medical Association|accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the job carries significant personal responsibility. A physician must be on the Specialist Register before he or she may be employed as a substantive consultant in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). This usually entails holding a [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] (CCT) in any of the recognised specialities, but academics with substantial publications and international reputation may be exempted from this requirement, in the expectation that they will practice at a tertiary level. "Locum consultant" appointments of limited duration may be given to those with clinical experience, with or without higher qualifications.

==Responsibilities==
A consultant typically leads a "firm" (team of doctors) which comprises [[Specialty Registrar]]s and [[Foundation Doctor]]s, all training to work in the consultant's speciality, as well as other "career grade" doctors such as clinical assistants, clinical fellows, Speciality Doctors, Associate Specialists and [[staff grade]] doctors.  They also have numerous other key roles in the functioning of hospitals and the wider health service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role of the doctor: Role of the consultant
|url=http://bma.org.uk/developing-your-career/medical-student/the-role-of-the-doctor/role-of-the-consultant|publisher=British Medical Association|accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The time required to become a consultant depends upon a number of factors, but principally the speciality chosen. Certain specialities require longer training, or are more competitive, and therefore becoming a consultant can take longer. Other specialities are relatively easy to progress through, and it is possible for a doctor to become a consultant much earlier in his or her career. After [[Modernising Medical Careers]] came into operation (in early 2007), the length of training was fixed for the majority of doctors, at about nine years.

==Contracts==
Most consultants work on a long-term contract with one or more hospital trusts, and these posts are known as ''substantive consultant'' positions. Various titles (such as senior consultant, clinical director, medical director, lead consultant etc.) exist for consultants who have particular responsibilities for the overall management of the [[hospital]] or some part thereof.

In the UK all doctors including consultants have the right to undertake private medical work. Some make a career out of private medical practice. For others it is used to supplement their work for the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=20007822|title=BMJ Careers - Is private practice losing its appeal?|author=|date=|website=careers.bmj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other doctors - some without a CCT, a few who have only just obtained that qualification, others who have retired from substantive appointments, and others who wish to use some of their annual leave to generate additional earnings - may be employed as ''locum consultants'', who have the same clinical responsibility, but are typically on fixed, short-term contracts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">The '''core business''' of an organization is an idealized construct intended to express that organization's "main" or "essential" activity.  

The [[corporation|corporate]] trend in the mid-20th Century, of acquiring new enterprises and forming [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s, enabled [[corporation]]s to reduce costs funds and similar investment vehicles, and sometimes the following of a popular trend among corporate management seeking to appeal to current and impress investors.

Core business process means that a business's success depends not only on how well each department performs its work, but also on how well the company manages to coordinate departmental activities to conduct the core business process, which is;

1. '''The market-sensing process'''
Meaning all activities in gathering marketing intelligence and acting on the information.

2. '''The new-offering realization process'''
Covering all activities in research, development and launching new quality offerings quickly and within budget.

3. '''The customer acquisition process'''
all the activities defining the target market and prospecting for new customers

4. '''The customer relationship management process'''
all the activities covering building deeper understanding, relationships and offerings to individual customers.

5. '''The fulfillment management process'''
all the activities in receiving and approving orders, shipping out on time and collecting payment.

To be successful, a business needs to look for competitive advantages beyond its own operations. The business needs to look at the competitiveness value chain of suppliers, distributors and customers. Many companies today have partnered with specific suppliers and distributors to create a superior value delivery network.

'''[[Customer satisfaction]] research''' is that area of [[marketing research]] which focuses on customers' perceptions with their shopping or purchase [[customer experience|experience]].

Companies are interested in understanding what their customers think about their shopping or purchase experience, because finding new customers is generally more costly and difficult than servicing existing or repeat customers.

==Types of research==

===Descriptive or documentary research===
Many [[customer satisfaction]] studies are intentionally or unintentionally only descriptive in nature because they give a snapshot in time of customer attitudes.  If the study instrument is administered to groups of customers periodically, then a descriptive picture of customer satisfaction through time can be developed ("tracking" or [[cohort study]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol74No3/2Vol74No3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inferential or models-based research===
Beyond [[documentary]] types of work are studies that attempt to provide an understanding of why customers have the perceptions they do and what may be done to change those perceptions.  While models-based studies also provide snapshots of customer attitudes, the results of these studies are more powerful because they present the firm with recommendations on how to improve customer satisfaction.  Frequently, these studies also provide firms with a prioritization of the various recommended actions.  [[Inferential studies]] can also be conducted as tracking studies.  When this is done, the firm can gain insight into how the drivers of customer satisfaction are changing in addition to documenting the levels and areas of customer satisfaction.

==Methods==
Both quantitative studies and qualitative studies are critical to understanding customer satisfaction.

===Quantitative Research Studies===
[[Quantitative studies]] allow a firm to develop an understanding of the "big picture" of their customers' experiences based upon a relatively small number of interviews.  This [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of the firm's customers must be carefully designed and drawn if the results of the study are to be considered representative of the customer population as a whole.  In most cases, the results of quantitative studies are based upon the responses of a relatively large number of interviews.  Depending upon the size of the population and the amount of segmentation desired, "large" can be as few as 50 responses or range from several hundred to thousands of interviews.  Mail-based, [[telephone survey|telephone]]-based, and (more recently) [[Internet]]-based surveys and related [[customer data|customer]] [[data collection]].

===Qualitative Research Studies===
Qualitative studies are used by firms to provide a more detailed and/or unconstrained understanding of customer experiences.  In most cases, the results of qualitative studies are based upon dozens of interviews.  Qualitative studies are not designed to provide insights that are projectable to the customer population: qualitative studies are used for initial exploration of experiences and topics or to probe more deeply the reasons behind customer perceptions.  Focus groups (group depth interviews) and "one-on-ones" (individual depth interviews) are the common examples of qualitative studies.

'''Market dominance''' is a measure of the strength of a [[brand]], [[product (business)|product]], [[Service (economics)|service]], or [[corporation|firm]], relative to competitive offerings. There is often a geographic element to the competitive landscape. In defining market dominance, you must see to what extent a product, brand, or firm  controls a product category in a given geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~athey/Invest_Mkt_Dominance.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410072435/http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~athey/Invest_Mkt_Dominance.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating==
There are several ways of calculating market dominance. The most direct is [[market share]]. This is the percentage of the total market served by a firm or brand. A declining scale of market shares is common in most industries: that is, if the industry leader has say 50% share, the next largest might have 25% share, the next 12% share, the next 6% share, and all remaining firms combined might have 7% share.

Market share is not a perfect proxy of market dominance. The influences of customers, suppliers, competitors in related industries, and government regulations must be taken into account. Although there are no hard and fast rules governing the relationship between market share and market dominance, the following are general criteria:
* A company, brand, product, or service that has a combined market share exceeding 60%  most probably has market power and market dominance.
* A market share of over 35% but less than 60%, held by one brand, product or service, is an indicator of  market strength but not necessarily dominance.
* A market share of less than 35%, held by one brand, product or service, is not an indicator of strength or dominance and will not raise anti-competitive concerns by government regulators.

Market shares within an industry might not exhibit a declining scale. There could be only two firms in a [[duopoly|duopolistic market]], each with 50% share; or there could be three firms in the industry each with 33% share; or 100 firms each with 1% share. The [[concentration ratio]] of an industry is used as an indicator of the relative size of leading firms in relation to the industry as a whole.  One commonly used concentration ratio is the ''four-firm concentration ratio'', which consists of the combined market share of the four largest firms, as a percentage, in the total industry.  The higher the concentration ratio, the greater the market power of the leading firms.

Alternatively, there is the [[Herfindahl index]]. It is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry and an indicator of the amount of competition among them. It is defined as the sum of the squares of the market shares of each individual firm. As such, it can range from 0 to 10,000, moving from a very large amount of very small firms to a single [[monopoly|monopolistic]] producer. Decreases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a loss of [[pricing power]] and an increase in competition, whereas increases imply the opposite.

Kwoka's ''dominance index'' (D) is defined as the sum of the squared differences between each firm's share and the next largest share in a market: 
:&lt;math&gt;D = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (s_i-s_{i+1})^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s_1 \ge ... \ge s_i \ge s_{i+1} \ge ... \ge s_n&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'' - 1.&lt;ref&gt;Kwoka, J. E. "Large firm dominance and price-cost margins in manufacturing industries." Southern Econ J (1977) vol. 44, pp. 183–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its merger review process, Mexican Competition Commission uses García Alba's ''dominance index'' (ID), described as the [[Herfindahl index]] of a [[Herfindahl index]] (HHI). Formally, ID is the sum of squared firm contributions to the market HHI: &lt;math&gt;ID = \sum_{i=1}^n h_i^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h_i = \left. s_i^2 \right/ HHI.&lt;/math&gt;

''Asymmetry Index'' (AI) is defined as the [[Variance|statistical variance]] of market shares: &lt;math&gt;AI=\left.\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(s_i- {1 \over n}\right)^2 \right/n.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald M., and Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, Testing the Structure- Competition Relationship on Cross-Sectional Firm Data, EAG 88-6, May 11, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren-Boulton, Frederick R. (1990).

== [[European Union law|EU Law]] and Dominance ==
There are different perspectives of what indicates dominance and how to go about establishing dominance. One of these being the perspective of the [[European Commission]] regarding their application of [[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (Formerly Article 82 of the Treaty establishing the European Community), that deals specifically with the abuse of dominance in the market regarding [[European Union competition law|competition law]].

The European Commission equates dominance with the economic concept of substantial market power, which indicates that dominance can be exerted and abused, in its Guidance on A102 Enforcement Priorities. In paragraph 10 of the Guidance, it is stated that where there is no competitive pressure, an [[Company|undertaking]], which is a legal entity acting in the course of business, is probably able to exercise substantial market power. Furthermore, in paragraph 11, this is developed on, arguing if an undertaking can increase their products above the competitive price level, and does not face economic restraints, it is therefore dominant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01)|title=EUR-Lex - 52009XC0224(01) - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in basic terms, if two businesses are selling competing products, and one can increase their selling price, and not suffer an economic consequence such as a boycott of their products or a shift of their customers to a cheaper product, they are dominant.

The Guidance is not law, it is instead a set of rules the courts are to follow. However, the same definition can be found elsewhere, in Chapter 3 of the Unilateral Conduct Workbook. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unilateral Conduct Workbook Chapter 3: Assessment of Dominance|last=|first=|publisher=The Unilateral Conduct Working Group|year=May 2011|isbn=|location=10th Annual ICN Conference The Hague, Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidance is also supported by paragraph 65 of the Commission’s judgement in ''United Brands v Commission''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61976CJ0027|title=EUR-Lex - 61976CJ0027 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“65''THE DOMINANT POSITION REFERRED TO IN THIS ARTICLE (102) RELATES TO A POSITION OF ECONOMIC STRENGTH ENJOYED BY AN UNDERTAKING WHICH ENABLES IT TO PREVENT EFFECTIVE COMPETITION BEING MAINTAINED ON THE RELEVANT MARKET BY GIVING IT THE POWER TO BEHAVE TO AN APPRECIABLE EXTENT INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS COMPETITORS , CUSTOMERS AND ULTIMATELY OF ITS CONSUMERS."''

The identification of the relevant and geographic market must first be established before being able to calculate shares or an undertaking’s dominance within that market. Dominance as an economic concept is determined within EU competition law through a 2-stage process, which first requires the identification of the relevant market as was established in ''Continental Can v Commission''. This was affirmed in paragraph 30 of the judgement of ''AstraZeneca AB v Commission'', in which the Commission stated that it must be assessed whether an undertaking is able to act independently of its competitors, customers and consumers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=82135&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=264627|title=CURIA - Documents|website=curia.europa.eu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of the relevant and geographic market is assessed through the hypothetical monopolist test, which questions would a party’s customer, switch to an alternative supplier located elsewhere, in response to a small relative price increase. Therefore, it is a question of interchangeability and demand substitutability, meaning whether one product can be a substitute for another, and whether an undertaking's market power puts them above price competition. The second stage of the test requires the Commission to look at various factors to see if an undertaking enjoys a dominant position on that relevant market. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61972CJ0006|title=EUR-Lex - 61972CJ0006 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Identifying a dominant position involves the use of several factors. The European Commission’s Guidance on A102 states that a dominant position is derived from a combination of factors, which taken separately are not determinative. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the constraints imposed by existing supplies from, and the position of, actual competitors, meaning those who are competing with the undertaking in question. This involves looking at the day-to-day downwards pressure that retains low product prices and competitiveness within the market, which market shares are only useful as a first indication of; this needs to be followed by the consideration of other factors such as market conditions and dynamics. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Guidance also states that the constraints imposed by the credible threat of future expansion by actual competitors, or entry by potential competitors, is a required factor of consideration. For example, [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] in the form of patent protection, is a potential legal barrier to entering the market for new businesses, as was shown in ''[[Microsoft Corp v Commission|Microsoft Corp]]''. In this case, the Court of Justice confirmed the Commission’s decision, that Microsoft were dominant and had abused their dominant position regarding their refusal to supply the interoperability information for operating PC Windows with other systems. Microsoft was forced to licence out its interoperability data.

The final point that must be considered is the bargaining strength of the undertaking’s customers, also known as the countervailing buyer power. This refers to the competitive constraints that customers may exert where they are a large size, or commercially significant, for a dominant firm. However, the Commission will not come to a final decision without examining all of the factors which may be relevant to constrain the behaviour of the undertaking. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Relevance of market shares'''

According to the European Commission, market shares provide a useful first indication of the structure of any market and of the relative importance of the various undertakings active on it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In paragraph 15 of the Guidance on A102, the European Commission state that a high market share over a long period of time can be a preliminary indication of dominance. The International Competition Network stress that determining whether substantial market power is apparent should not be based on market shares alone, but instead an analysis of all factors affecting the competitive conditions in the market, should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recommended Practices: Dominance/Substantial Market Power Analysis Pursuant To Unilateral Conduct Laws|last=|first=|publisher=ICN Unilateral Conduct Working Group|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

100% market shares are very rare but can arise in niche areas, a close example of this being 91.8% market share in ''Tetra Pak 1 (BTG Licence)'', and the 96% market share in plasterboard held by BPB in ''BPB Industries Plc v Commission OJ''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=88/501/EEC: Commission Decision of 26 July 1988 relating to a proceeding under Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty (IV/31.043 - Tetra Pak I (BTG licence) (Only the English and French texts are authentic)|date=1988-10-04|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dec/1988/501/oj/eng|issue=31988D0501|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61989TJ0065|title=EUR-Lex - 61989TJ0065 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hoffman-La Roche v Commission'', the Court of Justice said that large market shares are ‘evidence of the existence of a dominant position’ which led to the Court of Justice decision in ''AKZO v Commission'' that where there is market share of at least 50%, without exceptional circumstances, there will be a presumption of dominance that shifts the burden of proof on to the undertaking. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61976CJ0085|title=EUR-Lex - 61976CJ0085 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61986CJ0062|title=EUR-Lex - 61986CJ0062 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has affirmed this threshold in cases since AKZO. For example, in paragraph 100 of the Commission Judgment in the Court of First Instance in ''France Telecom v Commission'', the Commission state that ‘…very large shares are in themselves, and save in exceptional circumstances, evidence of the existence of a dominant position…’, citing the Court of Justice judgement in AZKO, paragraph 60, ‘…this was so in the case of a 50% market share.’. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=66047&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=253572|title=CURIA - Documents|website=curia.europa.eu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Commission's ''Tenth Report on Competition'' implies that a significant disparity between the largest and the second-largest firm shares can indicate that the largest firm has a dominant position in the market. Specifically, under a section entitled "Scrutiny of mergers for compatibility with Article 86 EEC," the Report states:

:A dominant position can generally be said to exist once a market share to the order of 40% to 45% is reached. [footnote: A dominant position cannot even be ruled out in respect of market shares between 20% and 40%; Ninth Report on Competition Policy, point 22.] Although this share does not in itself automatically give control of the market, if there are large gaps between the position of the firm concerned and those of its closest competitors and also other factors likely to place it at an advantage as regards competition, a dominant position may well exist. (European Commission's Tenth Report on Competition, page 103, paragraph 150.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7146">The '''Edward Warner Award''' is an award that's given in the field of [[aviation]] to aviation pioneers or organizations that have contributed to [[civil aviation]]. The award is named after [[Edward Pearson Warner|Dr. Edward Pearson Warner]], the first President of the council of [[ICAO]].

The award consists of two items: a medal and a certificate. The medal is made of solid gold and is inscribed with the recipient's name. The certificate is a recognition citing the reasons for the award. The Edward Warner Award is recognized throughout the world as the greatest single honour the international civil aviation community can bestow, for its importance is derived from the fact that it is given by ICAO on behalf of its Member States. No other international civil aviation award offers such wide recognition.

'''Erazm Józef Jerzmanowski''' h. [[Dołęga coat of arms|Dołęga]] (2 June 1844 – 7 February 1909) was an industrialist, philanthropist and patron of art, soldier, who took part in the [[January Uprising]] of 1863-1865.

==Biography==
{{moresources|section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Anna-jerzmanowska zyciorys.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Anna Jerzmanowska]]
Born to Franciszek Jerzmanowski and Apolonia Kamila Kosowska,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://tpp.krakow.pl/szablonymain/tpp.krakow.pl/E.J.Jerzmanowski_grzewo-genealogiczne.pdf|title=Erazm Jerzmanowski Family Tree|publisher=Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Prokocimia|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erazm graduated from the high school in Warsaw in 1862, and then began education at Polytechnic Institute in [[Puławy]]. 

With other students he joined the [[January Uprising]] in 1863. He fought under commands of general [[Marian Langiewicz]].&lt;ref name="psb"&gt;{{citebook|author=Jan Hulewicz|chapter=Jerzmanowski Erazm Józef Dołęga (1844–1909)|title=[[Polish Biographical Dictionary|Polski Słownik Biograficzny]]|volume=XI/2|pages=178–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the uprising failed, he was interned in the castle of [[Olomouc]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Jerzmanowski was set free and forced to go abroad. He went to [[Paris]] for emigration in 1864 and studied at the Polish School in [[Montparnasse]]. Later he moved to [[Metz]] to study at the School of Engineering and Artillery. In 1870 he participated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] as an officer of the French Army.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

After the war he began working as an engineer. In 1873, a French company, which had been exploiting lighting-gas in America, sent him to the [[United States]]. Shortly after going to the USA Jerzmanowski married Anna Koester. In 1879, he became a United States citizen. He worked on production of the [[calcium carbide]], in the meantime patenting 17 inventions in the field of mining and investing money.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

In 1882 he was a co-founder of Equitable Gas Light Company in [[New York City|New York]], as a vice-chairman and later chairman he led this company for 13 years. He was a founder of gas companies in [[Chicago]] and [[Baltimore]] and owned gas factories in [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name="psb"/&gt; His fortune grew fast, he became the richest Polish in the United States and one of the richest Americans. Being one of the most influential directors in gas industry he has been supporting financially other people of American Polonia. In 1889 pope [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] decorated him with Knight Commander of [[Order of St. Sylvester]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}
In 1896 Jerzmanowski bought a palace in Galicia and settled in Prokocim, near Kraków, where he died in 1909.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

The palace that Jerzmanowski bought in 1896, currently better known as the Jerzmanowscy Palace, is located in Prokocim. The surrounding park – Anna and Erazm Jerzmanowski Park – was named after its owners.

===Jerzmanowscy Award===
In his last will Jerzmanowski presented all his wealth to [[Academy of Learning]] in Kraków. He ordered the Academy to establish the foundation and the award named after him and his wife. People distinguished with Jerzmanowscy Award had to be Polish Roman Catholics who had served Poland with their artistic, scientific or social activities. Payments are made from Jerzmanowski's funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.smj.jaroslaw.pl/biblioteczkasmj/archiwalia/187-erazm-jerzmanowski-fundator-polskiej-nagrody-nobla|title=Erazm Jerzmanowski – fundator polskiej Nagrody Nobla|publisher=Stowarzyszenie Miłośników Jarosławia|accessdate=6 May 2014|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{European patent law}}
The '''European Patent Convention''' ('''EPC'''), also known as the '''Convention on the Grant of European Patents''' of 5 October 1973, is a multilateral [[treaty]] instituting the [[European Patent Organisation]] and providing an autonomous legal system according to which '''European patents''' are granted.  The term ''European patent'' is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents,&lt;ref name="SingerArt2andScourfield"&gt;The view that a European patent issues as independent national patents in each designated Contracting state is very convenient from a practical point of view. Some however consider this view as incorrect:
:"''The view that, after grant, a European patent breaks up into a bundle of national patents in designated Contracting States may appear plausible, but it is incorrect both in law and systematically''", Singer/Stauder, ''The European Patent Convention, A Commentary'', Munich, 2003, under Article 2.
Singer/Stauder's view seems in turn rather theoretical in view of decisions ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'' and ''GAT v LUK'' of the [[European Court of Justice]] (see also "Enforcement and validity" section), which reinforced the independent character of a European patent in each Contracting State. As Tom Scourfield wrote in an article commenting on these two decisions:
:"''(...) a European patent is no more than a bundle of national patents pursuant to a single application. Until a true community patent becomes a reality it seems likely that true community enforcement will continue to elude patent owners.''" Tom Scourfield, ''Jurisdiction and Patents: ECJ rules on forum for validity and cross-border patent enforcement'', The CIPA Journal, August 2006, Volume 35 No. 8, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited [[opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition procedure]], which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and [[limitation and revocation procedures]], which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.

The EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a single, harmonised procedure before the [[European Patent Office]]. A single [[patent application]], in one language,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be filed at the European Patent Office in [[Munich]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its branch in [[The Hague]],&lt;ref name="Art75-1-a"/&gt;{{refn|The Hague branch of the EPO is actually located in [[Rijswijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/g880007ep1.html Enlarged Board of Appeal decision G 7/88 (Administrative Agreement) of 16.11.1990], Summary of Facts and Submissions, V.(3)&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} at its sub-office in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj1989/p189_270.pdf Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 10 May 1989 on the setting up of a Filing Office in the Berlin sub-office of the European Patent Office]'', OJ 1989, 218&lt;/ref&gt; or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.&lt;ref name="Art75-1-b"&gt;{{EPC Article|75|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and rationale==
Before 1978, two important problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe in a number of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct grant procedure in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages.  While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.

== History ==

In September 1949, French Senator [[Henri Longchambon]] proposed to the [[Council of Europe]] the creation of a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the "Longchambon plan", marked the beginning of the work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bossung |first=Otto |title=The Return of European Patent Law in the European Union |journal=IIC |volume=27 |issue=3/1996 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |url=http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |quote=Work on a European patent law aimed at a "European patent" had begun in Strasbourg in 1949 with the Longchambon plan. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232011/http://www.suepo.org/public/background/bossung_en.htm |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council's Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the [[European Convention relating to the Formalities required for Patent Applications|formalities required for patent applications]] (1953) and one on the [[European Convention on the International Classification of Patents for Invention|international classification of patent]] (1954).&lt;ref name="Tookey"&gt;G. W. Tookey, ''Patents in the European Field'' in Council of Europe, Council of Europe staff, ''European Yearbook 1969'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1971, pages 76–97, {{ISBN|90-247-1218-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the [[Strasbourg Patent Convention]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Tookey"/&gt;

In 1973, the ''Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents'' took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the "Munich Convention"). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which [[Kurt Haertel]], considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and [[François Savignon]] played a decisive role.

The Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: [[Belgium]], Germany (then [[West Germany]]), France, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for [[Sweden]]. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the [[European Patent Organisation#Administrative Council|Administrative Council]] which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977).  Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.

The EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Turkey]], [[Monaco]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[San Marino]], [[Albania]] and [[Serbia]] are members of the EPO but are not members of the EU. The Convention is, as of January 2015, in force in 38 countries.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/epo/member-states.html|title=Member states of the European Patent Organisation|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia became the 38th state on 1 October 2010.&lt;ref name="serbia"/&gt;

A diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in [[international law]] and to add a level of judicial review of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Boards of Appeal]] decisions. The revised text, informally called the [[EPC 2000]], entered into force on 13 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office|Official Journal of the EPO]], 2/2006, [http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj006/02_06/02_1386.pdf ''Notice from the European Patent Office dated 27 January 2006 concerning deposit of the fifteenth instrument of ratification of the EPC Revision Act'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation agreements with non-contracting states: extension and validation agreements===
Throughout the history of the EPC, some non-contracting States have concluded cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became "extension states" or "validation states", which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to {{EPC Article|33|4}}, are not based on a "direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/natlaw/en/a/index.htm|title=National Law relating to EPC|publisher=EPO|quote=The extension system largely corresponds to the EPC system operating in the EPC contracting states, except that it is based not on direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC. It is therefore subject to the national extension rules of the country concerned.|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|1}}: "Extension agreements and ordinances", "Legal nature"&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is "not subject to the jurisdiction of the [EPO] boards of appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|vii|2|2}}: "No jurisdiction of the boards of appeal"&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2015, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]]&lt;ref name="ME"/&gt; have extension agreements with the EPO so that, in effect, these states can be designated in a European patent application. Several other "extension states" have since become states parties to the EPC. Furthermore, so-called "validation agreements" with Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia are also in effect since 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150119.html|title=Morocco recognises European patents as national patents|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=19 January 2015|work=European Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20150302.html|title=Validation agreement with Morocco enters into force|date=1 March 2015|publisher=EPO|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moldova-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2015/20151008.html|title=European patents to cover Moldova|date=8 October 2015|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunisia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2017/20171004.html|title=Brevets européens en Tunisie : L’accord de validation entre l’OEB et la Tunisie entrera en vigueur le 1er décembre|trans-title=European patents in Tunisia: The validation agreement between the EPO and Tunisia will enter into force on December 1|date=3 October 2017|publisher=European Patent Office|language=French|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/foundation/validation-states.html|title=Validation states|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="validation-agreement-KH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/information-epo/archive/20180209.html|title=Validation of European patents in Cambodia (KH) with effect from 1 March 2018|date=9 February 2018|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal nature and content ==
{{EPC requirements}}
The European Patent Convention is "a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the [[Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last revised on 14 July 1967, and a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45, paragraph 1, of the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] of 19 June 1970."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/apre.html|title=Preamble [of the European Patent Convention]|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}} See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/g980002ep1.pdf Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G2/98], "Reasons for the Opinion", point 3, first sentence: "The EPC constitutes, according to its preamble, a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Paris Convention".&lt;/ref&gt; The European Patent Convention currently does not lead to the grant of centrally enforceable patents in all 38 countries, although the [[European Union patent]] would allow for unitary effect: centrally enforceability throughout 24 of the 27 countries of the European Union.

The content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ma1.html|title=The European Patent Convention|publisher=EPO|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* the "Implementing Regulations to the Convention on the Grant of European patents", commonly known as the "Implementing Regulations". The function of the Implementing Regulations is "to determine in more detail how the Articles should be applied".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iii|h|6}}: "Implementing Regulations"&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the Implementing Regulations, the provisions of the EPC prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|164|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "Protocol on Jurisdiction and the recognition of decisions in respect of the right to the grant of a European patent", commonly known as the "Protocol on Recognition". This protocol deals with the right to the grant of a European patent but exclusively applies to European patent applications.
* the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Patent Organisation", commonly known as the "Protocol on Privileges and Immunities";
* the "Protocol on the Centralisation of the European Patent System and on its Introduction", commonly known as the "Protocol on Centralisation";
* the "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the Convention";
* the "Protocol on the Staff Complement of the European Patent Office at The Hague", commonly known as the "Protocol on Staff Complement".

== Substantive patent law ==
One of the most important articles of the Convention, {{EPC Article|52|1}}, entitled  "''Patentable [[invention]]s''", states:
{{quotation|European patents shall be granted for any inventions, in all fields of technology, providing that they are [[Novelty under the European Patent Convention|new]], involve an [[inventive step under the European Patent Convention|inventive step]], and are susceptible of [[industrial applicability|industrial application]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{EPC Article|52|1}}. The state of the art is further defined in Articles 54(2)-(5), and a limited grace period is specified in {{EPC Article|55}}, but this is only relevant in cases of breach of confidence or disclosure of the invention in a recognised international exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article constitutes the "fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions".&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"&gt; [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t040154ex1.htm Decision T 154/04] of 15 November 2006, Reasons 6, to be published at the [[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the EPC provides further indications on what is patentable. There are exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.

First, [[discovery (observation)|discoveries]], [[theory|scientific theories]], mathematical methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; aesthetic creations,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presentations of information&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2|d}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not regarded as inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|52|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is "a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC."&lt;ref name="T 154/04-r6"/&gt; ''(For further information, see also: [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|Software patents under the EPC]]).''

The second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include
* inventions contrary to "''ordre public''" or morality,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* plant or animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, and [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] methods practised on the human or animal body,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|53|c}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been excluded for "socio-ethical considerations and considerations of [[public health]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/cdd5fb0c3153e9c3c12576cb00563d2d/$FILE/G1_07_en.pdf Decision G 1/07 of February 15, 2010], Reasons 3.3.6. See also [[G 1/07]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unified prosecution phase ==
{{main|Grant procedure before the European Patent Office}}

The Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.

European patent applications may be filed in any language, but they are prosecuted only in one of the three official languages of the EPO – English, French and German. If an application is filed in a language other than an official language, a translation must be filed into one of the three official languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|14|2}}; {{EPO Guidelines|a|vii|1|1}}: "Admissible languages; time limit for filing the translation of the application"; "European patent applications can be filed in any language."&lt;/ref&gt; within two months from the date of filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|6|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the "language of proceedings" and is used by the EPO for communications.

European patent applications are [[patent prosecution|prosecuted]] in a similar fashion to most patent systems – the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.

During the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and "the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the [[invention]] is desired,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; and the designations need to be "confirmed" later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|79|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once granted by the EPO,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.

==Opposition==
{{main|Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office}}

There are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the [[limitation and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office|limitation and revocation procedures]]. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute).  National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.

== Grant, effect and need for translations ==

In contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the opposition procedure and even after it has ended, particular acts can still be performed before the European Patent Office, such as requesting a rectification of an incorrect designation of inventor under {{EPC Rule|19|1}}. {{Update after|2010|11}} &lt;!-- To be converted to EPC 2000 --&gt; "Rectification may [indeed] be requested after the proceedings before the EPO are terminated" (Guid. A III 5.6).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State&lt;ref&gt;There is no consistent usage of a particular expression to refer to "the European patent in a particular designated Contracting State for which it is granted". The article uses the expression "a European patent in a Contracting State" which is considered to be the most consistent with the authoritative text, i.e. the EPC.&lt;/ref&gt; is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.

A European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the [[European Patent Bulletin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}: EP patent has same effect as national patent in "each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted"; {{EPC Article|97|2) and (4}}: decision to grant "for the designated Contracting States" is made by the examining division.&lt;/ref&gt; That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).

A translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have "prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European patent is ''[[void ab initio]]'' in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]] is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Veronese|Watchorn|2011|}}, Chapter XI.4&lt;/ref&gt; If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|65|2}}; [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/national/html/en/iv/index.htm National law, Chapter IV, Filing of translations of the patent specification under Article 65 EPC] (regarding implementation in EPC Contracting States)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforcement and validity ==
{{main|Enforcement of European patents}}
Almost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{EPC Article|2|2}}, {{EPC Article|64|1) and(3}}, {{EPC Article|66}}, {{EPC Article|74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings – including [[renewal (patent)|renewal]], revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and [[patent infringement|infringement enforcement]] are determined under national law.

EPO Boards of Appeal decisions are not precedential at all upon national courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction on validity and infringement after a European patent has been granted (except during the 9-month opposition period, which can only relate to validity). However, national courts will tend to take note, and may find 'persuasive', decisions of the EPO Boards, though they can disagree with them.

===Infringement===
[[patent infringement|Infringement]] is remitted almost entirely to national law and to national courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the "direct product of a patented process" to be an infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|64|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "extent of the protection" conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and [[patent drawing|drawing]]s, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC" provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a "fair" middle position, neither "strict, literal" nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Southco Inc v Dzus'', [1992] R.P.C. 299 CA; ''Improver Corp. v Remington Products Inc'' [1990] FSR 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingerArt2Precedence"&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|Stauder|2003}}, under Article 2, section "EPC provisions on European patents that take precedence over national law"&lt;/ref&gt;

All other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for wilful infringement, etc.), equitable defences, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|2|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]].  In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the [[Brussels Regime|Brussels Convention]], the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity===
Validity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts. {{EPC Article|138|1}} limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:

* if the subject-matter of the European patent is not patentable within the terms of Articles 52 to 57 EPC (see "Substantive patent law" section above);
* if the [[disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention|disclosure does not permit the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art]];&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if [[amendments under the European Patent Convention|amendments have been made]] such that the subject-matter extends beyond the content of the application as filed;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|c}}, {{EPC Article|123|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* if the claims have been broadened post-grant, e.g. in opposition proceedings;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|d}}, {{EPC Article|123|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an improper proprietor&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|138|1|e}}, {{EPC Article|60}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in some jurisdictions, only the person pretending to be entitled to the European patent can raise this specific ground, so that the resulting nullity of the patent may be relative to some persons only&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Laurent Teyssedre, [http://europeanpatentcaselaw.blogspot.com/2012/03/la-nullite-tiree-du-motif-de-lart-1381.html ''La nullité tirée du motif de l'Art 138(1) e) est relative''], Le blog du droit européen des brevets, 5 March 2012. Consulted on 10 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—.

A national court may partially invalidate a European patent in a Contracting State, e.g., by revoking only some claims, or by permitting amendment to the claims, the description or the drawings, as allowed by national law.

A European patent is also non-unitary in that it may be revoked in one Contracting State while maintained in another. However, a national court in one Contracting State may not revoke a European patent in another Contracting State.

== Term (duration) of a European patent ==

The EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a [[Term of patent|term]] of 20 years from the filing date,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|PCT]] designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the [[priority right|priority date]], which can be up to one year earlier.  The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63|2|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member states this is by means of a [[supplementary protection certificate]].

== Relation with the Patent Cooperation Treaty ==

A European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), i.e. the filing of a PCT application, and then the entry into "European regional phase",&lt;ref&gt;See {{PCT Article|11|3}}, which provides a [[legal fiction]] according to which an international application, i.e. a PCT application, has the effect of a regular European patent application as of the international filing date under certain conditions (see for instance [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/j090018ex1.html Decision J 18/09 of the Legal Board of Appeal 3.1.01 of 1 September 2010], Reasons 7 and 8); and {{EPC Article|150|2), (first sentence}}: "International applications filed under the PCT may be the subject of proceedings before the European Patent Office."&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the transition from the international to the European procedural stages. The European patent application is therefore said to be a "Euro-PCT application" and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|e|viii|2}}: "EPO as designated or elected Office".&lt;/ref&gt; In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the PCT, the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations prevail over those of the EPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|150|2), (third sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve EPC Contracting States, namely [[Belgium]], [[Cyprus]], France, [[Greece]], Ireland, Italy, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Slovenia]] have "closed their national route".&lt;ref&gt;For Malta, source: "European Patent Office web site, [http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html ''Accession to the PCT by Malta (MT)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220506/http://www.epo.org/patents/law/legal-texts/InformationEPO/archiveinfo/02012007.html |date=26 September 2007 }}, Information from the European Patent Office, January 2, 2007; for Latvia, source: [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2007/pct_news_2007_4.pdf ''Latvia: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] of April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it is no longer possible to obtain a national patent protection through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent. Lithuania closed its "national route" most recently, on 4 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2012/pct_news_2012_02.pdf ''Lithuania: Closing of the National Route via the PCT''], [[PCT Newsletter]] No. 02/2012, p. 1.; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2014/pct_news_2014_05.pdf|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|work=PCT Newsletter No. 05/2014|publisher=WIPO|page=3|accessdate=11 May 2014}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|title=Lithuania: Reminder re the Closing of the National Route via the PCT|date=July–August 2014|work=PCT Newsletter No. 07-08/2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142535/http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/2014/article_0005.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being''' ({{lang-ru|Федеральная служба по надзору в сфере защиты прав потребителей и благополучия человека}}) or '''Rospotrebnadzor''' ({{lang-ru|Роспотребнадзор}}) is the federal service responsible for Supervision of [[consumer rights]] Protection and Human Well-Being in Russia. The service is submissive and was included into the structure of the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health Care]] of Russia till 2012. This service was founded in 2004. Since May  2012 Rospotrebnadzor was excluded from the Ministry of Health and reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the base of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation.

==History==
Organization's history goes back to the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR "On the sanitary authorities of the Republic" dated 15 September 1922.
 
Up to 2004 in Russia in 2218 functioned sanitary-epidemiological stations (centers).
 
The current structure of the organization founded by the [[decree of the President of Russia]] on March 9, 2004 № 314 "On the system and structure of federal bodies of executive power". Subordinated to the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]]. In accordance with the presidential decree of May 21, 2012 № 636 "On the system and structure of federal executive bodies" under the direct authority of the Government of Russia. Since the establishment of the Federal Service (2004) is led by GG Onishchenko. 
 
All the organs and institutions of the Federal Service currently employs approximately 110,000 professionals.

== Rospotrebnadzor and permissive documents==

Rospotrebnadzor in the plan of regulating of the state functions connected with the technical regulation, evaluation of conformity or other kinds of state regulating performs the following functions:

* Performs the sanitary control, control and issuing some kinds of permissive documents;
* Performs licensing of certain kinds of activities;
* Performs certification of different objects of evaluating of conformity to Russian legislation. 
* Performs sanitary certification of production according to the requirements of the Customs Union;
* Performs state registration of production of the RF (excepting medicaments);
* Performs state registration of production of the Customs Union on the territory of Russia (with the exception of pharmaceuticals).

Even listing the kinds of activities of Rospotrebnadzor, connected with drawing up different kinds of permissive documents makes a significant list. Let’s give more details about some certain directions while receiving permissive documents.

==Permissive documents in the plan of sanitary control and supervision==

Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are issued in the form of Permit for exploitation of buildings and premises. This document testifies about the fact that the premises conforms to the requirements to performing a certain kind of activity and providing some kind of service. This document is obligatory for receiving for owners of restaurants and cafes, food shops and swimming pools, children's preschool, school institutions, medical cabinets and clinics, by providing hair-dresser, laundry and other similar institutions.

The function of permissive document is brought by negotiation of the Program of Industrial Control of an object of any legal entity or an individual entrepreneur that applied to Rospotrebnadzor in order to draw up a sanitary conclusion or permit for exploitation or in other cases. This Program appears to be the plan of sanitary measurements of an organization or institutions that allow meet all the requirements of the Russian sanitary legislation.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by licensing==

It is clear that such kind of permissive documents is called a license, that is drawn up after performing an analysis of the documents presented before the body of licensing, that prove performing all the requirements of licensing set for the certain kind of activities.

Rospotrebnadzor is authorized to draw up permissive documents for the following directions of licensed kinds of entrepreneurship:

* Activities connected with application of provocatives of infection diseases;
* Activities connected with application of sources of [[ionizing]] radiation.

Issuing different kinds of documents is performed both by territorial bodies of Rospotrebnadzor and its central apparatus depending on the class of danger of apparatus of ionizing radiation and the class of danger of provocatives of infection diseases. Drawing up permissive documents is primarily required for meeting requirements of the Federal Law “About Sanitary Well Being of the population of the RF”.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing certification in the sphere of sanitary safety==

The kind of drawn up permissive documents primarily depends on the object suffering evaluation of conformity. So, for many kinds of production it was required to draw up the sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion. The SEC, this was the widely known name of thus famous document. But from 1 July 2012 issuing of these permissive documents was stopped. They were replaced by the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the Customs Union and the Expert Conclusion.

The Expert Conclusion is not the direct analog of the SEC. Earlier, until 1 July 2010, the mandatory sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion (SEC) or [[hygienic]] certificate for realization both Russian and foreign goods were required for the most part of production on the [[Russian market]].  All the children’s goods, all the production that we eat, drink or wear, or all that we use in our everyday life underwent the mandatory evaluation of conformity to SNiPs or SanPins. After the moment that the legislation of the [[Customs Union]] went into force, for some groups of goods that may do the most significant harm with their unquality, it became necessary to prove the conformity with the help of the unified requirements of the CU by means of drawing up of the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the CU.

In the same document, that states the list of such production (Decision of the CU Commission 299 of 28 May 2010) in the first part there is a list of the goods for which by crossing the border of the RF (CU) there can be the necessity of sanitary-epidemiologic control. In this case for this kind of production we’ll need the hygienic certificate – the Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor.

The Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor unlike the SEC appears to be the voluntary document. As the situation of the sanitary control may occur or may not occur. The reason why the customs services may require sanitary documents and going through hygienic control of the load may be as follows:

Injured cartridge, conveyor or other kind of package in which transportation of the load is performed;
Mismatch between documents and loads detected;
There is information about breaking that is connected with given delivery, about mismatch between the documents and the contents of the transport units and in some other cases.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing the sanitary supervision of the Customs Union (CU)==

The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are mandatory to draw up for the production included into the List of the goods to go through sanitary control by crossing the border of the CU, that was approved by the Commission of the CU on 18 July 2010.

If the production is included into the first part of this document, so the kind of the permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor is the Expert Conclusion. If the production is included into the second part of the document, so the kind of the document of Rospotrebnadzor is the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.

The both documents are possible to be received only on the base of the Expert Conclusion after the performed certification tests, done by the certification laboratory (having authorization of the CU). They prove that the studied product meets the Unified sanitary requirements of the three countries the Union members.

Such documents must be received also for these kinds of Russian production if they are firstly manufactured for realization on the market of the [[Customs Union]].

The volume of the production items for which it is required the following permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor is reduced nearly ten times in comparison with the list of goods for which it is necessary to draw up the SEC and (or) the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.

In the cases that the production went through the sanitary supervision on the base of the Russian Sanitary Rules and in the present it needs drawing up the sanitary permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the CU, bet nevertheless the customs inspection requires the document of proof, but also it is necessary to apply to Rospotrebnadzor.

In such situations you will receive the drawn up the Exemption Letter of Rospotrebnadzor. But the information, which it usually comprises, is of the general legislative character (it can be read in the laws of the CU). That is why the consultants recommend draw up the Expert Conclusion of Rospotrebnadzor in such cases.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by State registration of production==

The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor were issued till the end of 2012 for the production that in accordance with the national legislation required its inclusion into the State Registry before its start of realization on the territory of the RF.

The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor drawn up on the blank of the Certificate of State Registration of the RF will be valid on the territory of Russia till the end of the year.

==The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor of State Registration of the CU==

Such a document is drawn up from 1 July 2010 and is called the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. On which it is required to draw up the given permissive documents. The above-mentioned article describes it.

As the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the CU replaced two earlier existing Russian documents proving the sanitary safety of production and duplicating each other. Earlier entrepreneurs had to go through the same procedure of proving conformity of production to sanitary requirements of the Russian legislation twice. The Certificate of the CU replaced the Sanitary-Epidemiologic Conclusion and the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7093">'''Felix Zandman''' ({{lang-pl|Feliks Zandman}}; May 7, 1928 – June 4, 2011) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born entrepreneur and founder of [[Vishay Intertechnology]] – one of the world's largest manufacturers of electronic components. From 1946 to 1949 he studied in France at the University of Nancy physics and engineering. In parallel, he was enrolled in a [[Grande école]] of engineering Ensem (''École nationale supérieure d'électricité et de mécanique''). He received a [[Doctorate|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] as a physicist on a subject of [[photoelasticity]].   He was awarded the [[Edward Longstreth Medal]] from the [[Franklin Institute]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="LongstrethMedal_Laureates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&amp;ln=&amp;fn=&amp;keyword=&amp;subject=&amp;award=LONG+&amp;sy=1961&amp;ey=1963&amp;name=Submit |title=Franklin Laureate Database - Edward Longstreth Medal 1962 Laureates |publisher=[[Franklin Institute]] |accessdate=November 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222042952/http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&amp;ln=&amp;fn=&amp;keyword=&amp;subject=&amp;award=LONG%2B&amp;sy=1961&amp;ey=1963&amp;name=Submit |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Felix Zandman was born in [[Grodno]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (now Belarus) and lived in [[Kresy]] until the Nazi-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref name="K-B"&gt;Jr. Korn, Bertram, Jewish Exponent, 10-20-1995. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2366840.html  "Survivor Triumphant: Felix Zandman's life story is a saga of success"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following German [[Operation Barbarossa]], in October 1941, at the age of 14 he arrived at the [[Grodno Ghetto]] (liquidated by the Nazis at the end of 1942) with parents, sisters, grandparents and many other relatives. He survived [[the Holocaust]] thanks to a family of [[Polish Righteous among the Nations|Polish Righteous]] [[Jan and Anna Puchalski]] who hid him and his uncle for 17 months. Their main hiding place was a dugout 170&amp;nbsp;cm long, 150&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 120&amp;nbsp;cm tall.

Felix Zandman shared this hideaway with three other Jewish refugees. One of them, his uncle Sender Freydowicz, taught him [[trigonometry]], and advanced mathematics in the long hours of darkness.&lt;ref name="Paldiel"&gt;Mordecai Paldiel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gRdUvDLC3pgC&amp;pg=PA83 ''Saving the Jews''] Chapter: Sheltering and Hiding. Page 82-83. Published by Schreiber.&lt;/ref&gt;
The advancing Soviet Army liberated them in July 1944. He stayed with other survivors in Poland until he was able to emigrate legally to [[France]] in the summer of 1946.

==Professional life as an employee==
Zandman worked initially for two years as a lecturer at the [[École de l'air]], the French Academy of Aeronautics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://powerelectronics.com/news/dr-felix-zandman-lifetime-achievement-award-assoc-122109/  Dr. Felix Zandman Receives Lifetime Achievement Award From the National Electronic Distributors Association]&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as an engineer in his specialty field of voltage measurement for a publicly owned company, which manufactured aircraft engines.

In 1956, Zandman presented his methods and self-developed instruments for the first time in the U.S.. He was able to establish important contacts with leading professors and well-known users of its specific field. He was eventually employed by the company Tatnall Measuring Systems in Philadelphia as director of basic research. Initially, he concentrated on measuring the development of his case, voltages of optical coatings. Then he developed a temperature-resistant electrical resistance. His employer, however, had no interest in the marketing of this invention.

==Professional life as an entrepreneur==
In 1960 Felix Zandman and Sidney J. Stein&lt;ref&gt;A NEW PRECISION FILM RESISTOR EXHIBITING BULK PROPERTIES&lt;/ref&gt; present a development of resistor film and put the potential of this invention to work, based on inventions made by previous researchers knew how to make up an industry, of an electrical component of very high stability.
This component was called metal foil resistor and in spite of the problems encountered and working with many collaborators, it was able to develop this resistance, which gave it a high precision and, above all, a stability to extreme temperature changes, such as those found in the aeronautical and space industry. In essence the metal foil resistor, is a component formed by a ceramic base and attached to it a metal with a small thickness. Zandman's idea was the following, assuming that the component is at room temperature and then the temperature increases, the electrical resistance of the metal due to the increase in temperature also increases, as the temperature increases the metal tends to increase its length, it expands, but being stuck to a ceramic structure with a much greater thickness, the metal can not expand and the thickness of it increases, with a reduction in electrical resistance, with which the effect of increased resistance is compensated and almost it does not change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galileog.com/ingenieria/metal_foil_resitors/metal_foil.html Introduction to the Metal Foil Resistors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

To this end he founded, in 1962, the company [[Vishay Intertechnology]], Inc.  His relative, Alfred P. Slaner, provided financial support for the initial funding.The company has developed into a Fortune 1000 company with many subsidiaries and over 22,000 employees worldwide. Vishay Intertechnology (NYSE: VSH&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/vsh.html&lt;/ref&gt;) is a publicly traded company with a market capitalization of over a billion dollars.&lt;ref name="K-B" /&gt;

==Personal Story==
In April 2008, Felix Zandman attended the ''[[March of the Living]]'', where he shared the story of how he was rescued by Catholic Polish Righteous Among the Nations, Jan and Anna Puchalski, who hid him and his uncle for 17 months. His hiding place was a dugout 170&amp;nbsp;cm long, 150&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 120&amp;nbsp;cm tall that Felix Zandman shared with three other Jewish escapees. Felix Zandman told his story to thousands of young students from around the world who had gathered in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day ([[Yom HaShoah]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptGvGvNRsDs |title=Felix Zandman 2008 Speech to March of the Living=Retrieved Jan 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was in the Soviet military and fought alongside Russian Forces in the second world war. He spent 6 years of his childhood (from 1959–1965) in the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (and learnt German)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya/lyudi/182561-put-timchenko-ot-mastera-tseha-do-milliardera|script-title=ru:Путь Тимченко: от мастера цеха до миллиардера|language=ru|trans-title=Timchenko's path from shop foreman to billionaire|date=26 October 2012|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; In 1976, he graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|Mechanical Institute of Saint Petersburg]], then named Leningrad, as an electrical engineer, according to a 2008 interview with the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121313303128762055?mod-googlews|title=Excerpts: Gunvor’s Timchenko On His History, Putin and Gunvor|date=11 June 2008|journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1977, Timchenko started to work as an engineer for the [[Izhorskiye Zavody|Izhorsky]] plant near Saint Petersburg, which specialized in building power generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=13 November 2013 |website=Lenta.ru |url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14184845/full.htm#105 |title=Timchenko, Gennady |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113180748/http://lenta.ru/lib/14184845/full.htm#105 |archivedate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=no |publisher=Лента.Ру |date=28 December 2014 |language=Russian |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he spoke German, he was then moved to the trade department of this state-owned company.

From 1982 to 1988, he worked as a senior engineer of the [[Ministry of Foreign Trade (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Trade]].&lt;ref name="Main Investor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/2009/12/22/221960 |title=Main Investor |accessdate=13 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113180453/http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/2009/12/22/221960 |archivedate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=no |date=22 December 2009 |language=Russian |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, when Russia started to liberalize its economy, he was promoted to Deputy Director of state-owned oil company [[KiNEx|Kirishineftekhimexport]], which had been created in 1987 based on the Kirishi refinery, one of the three largest refineries in the [[RSFSR]].&lt;ref name="At home among strangers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.public.ru|title=At home among strangers|publisher=Russian focus|date=1 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timchenko’s teams set up some first export routes of oil products from the USSR to Western countries and Timchenko became one of the leading figures of the Russian oil trading industry.

In 1991, Timchenko decided to leave Russia and was hired by a Finland-based company, Urals Finland Oy, specializing in importing Russian oil to Europe. He settled in Finland and became a Finnish citizen.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1995, Urals Finland Oy was renamed International Petroleum Products Oy (IPP), and Timchenko became first deputy and then CEO of IPP OY.&lt;ref name="At home among strangers"/&gt;

In an October 2012 interview with the Russian edition of ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'', Timchenko said that he had both Russian and Finnish citizenships.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In August 2014, Timchenko said in an interview with [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia|ITAR-TASS]] that he needed Finnish citizenship to travel in the 1990s, when it was harder to travel on a Russian passport, and that he never concealed having two passports. He said that, over the past fourteen years, he had been paying taxes in Switzerland and, prior to that, in Finland. "I scrupulously transfer to Russia the monies I owe to the Russian budget. In theory, I could have cut down the transfers citing the rule on inadmissibility of dual taxation but I never did this – I realized the proceeds that my monies were going off in wages to Russian doctors, teachers, and the military while I was not going to go bankrupt under any circumstances.

{{Main|Gunvor (company)}}
Timchenko was the co-founder (together with [[Torbjörn Törnqvist]]) of [[Gunvor (company)|Gunvor Group]], a corporation registered in [[Cyprus]], and operating in trading and logistics related to the international [[energy market]]. On 19 March 2014, Timchenko sold his stake in Gunvor to the other co-founder, Torbjörn Törnqvist.&lt;ref name=reuters210314&gt;{{cite news|date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/us-ukraine-crisis-sanctions-gunvor-idUSBREA2J1T920140321 |title=Oil firms, U.S. banks trade with Gunvor after co-founder sanctioned |first1=Dmitry |last1=Zhdannikov |first2=Peg |last2=Mackey |first3=Ron |last3=Bousso |agency=[[Reuters]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322042126/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/21/us-ukraine-crisis-sanctions-gunvor-idUSBREA2J1T920140321 |archivedate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=upstream210314&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]] |publisher=[[NHST Media Group]] |url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article1355878.ece |title=Timchenko sells stake in Gunvor |first=Luke |last=Johnson |date=21 March 2014 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |archivedate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013550/http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article1355878.ece |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was made the day before Timchenko was included on the United States sanctions list in the wake of the [[2014 Crimean crisis|annexing of Crimea by Russia]].

In November 2014, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of [[New York (state)|New York]] is examining allegations about transactions in which Gunvor Group bought oil from Russia’s OAO Rosneft and sold it to third parties through the US financial system, which could have been illegal. Gunvor released a statement on 6 November denying any crime.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Harding, {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/us-money-laundering-putin-associate-russia |title=US ‘launches money-laundering investigation’ into Putin associate |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=6 November 2014 |archivedate=6 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106161109/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/us-money-laundering-putin-associate-russia |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Guts'' (Lutz book)}}
'''''Guts: 8 Laws of Business from One of the Most Innovative Business Leaders of Our Time''''' is a 2003 management book by [[Robert A. Lutz]], former president of [[Chrysler]].

A self-described "maverick", Lutz organizes the book around his "8 Immutable Laws of Business" which he poses as [[strawman|strawmen]] to demonstrate that even the best principles can be harmful if taken too far.  Lutz draws extensively from his personal experience to illustrate the business principles in the book.

A '''heijunka box''' is a visual scheduling tool used in [[heijunka]], a concept originally created by [[Toyota]] for achieving a smoother production flow.  While heijunka is the smoothing of production, the heijunka box is the name of a specific tool used in achieving the aims of heijunka.

The heijunka box is generally a wall schedule which is divided into a grid of boxes or a set of 'pigeon-holes'/rectangular receptacles. Each column of boxes representing a specific period of time, lines are drawn down the schedule/grid to visually break the schedule into columns of individual shifts or days or weeks. Coloured cards representing individual jobs (referred to as [[kanban]] cards) are placed on the heijunka box to provide a visual representation of the upcoming production runs.

The heijunka box makes it easy to see what type of jobs are queued for production and for when they are scheduled. Workers on the process remove the kanban cards for the current period from the box in order to know what to do. These cards will be passed to another section when they process the related job.

==Implementation==
[[File:HeijunkaBox.svg|thumb|400px|An example of a Heijunka box.]]
The Heijunka box allows easy and visual control of a smoothed production schedule.

A typical heijunka box has horizontal rows for each product. It has vertical columns for identical time intervals of production. In the illustration on the right, the time interval is thirty minutes. Production control kanban are placed in the pigeon-holes provided by the box in proportion to the number of items to be built of a given product type during a time interval.

In this illustration, each time period builds an A and two Bs along with a mix of Cs, Ds and Es. What is clear from the box, from the simple repeating patterns of kanbans in each row, is that the production is smooth of each of these products.

This ensures that production capacity is kept under a constant pressure thereby eliminating many issues.

'''ISOFIX''' is the international standard for attachment points for [[child safety seat]]s in passenger cars. The system has other regional names including '''LATCH''' ("Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children") in the [[United States]] and '''LUAS''' ("Lower Universal Anchorage System") or '''Canfix''' in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.car-safety.org/latch.html |title=Information on LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) |work=Car-Safety.Org |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called the "Universal Child Safety Seat System" or '''UCSSS'''.

ISOFIX is [[International Organisation for Standardisation]] standard ISO 13216, which specifies the anchoring system for [[Child_safety_seat#Group_1|Group 1]] child safety seats. It defines standard attachment points to be manufactured into cars, enabling compliant child safety seats to be quickly and safely secured. ISOFIX is an alternative to securing the seat with [[seat belt]]s. Seats are secured with a single attachment at the top (top tether) and two attachments at the base of each side of the seat. The full set of anchor points for this system were required in new cars in the United States starting in September 2002.

In the EU the system is known as ISOFIX and covers both [[Child_safety_seat#Group_0+|Group 0/0+]] and Group 1 child safety seats. The mechanism for attaching the seat to the Lower Anchors is quite different from that in the United States. In the EU two "alligator-like" clips connect the seat to the Lower Anchors rather than the open clip style connectors commonly used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidsincars.blogspot.com/search/label/LATCH |title=Information on ISOFIX/LATCH |work=Car Safety for Kids Blog |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some child seat manufacturers are beginning to offer true ISOFIX type attachments in the U.S. In the European standard, there are also various installation categories: "universal", "vehicle-specific" and "semi-universal". The main difference is that "Universal" represents use of a top tether [[strap]] with the ISOFIX anchorage, "vehicle-specific" represents the usage of the ISOFIX anchorage without the top tether in specified vehicles only, while "Semi-Universal" represents usage of the ISOFIX anchorage together with a "foot-prop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britax-roemer.de/upload/download/typenliste/17/DUO%20plus%20Typenliste.pdf | title=DUO plus Typenliste| accessdate=June 26, 2008}}{{Dead link |date=March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britax-roemer.de/upload/download/typenliste/13/SAFEFIX%20plus%20Typenliste.pdf | title=SAFEFIX plus Typenliste | accessdate=June 26, 2008}}{{Dead link |date=March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isofix is designed to secure a maximum combined weight (comprising both seat and child) of 33kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bebeconfort.com/car-seats/car-seat-safety/choosing-a-child-car-seat/why-choose-isofix.aspx#|title=Why choose an ISOFIX car seat?|website=www.bebeconfort.com|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The center-to-center distance between the anchors of ISOFIX (and also LATCH) systems is 280 mm. 

For [[Child_safety_seat#Group_2|Group 2]]/[[Child_safety_seat#Group_3|3]] seats there is a system called ISOFIT which anchors the seat to the vehicle so it cannot slide around when not in use. In the case of Isofit, the child is held into the seat using the vehicle's existing seat belt system, not the safety seat's straps.

On September 19, 2014, the Australian government legalized the use of ISOFIX child seats. Prior to this date, their sale (and use) in Australia was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/308969/isofix-seats-legalised-for-australia | title=ISOFIX child seats legalised for Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ISOFIX system was developed jointly by child safety seat maker [[Britax|Britax-Römer]] and automobile maker [[Volkswagen|VW]], with the first compatible products released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britaxusa.com/learning-center/history-heritage | title=Britax history and heritage | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 13216 part 1 (covering lower anchorage points) was published in 1999. Part 2, covering top tether anchorages was published in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=30437 | title=ISO 13216-1:1999 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36058 | title=ISO 13216-2:2004 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendments to include ISOFIX in UN ECE Regulations 14 &amp; 44, which specify uniform provisions for the design of vehicle seat anchorages and child safety seats, came into force in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2003/wp29/TRANS-WP29-2003-38e.pdf | title=United Nations ECE Working Party on Passive Safety - Proposal for draft supplement 5 to the 03 series of amendments to Regulation No 44 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/r044r2e.pdf | title=UN ECE Regulation No 44 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current UN/ECE R14, all new vehicles produced since February 2013 are required to have ISOFIX lower anchorages and top tether attachments.

'''James Buchanan, 1st Baron Woolavington''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCVO|JP}} (16 August 1849 – 9 August 1935), known as '''Sir James Buchanan, Bt''', from 1920 to 1922, was a British businessman, [[philanthropist]], and racehorse owner and breeder.

==Early life==
Buchanan was born in [[Brockville, Ontario]], Canada, the third and youngest son of Alexander Buchanan and his wife Catherine (née McLean),&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p6279.htm#i62782 thepeerage.com James Buchanan, 1st and last Baron Woolavington]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, but his parents returned to the United Kingdom shortly after he was born and he was brought up in [[Larne]], where his father worked as a [[quarry]] manager. Due to ill health as a child, he was educated privately.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{Cite ODNB |id=32151 |title=Buchanan, James, Baron Woolavington (1849–1935) |last=Weir |first=Ronald B. |year=2011 |origyear=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Buchanan joined William Sloan &amp; Co, a [[Glasgow]] shipping firm, as an office boy when he was fourteen or fifteen, and was later promoted to be a clerk. In 1868, he joined his brother William in his [[grain]] business, also in Glasgow. In November 1879, he moved to [[London]] as an agent for the [[Leith]] whisky blenders Charles Mackinlay &amp; Co.

He realised that there was an untapped market in [[England]] for bottled [[Scotch whisky]] and set about producing his own, the ''[[Buchanan's|Buchanan Blend]]'', which is still available today. He went into business on his own in 1884. Buchanan did not, however, produce his own whisky. It was produced for him by the Glasgow blenders W. P. Lowrie &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; Marketed in distinctive black bottles with plain white labels, it was commonly known as "[[Black &amp; White (whisky)|black and white whisky]]", a name that was eventually actually used on the label.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; By 1903, when his firm was incorporated as a [[private limited company]], Buchanan was worth £750,000.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; By 1909, Buchanans was the best-selling Scotch in England.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He supplied whisky to the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] from 1885.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1898, he received [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrants]] to supply [[Queen Victoria]], the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the [[George V|Duke of York]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; Buchanan opened a Paris office in 1902 and a New York office shortly afterwards. In 1898 he opened [[Glentauchers]] [[malt whisky]] distillery on [[Strathspey, Scotland|Speyside]] and later acquired two more distilleries.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1906, he bought Lowrie's and rapidly mechanised their production facilities in Glasgow.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1907, he acquired an interest in the North British Bottle Manufacturing Company and purchased the Acme Tea Chest Company, both to aid his business. Both were rapidly mechanised.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was a master of publicity, driving a red-wheeled [[horse and buggy|buggy]] pulled by a black pony and accompanied by a liveried [[footman]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1909, Buchanan proposed a merger between the "big three" whisky firms: Buchanan's, [[Dewar's]], and [[Johnnie Walker|Walker's]]. This, however, was not successful.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He tried again in 1914, and in April 1915 Buchanan's and Dewar's formed a joint holding company, Scotch Whisky Brands Ltd, renamed Buchanan Dewar Ltd in 1919.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; In 1925, the "big three" merged with the [[Distillers Company]]. Buchanan was a director, but his age and failing health (he had never been in the best of health) meant he played little part in the company, attending only a single board meeting.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Other interests==
Buchanan was vice-president of the [[Tariff Reform League]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He owned properties in [[Kenya]] and [[Argentina]] and part-owned, with [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]], a 20,000-acre fruit farm in [[British Columbia]], Canada. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Sussex]] in 1910.

He spent much of his wealth on philanthropic projects. He bought the [[logbook]] of [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] and presented it to the [[British Museum]], financed the fitting out of [[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] as a [[training ship]], and donated  £125,000 to fund a wing at [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1928 in honour of his late wife, £50,000 to restore the [[nave]] of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], £10,000 to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to fund animal breeding research (later receiving an honorary [[Doctorate of Laws]]), £10,000 to fund a [[hospital#Departments|ward]] at the [[London Hospital]], £5,000 to the [[West of Scotland Agricultural College]], £2,500 to the [[Licensed Victuallers' School]], and £2,500 to the Licensed Victuallers' Benevolent Institution.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

===Thoroughbred racing===
For more than two decades, Woolavington was a significant owner/breeder in the sport of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] who twice won [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] and [[St. Leger Stakes]]. Among his best known runners were [[Epsom Lad]], [[Hurry On]], who became the foundation sire for his [[stud farm|stud]], [[Captain Cuttle]], [[Coronach (horse)|Coronach]], [[Press Gang (horse)|Press Gang]], and [[Coventry Stakes]] winner [[Manitoba (horse)|Manitoba]] who went on to become the [[leading sire in Australia]] in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=928 |title=Woolavington, James (1st Baron) (1849–1935) |publisher=The National Horseracing Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up a [[stud farm]] at his [[Sussex]] estate, [[Lavington Park]], near [[Petworth]], which he had bought in 1903.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was elected to the [[Jockey Club]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He also bred pedigree cattle and sheep.

==Honours==
Buchanan was created a [[baronet]], of Lavington in the County of Sussex, in the 1920 New Year Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31830 |date=19 March 1920 |page=3432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for "public and local services"&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised to the [[peerage]] in the [[1922 New Year Honours]] as '''Baron Woolavington''', of Lavington, in the County of Sussex,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32598 |date=3 February 1922 |page=954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for being a "generous supporter of many public and charitable objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32563 |date=30 December 1921 |page=10709 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is said that he paid £50,000 for his peerage, signing the cheque "Woolavington" and dating it 2 January &amp;ndash; the day after the title was to be gazetted &amp;ndash; so that the payment would [[non-sufficient funds|bounce]] if he did not receive the honour he had been promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1519047/Was-this-the-richest-and-most-secretive-British-tycoon-ever.html |title=Was this the richest (and most secretive) British tycoon ever? |first=Ben |last=Fenton |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] (GCVO) in the [[1931 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33675 |date=30 December 1930 |page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Dent''' (1821–1892) was an English merchant of the then prominent trading firm [[Dent &amp; Co.]] and member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and Chairman of the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]].

==Biography==
John was born in 1821 in the Far East merchant family. His uncle Thomas Dent started the [[Dent &amp; Co.]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in the 1820s and his two other uncles [[Lancelot Dent|Lancelot]] and Wilkinson Dent were the heads of the firm&lt;ref name="familiy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=61647&amp;back=|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Philip K.|last=Law|title=Dent family (per. c.1820–1927)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the firm into one of the largest [[hong (business)|hongs]] in China and early colonial Hong Kong.

John Dent joined Dent &amp; Co. and became the senior partner of the firm. In 1863, he was elected the third chairman of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]]. He played a leading role in the establishment of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Company]]&lt;ref name="familiy"/&gt; and was one of the proprietors when the bank was incorporated in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|date=25 July 1866|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1866/713501.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to London in 1864 with a fortune of about £800,000, which he amassed in China, and joined the formation of the Blakely Ordnance Company and became the chairman of the firm with the capital of £120 000.&lt;ref name="Argus"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|location=Melbourne|date=12 January 1867|page=1|title=The English November Mail per Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dent was appointed an unofficial [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1844. In 1857, he was appointed member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=30|volume=3|date=26 December 1857|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1857/724386.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the office in 1861 and replaced by [[Francis Chomley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=125|date=9 November 1861|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1861/720939.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; another partner of the Dent &amp; Co.. He was reappointed to the Legislative Council in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=147|date=10 August 1866|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1866/713861.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 1867 after his firm went bankrupt in 1867 and was replaced by [[Phineas Ryrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=109|date=15 July 1867|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1867/711749.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dent was also appointed consul for the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and later the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in Hong Kong from 1858 to 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=180|volume=4|date=30 October 1858|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1858/723192.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=70|volume=4|date=12 May 1866|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1866/713102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|number=49|date=28 April 1867|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1868/709313.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dent &amp; Co. went bankrupt in 1867 during the [[Long depression|worldwide financial crisis]] which originated in 1866 in London. They suffered a loss of no less than £200,000 by the malversations of a Portuguese clerk in their employment at Shanghai who was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Argus"/&gt; The petition for adjudication of bankruptcy was filed in the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]] on 29 June 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Hongkong Government Gazette|page=434|date=21 December 1867|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1867/712466.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dent had to remove his headquarters in Shanghai and sold the Dent Building to the [[Hong Kong Hotel]] Co.

Dent was noted for his luxurious lifestyle which he was reported to have spent £10,000 on a racehorse to win the Hong Kong cup.&lt;ref name="familiy"/&gt; The clock-tower at the end of [[Pedder Street]] and the entrance to [[Queen's Road, Hong Kong|Queen's Road]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]], erected by public subscription in 1862, was at the suggestion of John Dent, whose original design had to be stripped of its original decorative features, owing to the waning enthusiasm of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=153|title=Twentieth Century Impressions of Hongkong, Shanghai, and other Treaty Ports of China|editor-first=Arnold|editor-last=Wright|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dent also donated a fountain at the entrance of the old [[City Hall, Hong Kong|City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Wen Wei Po|title=香港大會堂50周年：從小見大 變化難料|date=22 June 2012|language=Chinese|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2012/06/22/OT1206220007.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Dent recommenced business as [[Dent &amp; Co]] in Shanghai in the premises previously occupied by his old firm.&lt;ref&gt;Notice in the North China Herald, 16 June 1870, p437&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871 he became the Chairman of the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]] and served in that position until January 1873&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle &amp; Directory for China and Japan 1872, entry for Dent; Municipal Council Report and Budget 1874, p4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]] with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness Management. He also earned a Master of Environment and Natural Resources Management degree from the [[University of the Philippines Open University]].

==Political career==
===Congress===
After serving as chief of staff of his father, Rep. (now Bukidnon Governor) Jose Ma. R. Zubiri, Jr., from 1995–1998, he ran for the seat representing the [[Legislative districts of Bukidnon#Third district|third district of Bukidnon]] to be vacated by his father in the 1998 general elections. Winning easily in that election, he served his first term in the [[10th Congress of the Philippines|10th Congress]]. During his first term, he was one of the members of what the media dubbed as the "[[Spice Boys (Congressmen)|Spice Boys]]", a group of neophyte and two-term congressmen who were openly critical of President [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph Estrada's]] administration. He was subsequently re-elected to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine House of Representatives]] in the 2001 and 2004 elections.

===Senate===
After serving as a [[Congressman]] for three-terms, he was drafted by [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas CMD]] to be one of their candidates in the pro [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] administration [[TEAM Unity]] ticket in the 2007 mid-term elections.

In the final tally for the 2007 senatorial race by the [[Comelec|Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec)]], Rep. Zubiri narrowly defeated opposition candidate [[Koko Pimentel]] for the 12th and last slot in the Senate. Zubiri had a total of 11,001,730 votes against Pimentel's 10,983,358 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20070714hed3.html The Philippine Daily Tribune] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140200/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20070714hed3.html |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of some 18,372 votes was hotly contested, particularly the votes from the southern Philippine province of [[Maguindanao]], where Pimentel had lost heavily to Zubiri.

Claiming the votes in [[Maguindanao]] were tainted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=82880 ABS-CBN News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701205304/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=82880 |date=July 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pimentel petitioned the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Philippine Supreme Court]] to invalidate the votes from Maguindanao, effectively disenfranchising a whole province. The Supreme Court voted unanimously 14 -0 against Pimentel and allowed the COMELEC (Commission on Elections) to count the votes in Zubiri's favor. Pimentel then returned to the Supreme Court for the second time. This time, he petitioned the justices to issue a restraining order against the proclamation of Zubiri. After oral arguments, however, the High Tribunal again voted to uphold the COMELEC's decision to proclaim Zubiri, consequently failing to grant Pimentel's petition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=76486 Inquirer.net, SC paves way for Zubiri proclamation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715122235/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=76486 |date=July 15, 2007 }}. None. Retrieved on August 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, July 14, 2007, Zubiri was duly proclaimed elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]]. However, the Court's judgment did not prevent Pimentel from bringing his poll protests to the Senate Electoral Tribunal.

On March 14, 2008, the Supreme Court, in a 40-page decision penned by Associate Justice [[Minita Chico-Nazario]], dismissed [[Koko Pimentel]] petition to stop the Commission on Elections from canvassing votes from the province of [[Maguindanao]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/84882/Zubiri-SC-decision-a-big-morale-booster www.gmanews.tv, Zubiri: SC decision a big morale booster]. Gmanews.tv. Retrieved on August 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a definite morale booster for Senator Zubiri.

While serving his stint in the Senate, Zubiri began advocating a more in-depth study of biofuels in order to prevent food shortages, all the while allowing current production of alternative clean energy and biofuels so as to lessen dependence on imported oil and allow the Philippine economy a new avenue of economic success, "especially in this day and age of constant rising oil prices".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/archives.php?aid=2008040233&amp;type=2 – Philstar.com- Food vs. Fuel issue not applicable to RP]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2011, however, during his privilege speech on the floor in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]], Zubiri suddenly announced his resignation from the body.&lt;ref name="inquirer1"/&gt; In his speech, he said that his family was hurt by the "unfounded" accusations against him. "Without admitting any fault and with my vehement denial of the alleged electoral fraud hurled against me, I am submitting my resignation as a duly elected Senator of the Republic of the Philippines in the election for which I am falsely accused without mercy and compassion," Zubiri said in his speech. "My political detractors began calling me ugly names and dragging the name of my family in entirety. In other words, Mr. President, the trial by publicity has begun," he continued.

His resignation was lauded by [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañang]] and various sectors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/228270/news/nation/senator-zubiri-resigns-amid-2007-poll-fraud-controversy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://balita.ph/2011/08/03/enrile-commends-zubiri-resignation-saddened-colleagues&lt;/ref&gt; but was also seen as a step that helped restore the Filipino's faith in national electoral protests. 

Senator [[Francis Pangilinan]], a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal, likewise refused to comment on what the next procedure is for the vacancy left by Zubiri. "Let's just wait for developments if any," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.news.yahoo.com/senator-zubiri-resigning-from-post-.html Senator Zubiri resigns from post, to run in 2013 – Yahoo!]. Ph.news.yahoo.com (August 3, 2011). Retrieved on August 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he ran for the senate under the Partido ng Galing at Puso of Senator [[Grace Poe]]'s [[Grace Poe presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] placing 6th in the polls. As like other politicians, he left his party and joined [[PDP–Laban]], mending his relations with Koko Pimentel, his former adversary.

== Life and career ==
Lau Ah Kok was born in 1920 in [[Pengcheng]], [[China]] to a farmers' family and in the early years he lived with his family in [[Kinmen]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thescoop.co/2018/01/11/humble-farmer-retail-tycoon-pehin-lau-built-hua-ho-empire/|title=From humble farmer to retail tycoon: How Pehin Lau built the Hua Ho empire – The Scoop|date=2018-01-11|work=The Scoop|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, he left his hometown at the age of 17 and eventually migrated to Brunei,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; where he worked at a grocery shop owned by his brother-in-law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The destruction in the aftermath of the war also prevented him from returning to his homeland.

In 1947, he set up in [[Manggis, Brunei|Manggis]] a small agricultural farm and the first Hua Ho store, which was a grocery store.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, after a few years he had to close the store due to financial difficulty as well as illness. It was revived in 1961 but again ceased operation in 1982, this time together with the farm, citing bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Nevertheless, he was undeterred and after acquiring sufficient capital he established a supermarket in [[Gadong, Brunei|Gadong]] as well as the first Hua Ho department store in [[Lambak, Brunei|Lambak]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also revived the farming business where he set up new farms in [[Junjongan]] in 1984 and [[Labi, Brunei|Labi]] four years later, in which he made substantial investment in machinery and better farming methods. He then decided to relinquish the retail business to his children where he could focus on the farming business. Nevertheless, both businesses finally took hold and become successful. The department store eventually became the largest retail business in the country with nine stores altogether located in [[Brunei-Muara District|Brunei-Muara]] and [[Tutong District|Tutong Districts]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/hua-ho-dept-store-founder-passes-away-at-98/|title=Hua Ho Dept Store founder passes away at 98 – Borneo Bulletin Online|date=2018-01-08|work=Borneo Bulletin Online|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; where as the farms generated substantial produce – it produces about 10,000 tonnes of oranges annually, sells 1,000 broiler chicken per hour and seven tonnes of vegetables; all are supplied to the Hua Ho supermarket stores.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Accolades ==
In 2004, Lau Ah Kok was bestowed by [[Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]], the [[Sultan of Brunei]], a titular position of Manteri, a nobility class (similar to the British [[life peerage]]), with the title "{{Lang|ms|Pehin Kapitan China Kornia Di-Raja|italic=no}}" for his contributions to the local Chinese community and government activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was one of the few local Chinese commoners in the nobility.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Two years later, he was also awarded by the Sultan a service medal which came with the title "{{Lang|ms|Dato Paduka|italic=no}}".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2008, he was awarded the Asia-Pacific Entrepreneurship Lifetime Achievement Award by Enterprise Asia, a [[Kuala Lumpur]]-based organisation, for his business achievements locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://enterpriseasia.org/apea/brunei/awards/bn-2008/|title=2008 — Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards|last=nazerry|work=Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Death ==
Lau Ah Kok passed away on 7 January 2018 at his residence in [[Manggis, Brunei|Manggis]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He left behind his wife, seven children, fifteen grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4207">This list is a comprehenisive collection of [[statistical]] methods used in [[project management]] is to achieve project goals.

==Project management tools==
* [[Critical path method]] (CPM) is an [[algorithm]] for scheduling a set of project activities in a straight line.
* [[Critical chain project management]] is a method of planning and managing projects that emphasizes the resources required to execute project tasks.
* [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]], commonly abbreviated PERT, is a statistical tool, used in project management, that is designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.
* [[Activity diagram]]s are graphical representations of [[workflows]] of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]].
* [[Beta distribution]] is a combination of [[probability theory]] and statistics, most commonly used in project management for time allocation and to analyse random variables.
* [[Critical path drag]] is a project management metric used to schedule analysis and compression in the [[critical path method]] of scheduling.
* [[Drag cost]] is the reduction in the expected [[return on investment]] for a project due to an activity's or constraint's [[critical path drag]]. It is often used to justify additional resources that cost less than the drag cost.
* [[Event chain diagram]]s are visualizations that show the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other.
* [[Earned value management]] is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress in terms of deducing earned value of a project from planned value and the actual costs.
* [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]], commonly abbreviated PERT, is a statistical tool, used in project management to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.
[[Image:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|309px|PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five milestones (10 through 50) and six activities (A through F).]]
* [[work breakdown structure]], A work breakdown structure (WBS), in project management is a deliverable oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components.
* A [[Gantt chart]] is a type of bar chart, that illustrates a project schedule.
* [[Design structure matrix]] is a simple, compact and visual representation of a system or project in the form of a matrix. It is the equivalent of an adjacency matrix in graph theory, and is used in project management to model the structure of complex systems or processes, in order to perform system analysis, project planning and organization design.
* [[Project network]] is a graph (flow chart) depicting the sequence in which a project's terminal elements are to be completed by showing terminal elements and their dependencies.
* [[Triangular distribution]] – In probability theory and statistics, the triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with lower limit a, upper limit b and mode c, where a &lt; b and a ≤ c ≤ b.
* [[Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique]], commonly known as GERT, is a network analysis technique used in project management that allows probabilistic treatment of both network logic and estimation of activity duration
* [[Capability Maturity Model]], a statistical model converts ad hoc practices in to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, resulting in  active optimization of the processes.
* [[Integrated master plan]] is an event-driven plan document depicting the significant accomplishments necessary to complete the work and ties each accomplishment to a key program event
* [[Linear scheduling method]] is a graphical scheduling method focusing on continuous resource utilization in repetitive activities.
* [[Predictive analytics]] encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from [[Computer model|modeling]], [[machine learning]], and [[data mining]] that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future, or otherwise unknown, events .

'''Levie Jacob "Louis" Fles''' (19 October 1872 – 24 May 1940) was a Dutch businessman, activist and author. He is best known for writing and [[broadcasting]] against [[Zionism]], [[Nazism]], and organized religion. A self-described [[Freethought|freethinker]], Fles was a vocal supporter of [[Humanism]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. His relationship with the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party]] was  more problematic. While he generally supported the ideals of [[socialism]], he wrote extensively about his disagreements with the party as well. After a life filled with personal tragedy and devotion to political and social activism, Fles committed [[suicide]] in May 1940, only a few weeks after the German occupation of the Netherlands.

==Family life==
[[File:Maassluis centrum.jpg|thumb|left|Maassluis Center]]
Louis Fles was born in [[Maassluis]], Netherlands on 19 October 1871 to Jewish parents. His father, Jacob Levie Fles, worked as a diamond cutter, and his mother, Saartje van Blijdestein, ran a hosiery shop, placing young Louis squarely in the newly expanding merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gans|first1=Evelien|title=Fles, Levie|url=http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|website=Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926232224/http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|archivedate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his father died in 1873 his mother married a man named Swaab. Upon his mother's death in 1878, Louis was taken in and raised by his stepfather's family.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; As a successful business owner himself, Swaab took the young Louis into his company shortly after the boy had completed primary school.&lt;ref name=BWSA&gt;{{cite web|title=Fles, Levie|url=http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|website=BWSA|publisher=Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland|accessdate=26 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926232224/http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|archivedate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 1896 Fles married Zipporah van Straten in the city of [[Rotterdam]]. They had six children; Mina, Rosine, Henriette, Clara, [[Barthold Fles|Barthold]], and [[George Fles|George]]. Barthold became a successful literary agent in [[New York City]] in the [[United States]]. George worked as a translator in the [[Soviet Union]] during the regime of [[Joseph Stalin]]. In 1938 George was arrested as a political dissident due to his [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] sympathies.&lt;ref name=Gans&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gans|first1=E.E.|title=De kleine verschillen die het leven uitmaken.

George died in prison in 1939.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; Around this same time news arrived from the United States that daughter Rosine had died shortly after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;

Fles was widely known as an opponent of Nazism when the German army occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. Even so, it was a shock to many of his family members when, on 25 May 1940, Levie Jacob "Louis" Fles committed suicide by means of pills acquired from a pharmacist in [[Keppel, Netherlands|Keppel]].&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; He was buried in [[Amsterdam]] in [[Zorgvlied (cemetery)|Zorgvlied Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Museum Wilhelmsbau Klein-Adler typewriter pic2.JPG|thumb|left|Museum Wilhelmsbau, Klein-Adler typewriter]]

Fles began working in his stepfather's office shortly after completing primary school. Soon, however, he went into business for himself.  He gave lessons in French, English, and German before passing the accounting examination. This allowed him to become a bookkeeper for the [[Bank of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=JA&gt;{{cite web|title=personen &gt; levie jacob fles|url=http://rotterdam.joodsamsterdam.nl/persfleslevie.htm|website=naar joodsamsterdam|publisher=Joodsamsterdam.nl|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816173505/http://rotterdam.joodsamsterdam.nl/persfleslevie.htm|archivedate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these experiences as a foundation, Fles soon founded his own company.&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt; Fles &amp; Company had many interests, all related to serving the needs of other businesses. These included advertising and publishing, as well as the import and sale of high-end German-made Adler typewriters.&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=type&gt;{{cite web|title=Adler|url=http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=adler15&amp;cat=kf|website=The Virtual Typewriter Museum|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125143813/http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=adler15&amp;cat=kf|archivedate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of a highly successful line of office furniture helped the company expand and establish branch offices throughout the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt;

The rise of Nazism in Germany presented both moral and practical problems for the importer of German goods. In 1933, Fles published the brochure ''Hitler, hervormer of misdadiger?'' (''Hitler, reformer or criminal?'') in which he called for a [[boycott]] on the importation of all German goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fles|first1=Levie|title=Hitler, hervormer of misdadiger?|date=1933|publisher=Fles &amp; Company|page=87|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fles sold his business and retired in 1934.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;

==Activism==

===Writing===
Fles' earliest published pamphlets, ''Is in de moderne boekhouding plaats voor het copieboek?'' (''Can copybooks serve a function in modern accounting?'') (1918) and ''Efficiency'' (1922), were both related to the world of business.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt; However, Louis Fles is better known for his extensive writings on politics, religion, and education. As early as 1917, ''[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]'' printed his criticism of the way Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) allowed churches to influence the Dutch educational system. In this article, he accused the SDAP of having "sacrificed children to politics".&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;

Later writings continued to criticize both political and religious authorities. In ''Kalenderhervorming, Sjabbat en Kerk'' (''Calendar Reform, Shabbat and Church'') (1930), Fles first observed that clinging to cultural and religious practices that set Jewish people apart from the surrounding Dutch culture served to feed the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] narrative of Jews as foreigners. He then went on to propose alternative activities families might engage in, such as visiting a museum or other educational pursuits&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; and admonished his reader, ''"durf vrij te denken"'', "Dare to think freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fles|first1=Levie|title=Kalenderhervorming, Sjabbat en Kerk|date=1930|publisher=Fles and Company|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He expanded upon these ideas in ''Water en vuur'' (''Water and Fire'') (1931). Religion, Fles wrote, was as antithetical to [[socialism]] as water was to fire. Here Fles repeated his accusation that the government deferred too much to religious—particularly [[Catholic]]—authorities, especially in the area of children's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fles|first1=Levie|title=Water en vuur|date=1931|publisher=Fles and Company|location=Amsterdam|pages=9–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri Polak, geschilderd door Johan van Caspel.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Polak]] painted by {{Interlanguage link multi|Johan van Caspel|nl}} (1912)]]
In 1933 Fles used a [[pseudonym]], Dr. W. Bottema C. Az, to publish ''Hitler, hervormer of misdadiger?'' (''Hitler, reformer or criminal?'').&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt; Here Fles enumerated and described the treatment of Jewish people under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], and declared that "every relationship with Germany, in the area of commerce, art, science, sports and traffic should be discontinued, so that Germany is economically and otherwise crushed."&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; Fles would later put this sentiment into practice.  He sold his business that depended largely upon selling imported German merchandise,&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; and, in 1936, served on the planning committee for ''De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur'' (The Olympiad under Dictatorship), which served as counter to the summer [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] being held in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riding|first1=Alan|authorlink=Alan Riding|title=Dutch Re-Create a 1936 Anti-Nazi Art Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/23/arts/dutch-re-create-a-1936-anti-nazi-art-show.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526170435/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/23/arts/dutch-re-create-a-1936-anti-nazi-art-show.html|archivedate=26 May 2015|date=23 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Fles carried on correspondences with other leading thinkers of his day, including an extended debate with [[Henri Polak]] regarding the nature of socialism and Fles' determined opposition to [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt; Fles felt himself to be Dutch, and saw Zionism as further separating Jews from their non-Jewish Dutch neighbors while reinforcing the image of the Jew as a foreigner. Instead, Fles favored assimilation into the cultures in which Jews found themselves. He endorsed mixed marriages to accelerate this process.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt; Fles gathered many of his thoughts from this correspondence into the 1939 pamphlet ''Weg met het zionisme!'' (''Down with Zionism!'').

===Broadcasting===
[[File:Protest Dageraad volkstelling.jpg|thumb|Action by Rotterdam freethinkers of De Dageraad against the 1930 census. The goal was to persuade people to have themselves registered as "unchurched" and "not religious", and thus reduce public subsidy of church associations.

NONE!"]]
Fles became involved with ''Vrijdenkers Radio Omroep (VRO)'' (Freethinkers Radio Broadcasting), which had been established in 1928 as an outreach program of the freethinkers' association ''[[De Vrije Gedachte|De Dageraad]] (The Dawn)''. In 1929, the newly established Dutch Radio Broadcasting Control Commission labeled the group's material as subversive,&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; and began to monitor its broadcasts closely. Fles' radio speech ''Los van de kerk'' (''Free from the Church'') was banned altogether, and many other broadcasts were censored for their subversive content, although they later found an audience in print form.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;

In 1933 Fles challenged the secretary of the Radio Broadcasting Control Commission regarding the lack of support VRO received from the government. He pointed out that the 1930 census had shown that the number of "unchurched" citizens had risen sharply, and, since this was VRO's intended audience, it should receive commensurate support. However, in that same year broadcast content restrictions were sharply tightened and, in 1936, VRO's broadcasting license was revoked. However, documents from the organization show that Fles was elected to the VRO's general board, showing that the organization continued to work toward regaining the right to broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Bert Gasenbeek |author2=Hans Blom |author3=Jo Nabuurs |date=2006 |title=God noch autoriteit. Geschiedenis van de vrijdenkersbeweging in Nederland |publisher=Boom |location=Amersfoort |ISBN=9085063582 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Olympiad Under Dictatorship===
When the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin were declared off limits to Jews and other groups that the Nazi government deemed undesirable, Fles was among a group of Dutch businessmen and politicians who organized ''De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur'' ("The Olympiad Under Dictatorship") both to showcase the artists of the Netherlands and to protest the policies of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Organizers of the exhibition included Fles' friend and correspondent [[Henri Polak]], as well as other left-leaning Dutch leaders.&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt; The committee made it clear that their exhibition was as much about protesting the Nazis' manipulation of the arts and sciences for political purposes as it was about showcasing Dutch excellence.  Artists from neighboring countries and even German artists who had fled the Nazi regime were invited to participate. The initials of the name itself spell out ''D.O.O.D'', or "death" in Dutch.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The travelling exhibition opened on 1 August 1936 amid much controversy. In Amsterdam, the use of public buildings was prohibited, and in Rotterdam, the show was closed down after only a few days. Nineteen works were considered by the Dutch government to be too insulting to Hitler and were removed from display. The German consul himself characterized the event as "sheer provocation", showing that the committee's efforts had not escaped official German notice. Many of the organizers and participants went to prison or were executed after German forces occupied the Netherlands in 1940.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In 1996, in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the D.O.O.D., the Amsterdam Municipal Archives allowed a number of the works from the original exhibition to be displayed at the Sports Museum in [[Berlin]], Germany.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The '''Master of Economics''' is  a [[postgraduate]] '''[[master's degree]] in [[economics]]''' ('''M.Econ.''', '''M.Ec.'''; also [[Master of Science|MS]] in Economics, [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Economics, [[Master of Commerce|MCom]] in Economics) comprising training in economic theory, [[econometrics]] and / or [[applied economics]].

==Overview==
The degree may be offered as a [[terminal degree]] or as additional preparation for [[doctorate|doctoral study]], and is sometimes offered as a [[professional degree]], such as the  emerging  degree, ''M.P.S. in Applied Economics''. The program emphases and curricula will differ correspondingly.  The course of study for the master's degree lasts from one to two years. A [[thesis]] is often required, particularly for terminal degrees.

Many universities (in the United States) do not offer the master's degree directly; rather, the degree is routinely awarded as a [[Doctor of Philosophy#Master's degree "en route"|master's degree "en route"]], after completion of a designated phase of the [[Ph.D.]] program in economics. 

Typically, the [[curriculum]] is structured around [[Core curriculum|core topics]], with any optional [[coursework]] [[wikt:complementary|complementary]] to the program focus. The core modules are usually in [[Microeconomics|microeconomic theory]], [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic theory]] and [[econometrics]]. Theory-focused degrees will tend to cover these more mathematically, and emphasize econometric theory as opposed to econometric techniques and [[Statistical packages|software]]; these will also require a separate course in [[mathematical economics]]. Note though that regardless of focus, most programs "now place a marked emphasis on the primacy of mathematics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Masters degrees in economics: How to be a leader of the future|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/masters-degrees-in-economics-how-to-be-a-leader-of-the-future-482394.html|newspaper=The Independent | location=London|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many universities thus also require [[Business_mathematics#Postgraduate|"quantitative techniques"]], especially where mathematical economics is not a core course. Some (doctoral) programs include core work in [[economic history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Econ Grad School|url=http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/gradschool.htm|publisher=Davidson|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528031938/http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/gradschool.htm|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optional or additional coursework will depend on the program's emphasis. In theory-focused degrees, and those preparing students for doctoral work, this coursework is often in these same core topics, but in greater depth. In terminal or applied or [[Professional degree|career-focused degrees]], options may include [[public finance]], [[labour economics|labour-]], [[financial economics|financial-]], [[development economics|development-]], [[industrial economics|industrial-]],  [[health economics|health-]] or [[agricultural economics]]. These degrees may also allow for a specialization in one of these areas, and may be named correspondingly (for example [[Master's in Financial Economics]], [[Masters in International Economics]], [[Masters in Development Economics]], Master's in Sustainable Economic Development and [[Masters in Agricultural Economics]].)

Entry requirements are undergraduate work in (calculus-based) economics, at least at the intermediate level, and often as a [[academic major|major]], and a sufficient level of mathematical training (including courses in  [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; often ([[Multivariable calculus|multivariable]]) [[calculus]] and [[linear algebra]]; and sometimes [[mathematical analysis]].)

'''Melt''' is the working material in the [[steelmaking]] process, in making [[glass]], and when forming [[thermoplastic]]s. In thermoplastics, melt is the plastic in its forming temperature, which can vary depending on how it is being used.&lt;ref&gt;Whelan, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; For steelmaking, it refers to steel in liquid form.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar thesis was originally expressed by [[Daniel Guérin]], in his 1936 book ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'', about the [[Fascism|fascist]] government support to heavy industry. It can be defined as, "an informal and changing coalition of groups with vested psychological, moral, and material interests in the continuous development and maintenance of high levels of weaponry, in preservation of colonial markets and in military-strategic conceptions of internal affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Pursell, C. (1972). The military–industrial complex. Harper &amp; Row Publishers, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
An exhibit of the trend was made in [[Franz Leopold Neumann]]'s book ''[[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism]]'' in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state.

Such type of complex, in the First World War, had taken US to the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]].{{vague|date=August 2018}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Eisenhower farewell address.ogg|right|thumb|Eisenhower's farewell address, January 17, 1961. The term ''military–industrial complex'' is used at 8:16. Length: 15:30.]]

[[President of the United States]] (and [[five-star general]] during World War II) [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] used the term in his [[Eisenhower's farewell address|Farewell Address to the Nation]] on January 17, 1961:

{{quote|A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...

This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.
In the councils of government, '''we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex'''. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together. [emphasis added]}}

The phrase was thought to have been "war-based" industrial complex before becoming "military" in later drafts of Eisenhower's speech, a claim passed on only by oral history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-12-10-eisenhower-address_N.htm |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |title=Papers shed light on Eisenhower's farewell address |author=John Milburn |date=December 10, 2010 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Geoffrey Perret]], in his biography of Eisenhower, claims that, in one draft of the speech, the phrase was "military–industrial–congressional complex", indicating the essential role that the [[United States Congress]] plays in the propagation of the military industry, but the word "congressional" was dropped from the final version to appease the then-currently elected officials.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/guest-post-james-ledbetter-on-50-years-of-the-military-industrial-complex/|title=Guest Post: 50 Years of the "Military–Industrial Complex"|last=Ledbetter|first=James|date=25 January 2011|work=Schott's Vocab|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Ledbetter]] calls this a "stubborn misconception" not supported by any evidence; likewise a claim by [[Douglas Brinkley]] that it was originally "military–industrial–scientific complex".&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=52 |issue=6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323001947/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2001/6/2001_6_58.shtml |archivedate=23 March 2006 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2001/6/2001_6_58.shtml|title=Eisenhower; His farewell speech as President inaugurated the spirit of the 1960s|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas|date=September 2001|work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Henry Giroux]] claims that it was originally "military–industrial–academic complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820234731/http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=168000 |archivedate=20 August 2007 |url=http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=168000 |title=''The University in Chains: Confronting the Military–Industrial–Academic Complex'' |last1=Giroux |first1=Henry |last2= |first2= |date=June 2007 |work= |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual authors of the speech were Eisenhower's speechwriters [[Ralph E. Williams]] and [[Malcolm Moos]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Charles "New Light on Eisenhower's Farewell Address," in Presidential Studies Quarterly 22 (Summer 1992): 469–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to conceptualize something similar to a modern "military–industrial complex" existed before Eisenhower's address. Ledbetter finds the precise term used in 1947 in close to its later meaning in an article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' by Winfield W. Riefler.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riefler|first=Winfield W.|date=October 1947|title=Our Economic Contribution to Victory|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=26|issue=1|pages=90–103|jstor=20030091}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] had claimed in his book ''[[The Power Elite]]'' that a class of military, business, and political leaders, driven by mutual interests, were the real leaders of the state, and were effectively beyond democratic control. [[Friedrich Hayek]] mentions in his 1944 book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' the danger of a support of monopolistic organization of industry from World War II political remnants:

{{quote|Another element which after this war is likely to strengthen the tendencies in this direction will be some of the men who during the war have tasted the powers of [[coercive control]] and will find it difficult to reconcile themselves with the humbler roles they will then have to play [in peaceful times]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich von Hayek|Hayek, F. A.]], (1976) "The Road to Serfdom", London: Routledge, p. 146, note 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Vietnam War]]–era activists, such as [[Seymour Melman]], referred frequently to the concept, and use continued throughout the [[Cold War]]: [[George F. Kennan]] wrote in his preface to [[Norman Cousins]]'s 1987 book ''The Pathology of Power'', "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military–industrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=George Frost |last=Kennan |title=At a Century's Ending: Reflections 1982–1995 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60D6qQGjMdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US military bases in the world 2007.svg|thumb|U.S. military presence around the world in 2007. {{as of|2018}}, the United States still had many [[List of United States military bases|bases and troops stationed globally]].]]
In the late 1990s [[James Kurth]] asserted, "By the mid-1980s&amp;nbsp;... the term had largely fallen out of public discussion." He went on to argue that "[w]hatever the power of arguments about the influence of the military–industrial complex on weapons procurement during the Cold War, they are much less relevant to the current era".{{sfn|Kurth|1999}}

Contemporary students and critics of American [[militarism]] continue to refer to and employ the term, however. For example, historian [[Chalmers Johnson]] uses words from the second, third, and fourth paragraphs quoted above from Eisenhower's address as an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to Chapter Two ("The Roots of American Militarism") of a recent volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Chalmers |title=The sorrows of empire: Militarism, secrecy, and the end of the republic |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2004 |p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; on this subject. [[P. W. Singer]]'s book concerning [[private military company|private military companies]] illustrates contemporary ways in which industry, particularly an information-based one, still interacts with the U.S. federal and the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry''. Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressions [[permanent war economy]] and war corporatism are related concepts that have also been used in association with this term. The term is also used to describe comparable collusion in other political entities such as the [[German Empire]] (prior to and through the first world war), Britain, France, and (post-Soviet) [[Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Linguist and [[anarchism|anarchist]] theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] has suggested that "military–industrial complex" is a misnomer because (as he considers it) the phenomenon in question "is not specifically military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies, Noam Chomsky interviewed by David Barsamian|work=chomsky.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts, "There is no military–industrial complex: it's just the industrial system operating under one or another pretext (defense was a pretext for a long time)."&lt;ref&gt;In ''On Power, Dissent, and Racism: a Series of Discussions with Noam Chomsky'', Baraka Productions, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentagon contractor-funded American [[think tanks]] such as the [[Lexington Institute]] and the [[Atlantic Council]] have also demanded increased spending in view of the perceived Russian threat.&lt;ref name="theintercept.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, 11 May 2016, Testimony of M.

== Eras of the Military Industrial Complex ==
The Military Industrial Complex has gone through three distinct eras in its existence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynn III|first=William|date=Winter 2017|title=The End of the Military-Industrial Complex|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/end-military-industrial-complex|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=93|pages=104-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The First Era ===
From 1797 to 1941 the government only relied on civilian industries while the country was actually at war. The government owned their own shipyards and weapons manufacturing facilities which they relied on through [[World War I]]. With [[World War II]] came a massive shift in the way that the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]] armed the [[American military|military]]. 

With the onset of World War II President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate civilian industries and shift them into wartime production. Throughout World War II arms production in the United States went from around one percent of the annual [[GDP]] to 40 percent of the GDP&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. After the end of the war the American government did not dismantle the war machine that they had built. Various American companies, such as [[Boeing]] and [[General Motors]], maintained and expanded their defense divisions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. These companies have gone on to develop various technologies that have improved civilian life as well such as [[Night-vision device|night-vision goggles]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], and the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Second Era ===
The start of the second era of the Military Industrial Complex is said to start with the coining of the term by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. This era marked the end of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1993 the Pentagon urged defense contractors to consolidate due to the collapse of communism and shrinking defense budget.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Third (Current) Era ===
The third era of the Military Industrial Complex has seen the most change as defense contractors either consolidated or shifted their focus to civilian innovation. From 1992 to 1997 there was a total of $55 Billion worth of mergers in the defense industry. Major defense companies purchased smaller defense companies and became the major companies that know today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Department of Defense no longer exports technological advancements to the civilian market, they now import many technologies. [[3D printing]], [[cloud computing]], [[Computer security|cybersecurity]], and [[nanotechnology]] are all examples of the advancements of the civilian technological industry. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Pentagon no longer has the budget to award many defense contracts and the research and development budgets of defense contractors is far smaller than private technology companies. The lack of a large budget from the Pentagon has made defense contractors anxious to invest their own profits into research and development as it is unclear whether or not the Pentagon will be able to match their contributions to create intuitive new products. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Current applications==
[[File:Biggest arms sales 2013.png|thumbnail|right|Share of arms sales by country; source provided by [[SIPRI]]&lt;ref name="sipri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/production/recent-trends-in-arms-industry|title=Arms production - SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to [[SIPRI]], total world spending on military expenses in 2009 was $1.531 trillion U.S. dollars. 46.5% of this total, roughly $712 billion U.S. dollars, was spent by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Anup Shah]] | title = World Military Spending | url = http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending | accessdate = October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privatization of the production and invention of military technology also leads to a complicated relationship with significant research and development of many technologies. The [[military budget of the United States]] for the 2009 fiscal year was $515.4 billion. Adding emergency discretionary spending and supplemental spending, brings the sum to $651.2 billion.&lt;ref name="gpoaccess.gov"&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/pdf/budget/defense.pdf Gpoaccess.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107010807/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/pdf/budget/defense.pdf |date=2012-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include many military-related items that are outside of the Defense Department budget. Overall the U.S. federal government is spending about $1 trillion annually on defense-related purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Robert Higgs]] | title = The Trillion-Dollar Defense Budget Is Already Here | url = http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1941 | accessdate = March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 story, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' reported, "Despite a decline in global arms sales in 2010 due to [[recession]]ary pressures, the United States increased its market share, accounting for a whopping 53 percent of the trade that year. Last year saw the United States on pace to deliver more than $46 billion in foreign arms sales."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/2012/01/24/america_arms_dealer_to_the_world/  America, arms-dealer to the world]," ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]],'' January 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense industry also tends to contribute heavily to incumbent members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42733.html|title=Defense goes all-in for incumbents - Jen DiMascio|author=Jen DiMascio|work=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an example in practice, Matthew Brummer describes Japan's Manga Military and how the Ministry of Defense uses popular culture and the [[Moe (slang)|moe]] that it engenders to shape domestic and international perceptions.

'''MingJian''' (Ming Qi Jian (Shanghai) Detection Technology Services Ltd.) is a product-testing organization based in [[Shanghai]], China. MingJian is the first Chinese member of [[International Consumer Research &amp; Testing|International Consumer Research and Testing (ICRT)]], an international aggregate of consumer safety and product-testing organizations.

== History ==
[[University of Pennsylvania]] alumni James and Jessie Feldkamp started MingJian on March 15, 2010 [[Consumers International (World's Consumer Rights Day)]]. They were driven to protect Chinese consumers after having their first son, Albert, following the 2008 baby formula scandal in China. Modeled after [[Consumer Reports]] in the United States, MingJian aims to provide expert advice on products and services to Chinese consumers.

==Testing ==
MingJian utilizes partner laboratories located throughout the US and Europe to test products against international safety and quality standards. MingJian also uses [[mystery shopping]] to anonymously obtain samples for testing.

==Services ==
MingJian subscribers have access to full test results, catered monthly newsletters, and public forums with other members. In addition, MingJian provides a monthly Top 5 ranking of the best five performers in a wide range of product categories spanning electronics, cosmetics, and home goods.

==Campaigns ==

=== Child Restraints Save Kids Lives Campaign ''(2015)'' ===
On June 1, 2015 ([[Children's Day]]), MingJian launched the first half of its child safety campaign with ''Child Safety On-the-Go'', which based its message on testing of over 30 carseats from popular names in China and comparison models. ''On-the-Go'' was part of MingJian's long-term campaign for child safety in Chinese households, to be followed by six months of ''Child Safety in the Home'' initiatives.

The campaign announcement coincided with [http://www.savekidslives2015.org #SaveKidsLives], the 2015 theme of the United Nations' [[Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020|Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020]].

'''Near net shape''' is an industrial manufacturing technique. The name implies that the initial production of the item is very close to the final (net) shape, reducing the need for [[surface finishing]].   Reducing traditional finishing such as [[machining]] or [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] eliminates more than two-thirds of the production costs in some industries.

==Processes==
The following are various near-net-shape processes categorized by material.

===Ceramics===

*[[Ceramic injection molding]]
*[[Spray forming]]
*Structural [[ceramic]] production

Phiwa Nkambule was born in [[Manzini, Swaziland|Manzini]] where he also spent his childhood.&lt;ref name=PR20180503&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/swaziland/swazi-observer/20180503/281990378145647|title=Eswatini Born Entrepreneur Develops FinTech Platform|date=3 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.observer.org.sz/details.php?id=5348|title=First Liswati Makes it to Forbes List|website=new.observer.org.sz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, as a 14-year-old, he began fixing and building computers with his uncle in a small township in Swaziland.&lt;ref name=forbesafrica/&gt; Nkambule moved to South Africa in 2007 for academic purposes.&lt;ref name=PR20160709&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/swaziland/observer-on-saturday/20160709/281805693258766|title=Swazi Born Entrepreneur Making Waves in SA Insurance Industry|date=9 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phiwa was a [[law student]] at the [[University of Pretoria]] before quitting to start his first technology company [[Cybatar]] from his garage in 2014.&lt;ref name=themoneyfam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoneyfam.com/fintech-entrepreneur-peer-investing/|title=Why this 25 Year Old Fintech Entrepreneur Thinks Your Peers are Your Biggest Investments|date=18 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the university where he taught himself web and app development.&lt;ref name=forbesafrica/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8718">The '''Retail Banking Academy''' (RBA) is a UK-based educational body, founded with the objective of playing a leading role in the development and professionalisation of consumer-oriented [[retail banking]] around the world. It is the only educational and professional academy exclusively dedicated to retail banking anywhere in the world.
The RBA is the only international, educational and professional body that's exclusively dedicated to retail banking. 

The Certified Retail Banker ('''CRB''') programme makes it possible for retail bankers to embark on a structured certification programme that covers every aspect of the industry end to end. 
. The Retail Banking Academy has its headquarters in London, UK.

== History ==

The organisation was founded in London, UK in 2011 as the ''International Academy of Retail Banking'' with the objective of educating retail bankers worldwide to a high professional standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarb.org |title=International Academy of Retail Banking |publisher=iarb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It believes that a separated, independent retail banking sector should be led by professionally qualified retail bankers, bound by an ethical code &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d83d321e-94de-11e3-af71-00144feab7de.html |title=We believe retail banking should be ethics-based |publisher=FT.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to those already in place for accountants and lawyers. This ethical code &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/teaching-banks-to-value-trust-and-honesty-1.1673998?page=1 |title=Teaching banks to value trust and honesty - Financial Services News &amp;#124; Business News &amp;#124; The Irish Times - Fri, Jan 31, 2014 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intended to oblige retail bankers to act in the customer’s best interests. Bankers who persistently fail to comply would be barred from membership of the profession. To that end, the RBA believes that the foundation stone for a retail banking profession must be the complete separation of retail banking from both investment banking and large-scale corporate banking.

In 2012 the UK [http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/professional-standards-in-the-banking-industry/ Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards] accepted evidence from a number of participants operating in the banking sector.  The Retail Banking Academy was one of the participants, and its submission was included in selected submissions in its final published report, Changing Banking for Good,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/professional-standards-in-the-banking-industry/news/changing-banking-for-good-report/ |title=Banking Commission publishes report on changing banking for good - News from Parliament - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines the radical reform required to improve standards across the banking industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtpcbs/27/27v_we85.htm |title=House of Commons - Banking Standards: Written evidence from the International Academy of Retail Banking |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the organisation changed its name from the International Academy of Retail Banking to the Retail Banking Academy.

== Certifications ==

The RBA offers a large variety of programmes such as:

=== Certified Retail Banker (CRB) ===


The ''Certified Retail Banker programme'' was designed by senior retail bankers and academics from around the world.  Since 2011 the qualification strategy has evolved to grow with sector demands, for example, it was made available in the French language in 2012.
To become a Certified Retail Banker, and to be able to use the designation CRB, you need to join RBA Membership and successfully pass examinations at three separate levels.

*Retail Banking I (RB I)

Retail Banking I was designed to introduce candidates to the theoretical and practical core competencies that are required for success within a retail banking organisation. It is ideal for retail bankers looking to broaden their scope and banking knowledge. 

*Banking II (RB II)

Retail Banking II focuses on the issues that are encountered when leading people and retail banking departments. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to fast track their career and understand the key divisions/functions of a retail bank.

*Retail Banking III (RB III)

Retail Banking III focuses on developing and enhancing the capabilities required to run retail banking strategic business units. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to understand how different functions are brought together in one retail bank, and challenges associated to leadership.

=== Accelerated Programmes ===


The ''Accelerated Programmes'' have been created for experienced retail bankers with over 10 or 15 years experience, , which means that eligible candidates will be exempt from Retail Banking I exams (Accelerated 10) or exempt from Retail Banking I &amp; II (Accelerated 15) due to their extensive number of years working full-time in the sector. 
and renowned industry speakers are invited to lead thought-leadership discussion groups.

=== Certified Cards and Payments Professional ===


The ''Certified Cards and Payments Programme'' was launched in 2013 as a result of the introduction of an increasing number of new card payment methods to the market. CCPP certification is gained in the same way as the CRB certification above, with three levels of study and exams to pass. At that point in time, the programme was delivered as an in-bank classroom programme only.  

On the back of the success of the in-bank sessions, there are now first and second levels of the programme available for individual candidates to enrol on our site:

*Cards and Payments I

Cards and Payments I is a specialised programme that provides a broad overview and coverage of the entire lifecycle of all types of payments cards, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, corporate cards and mobile payments.
The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry. As a functional specialist you will gain an excellent understanding of other areas along with a strategic grasp of the industry which embraces international trends and best practices.

*Cards and Payments II

Cards and Payments II is a specialised programme focussed on the key areas of the Cards and Payments industry. The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry.

=== Executive Management Programme ===


For senior retail bankers with over 15 years of experience, the RBA also offers the Executive Management Programme that is hosted twice per year in London or Johannesburg. It's a three or five-day immersive programme for senior delegates, where a group our distinguished faculty deliver lectures, facilitate practical workshops

== Types of learning ==

=== ELearning ===

The Retail Banking Academy offers access to the CRB qualification via eLearning with a series of interactive modules and analytics solutions that continuously adapts to the candidates’ performance, facilitates critical reasoning and provides continuous coaching and feedback to help you become proficient at the core curriculum and enhance your retail banking training. 

=== Classroom (for in-bank programmes) ===

Programmes can also be tailored specifically to meet the needs of individual bank requirements, strategy and objectives with the in-bank programmes. Not only programmes can be bespoke, but can also be delivered by faculty staff in a classroom setting or via the e-learning platform, or in fact a combination of both types of learning.


== Governance ==

The Retail Banking Academy is governed by a board of directors, an academic standards board, an awarding organisation and its governing body. The board of directors is chaired by [[Michael Lafferty]] (chairman of Lafferty Group and a former [[Financial Times]] journalist). The academic director is Professor Abdul Rahman, a former full professor of economics and finance and Telfer teaching Fellow at the [[Telfer School of Management]], [[University of Ottawa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2866">[[Image:Teh Botol Sosro.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1974-present Teh Botol Sosro bottle]]
'''Teh Botol''' is a popular iconic [[Indonesia]]n drink produced by the company [[Sinar Sosro|Sosro]] and is sold worldwide. ''Teh Botol'' literally means ''bottled tea'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. It is a sweetened [[jasmine tea]] and it is usually served cold. In addition, Sosro also sells the tea in the [[Tetra Pak]] and [[plastic bottle]] packaging.

== History ==
The Sosro brand, a well-known tea brand in Indonesia, is taken from the Sosrodjojo (Souw Seng Kiam) family name, the owners of the company. They started the business of marketing [[jasmine tea]] based in [[Slawi]], a small town in [[Central Java]] province, in 1940. The first brand was called ''Teh Cap Botol'' ("bottle brand tea"). 

In 1965 the ''Cap Botol'' jasmine tea was first introduced to [[Jakarta]] by promoting the product with [[free sample]]s under the marketing name of ''cicip rasa''. During the free tasting promotion, the jasmine tea was brewed on the spot, but the time required for brewing was too long for some of their more impatient customers. To overcome this problem, the promotion staff brewed the tea in the office before going to the promotion location and poured the ready-to-consume jasmine tea into big pots and pans. However, this technique did not solve the problem; the tea in large pots and pans spilled over on the way before they reached the location. Another solution was found by placing the brewed jasmine tea in clean used glass bottles, which were normally used for packing soda, soy sauce and other products. It was successful and gave birth of the ''teh botol'' (or bottled tea) brand name in 1969. The official name was ''Teh Botol Sosro''.

The first bottles were introduced in 1970. In 1972, they redesigned the bottles. In 1974, with the establishment of PT, Sinar Sosro (a company producing the Teh Botol Sosro) in Ujung Menteng (part of [[Bekasi]] at that time) again redesigned the bottle which remains in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Profile|url=http://www.sinarsosro.id/en/about/corporate-profile|website=PT.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21137">In [[economics]] and related disciplines, a '''transaction cost''' is a [[cost]] in making any economic [[trade]] when participating in a [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fixglobal.com/home/buy-side-firms-use-tca-to-measure-execution-performance/ Buy-side Use TCA to Measure Execution Performance], FIXGlobal, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Transaction Costs, Institutions and Economic Performance'' (1992), [[Douglass C. North]] argues that [[institution]]s, understood as the set of rules in a society, are key in the determination of [[Financial transaction|transaction]] costs. In this sense, institutions that facilitate low transaction costs, boost [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;North, Douglass C. 1992. “Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance.” San Francisco, CA: ICS Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass North states that there are four factors that comprise transaction costs – "measurement," "enforcement," "ideological attitudes and perceptions," and "the size of the market."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Measurement'' refers to the calculation of the value of all aspects of the good or service involved in the transaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Enforcement'' can be defined as the need for an unbiased third party to ensure that neither party involved in the transaction reneges on their part of the deal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These first two factors appear in the concept of ''ideological attitudes and perceptions'', North's third aspect of transaction costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ideological attitudes and perceptions encapsulate each individual's set of values, which influences their interpretation of the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The final aspect of transaction costs, according to North, is ''market size'', which affects the partiality or impartiality of transactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transaction costs can be divided into three broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahlman|first=Carl J.|year=1979|title=The Problem of Externality|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=22|issue=1|pages=141–162|issn=0022-2186|quote=These, then, represent the first approximation to a workable concept of transaction costs: search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, policing and enforcement costs.|doi=10.1086/466936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Search cost|Search and information costs]]'' are costs such as in determining that the required good is available on the market, which has the lowest price, etc.
*''Bargaining costs'' are the costs required to come to an acceptable agreement with the other party to the transaction, drawing up an appropriate [[contract]] and so on. In [[game theory]] this is analyzed for instance in the [[game of chicken]]. On asset markets and in [[market microstructure]], the transaction cost is some function of the distance between the [[bid and ask]].
* ''Policing and enforcement costs'' are the costs of making sure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract, and taking appropriate action (often through the [[legal system]]) if this turns out not to be the case.

For example, the buyer of a used car faces a variety of different transaction costs. The search costs are the costs of finding a car and determining the car's condition. The bargaining costs are the costs of negotiating a price with the seller. The policing and enforcement costs are the costs of ensuring that the seller delivers the car in the promised condition.

== History of development ==

[[Image:Market-Hierarchy-Model.png|300px|right|thumb|The pool shows institutions and market as a possible form of organization to coordinate economic transactions. When the external transaction costs are higher than the internal transaction costs, the company will grow. If the internal transaction costs are higher than the external transaction costs the company will be downsized by outsourcing, for example.]]
The idea that transactions form the basis of an economic thinking was introduced by the [[Institutional economics|institutional economist]] [[John R. Commons]] (1931). He said that:

{{Quote|text=These individual actions are really trans-actions instead of either individual behavior or the "exchange" of commodities. It is this shift from commodities and individuals to transactions and working rules of collective action that marks the transition from the classical and hedonic schools to the institutional schools of economic thinking. The shift is a change in the ultimate unit of economic investigation. The classic and hedonic economists, with their communistic and anarchistic offshoots, founded their theories on the relation of man to nature, but institutionalism is a relation of man to man. The smallest unit of the classic economists was a commodity produced by labor. The smallest unit of the hedonic economists was the same or similar commodity enjoyed by ultimate consumers. One was the objective side, the other the subjective side, of the same relation between the individual and the forces of nature. The outcome, in either case, was the materialistic metaphor of an automatic equilibrium, analogous to the waves of the ocean, but personified as "seeking their level." But the smallest unit of the institutional economists is a unit of activity – a transaction, with its participants. Transactions intervene between the labor of the classic economists and the pleasures of the hedonic economists, simply because it is society that controls access to the forces of nature, and transactions are, not the "exchange of commodities," but the alienation and acquisition, between individuals, of the rights of property and liberty created by society, which must therefore be negotiated between the parties concerned before labor can produce, or consumers can consume, or commodities be physically exchanged".|sign=[[John R. Commons]]|source=''Institutional Economics'', American Economic Review, Vol.21, pp.648-657, 1931}}

The term "transaction cost" is frequently thought to have been coined by [[Ronald Coase]], who used it to develop a theoretical framework for predicting when certain economic tasks would be performed by [[business organizations|firms]], and when they would be performed on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. However, the term is actually absent from his early work up to the 1970s. While he did not coin the specific term, Coase indeed discussed "costs of using the price mechanism" in his 1937 paper ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'', where he first discusses the concept of transaction costs, and refers to the "Costs of Market Transactions" in his seminal work, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960). The term "Transaction Costs" itself can instead be traced back to the monetary economics literature of the 1950s, and does not appear to have been consciously 'coined' by any particular individual.&lt;ref name="Kissell"&gt;[[Robert Kissell]] and [[Morton Glantz]], ''Optimal Trading Strategies'', AMACOM, 2003, pp. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, transaction cost reasoning became most widely known through [[Oliver E. Williamson]]'s ''Transaction Cost Economics''. Today, transaction cost economics is used to explain a number of different behaviours. Often this involves considering as "transactions" not only the obvious cases of [[buying]] and [[selling]], but also day-to-day emotional interactions, informal [[gift]] exchanges, etc.  Oliver E. Williamson, one of the most cited social scientist at the turn of the century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pessali|first=Huascar F.|date=2006|title=The rhetoric of Oliver Williamson's transaction cost economics|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/rhetoric-of-oliver-williamsons-transaction-cost-economics/E6A68A5FE3FAC2025FDE68C7A41AA2FB|journal=Journal of Institutional Economics|volume=2|issue=1|pages=45–65|doi=10.1017/s1744137405000238|issn=1744-1382|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded the 2009 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Journal of Retailing in Honor of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009 to Oliver E. Williamson, Volume 86, Issue 3, Pages 209-290 (September 2010). Edited by [[Arne Nygaard]] and [[Robert Dahlstrom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Williamson, the determinants of transaction costs are frequency, [[Asset specificity|specificity]], uncertainty, limited rationality, and opportunistic behavior.

At least two definitions of the phrase "transaction cost" are commonly used in literature.  Transaction costs have been broadly defined by [[Steven N. S. Cheung]] as any costs that are not conceivable in a "[[Robinson Crusoe]] economy"—in other words, any costs that arise due to the existence of [[institution]]s.  For Cheung, if the term "transaction costs" were not already so popular in economics literatures, they should more properly be called "institutional costs".&lt;ref name="Cheung"&gt;Steven N. S. Cheung "On the New Institutional Economics", ''Contract Economics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werin"&gt;L. Werin and H. Wijkander (eds.), Basil Blackwell, 1992, pp. 48-65&lt;/ref&gt;  But many economists seem to restrict the definition to exclude costs internal to an organization.&lt;ref name="Demsetz"&gt;[[Harold Demsetz]] (2003) “Ownership and the Externality Problem.” In T. L. Anderson and F. S. McChesney (eds.) Property Rights: Cooperation, Conflict, and Law. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter definition parallels Coase's early analysis of "costs of the price mechanism" and the origins of the term as a market trading fee.

Starting with the broad definition, many economists then ask what kind of institutions (firms, markets, [[Franchising|franchise]]s, etc.) minimize the transaction costs of producing and distributing a particular good or service. Often these relationships are categorized by the kind of [[contract]] involved.  This approach sometimes goes under the rubric of [[New Institutional Economics]].

== Examples ==
A supplier may bid in a very competitive environment with a customer to build a [[widget (economics)|widget]].  However, to make the widget, the supplier will be required to build specialized machinery which cannot be easily redeployed to make other products.  Once the contract is awarded to the supplier, the relationship between customer and supplier changes from a competitive environment to a [[monopoly]]/[[monopsony]] relationship, known as a [[bilateral monopoly]].  This means that the customer has greater leverage over the supplier such as when price cuts occur.  To avoid these potential costs, "hostages" may be swapped to avoid this event.  These hostages could include partial ownership in the widget factory; revenue sharing might be another way.

Car companies and their suppliers often fit into this category, with the car companies forcing price cuts on their suppliers.  Defense suppliers and the military appear to have the opposite problem, with cost overruns occurring quite often. Technologies like [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) can provide technical support for these strategies.

An example of measurement, one of North's four factors of transaction costs, is detailed in Mancur Olson's work ''Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development'' (1993) – Olson writes that roving bandits calculate the success of their banditry based on how much money they can take from their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=September 1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|pages=567–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement, the second of North's factors of transaction costs, is exemplified in Diego Gambetta's book ''The Sicilian Mafia: the Business of Private Protection'' (1996). Gambetta describes the concept of the “Peppe,” who occupies the role of mediator in dealings with the Sicilian mafia – the Peppe is needed because it is not certain that both parties will maintain their end of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sicilian Mafia: the Business of Private Protection|last=Gambetta|first=Diego|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0674807426|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement and enforcement comprise North's third factor, ideological attitudes and perceptions – each individual's views influence how they go about each transaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Differences from neoclassical microeconomics ==

Williamson argues in ''The Mechanisms of Governance'' (1996) that Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) differs from [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical microeconomics]] in the following points:

==  Game theory ==
In game theory, transaction costs have been studied by Anderlini and Felli (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderlini|first=Luca|last2=Felli|first2=Leonardo|date=2006|title=Transaction Costs and the Robustness of the Coase Theorem*|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01054.x|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=116|issue=508|pages=223–245|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01054.x|issn=1468-0297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consider a model with two parties who together can generate a surplus. Both parties are needed to create the surplus. Yet, before the parties can negotiate about dividing the surplus, each party must incur transaction costs. Anderlini and Felli find that transaction costs cause a severe problem when there is a mismatch between the parties’ bargaining powers and the magnitude of the transaction costs. In particular, if a party has large transaction costs but in future negotiations it can seize only a small fraction of the surplus (i.e., its bargaining power is small), then this party will not incur the transaction costs and hence the total surplus will be lost. It has been shown that the presence of transaction costs as modelled by Anderlini and Felli can overturn central insights of the Grossman-Hart-Moore [[theory of the firm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Daniel|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2016|title=Transaction costs and the property rights approach to the theory of the firm|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.04.013|journal=European Economic Review|volume=87|pages=92–107|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.04.013|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2016|title=The negotiators who knew too much: Transaction costs and incomplete information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2016.05.009|journal=Economics Letters|volume=145|pages=33–37|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2016.05.009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yorkville Records''' was a Canadian [[record label]] formed in 1966. The label, which itself was a subsidiary of the larger [[Arc Records (Canada)|Arc Records]], was founded by Arc Records president Bill Gilliland and supervisor Fred White, originally under the name '''Yorktown Records'''. Initially, the record label almost exclusively distributed recordings by the [[garage rock]] band [[the Ugly Ducklings]], which resulted in a string of national hits, including "Nothin'", "10:30 Train", and "She Ain't No Use to Me".&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol6000.com/yorktown.html|title=The Yorktown and Yorkville Discography|website=capitol6000.com|author=Hemmingsen, Pier|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/m/article/arc-records-emc/|title=Arc Records|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedexposure.com/Labels/YORKTOWN.RECORDS.CANADA.html|title=Yorkville Records (Canada)|website=forcedexposure.com|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Yorktown migrated to Yorkville Records in late 1966, the company signed more musical artists, first earning a minor hit with the Stitch of Tyme's [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]". Yorkville Records is considered the only record company established in Canada to dedicate its efforts specifically on material rooted in the musical genre of [[psychedelic rock]], releasing additional records by [[the Quiet Jungle]], [[the Sugar Shoppe]], and Willapuss, among others. Additionally, Yorkville released several [[compilation album]]s such as ''Yorkville Evolution'' and ''After Four''. The label remained active until 1971.&lt;ref name=york/&gt;

Music historian Piers A. Hemmingsen attributed the collectibility of Yorkville's catalogue to "The bright colours of the label and the unique collection of artists make this a label that record collectors love".&lt;ref name=york/&gt;
