      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">The '''AB magnitude''' system is an [[Magnitude (astronomy)|astronomical magnitude]] system. Unlike many other magnitude systems, it is based on flux measurements that are calibrated in absolute units, namely [[spectral flux density|spectral flux densities]].

== Definition ==

The ''monochromatic'' AB magnitude is defined as the logarithm of a [[spectral flux density]] with the usual scaling of astronomical magnitudes and a zero-point of about 3631 [[Jansky]],&lt;ref name=refAB83&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oke |first=J. B. |date=1983 |title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=266 |pages=713–717 |bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O |doi=10.1086/160817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where 1 Jansky = 1 Jy = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; W Hz&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;23&lt;/sup&gt; erg s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; ("about" because the true definition of the zero point is based on magnitudes as shown below). If the spectral flux density is denoted ''f&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'', the monochromatic AB magnitude is:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{3631\text{ Jy}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{\text{Jy}}\right) + 8.90.&lt;/math&gt;

This exact definition is defined in magnitudes relative to the [[cgs]] units of erg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} = -2.5 \log_{10} f_{\nu} - 48.60.&lt;/math&gt;

Inverting this leads to the true definition of the numerical value "3631 Jy" often cited:

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\nu,0} =  10^{\frac{48.60}{-2.5}} \approx 3631 \times 10^{-23}&lt;/math&gt;



Actual measurements are always made across some continuous range of wavelengths. The ''bandpass'' AB magnitude is defined so that the zero point corresponds to a bandpass-averaged spectral flux density of about 3631 [[Jansky]]:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} \approx  -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{\int f_\nu (h\nu)^{-1} e(\nu) d\nu}{\int 3631\text{ Jy} (h\nu)^{-1} e(\nu) d\nu}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e(ν)'' is the "equal-energy" filter response function and the ''(hν)''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; term assumes that the detector is a photon-counting device such as a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[photomultiplier]].&lt;ref name=refPS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tonry |first=J. L. |date=2012 |title=The Pan-STARRS1 Photometric System |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=750 |pages=99 |bibcode=2012ApJ...750...99T
 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/99 |arxiv = 1203.0297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Filter responses are sometimes expressed as quantum efficiencies, that is, in terms of their response per photon, rather than per unit energy. In those cases the ''(hν)''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; term has been folded into the definition of e(ν) and should not be included.)

The STMAG system is similarly defined, but for constant flux per unit wavelength interval instead.

AB stands for "absolute" in the sense that no relative reference object is used (unlike using [[Vega#Observation history|Vega]] as a baseline object).&lt;ref name=refAB74&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oke |first=J. B. |date=1974 |title=Absolute spectral energy distributions for white dwarfs |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=236 |issue=27|pages=21–25 |bibcode=
1974ApJS...27...21O |doi = 10.1086/190287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must not be confused with [[absolute magnitude]] in the sense of the apparent brightness of an object if seen from a distance of 10pc.

== Expression in terms of f&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ==

In some fields, [[spectral flux density|spectral flux densities]] are expressed per unit wavelength, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than per unit frequency, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;. At any specific wavelength,

:&lt;math&gt;f_\nu = \frac{\lambda^2}{c} f_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; is measured per frequency (e.g., Hertz), and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is measured per wavelength (e.g., cm). If the wavelength unit is [[Ångstrom]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_\nu}{\text{Jy}} = 3.34 \times 10^4 \left(\frac{\lambda}{\AA}\right)^2 \frac{f_\lambda}{\text{erg} \text{ cm}^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1} \AA^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can then be plugged into the equations above.

The “pivot wavelength” of a given bandpass is the value of λ that makes the above conversion exact for observations made in that bandpass. For an equal-energy response function as defined above, it is &lt;ref name=TV05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokunaga|first=A. T.|author2=Vacca|title=The Mauna Kea Observatories Near‐Infrared Filter Set. III. Isophotal Wavelengths and Absolute Calibration|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2005PASP..117..421T&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= |date=April 2005|volume=117|issue=830|pages=421–426|doi=10.1086/429382|accessdate=25 February 2014|arxiv = astro-ph/0502120 |bibcode = 2005PASP..117..421T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{piv} = \sqrt{\frac{\int e(\lambda) d\lambda}{\int e(\lambda) \lambda^{-2} d\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a response function expressed in the quantum-efficiency convention, it is:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{piv} = \sqrt{\frac{\int e(\lambda) \lambda d\lambda}{\int e(\lambda) \lambda^{-1} d\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Conversion from other magnitude systems ==

Magnitudes in the AB system can be converted to other systems. However, because all magnitude systems involve integration of some assumed source spectrum over some assumed passband, such conversions are not necessarily trivial to calculate, and precise conversions depend on the actual spectrum of the source in question. Various authors have computed conversions for standard situations.&lt;ref name=refBR07&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanton |first=M. R. |date=2007 |title=K-Corrections and Filter Transformations in the Ultraviolet, Optical, and Near-Infrared |journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]] |volume=133 |issue=2|pages=734–754 |bibcode=2007AJ....133..734B |doi=10.1086/510127 |arxiv = astro-ph/0606170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23358">The term '''abjection''' literally means "the state of being cast off." The term has been explored in [[post-structuralism]] as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is [[Julia Kristeva]]'s (pursued particularly in her work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''). Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and what is [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self from that which immediately threatens one's sense of life. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death.

The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what "is not me."

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in [[misogyny]], [[misandry]], [[homophobia]], and [[genocide]]. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012) p. 92; Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as grounded in "filth" (e.g., psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reason{{snd}}the communal consensus that underpins a social order.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection'' (1982)m p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The "abject" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] and the concept of the subject, representing [[taboo]] elements of the self barely separated off in a [[Liminality|liminal]] space.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subject{{snd}}a part of oneself{{snd}}and object{{snd}}something that exists independently of oneself{{snd}}there resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejected{{snd}}the abject.

It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: it is not the lack of "cleanliness or health" that causes abjection, but that which disturbs identity, system, and order.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror", p. 4; Guberman, "Julia Kristeva Interviews", (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abject is situated outside the [[symbolic order]], being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpse{{snd}}an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10269033/-Kristeva-Abjection-Short-Version Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the [[superego]]{{snd}}the representative of culture, of the symbolic order:&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kristeva's aphorism, "To each ego its object, to each superego its abject".&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law". We use [[ritual]]s, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of [[The Uncanny (Freud)|the uncanny]], the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanniness&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Menninghaus, ''Disgust'' (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}creates a [[cognitive dissonance]].

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (Journal du Voleur) by French author [[Jean Genet]], a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an [[existentialist]] form of 'sainthood'&lt;ref&gt;Gene A. Plunka, ''The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet'' (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Creed]], ''The Monstrous Feminine'' (1993), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the [[primal scene]], and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 17 and p. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre [[grunge lit]] often focuses on young adult characters with "abject" bodies &lt;ref&gt;Gelder K. and Salzman P. ''After the celebration: Australian fiction 1989–2007''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in [[Andrew McGahan]]'s book ''[[Praise]]'', Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes'  ''Drift Street'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "limnal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "limnality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social critical theory==
"Abjection" is often used to describe the state of often-[[marginalized]] groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Outcasts''. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salih|first1=Sara|title=Judth Butler|date=2002|page=63|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Salih-Butler-Performativity-Chapter_3.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===In organizational studies===
[[Organizational theory]] literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms "the one by whom the abject exists," or "the deject" people.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers of Horror", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the [[semiotic]], both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a "zone of inhabitability" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of "collective instruction," which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient "dark side" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson, "Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side" (2014), p. 281–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is created{{snd}}for example, a corporation's or organization's [[mission statement]]. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This [[spin (public relations)|spun meaning]] developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.&lt;ref&gt;Risq, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Imogen Tyler&lt;ref&gt;"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain" (2013), p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of people{{snd}}mostly minority groups{{snd}}as revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

There has also been exploration done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances&lt;ref&gt;"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling" (2014), p. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'{{snd}}an object that can be ignored{{snd}}or that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014), p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the other{{snd}}actual, imagined or fantasized{{snd}}is central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker&lt;ref&gt;"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body part{{snd}}it has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a whole{{snd}}whether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, Ussher &amp; Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014); Parker, "Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014); Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

==In art==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which "explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety[,] particularly referencing the body and bodily functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art |title=Abject Art |work=[[Tate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the [[Dada]] movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]''. The [[Whitney Museum]] in [[New York City]] identified abject art in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Hal. "Obscene, abject, traumatic." October (1996): 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kutzbach, Konstanze | author2=Mueller, Monika | title=The abject of desire : the aestheticization of the unaesthetic in contemporary literature and culture | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=978-90-420-2264-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the films and performances of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese actionists]], in particular, [[Hermann Nitsch]], whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the [[Orgien-Mysterien-Theater]]. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], [[Gunter Brus]], who began as a painter, and [[Otto Muehl]] collaborated on performances. The performances of [[Gunter Brus]] involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. [[Rudolf Schwarzkogler]] is known for his photos dealing with the abject.  
In the late 1960s, [[performance art]] become popular in New York, including by [[Carolee Schneemann]]. [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Genesis P. Orridge]] and [[GG Allin]] did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', the title of a book by [[Julia Kristeva]], led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including [[Ron Athey]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]]. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis{{snd}}an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, "'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny" (2011); Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and [[Yang Zhichao]]. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Kiki Smith]] and [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art "Abject Art"] Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, [[Joel Peter Witkin]], whose book ''[[Love and Redemption]]'' and [[Andres Serrano]] whose piece entitled ''[[Piss Christ]]'' caused a scandal in 1989.

As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum.

Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to [[religion and homosexuality|religious prohibitions]]. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the [[Reproduction|procreative]] purpose of sexual activity.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt; It may be regarded as [[taboo]] or unnatural, and is a [[Crime|criminal offense]] in some countries, punishable by [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt; By contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their [[Sex life|sex lives]] or as their primary form of sexual activity.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt;

The abundance of [[Nerve|nerve endings]] in the anal region and [[rectum]] can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women.&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal]] and [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external]] [[sphincter]] muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The ''Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia'' states that "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" and that "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;

Research indicates that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors,&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; but its association with [[dominance and submission]], as well as [[taboo]], makes it an appealing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] to people of all [[sexual orientation]]s.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite book|author =Joann S.

The anal sphincters are usually tighter than the [[pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] of the vagina, which can enhance the sexual pleasure for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt;

While some women find being a receptive partner during anal intercourse painful or uncomfortable, or only engage in the act to please a male sexual partner, other women find the activity pleasurable or prefer it to [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]].&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;{{cite book| author = Adrian Howe | title = Sex, Violence and Crime: Foucault and the 'Man' Question| publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2008 | page = 35 | accessdate = July 16, 2013 |isbn = 0203891279| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W6aoQfurvT4C&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alters and Schiff"&gt;{{cite book| author = Sandra Alters| author2 = Wendy Schiff | title = Essential Concepts for Healthy Living| publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2012 | page = 144 | accessdate = July 16, 2013 |isbn = 1449630626| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VegUiVbruBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, ''anal intercourse'' is used to specifically denote penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' is used to denote any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that "for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex".&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The likelihood of [[pregnancy]] occurring&lt;!-- NOTE: This paragraph, including this line, relates to practice far more than it does to health, so it seemingly fits better here than in the Health risks section. --&gt; during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of [[Birth control|contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171231103438/http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not tear the [[hymen]]; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss. This is sometimes called ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11 here] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 pages 48–49] for the majority of researchers and heterosexuals defining virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Carpenter stated that this view "dates to the late 1600s, with explicit 'rules' appearing around the turn of the twentieth century, as in marriage manuals defining petting as 'literally every caress known to married couples but does not include complete sexual intercourse.'"&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;

===Prevalence===

Because most research on anal intercourse addresses [[men who have sex with men]], little data exists on the prevalence of anal intercourse among heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book |authors =Hardin L.K. Coleman, Christine Yeh|title =Handbook of School Counseling|isbn = 1135283591|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|page=247|accessdate=December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBiPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt; The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt; The review added that because "relatively little attention [is] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners", this means that it is "quite rare" to have research "that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus."&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;

According to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in anal intercourse less commonly than men. Vaginal intercourse was practiced more than insertive anal intercourse among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive anal intercourse.&lt;ref name="Carroll 2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Janell L. Carroll| title = Discovery Series: Human Sexuality| edition = 1st | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|pages=285–286| isbn = 1111841896|year=2012| accessdate = December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC&amp;pg=PT316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University. ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to adolescents, limited data also exists. This may be because of the taboo nature of anal sex and that teenagers and caregivers subsequently avoid talking to one another about the topic. It is also common for subject review panels and schools to avoid the subject.  A 2000 study found that 22.9% of college students who self-identified as non-virgins had anal sex.  They used condoms during anal sex 20.9% of the time as compared with 42.9% of the time with vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

Anal sex being more common among heterosexuals today than it was previously has been linked to the increase in consumption of anal pornography among men, especially among those who view it on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johansson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidman"&gt;{{cite book|title =Introducing the New Sexuality Studies|edition =2nd|author=Steven Seidman|author2=Nancy Fischer|author3=Chet Meeks|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|pages=108–112|isbn=1136818103|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rmjynItoEkC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seidman et al. argued that "cheap, accessible and, especially, interactive media have enabled many more people to produce as well as consume pornography", and that this modern way of producing pornography, in addition to the buttocks and anus having become more eroticized, has led to a significant interest in or obsession with anal sex among men.&lt;ref name="Seidman"/&gt;

Reports regarding the prevalence of anal sex among gay men and other men who have sex with men vary. A survey in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Behaviors of U.S. Men by Self-Identified Sexual Orientation: Results From the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior|author1=Brian Dodge|author2=et al.|year=2016|journal=J Sex Med|volume=13|pages=37e649|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.01.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during [[intercrural sex]] or other [[Sex position#Genital-genital rubbing|genital-genital rubbing]]) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).

Because of this, men who have sex with men have a high risk of this cancer."&lt;ref name="Anal cancer"/&gt;

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common literary convention, represented as taking place with "eligible" youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him; Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced male-female anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.|year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception | doi=10.1163/1568536952613631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse (''paedicatio'' in [[Latin]]) was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or un[[chastity]]); free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young male slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to "take it like a woman" (muliebria pati, "to undergo womanly things") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|title =Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought.

The term ''[[buggery]]'' originated in [[medieval]] Europe as an insult used to describe the rumored same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomilism|bogomils]]'';&lt;ref name="McKean"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[New Oxford American Dictionary]], 2nd edition |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-517077-6 |editor=Erin McKean}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they spread out of the country, they were called ''buggres'' (from the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgars'').&lt;ref name="McKean"/&gt; Another term for the practice, more archaic, is ''pedicate'' from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pedicare'', with the same meaning.&lt;ref name="Pollini"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollini|first=John|title =The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver | journal = [[BJUI]] | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–52 |date=March 1999 | doi = 10.1080/00043079.1999.10786870|quote="I have derived the word pedicate from the Latin paedicare or pedicare, meaning "to penetrate anally."

====Hinduism====
{{See also|History of sex in India|LGBT topics and Hinduism}}

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and [[third gender]]s as a variation of male-female sex (meaning a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analyzed in western terms). Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc. (the various forms of third gender that exist in India today) are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. However, sexuality between males (as distinct from third genders) has thrived, mostly unspoken and informally, without being seen as different in the way it is seen in the west; young men involved in "such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "Indian culture is highly homosocial and displays of affection, body contact and the sharing of beds between men is socially acceptable (Kahn, 1994) This creates opportunities for sexual contact, though sexual behavior in this context is rarely seen as real sex, but as play. Much of this same-sex sexual activity begins in adolescence between school friends and within family environments and is non-penetrative... Young men who cultivate such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Covent Garden 1762.gif|thumb|right|240px|A theatrical riot at Covent Garden's Royal Theatre in 1762 over a rumored increase in ticket prices. Although drama declined in the Augustan era, it was still popular entertainment.]]

'''''Augustan drama''''' can refer to the [[drama]]s of [[Ancient Rome]] during the reign of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], but it most commonly refers to the [[English drama|plays of Great Britain]] in the early 18th century, a subset of 18th-century [[Augustan literature]]. King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] referred to himself as "Augustus," and the poets of the era took this reference as apropos, as the [[Latin literature|literature of Rome]] during Augustus moved from historical and didactic poetry to the poetry of highly finished and sophisticated [[Epic poetry|epic]]s and [[satire]].

In [[poetry]], the early 18th century was an age of [[satire]] and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the developing [[novel]]. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful [[Restoration comedy]], the pathetic [[she-tragedy]] of the turn of the 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and what it meant to be [[gentry]]: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve.

Augustan drama has a reputation as an era of decline. One reason for this is that there were few dominant figures of the Augustan stage. Instead of a single genius, a number of playwrights worked steadily to find subject matter that would appeal to a new audience. In addition to this, playhouses began to dispense with playwrights altogether or to hire playwrights to match assigned subjects, and this made the producer the master of the script. When the public did tire of anonymously authored, low-content plays and a new generation of [[wit]]s made the stage political and aggressive again, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry stepped in and began official [[censorship]] that put an end to daring and innovative content. This conspired with the public's taste for [[special effects]] to reduce theatrical output and promote the novel.

==The middle-class tragedy==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy}}
As for prose and poetry, there is no clear beginning to the "Augustan era" in drama, but the end is clearly marked. Augustan-era drama ended definitively in 1737 with the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]]. Prior to 1737, the English stage was changing rapidly from [[Restoration comedy]] and [[Restoration drama]] and their noble subjects to the quickly developing [[melodrama]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:R-Steele.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Richard Steele]], collaborator of [[Joseph Addison]]'s and author of ''The Conscious Lovers'']] --&gt;
[[George Lillo]] and [[Richard Steele]] wrote the trend-setting plays of the early Augustan period. Lillo's plays consciously turned from heroes and kings toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale rather than a national scale, and the ''[[hamartia]]'' and ''[[agon]]'' in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sin]]. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and [[repentance]]. Steele's ''The Conscious Lovers'' (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a [[duel]]. These plays set up a new set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and ennoble it. Further, the plays were popular precisely because they seemed to reflect the audience's own lives and concerns.

[[Joseph Addison]] also wrote a play entitled ''Cato'' in 1713, but it did not inspire followers. ''Cato'' concerned the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Cato the Younger|statesman]] who opposed [[Julius Caesar]]. The year of its première is important for understanding why the play is unique, for [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was seriously ill at the time, and both the [[Tory]] ministry of the day and the Whig opposition (already led by [[Robert Walpole]]) were concerned about the succession. Both groups were in contact with Anne's exiled brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]. Londoners sensed this anxiety, for Anne had no surviving children; all of the closest successors in the [[House of Stuart|Stuart family]] were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Therefore, the figure of Cato was a transparent symbol of Roman integrity. The Whigs saw in him a Whig refusal to accept an [[Divine Right of Kings|absolute monarch]] from the House of Stuart, while the Tories saw in him a resistance to rule by a triumphant general ([[John Churchill]], the Duke of Marlborough, whose wife Sarah was rumored to control Anne). Further, Cato's claim that Caesar profited by illegal war echoed the Tory accusations against Marlborough. Both sides cheered the play, even though Addison was himself clearly Whig and had meant the play as something near [[propaganda]]. [[John Home]]'s play ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' (1756) would have a similar fate to ''Cato'' in the next generation after the [[Licensing Act]].

==The problem of "Spectacle"==
[[Image:Rich-Covent-Garden.jpg|thumb|left|260px|"Rich's Glory": [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] takes control of Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. The first play he would stage was ''[[The Way of the World]]''.]]
As during the Restoration, economic reality drove the stage during the Augustan period. Under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] court patronage meant economic success, and therefore the Restoration stage featured plays that would suit the monarch and/or court. The drama that celebrated kings and told the history of Britain's monarchs was fit fare for the crown and courtiers. Charles II was a philanderer, and so Restoration comedy featured a highly sexualized set of plays.  However, after the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], the court and crown stopped taking a great interest in the playhouse. Theaters had to get their money from the audience of city dwellers, therefore, and consequently plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens were the ones to draw crowds. The aristocratic material from the Restoration continued to be mounted, and adaptations of [[Tudor period|Tudor]] plays were made and ran, but the ''new'' plays that were authored and staged were the domestic- and middle-class dramas. The other dramatic innovation was "[[spectacle]]": plays that had little or no text, but which emphasized novel special effects.

===Pantomime and tableau spectacle===
The public attended when they saw their lives represented on the stage, but also attended when there was a sight that would impress them.  If costumes were lavish, the sets impressive or the actresses alluring, audiences would attend.  The [[Restoration spectacular]] had seen the development of English opera and [[oratorio]] and a war between competing theaters to produce the most expensive and eye-popping plays.  However, these [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] productions could mean financial ruin as much as security, and neither of the two main playhouses could continue the [[brinksmanship]] for long.  After these battles between the playhouses, and these were multiple,&lt;ref&gt;Shesgreen 27&lt;/ref&gt; the theaters calculatingly sought the highest appeal with the lowest cost.  If the cost of ''rehearsal'' time, in particular, could be shortened, the theater's investment would be reduced.  Rehearsal time cost a playhouse its cast, its property masters, and its stages, and a long rehearsal meant fewer plays put on.  Additionally, dramatists received the money from each third night of box office, and this could be dangerous to a house that needed every farthing to defray costs.  Star dramatists could negotiate for more than one benefit night and might have terms for benefits on revival, while new, unknown, or dependent authors could be managed.  The solution for the theatrical producers was to cut the costs of plays and actors while increasing the outright spectacle, and there were quite a few plays that were not literary at all that were staged more often than the literary plays.
[[File:Hogarth-rehearsal (2).png|thumb|right|200px|A print by [[William Hogarth]] entitled ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' from 1724 depicting the managers of [[Drury Lane]] ([[Robert Wilks]], [[Colley Cibber]], and [[Barton Booth]]) rehearsing a play consisting of nothing but special effects, while they used the scripts for ''The Way of the World'', ''inter al.'', for toilet paper.  This battle of effects was a common subject of satire for the literary wits, including [[Alexander Pope|Pope]].]]

[[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] and [[Colley Cibber]] dueled over special theatrical effects.  They put on plays that were actually just spectacles, where the text of the play was almost an afterthought.  Dragons, whirlwinds, thunder, ocean waves, and even actual elephants were on stage.  Battles, explosions, and horses were put on the boards (Cibber).  Rich specialized in [[pantomime]] and was famous as the character "Lun" in [[harlequin]] presentations.  The playwrights of these works were hired men, not dramatists, and so they did not receive the traditional third-night author's profits.  A pantomime, after all, required very little in the way of a playwright and much more in the way of a director, and with John Rich and Colley Cibber both acting as star players and directors, such on-demand spectacles did not necessitate a poet.  Further, spectacles could be written quickly to answer to the public's whims or the rival theater's triumphs, rarely risked offensive political statements, and did not require paying benefits to a playwright.  In other words, they gave the managers more profit.  The plays put on in this manner are not generally preserved or studied, but their near monopoly on the theaters, particularly in the 1720s, infuriated established literary authors.  Alexander Pope was only one of the poets to attack "spectacle" (in the 1727 ''[[Dunciad|Dunciad A]]'' and, with more vigor, the ''Dunciad B'').  The criticism was so widespread that Colley Cibber himself made excuses for his part in the special-effects war, claiming that he had no choice but to comply with market pressures.

===The "chromatic tortures" and divas of opera===
If vacant, subliterary spectacles were not enough of a threat to dramatists, [[opera]], which had crossed over to England in the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]], experienced an enormous surge in popularity with [[Italian opera|Italian]] [[grand opera]] in England in the 1710s and 1720s.  In ''[[The Spectator]]'', both in number 18 and the 3 April 1711 number, and many places elsewhere, [[Joseph Addison]] fretted that foreign opera would drive English drama from the stage altogether. These early fears followed the sudden rage for the Italian singers and operas that took over London in 1711 with the arrival of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].  Inasmuch as opera combined singing with acting, it was a mixed genre, and its violation of [[neo-classicism|neoclassical]] strictures had made it a controversial form from the start.  Addison, damning opera's heterogeny, wrote, "Our Countrymen could not forbear laughing when they heard a Lover chanting out a Billet-doux, and even the Superscription of a Letter set to a Tune."&lt;ref&gt;Addison, Joseph ; Steele, Richard. "The Spectator", 1853. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of opera not only took up theatrical rehearsal time and space, it also took away dramatic subject matter.  Straight playwrights were at a loss.  As John Gay lamented (see below), no one could use music in a play unless it was as an opera, and Englishmen were nearly forbidden from that.  To add insult to injury, the casts and celebrated stars were foreigners and, as with [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]] (the latter of whom was paid two thousand pounds for a single season in 1721), [[castrati]].  Castrati were symbols, to the English, of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The satirists saw in opera the ''non plus ultra'' of invidiousness.  High melodies would cover the singers' expressions of grief or joy, conflating all emotion and sense under a tune that might be entirely unrelated.  [[Alexander Pope]] blasted this shattering of "decorum" and "sense" in ''Dunciad B'' and suggested that its real purpose was to awaken the Roman Catholic Church's power ("Wake the dull Church") while it put a stop to the political and satirical stage and made all Londoners fall into the sleep of un-Enlightenment:

:::Joy to Chaos! let Division reign:
:::Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them [the muses] hence,
:::Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense:
:::One Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage,
:::Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage;
:::To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore,
:::And all thy yawning daughters cry, ''encore.'' (IV 55–60)

[[Image:Dukes-theater-1671.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 1875 [[postcard]] from the [[Victoria and Albert Hall]] showing the Duke's Company theatre in [[Dorset Gardens]] (the so-called "machine house") in operation from 1671 to 1709, which began as a playhouse and gradually became a house for [[spectacle]].]]
Furthermore, grand opera had a high degree of spectacle in it.  In the 17th century, when opera first came to England, it prompted enormously complex theatrical stagings to present illusions of [[ghost]]s, mythological figures, and epic battles.  When Handel's arrival in England spurred a new vogue for English opera, it also caused a new vogue for imported opera, no matter the content, so long as it would create an enormous visual impact.  Although some of the "Tory Wits" like Pope and [[John Gay]] wrote opera [[libretto]]s (the two combining for ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' with Handel), opera was a spectacular form of theater that left too little room for dramatic acting for most of the playwrights.  Pope argued in ''The Dunciad'' that Handel's operas were "masculine" in comparison to Italian and French opera.  While this is a musical commentary, it is also a commentary on the amount of decoration and frippery put on the stage, on the way that Handel's operas concentrated on their stories and music rather than their theatrical effects.

It was not merely the fact that such operas drove out original drama, but also that the antics and vogue for the singers took away all else, seemingly, that infuriated English authors.  The singers (particularly the [[soprano]]s) introduced London to the concept of the [[prima donna]], in both senses of the term.  In 1727, two Italian sopranos, [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] and [[Faustina Bordoni]], had such a rivalry and hatred of each other (the latter had been paid more than the former) that the audiences were encouraged to support their favorite singer by hissing her rival, and during a performance of ''Astyanax'' in 1727, the two women actually began to fight on stage (Loughrey 13).  John Gay wrote to [[Jonathan Swift]] on 3 February 1723:
 
::There's nobody allow'd to say I sing but an Eunuch or an Italian Woman. Every body is grown now as great a judge of Musick as they were in your time of Poetry &amp; folks that could not distinguish one tune from another now daily dispute over different Styles of Handel, [[Bononcini]], and [[Aitillio]].  People have now forgot [[Homer]], and [[Virgil]] &amp; [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].

These operas were spectaculars in every sense.  The personalities of the stars were before the stage, the stars were before the music, and the music before the words.  Additionally, opera brought with it new stage machines and effects.  Even Handel, whom Pope values as restrained and sober, had his heroine brought on stage by "two huge Dragons out of whose mouths issue Fire and Smoke" in ''Rinaldo'' in 1711.

The "problem" of spectacle continued in the 1720s and 1730s.  In 1734, [[Henry Fielding]] has his tragedian, [[Fustian]], describe the horror of a pantomime show:

::intimating that after the audience had been tired with the dull works of Shakespeare, Jonson, [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]], and others, they are to be entertained with one of these pantomimes, of which the master of the playhouse, two or three painters, and half a score dancing-masters are the compilers.  ...I have often wondered how it was possible for any creature of human understanding, after having been diverted for three hours with the production of a great genius, to sit for three more and see a set of people running about the stage after one another, without speaking one syllable, and playing several juggling tricks, which are done at Fawks's after a much better manner; and for this, sir, the town does not only pay additional prices, but loses several fine parts of its best authors, which are cut out to make room for the said farces.  (''[[Pasquin]]'', V i.)

Fustian complains as well that authors are denied stagings because of these entertainments, and, as well, that playhouse managers would steal plays from their authors.  As Fustian says earlier, a playwright could spend four months trying to get a manager's attention and then "he tells you it won't do, and returns it to you again, reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime" (''Pasquin'' IV i.).

==The reemergence of satirical drama, and the Licensing Act==
Toward the end of the 1720s, the behavior of opera stars, the absurdity of spectacle productions, and an escalation of political warfare between the two parties led to a reclamation of the stage by political dramatists.  During the later years of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who favored Robert Walpole, there was a scramble for the favor of the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], his wife, and his mistress, and this combined with a shattering of public confidence in the government after the [[South Sea Bubble]] and revelations of corruption in the trial of [[Jonathan Wild]], [[Charles Hitchen]], the Earl of Macclesfield, and others.

===John Gay and comic inversion===
John Gay parodied the opera with his satirical ''[[The Beggar's Opera|Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728) and with it delivered a [[satire]] of [[Robert Walpole]]'s actions during the [[South Sea Bubble]].  Superficially, the play is about a man named Macheath who runs a gang for a criminal fence named Peachum, whose daughter, Polly Peachum, is in love with him, and who escapes prison over and over again because the daughter of the jailor, Lucy Lockitt, is also in love with him.  Peachum wishes to see Macheath hanged because Polly has married Macheath, unlike Lucy Lockitt, who is merely pregnant by him (and neither woman is concerned with Macheath's sexual activity, but only with whom he marries, for marriage means access to his estate when he is eventually hanged).  Peachum fears that Macheath will turn him in to the law, and he also feels that marriage is a betrayal of good breeding, that prostitution is the genteel thing.  Gay announced his intention to create the "[[ballad opera]]" with the play.  The music for the songs came from tunes already popular, and ten of the tunes were from the satirist [[Tom D'Urfey]], whose ''Pills to Purge Melancholy'' was a collection of coarse, bawdy, and amusing songs on various topics.  The [[ballad]] was associated with [[folk song]]s and folk poetry, and so Gay's choice of using ballads (although ballads written by a well-known author) for his music was itself an attempt to deflate the seeming pomposity and elitism of the opera.

For most of the audience, the central entertainment of the opera was the [[love triangle]] between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy, but satirically, the centre of the opera was the Peachum/Macheath story.  This story was an obvious parallel with the case of [[Jonathan Wild]] (Peachum) and [[Jack Sheppard]] (Macheath).  However, it was also the tale of Robert Walpole (Peachum) and the South Sea directors (Macheath).  Robert Walpole was one of the most divisive ministers in British history, and his control of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] ran for over two decades.  Until [[Margaret Thatcher]], no other [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (the office would not exist in name until later) had as adversarial a relationship with authors, and he had ruthlessly consolidated power and jealously guarded it against all threats.  During the South Sea Bubble, Walpole was accused of being "the screen," protecting the moneyed directors of the corporation from prosecution and of cashing in his own shares for full value before the collapse of the stock.  Further, during the life and career of the actual Jonathan Wild, Walpole's Whig ministry was suspected of protecting and supporting the master "thief-taker."

Additionally, Gay's opera was a strict [[parody]] and inversion of the opera.  Gay has his thieves and prostitutes speak like upper-class gentlemen and ladies.  Implicitly, he suggests that the nobles are no better than the thieves even as he suggests that thieves have their own mock-monarchies, senates, and religion.  He has his Beggar (the putative author of the opera) explain that the two female leads have equal parts and therefore should not fight (a joke that witnesses of the diva battle would understand).  The supernaturally lofty settings of opera are, in Gay's hands, the warrens of [[St Giles]] parish.  For palace settings, he has prisons.  For throne rooms, he has taverns.  For kings, he has criminal fences.  For [[knight errant|knights errant]]/[[pastoral poetry|shepherd lovers]], he has a highwayman.  For goddesses drawn about on gilded chariots, he has a ruined maid, a chorus of prostitutes, and Polly (who is perversely chaste).  The [[aria]]s also use the same metaphors that were common in opera, and Gay's songs are themselves parodies of the predictable lyrics in opera.  In each case, high and low trade places and Gay's suggestion of an essential likeness of the ministry with its most famous thief extended also to a suggestion that high opera is essentially like tavern songs and rounds.  The play was a hit, running for an unheard-of eighty performances.  Subsequently, the songs, as well as the play, were printed up and sold.

Robert Walpole, who had some personal animosity to John Gay, attended the play and enjoyed it.  However, upon learning from a friend that he was one of the targets of the satire, he tried to have the play stopped.  When Gay wrote a follow-up called ''Polly,'' Walpole had the play suppressed before performance.  The suppression was without precedent, although it was soon to be used ''as'' a precedent, for there had been no actual attack on the ministry.  The anti-ministerial (Tory) sentiment was entirely derived from interpretation.

Playwrights were therefore in straits.  On the one hand, when the playhouses were not running operas imported wholesale from the continent, they were dispensing with dramatists by turning out hack-written pantomimes.  On the other hand, when a satirical play appeared from a literary source, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry suppressed it even though it came from the most popular dramatist of the day (i.e., John Gay).  Furthermore, the grounds of the suppression were all implicit comparisons, and nothing explicit.  Gay had not ''said'' that Walpole was a crook as bad as Wild, although he had suggested it.

===The new Tory wits, escalating satire, and the creation of the Licensing Act===
[[File:Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Magnificent History of Tom Thumb the Great (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece to Fielding's ''Tom Thumb'', a play satirizing plays (and [[Robert Walpole]])]]
Robert Walpole's personal involvement in censoring entertainments critical of him only fanned the flames of the antagonism between himself and the stage.  [[Henry Fielding]], among others, was not afraid to provoke the ministry, and anti-Walpolean plays spiked after the suppression of ''Polly''.  Fielding's ''[[Tom Thumb]]'' (1730) was a satire on all of the tragedies written before him, with quotations from all the worst plays patched together for absurdity, and the plot concerned the eponymous tiny man attempting to run the kingdom and insinuate himself into the royal ranks.  It was, in other words, an attack on Robert Walpole and the way that he was referred to as "the Great Man" and his supposed control over [[Caroline of Ansbach]].  As with Gay's ''Beggar's Opera,'' the miniature general speaks constantly in elevated tones, making himself a great hero, and all of the normal-sized ladies fight each other to be his lover.  The contrast between reality, delusion, and self-delusion was a form of [[bathos]] that made the audience think of other grand-speaking and grandly spoken of people.  If a ridiculously tiny figure could be acclaimed a hero because of his own braggadocio, might other great leaders be similarly small?  Were they titans, or dwarves like Tom Thumb?  Fielding announced, essentially, that the emperor had no clothes, the [[prime minister]] no greatness.  Walpole responded by suppressing the performance of the play.  Fielding was a [[justice of the peace]] by profession, and so he knew that the ministry could only control the stage and not book publication.  Therefore, he tapped into the market for printed plays, and his revision of the play was solely in book form.  It was written by "Scribblerus Secundus," its title page announced (a reference to the [[Scriblerus Club]] of [[Jonathan Swift]], Gay, Pope, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], [[John Arbuthnot]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]]), and it was the ''Tragedy of Tragedies,'' which did for drama what Pope's ''Peri Bathos: or The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' had done for verse.  Fielding placed a critical apparatus on the play, showing the sources of all the [[parody|parodies]], and thereby made it seem as if his target had all along been bad tragedy and not the prime minister.  (Fielding's later novel, ''[[Jonathan Wild]]'', makes it clear that such was not the case, for it used exactly the same satirical device, "the Great Man," to lambaste the same target, Robert Walpole.)

Henry Fielding was not done with ministry satire.  His ''Covent-Garden Tragedy'' of 1732 was set in a [[brothel]] amongst the prostitutes.  Although the play was only acted once, it, like ''Tom Thumb,'' sold when printed.  Its attacks on ''[[poetic license]]'' and the antirealism of domestic tragedians and morally sententious authors was an attack on the values central to the Whig version of personal worth.  Two years later, Fielding was joined by [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]] in anti-Walpolean satire.  His ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'' takes its cue from ''Tom Thumb'' by outwardly satirizing the emptiness of bombast.  However, it also encoded a very specific and dangerous satire of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and his statutory wife.  The king and queen never meet in the play, and the subject is the former's wars with personal discomfort and the latter's desire for adultery.  In particular, the Queen herself is implicitly attacked.  However, the play also appears to be a superficial work of fancy and nonsense verse, and it delighted audiences with tongue twisters and parody.  However, Carey worked ''[[The Dragon of Wantley]]'' into a play in 1734.  Fielding and Carey, among others, picked up the cudgels where the Tory Wits had set them down and began to satirize Walpole and [[Parliament]] with increasing ferocity (and scatology).  Although a particular play of unknown authorship entitled ''A Vision of the Golden Rump'' was cited when Parliament passed the Licensing Act of 1737 (the "rump" being [[Parliament]], a rump roast, and human buttocks simultaneously), Carey's ''Dragon of Wantley'' was an unmistakable attack on tax policy and the ever-increasing power of the London government over the countryside.  Notably, Fielding's and Carey's plays made allowances for spectacle.  Indeed, their plays relied upon a [[burlesque]] of spectacle and by spectacle, for the effects of TopsyTurvy armies in ''Chrononhotonthologos'' (stacked atop each other instead of in ranks) and the titular dragon of Wantley, as well as the miniaturizing of Tom Thumb and the lurid scenery of the Covent Garden brothel, were part of the draw and part of the humor for these plays.

The Licensing Act required all plays to go to a censor before staging, and only those plays passed by the censor were allowed to be performed.  Therefore, plays were judged by ''potential'' criticism of the ministry and not just by reaction or performance.  The first play to be banned by the new Act was ''Gustavus Vasa'' by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]].  The play invoked the [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[Protestant]] king [[Gustav Vasa]] to castigate the purportedly corrupt Parliament of Walpole's administration, although Brooke would claim that he meant only to write a history play.  [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote a Swiftian parodic satire of the licensers, entitled ''A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage'' (1739).  The satire was, of course, not a vindication at all but rather a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of the position for censorship.  Had the licensers not exercised their authority in a partisan manner, the Act might not have chilled the stage so dramatically, but the public was well aware of the bannings and [[censorship]], and consequently any play that ''did'' pass the licensers was regarded with suspicion by the public.  Therefore, the playhouses had little choice but to present old plays and pantomime and plays that had no conceivable political content.  One consequence was that [[William Shakespeare]]'s reputation grew enormously as his plays saw a quadrupling of performances, and sentimental comedy and melodrama were the only "safe" choices for new drama.  Dramatists themselves had to turn to prose or to less obvious forms of criticism, such as [[puppet]] shows that [[Charlotte Charke]] would invest in.

==Effects of the Licensing Act==
[[Image:Othello-tragedy-18th.gif|thumb|right|200px|Othello "strikes" Desdemona in ''[[Othello]]'' from the 1744 Thomas Hanmer deluxe edition of [[William Shakespeare]].  Hanmer's was one of the "improved" editions that was roundly hissed by textual critics.]]
In comedy, one effect of the Licensing Act was that playwrights began to develop a comedy of sentiment.  This comedy was critically labeled as "high" comedy, in that it was intended to be entertaining rather than actually be funny, and brought about its entertainment by elevating the sentiments of the viewer.  The plots also relied upon characters being in or out of sympathy with each other.  Very late in the 17th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] attempted to resist the tide of sentimental comedy with ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1773), and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] would mount several satirical plays after Walpole's death. Both of these playwrights were taking advantage of a loosening of the censorship and popular weariness with "refined" comedy. Goldsmith's play reintroduces the country bumpkin character who outwits the sophisticated would-be rakes who are engaged in a plot to marry well. Sheridan, on the other hand, very consciously turned back to the [[Restoration comedy]]  for his models but carefully toned down the dangers of the sexual plots.

As mentioned above, another effect of the Licensing Act was to send the playhouses to old plays. Since any play written before 1737 could be staged without permission, theaters had a great deal to choose from.  However, they sought out Shakespeare, in particular, as the one author whose name alone could generate an audience as large as those formerly provided by leading poets.  Shakespeare's stature had been rising throughout the 18th century, and [[textual criticism]], particularly of Shakespeare, had resulted in reliable texts (''see [[Shakespeare's reputation]] for details''). Further, many of the expurgated and "improved" versions of Shakespeare were falling from favor.  Actors such as [[David Garrick]] made their entire reputations by playing Shakespeare.  The Licensing Act may be the single greatest factor in the rise of "[[Bardolatry]]."  However, other, less sparkling, plays were also revived, including multiple versions of ''Lady Jane Grey'' and ''The Earl of Essex'' (including one by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] that had been written before the Act).  Each of these could be used as a tacit commentary on the politics of the contemporary court and as a political gesture. Therefore, when playhouses wished to answer the public's political sentiment, they could quickly mount a performance of ''Cato'' or one of the Lady Jane Greys or, if the mood was otherwise, one of [[Aphra Behn]]'s royalist plays, and some of the Restoration plays such as [[William Wycherly]]'s ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' were always promising comedy.  However, when they needed to fill the house reliably, regardless of political season, and show off their actors, they staged Shakespeare.

[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[David Garrick]], a celebrity actor, starring as King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in [[Colley Cibber]]'s revision of Shakespeare's play six years after the Licensing Act]]
Finally, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were ''de rigueur'' for authors who were not journalists. This had to do with the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or ''Collected Sermons,'' and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make.  (For example, Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his ''Poems on Various Occasions'', which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists ([[Daniel Defoe]]), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was [[Aphra Behn]], who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her ''[[Oroonoko]]'' seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', was inappropriate for the stage.  However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.

Additionally, prior to 1737 the economic motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take of the third night of a play. This could be a very large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, [[John Gay]] grew wealthy with ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. In 1726, [[Leonard Welsted]]'s indifferent success, ''The Dissembled Woman'', was acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]]. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights.  After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, [[Samuel Richardson|Samuel Richardson's]] ''[[Clarissa]]'' was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more.  From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act.  Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass from hand to hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3667">The '''Building Information Modelling ([[Building information modeling|BIM]]) Task Group''' is a [[UK Government]]-funded group, managed through the [[Cabinet Office]], created in 2011 (and holding its first meeting in May 2011) and chaired by [[Mark Bew]]. It was founded to "drive adoption of BIM across government" in support of the ''Government Construction Strategy''.&lt;ref name=GCS&gt;Cabinet Office (2011) ''[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61152/Government-Construction-Strategy_0.pdf Government Construction Strategy]''. Accessed: 2 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to strengthen the public sector’s capabilities in BIM implementation to that all central government departments can adopt, as a minimum, collaborative 'Level 2' BIM by 2016.

The core BIM task force, to which companies seconded employees, identified four work streams, each led by a core team member: stakeholder and media engagement, delivery and productivity, commercial and legal, and training and academia.&lt;ref&gt;BIM Task Group, ''[http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/work-streams-wps/ Work streams and work packages]''. Accessed 2 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Working parties were established to focus on particular areas including: training and education, [[COBie]] data set requirements, Plan of Works, software vendors (the BIM Technologies Alliance), contractors ([[UK Contractors Group]], now superseded by [[Build UK]]), and materials and products suppliers ([[Construction Products Association]]).&lt;ref&gt;BIM Task Group, ''[http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/working-parties/ Working Parties]''. Accessed 2 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, it was announced that the BIM Task Group would be wound down during 2015, with a "managed handover" during 2015 to a newly created "legacy group", though there was speculation that the group's life might be extended to help achieve a new BIM Level 3 target.&lt;ref name=Withers&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withers|first1=Ian|title=Concern over plans to wind down BIM Task Group|url=http://www.building.co.uk/concern-over-plans-to-wind-down-bim-task-group/5068515.article|accessdate=2 September 2014|work=Building|publisher=UBM|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarkson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarkson|first1=Graham|title=Are we ready to manage without the BIM Task Group?|url=http://www.construction-manager.co.uk/comment/are-we-ready-manage-without-bim-task-group/|accessdate=2 September 2014|work=Construction Manager|publisher=Atom Publishing|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barristers' Ball''' is an annual event held at most [[law school in the United States|law schools]] in [[common law]] countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  It is generally a formal/semi-formal affair, often near the end of the academic year, conducted by the institution's [[Student Bar Association]] as a school-wide gathering.

The '''Book of Proverbs''' ([[Hebrew]]: מִשְלֵי, ''Míshlê (Shlomoh)'', "Proverbs (of [[Solomon]])") is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and a book of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Berlin|2011|p=588}} When translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], the title took on different forms: in the Greek [[Septuagint]] (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι ''Paroimiai'' ("Proverbs"); in the Latin [[Vulgate]] the title was ''Proverbia'', from which the English name is derived.

Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=438}} It is an example of the Biblical [[wisdom tradition]], and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=xiii–xvii}} The repeated theme is that "the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom."{{sfn|Longman|Garland|2009|p=}} Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.{{sfn|Boccaccini|2002|p=106}}

== Structure ==
[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|235px|Scroll of the Book of Proverbs]]

The superscriptions divide the collections as follows:
* Proverbs 1–9: "Proverbs of Solomon, Son of David, King of Israel"
* Proverbs 10–22:16: "Proverbs of Solomon"
* Proverbs 22:17–24:22: "The Sayings of the Wise"
* Proverbs 24:23–34: "These Also are Sayings of the Wise"
* Proverbs 25–29: "These are Other Proverbs of Solomon that the Officials of King Hezekiah of Judah Copied"
* Proverbs 30: "The Words of Agur"
* Proverbs 31:1–9: "The Words of King Lemuel of Massa, Which his Mother Taught Him"
* Proverbs 31:10–31: the ideal wise woman (elsewhere called the "woman of substance").{{sfn|Perdue|2012|pp=x–xi}}

== Contents ==

"Proverbs" translates to the Hebrew word ''mashal'', but "mashal" has a wider range of meaning than the short catchy sayings implied by the English word. Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of "sayings" of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include "instructions" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the "words of the wise" sayings, longer than the Solomonic "sayings" but shorter and more diverse than the "instructions".{{sfn|Farmer|1991|pp=17–20}}

The first section (chapters 1–9) consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten "instructions", and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=48}} Proverbs 10:1–22:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first contrasting the wise man and the fool (or the righteous and the wicked), the second addressing wise and foolish speech.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=58}} Chapters 25–29, attributed to editorial activity of "the men of [[Hezekiah]]," contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=67}} Chapter 30:1–4, the "sayings of Agur", introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=68}}

==Composition==
[[File:Dore Solomon Proverbs.png|thumb|235px|Solomon writing Proverbs ([[Gustave Doré]])]]

It is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=438}} The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, ''mishley shelomoh'', Proverbs of Solomon (the phrase is repeated at 10:1 and 25:1), is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship.{{sfn|Farmer|1991|p=25}}

The book is an anthology made up of six discrete units. The first, chapters 1–9, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods. This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Robert William  |date=1912 |title=Cuneiform parallels to the Old Testament |edition=1st | chapter = 8. Fragment of Wisdom Literature | publisher= Eaton and Mains|  place = New York | url=https://archive.org/details/cunciformparalle00roge |access-date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, chapters 10–22:16, carries the superscription "the proverbs of Solomon", which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon. The third unit is headed "bend your ear and hear the words of the wise": a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the [[Instruction of Amenemope]], and may have reached the Hebrew author(s) through an Aramaic translation. Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, "these too are from the wise." The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed "by the men of [[Hezekiah]]", indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE. Chapters 30 and 31 (the "words of Agur," the "words of Lemuel," and the description of the ideal woman) are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=183–85}}

The "wisdom" genre was widespread throughout the [[ancient Near East]], and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom.{{sfn|Smothers|2000|pp=167–68, 174}} The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction;{{sfn|Tucker|2000|pp=163–66}} nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages.{{sfn|Crenshaw|2000|p=217}}

== Themes ==
[[Image:Proverbs 3- 5,6 IMG 3141.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Excerpt from Proverbs 3 displayed at [[Portland International Jetport]] in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]]]
[[File:Incunabulum Blackletter Bible 1497.jpg|right|thumb|A page of the Book of Proverbs from a [[Bible]] from 1497]]

Along with the other examples of the Biblical [[wisdom tradition]] – [[Book of Job|Job]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] and some other writings – Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness. Wisdom is as close as Biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=xiii–xvii}}

Proverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions (the result of the book's origins as not just an anthology but an anthology of anthologies). The reader is told, for example, both to "not answer a fool according to his folly", according to 26:4, and to "answer a fool according to his folly", as 26:5 advises. More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit (chapters 1–9) is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1–14, the "words of Agur," we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=183–85}}

"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10 – the phrase implies submission to God's will{{sfn|Longman|Garland|2009|p=}}). Wisdom is praised for her role in creation ("God by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens" – Proverbs 3:19). God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos ("When [God] established the heavens...when he drew a circle on then face of the [[Tehom|Deeps]]...when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him" – Proverbs 8:27–31). Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.{{sfn|Boccaccini|2002|p=106}} Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful (though see the words of Agur for a "fool" who has wisdom, and could be seen as playful).

For the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster. In contrast, [[Book of Job|Job]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the "wise".{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=183}} Noteworthy also is the fact that the "mighty acts of God" ([[the Exodus]], the giving of the [[Torah]] at Sinai, the Covenant between God and Israel, etc.) which make up Israel's history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority ("Thus says the Lord!"), wisdom appeals to human reason and observation.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=130}}

==Later interpretation and influence==
The pre-Exilic (i.e. pre-586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an [[Heavenly host|assembly of subordinate servant-deities]].{{sfn|Page Lee|1990|pp=176–77}} The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe:{{sfn|Berlin|2011|p=188}} "Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields."{{sfn|Parrish|1990|p=183}} Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity.{{sfn|Kaiser|1997|p=28}} Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] calls Jesus "...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...", while the [[Gospel of John]] identifies him with the creative word ("In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God").{{sfn|Parrish|1990|pp=183–84}} 

In the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs, {{Bibleverse|Proverbs|8:22|NASB}} was used both to support and refute the claims of the [[Arian controversy|Arians]]. The Arians, assuming that Christ could be equated with the "Wisdom of God" ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|1:24}}), argued that the Son, like Wisdom, was "created" (Proverbs 8:22), and therefore subordinate to the Creator; their opponents, who argued that the relevant Hebrew word should be translated as "begot", won the debate, and the [[Nicene Creed]] declared that the Son was "begotten, not made", meaning that God and Christ were [[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]].{{sfn|Farmer|1991|pp=53–54}}

The '''California Science Center''' (sometimes spelled '''California ScienCenter''') is a [[California executive branch|state agency]] and museum located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], [[Los Angeles]], next to the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] and the [[University of Southern California]]. Billed as the West Coast's largest hands-on science center, the California Science Center is a [[public-private partnership]] between the State of California and the California Science Center Foundation. The [[California Natural Resources Agency]] oversees the California Science Center and the [[California African American Museum]].
Founded in 1951 as the "California Museum of Science and Industry", the Museum was remodeled and renamed in 1998 as the "California Science Center". The California Science Center hosts the [[California State Science Fair]] annually.

Admission includes access to the permanent exhibits, such as the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] and other prominent aircraft and spacecraft, and to various demonstrations. A separate ticket is required for the [[IMAX]] movies, most special traveling exhibitions, and special activities that include a [[climbing wall]], [[motion simulator]], and a high-wire bicycle.

==Affiliations==
The Center has been accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]], and is a member of the [[Association of Science and Technology Centers]].

===State Exhibition===
The museum's history dates back to the first California State Exhibition building, which opened in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in Los Angeles in 1912, the site of an agricultural fairground from 1872 to 1910. The brick and [[terra cotta]] building, designed by William D. Coates, Jr., state architect, and N. Ellery, state engineer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Los Angeles Historical Buildings (1900 - 1925)|url=http://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_LA_Buildings%20%281900%20-%201925%29_Page_2.html|publisher=Water and Power Associates|accessdate=6 March 2016|quote=Historical Notes  The State Exposition Building, designed by William D.

===California Museum of Science and Industry===
In 1951, the exhibition became the "California Museum of Science and Industry". The State Exhibition building was renamed in honor of major donor and trustee [[Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr.|Howard F. Ahmanson]] as the Howard F. Ahmanson Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://theahmansonfoundation.org/history/|publisher=The Ahmanson Foundation|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hands-on interactive exhibits included themes on agriculture, transportation, electricity, energy, industries, and minerals.&lt;ref name="Story of the California Museum of Science and Industry"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of the California Museum of Science and Industry|url=http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/CMSI_History.html|publisher=California State Science Fair Historical Information|accessdate=6 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173224/http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/CMSI_History.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the museum opened a new science wing that featured "[[Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond]]", an exhibit sponsored by [[IBM]] and designed by [[Charles and Ray Eames]] to visually demonstrate fundamental mathematical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popularizing Math and Science|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/mathandscience/|publisher=IBM at 100: Icons of Progress|accessdate=6 March 2016|quote=Arguably, the signature example of their efforts for IBM was Mathematica, the first interactive exhibit to make math its subject. Planning a new science wing to debut in 1961, the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles asked IBM for a contribution. The company turned to the Eameses, who designed a display that, in the words of Charles Eames, would "let the fun [of math and science] out of the bag."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReAppreciating Mathematica|url=http://www.humantific.com/reappreciating-mathematica/|publisher=Humantific New york|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction stations demonstrated different concepts including [[celestial mechanics]], the [[Möbius strip]], multiplication, symmetry, and [[projective geometry]]. The original exhibit closed in 1998, and is now on display at the [[New York Hall of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematica|url=http://nysci.org/mathematica/|publisher=New York Hall of Science|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall of Health was added in 1968.&lt;ref name="Story of the California Museum of Science and Industry"/&gt;

====1984 changes====
In preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], the museum added new exhibits on earthquakes and economics, and a [[IMAX]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Museum of Science and Industry1951-1996|url=http://whmsicl.cnc.net/CMSI.html|publisher=Whimsical Will|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening and closing ceremonies for the games were held in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], which is adjacent to the museum.

====California African American Museum====
The [[California African American Museum]] was founded in 1981 and housed in the California Museum of Science and Industry building until 1984, when its own facility was opened adjacent to the California Aerospace Museum.

====1990s and closing====
In 1994, the museum's building was damaged by the [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]].&lt;ref name="California Science Center opens"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nicolai Ouroussoff|title=The new California Science Center is a commanding presence and unifying element at a neglected site.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/02/entertainment/ca-14584|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=February 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Museum of Science and Industry closed in 1996 to prepare for a new facility.

===California Aerospace Museum===
[[File:Air space exhibits 01.jpg|thumb|Former California Aerospace Museum (now closed) was designed by [[Frank Gehry]], and displayed a [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]]]]
The "California Aerospace Museum" was also opened in 1984 adjacent to and operated by the California Museum of Science and Industry to coincide with the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Aerospace Museum, Exposition Park|url=https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/aero/aero.html|publisher=Marry Anne Sullivan, Bluffton University|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Aerospace Museum, Los Angeles, California|url=https://ksamedia.osu.edu/work/68621|publisher=Knowlton School of Architecture, Ohio State University|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as Aerospace Hall but also commonly known as the California Air and Space Museum/Gallery and the SKETCH Foundation Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Aerospace Museum|publisher=California State Parks Office of Historic Preservation|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first major public work of architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air and Space Gallery, California Science Center|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/air-and-space-gallery-california-science-center|publisher=Los Angeles Conservancy|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum focused on the State's history as a leader in the aviation and aerospace industries and featured a giant, hangar-like space with aircraft and space vehicles and artifacts.

The building, now known as the Air and Space Gallery, was closed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perishable! Gehry's Air and Space Gallery in limbo at California Science Center.|url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=6155#.VtxJy-aGPhU|publisher=The Architects Newspaper|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the building was listed on the [[California Register of Historical Resources]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendation Report|publisher=Los Angeles Department of City Planning|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its future is unknown.

===Transformation to California Science Center===
In 1988 the museum's leadership began a to develop a three-phase, 25-year master plan to transform the institution from a science museum to a science education facility.&lt;ref name="Our Past"/&gt; This new facility would be known as the ''California Science Center''. The original museum building closed its doors in 1996 to prepare for the new construction.

====Phase I====
[[File:Blackbird 02.jpg|thumb|[[Lockheed A-12|Lockheed A-12 "Archangel,"]] nicknamed "Titanium Goose," on display outside the California Science Center]]
The new construction was designed by [[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership]].&lt;ref name="California Science Center opens"/&gt; Changes included:

* Redesign of the original main building (Howard F. Ahmanson building). The north facade of the Science Center retains the facade of former State Exposition Building that opened to the [[Exposition Park Rose Garden]], but the remainder of the original building was demolished.&lt;ref name="Our Past"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Add to Board  WS ZO View of historical façade of former State Exposition Building now called the California Science Center in Exposition Park Los Angeles / Los Angeles, California, USA|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/view-of-historical-fa%C3%A7ade-of-former-state-stock-video-footage/106004477|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''center of gravity (CG) of an aircraft''' is the point over which the aircraft would balance.&lt;ref name="faa-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its position is calculated after supporting the aircraft on at least two sets of [[weighing scale]]s or [[load cell]]s and noting the weight shown on each set of scales or load cells.  The center of gravity affects the [[Longitudinal static stability|stability]] of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]] must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer.

== Terminology ==
[[File:KLM vliegtuig op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 189-0841.jpg|thumb|The nose baggage compartment of a [[:en:Fokker F.XII|Fokker F.XII]] in 1933, avoiding the problem of heavy weights towards the rear]]
;Ballast: Ballast is removable or permanently installed weight in an aircraft used to bring the center of gravity into the allowable range.

;Center-of-Gravity Limits: Center of gravity (CG) limits are specified longitudinal (forward and aft) and/or lateral (left and right) limits within which the aircraft's center of gravity must be located during flight. The CG limits are indicated in the airplane flight manual. The area between the limits is called the ''CG range'' of the aircraft.

;Weight and Balance:When the weight of the aircraft is at or below the allowable limit(s) for its configuration (parked, ground movement, take-off, landing, etc.) and its center of gravity is within the allowable range, and both will remain so for the duration of the flight, the aircraft is said to be within ''weight and balance''.  Different maximum weights may be defined for different situations; for example, large aircraft may have maximum landing weights that are lower than maximum take-off weights (because some weight is expected to be lost as fuel is burned during the flight).  The center of gravity may change over the duration of the flight as the aircraft's weight changes due to fuel burn or by passengers moving forward or aft in the cabin.

;Reference Datum:The ''reference datum'' is a reference plane that allows accurate, and uniform, measurements to any point on the aircraft. The location of the reference datum is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the aircraft flight manual. The horizontal reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane or point, placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location, and it may be located forward of the nose of the aircraft. For helicopters, it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter. While the horizontal reference datum can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses, most small training helicopters have the horizontal reference datum 100&amp;nbsp;inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline. This is to keep all the computed values positive. The lateral reference datum is usually located at the center of the helicopter.&lt;ref name="faa-2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/helicopter_flying_handbook/media/helicopter_flying_handbook.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Rotorcraft Flying Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Arm:The arm is the horizontal distance from the reference datum to the center of gravity (CG) of an item. The algebraic sign is plus (+) if measured aft of the datum or to the right side of the center line when considering a lateral calculation. The algebraic sign is minus (-) if measured forward of the datum or the left side of the center line when considering a lateral calculation.&lt;ref name="faa-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Moment:The moment is the moment of force, or [[torque]], that results from an object’s weight acting through an arc that is centered on the zero point of the reference datum distance. Moment is also referred to as the tendency of an object to rotate or pivot about a point (the zero point of the datum, in this case). The further an object is from this point, the greater the force it exerts. Moment is calculated by multiplying the weight of an object by its arm.

;[[Chord (aeronautics)|Mean Aerodynamic Chord]] (MAC): A specific chord line of a tapered wing.  At the mean aerodynamic chord, the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does on the rest of the wing.  The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions.  On some aircraft, the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC.  In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time.  This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the [[Aircraft flight manual|aircraft's flight manual]] and also on the aircraft's type certificate data sheet. If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge mean aerodynamic chord) and a TeMAC (trailing edge mean aerodynamic chord) are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line) then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.

== Calculation ==

Center of gravity (CG) is calculated as follows:

*Determine the weights and arms of all mass within the aircraft.
*Multiply weights by arms for all mass to calculate moments.
*Add the moments of all mass together.
*Divide the total moment by the total mass of the aircraft to give an overall arm.

The arm that results from this calculation must be within the center of gravity limits dictated by the aircraft manufacturer.  If it is not, weight in the aircraft must be removed, added (rarely), or redistributed until the center of gravity falls within the prescribed limits.

Aircraft center of gravity calculations are only performed along a single axis from the zero point of the reference datum that represents the longitudinal axis of the aircraft (to calculate fore-to-aft balance). Some helicopter types utilize lateral CG limits as well as longitudinal limits. Operation of such helicopters requires calculating CG along two axes: one calculation for longitudinal CG (fore-to-aft balance) and another calculation for lateral CG (left-to-right balance).

The weight, moment and arm values of fixed items on the aircraft (i.e. engines, wings, electronic components) do not change and are provided by the manufacturer on the Aircraft Equipment List. The manufacturer also provides information facilitating the calculation of moments for fuel loads. Removable weight items (i.e. crew members, passengers, baggage) must be properly accounted for in the weight and CG calculation by the aircraft operator.

===Example=== 
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!
! Mass (lb)
! Arm (in)
! Moment (lb-in)
|-
| Empty aircraft
| 1,495.0
| 101.4
| 151,593.0
|-
| Pilot and passengers
| 380.0
| 64.0
| 24,320.0
|-
| Fuel (30 gallons @ 6&amp;nbsp;lb/gal)
| 180.0
| 96.0
| 17,280.0
|-
| Totals
| 2,055.0
| 94.0
|193,193.0
|}

To find the center of gravity, we divide the total moment by the total mass: 193,193 / 2,055 = 94.01 inches behind the datum plane.

In larger aircraft, weight and balance is often expressed as a percentage of mean aerodynamic chord, or MAC.  For example, assume the leading edge of the MAC is 62 inches aft of the datum.  Therefore, the CG calculated above lies 32 inches aft of the leading edge of the MAC.  If the MAC is 80 inches in length, the percentage of MAC is 32 / 80 = 40%. If the allowable limits were 15% to 35%, the aircraft would ''not'' be properly loaded.

== Incorrect weight and balance in fixed-wing aircraft ==
[[Image:BAe 146 centre of gravity problem.JPG|thumb|The center of gravity of this [[British Aerospace 146]] shifted rearward after its engines were removed, making it unstable. As a result, it tipped back onto its rear fuselage in windy conditions.]]
When the center of gravity or weight of an aircraft is outside the acceptable range, the aircraft may not be able to sustain flight, or it may be impossible to maintain the aircraft in level flight in some or all circumstances, in some events resulting in [[load shifting]].  Placing the CG or weight of an aircraft outside the allowed range can lead to an unavoidable crash of the aircraft.

=== Center of gravity out of range ===
When the fore-aft center of gravity (CG) is out of range serious aircraft control problems occur.  The fore-aft CG affects longitudinal stability of the aircraft, with the stability increasing as the CG moves forward, and stability decreasing as the CG moves aft.  With a forward CG position, although the stability of the aircraft increases, the elevator control authority is reduced in the capability of raising the nose of the aircraft.  This can cause a serious condition during the landing flare when the nose cannot be raised sufficiently to slow the aircraft.  An aft CG position creates severe handling problems due to the reduced pitch stability and increased elevator control sensitivity, with potential loss of aircraft control.  Because the burning of fuel gradually produces a loss of weight and possibly a shift in the CG, it is possible for an aircraft to take off with the CG within normal operating range, and yet later develop an imbalance that results in control problems.  Calculations of CG must take this into account (often part of this is calculated in advance by the manufacturer and incorporated into CG limits).

Here's an example of a Piper Mirage with too much weight in the back of the aircraft that results in the Takeoff CG within limits (the green reference point) but the Landing CG is aft of the CG Envelope limits (the blue reference point).&lt;ref&gt;http://eflite.com/images/creative_commons/Aircraft_with_Aft_CG_Limit_Issue.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adjusting CG within limits ===
The amount a weight must be moved can be found by using the following formula
 shift dist = (total weight * cg change) / weight shifted

Example:
 1500lbs * 33.9in = 50,850 moment (airplane)
 100lbs * 84in = 6800 moment (baggage)
 cg = 37in = (50,850+6800) / 1600lbs (1/2in out of cg limit)

We want to move the CG 1in using a 100lb bag in the baggage compartment.

 shift dist = (total weight * cg change) / weight shifted
 16in = (1600lb * 1in) / 100lb

Reworking the problem with 100lbs moved 16in forward to 68in moves CG 1-in.
 new cg = 36in

=== Weight out of range ===

Few aircraft impose a minimum weight for flight (although a minimum pilot weight is often specified), but all impose a maximum weight.  If the maximum weight is exceeded, the aircraft may not be able to achieve or sustain controlled, level flight.  Excessive take-off weight may make it impossible to take off within available runway lengths, or it may completely prevent take-off.  Excessive weight in flight may make climbing beyond a certain altitude difficult or impossible, or it may make it impossible to maintain an altitude.

== Incorrect weight and balance in helicopters ==

The center of gravity is even more critical for helicopters than it is for fixed-wing aircraft (weight issues remain the same). As with fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter may be properly loaded for takeoff, but near the end of a long flight when the fuel tanks are almost empty, the CG may have shifted enough for the helicopter to be out of balance laterally or longitudinally.&lt;ref name="faa-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For helicopters with a single main rotor, the CG is usually close to the main rotor mast. Improper balance of a helicopter’s load can result in serious control problems. In addition to making a helicopter difficult to control, an out-of-balance loading condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location.

The pilot tries to perfectly balance a helicopter so that the fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight, with no cyclic pitch control needed except for wind correction. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing the center of gravity changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor. When the center of gravity is directly under the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontal; if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangs
with its nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the mast, the nose tilts up.

=== CG forward of forward limit ===

A forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the rotor mast. This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are located aft of the rotor mast because as fuel burns the weight located aft of the rotor mast becomes less.

This condition is recognizable when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a nose-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive rearward displacement of the cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. In this condition, the pilot could rapidly run out of rearward cyclic control as the helicopter consumes fuel. The pilot may also find it impossible to decelerate sufficiently to bring the helicopter to a stop. In the event of engine failure and the resulting [[autorotation]], the pilot may not have enough cyclic control to flare properly for the landing.

A forward CG will not be as obvious when hovering into a strong wind, since less rearward cyclic displacement is required than when hovering with no wind. When determining whether a critical balance condition exists, it is essential to consider the wind velocity and its relation to the rearward displacement of the cyclic control.

=== CG aft of aft limit ===

Without proper ballast in the cockpit, exceeding the aft CG may occur when:

* A lightweight pilot takes off solo with a full load of fuel located aft of the rotor mast.
* A lightweight pilot takes off with maximum baggage allowed in a baggage compartment located aft of the rotor mast.
* A lightweight pilot takes off with a combination of baggage and substantial fuel where both are aft of the rotor mast.

An aft CG condition can be recognized by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control. In this case, [[dissymmetry of lift]] and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft. With full forward cyclic control already applied, the rotor disc might not be able to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.

== Lateral balance ==

In fixed-wing aircraft, lateral balance is often much less critical than fore-aft balance, simply because most mass in the aircraft is located very close to its center.  An exception is fuel, which may be loaded into the wings, but since fuel loads are usually symmetrical about the axis of the aircraft, lateral balance is not usually affected.  The lateral center of gravity may become important if the fuel is not loaded evenly into tanks on both sides of the aircraft, or (in the case of small aircraft) when passengers are predominantly on one side of the aircraft (such as a pilot flying alone in a small aircraft).  Small lateral deviations of CG that are within limits may cause an annoying roll tendency that pilots must compensate for, but they are not dangerous as long as the CG remains within limits for the duration of the flight.

For most helicopters, it is usually not necessary to determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and passenger flights. This is because helicopter cabins are relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located near the center line. However, some helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo flight must be conducted. In addition, if there is an unusual situation, such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel on one side of the helicopter, which could affect the lateral CG, its position should be checked against the CG envelope. If carrying external loads in a position that requires large lateral cyclic control displacement to maintain level flight, fore and aft cyclic effectiveness could be dramatically limited.

== Fuel dumping and overweight operations ==

Many large transport-category aircraft are able to take-off at a greater weight than they can land.  This is possible because the weight of fuel that the wings can support along their span in flight, or when parked or taxiing on the ground, is greater than they can tolerate during the stress of landing and touchdown, when the support is not distributed along the span of the wing.

Normally the portion of the aircraft's weight that exceeds the maximum landing weight (but falls within the maximum take-off weight) is entirely composed of fuel.  As the aircraft flies, the fuel burns off, and by the time the aircraft is ready to land, it is below its maximum landing weight.  However, if an aircraft must land early, sometimes the fuel that remains aboard still keeps the aircraft over the maximum landing weight.  When this happens, the aircraft must either burn off the fuel (by flying in a holding pattern) or dump it (if the aircraft is equipped to do this) before landing to avoid damage to the aircraft.  In an emergency, an aircraft may choose to land overweight, but this may damage it, and at the very least an overweight landing will mandate a thorough inspection to check for any damage.

In some cases, an aircraft may take off overweight deliberately.  An example might be an aircraft being ferried over a very long distance with extra fuel aboard.  An overweight take-off typically requires an exceptionally long runway.  Overweight operations are not permitted with passengers aboard.

Many smaller aircraft have a maximum landing weight that is the same as the maximum take-off weight, in which case issues of overweight landing due to excess fuel being on board cannot arise.

Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as [[card magic]], as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.

==Elements==
Coin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic—some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. [[handkerchief]]s, [[glasses]]) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of [[sleight of hand]] and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.

==Sleights and tricks==
{{Confusing|date=June 2010}}
&lt;!-- This section may need a more detailed description for each act. Comment from User:Davtra --&gt;

Some classic coin magic effects:
*Coin vanish - making a coin seemingly vanish.
*Coin production - making a coin seemingly appear.
*Transposition - making two coins switch places

Some classic coin magic plots:
*[[Miser's Dream]] - Grabbing multiple coins from thin air. Popularized by T. Nelson Downs, who would drop coin after coin into a borrowed top hat.
*Coins Across - The magical transfer of multiple coins from one hand to another.
*Three fly - A coins across type effect involving three coins ''visually'' transferring from one hand to another.
*Matrix - Impossibly moving four coins under the cover of playing cards.
*Chink-a-chink - A bare-handed Matrix.
*[[Coins Through Table]] - Coins penetrate through the surface of the table.
*Coin Bite - Taking a bite out of a coin then visually restoring it right in front of the spectator.
*Spellbound - Visually changing one coin into another, while only showing one coin at all times.
*Coins to Glass - Similar to coins across - coins transfer from one hand to a glass.
*Tenkai Pennies - A two coin routine where one coin travels from one hand to the other.
*Coin to bottle - A coin is slammed into a sealed bottle.

A sampling of coin sleights and moves:
*[[Palming]] - A form of concealment.
*[[Sleeving]] - A form of concealment.
*Lapping - A form of ditching a coin.
*[[The French Drop]] - a retention of vision coin vanish involving the Passing of a coin from one hand to the other than making it disappear.
*The Muscle Pass - Shooting a coin from one hand to the other, this can be done in such a way that can make the coin look as if it’s defying gravity

==Coin magicians==
Some magicians widely known for coin magic include:
* [[Thomas Nelson Downs]] (considered, along with J.B. Bobo, one of the magicians key to the development and teaching of modern coin magic)
* [[J.B. Bobo]] (author of Modern Coin Magic, a core reference and starting point for coin magicians)
* [[Tony Slydini]] (a well-known magician whose style of magic transformed close-up magic including his impressive coin routines)
* [[Dai Vernon]]
* [[Ed Marlo]]
* [[David Roth]] (most important developer of coin magic in the twentieth century and inventor of the standard plots common in current coin magic)
* [[Larry Jennings]]
* [[Michael Ammar]] (one of the most prolific publishers and teachers, an experienced all around magician, including coin work)
* [[Dean Dill]] (coin magician and inventor who has appeared on television and also works as a barber)
* [[Michael Vincent (magician)|Michael Vincent]]
* [[Shoot Ogawa]] (Last Vegas restaurant performer known for highly stylized, high-difficulty, impressive coin magic)
* [[Apollo Robbins]] (contemporary of Shoot Ogawa and co-contributor to a number coin teaching materials)
* [[David Stone (magician)|David Stone]] (talented performer and teacher of fast-paced, flashy coin magic)
* [[Rocco Silano]]
* [[Jay Sankey]]

* [[Luis Piedrahita]]
* [[Michael Rubinstein]]
* [[Mike Gallo]]
* [[Chris Kenner]]
* [[Paul Cummins]]

==Performance==
Although some coin magic use [[gimmick]]s (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.

==In literature==
Canadian novelist [[Robertson Davies]] devotes a good part of his ''[[The Deptford Trilogy|Deptford Trilogy]]'' to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, [[World of Wonders (novel)|World of Wonders]], details his life and career.

In the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[American Gods]]'', the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.

In the [[Dean Koontz]] novel ''[[From the Corner of His Eye]]'', a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.

[[Stock character|Thieves, wizards, and jesters]], in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. [[Coin walk|Rolling a coin across the knuckles]] (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in [[David Eddings]]'s ''[[Belgariad]]'', and [[Mat Cauthon]] and [[Thom Merrilin]] in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[Wheel of Time]]'' do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of [[Pirates of the Caribbean]]. Also, [[Vila Restal]] in the [[BBC]] [[science fiction]] television program ''[[Blake's 7]]'' mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.

Research in computational epigenetics comprises the development and application of bioinformatics methods for solving epigenetic questions, as well as computational data analysis and theoretical modeling in the context of epigenetics. This includes modelling of the effects of histone and DNA CpG island methylation.

==Current research areas==

===Epigenetic data processing and analysis===
[[File:ChIP-on-chip wet-lab.png|thumb|428x428px|ChIP-on-chip technique]]
Various experimental techniques have been developed for genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madrigal|first=P|author2=Krajewski, P|title=Uncovering correlated variability in epigenomic datasets using the Karhunen-Loeve transform.|journal=BioData Mining|date=July 2015|volume=8|pages=20|doi=10.1186/s13040-015-0051-7|pmid=26140054|pmc=4488123}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most widely used being [[ChIP-on-chip]], [[ChIP-seq]] and [[bisulfite sequencing]]. All of these methods generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of data processing and quality control by bioinformatic methods.

===Epigenome prediction===
A substantial amount of bioinformatic research has been devoted to the [[prediction]] of epigenetic information from characteristics of the [[genome sequence]]. Such predictions serve a dual purpose. First, accurate epigenome predictions can substitute for experimental data, to some degree, which is particularly relevant for newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms and for species other than human and mouse. Second, prediction algorithms build statistical models of epigenetic information from training data and can therefore act as a first step toward quantitative modeling of an epigenetic mechanism. Successful computational prediction of DNA and lysine methylation and acetylation has been achieved by combinations of various features.&lt;ref name="Shi2012"&gt;{{cite journal

===Applications in cancer epigenetics===
The important role of epigenetic defects for [[cancer]] opens up new opportunities for improved diagnosis and therapy. These active areas of research give rise to two questions that are particularly amenable to bioinformatic analysis. First, given a list of genomic regions exhibiting epigenetic differences between tumor cells and controls (or between different disease subtypes), can we detect common patterns or find evidence of a functional relationship of these regions to cancer? Second, can we use bioinformatic methods in order to improve diagnosis and therapy by detecting and classifying important disease subtypes?

==Emerging topics==
The first wave of research in the field of computational epigenetics was driven by rapid progress of experimental methods for data generation, which required adequate computational methods for data processing and quality control, prompted epigenome prediction studies as a means of understanding the genomic distribution of epigenetic information, and provided the foundation for initial projects on [[cancer epigenetics]]. While these topics will continue to be major areas of research and the mere quantity of epigenetic data arising from epigenome projects poses a significant bioinformatic challenge, several additional topics are currently emerging.
* Epigenetic regulatory circuitry: Reverse engineering the regulatory networks that read, write and execute epigenetic codes.
* [[Population epigenetics]]: Distilling regulatory mechanisms from the integration of epigenome data with [[gene expression]] profiles and [[haplotype]] maps for a large sample from a heterogeneous population.''
* [[Evolutionary epigenetics]]: Learning about epigenome regulation in human (and its medical consequences) by cross-species comparisons.
* Theoretical modeling: Testing our mechanistic and quantitative understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by [[in silico]] simulation.&lt;ref name="roznovat2013computational"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Dendrology''' ({{lang-grc|δένδρον}}, ''dendron'', "tree"; and {{lang-grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', ''science of'' or ''study of'') or '''[[xylology]]''' ({{lang-grc|ξύλον}}, ''ksulon'', "wood") is the science and study of [[Woody plant|wooded plants]] ([[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, and [[liana]]s), specifically, their taxonomic classifications. There is no sharp boundary between [[plant taxonomy]] and dendrology; however, woody plants not only belong to many different plant [[Family (biology)|families]], but these families may be made up of both woody and non-woody members. Some families include only a few woody [[species]]. Dendrology, as a discipline of industrial forestry, tends to focus on identification of economically useful woody plants and their taxonomic interrelationships.  As an academic course of study, dendrology will include all woody plants, native and non-native, that occur in a region.  A related discipline is the study of sylvics, which focuses on the autecology of [[genus|genera]] and species.

== Relationship with botany ==

Dendrology is often confused with [[botany]]. However, botany is the study of all types of general plants, while dendrology studies only woody plants. Dendrology may be considered a subcategory of botany that specializes in the characterization and identification of woody plants.

The economics of [[information security]] addresses the economic aspects of [[privacy]] and [[computer security]]. Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational “[[homo economicus]]” as well as [[behavioral economics]]. '''Economics of security''' addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions.

Economics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?  Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in [[security engineering]].

== Emergence of economics of security ==
[[National security]] is the canonical [[public good]]. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues.

In 2000, [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] wrote, [http://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf Why Information Security is Hard].  Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on [[altruism]] for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security.

Also in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a [[public good]] but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative [[externality]] value.  Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods.  Six years later, [http://idefense.com/ iDEFENSE], [http://zerodayinitiative.com/  ZDI] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125104648/http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html Mozilla] have extant markets for vulnerabilities.

In 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi-faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: [http://www.cert.org/octave OCTAVE]. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice.

In 2001, in an unrelated development, [[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] published [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383709 Using information security as a response to competitor analysis systems]. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security. 

The authors came together to develop and expand a series of flagship events under the name Workshop on the Economics of Information Security.

== Examples of findings in economics of security ==
Proof of work is a security technology designed to stop spam by altering the economics. An early paper in economics of information security argued that [[proof of work]] cannot work. In fact, the finding was that [[proof of work]] cannot work without [[price discrimination]] as illustrated by a later paper, [http://weis2006.econinfosec.org/docs/50.pdf Proof of Work can Work].

Another finding, one that is critical to an understanding of current American data practices, is that the opposite of [[privacy]] is not, in economic terms [[anonymity]], but rather [[price discrimination]]. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.9746&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Privacy and price discrimination] was authored by [[Andrew Odlyzko]] and illustrates that what may appear as information pathology in collection of data is in fact rational organizational behavior.

[[Hal Varian]] presented three models of security using the metaphor of the height of walls around a town to show security as a normal good, public good, or good with externalities. [http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/resources/affiliates/workshops/econsecurity/econws/49.pdf Free riding] is the end result, in any case.

[[Lawrence A. Gordon]] and [http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/mloeb/ Martin P. Loeb] wrote the [http://ns2.virusflags.dc.hu/~mfelegyhazi/courses/EconSec/readings/04_GordonL02economics_security_investment.pdf Economics of Information Security Investment]. The [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] is considered by many as the first economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">The '''Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law''' Moot is an [[moot court|international moot competition]] for young practicing lawyers organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. Whereas most moot competitions are only for students still in [[law school]] or who have not been [[bar (law)|called to the bar]], the ECC-SAL Moot is only open to lawyers who have been qualified for practice for no more than three years. The first edition of the moot was held in 2012. The moot is open to lawyers from Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea, and is mainly judged by lawyers (including [[Queen's Counsel]] and [[Senior Counsel]]), academics, and judges in the region. It typically involves a commercial dispute between parties before the [[Singapore International Commercial Court]]. The top eight teams that qualify from the preliminary phase (two rounds) proceed to the knockout stages.

A '''fish ladder''', also known as a '''fishway''', '''fish pass''' or '''fish steps''', is a structure on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as [[dam]]s, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and [[waterfall]]s) to facilitate [[Fish migration#Classification|diadromous]] fishes' natural [[Fish migration|migration]].&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_52259_19092-46291--,00.html|title=What is a Fish Ladder?|publisher=[[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]]|accessdate=27 April 2012|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term ''[[ladder]]'') into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.

==History==
[[File:Denil fish ladder.jpg|thumb|right|Denil Fishway on Salmon Creek, [[Montana]]]]
Written reports of rough fishways date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833–1950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852–1854, the Ballisodare Fish Pass was built in [[County Sligo]] in Ireland to draw [[salmon]] into a river that had not supported a fishery. In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in [[Rhode Island]], United States, on the [[Pawtuxet Village|Pawtuxet Falls]] Dam. The ladder was removed in 1924, when the [[Providence, Rhode Island|City of Providence]] replaced the wood dam with a [[concrete]] one. Concrete ladders are not always an improvement – the electric field-sensitive organs of the [[paddlefish]] are overloaded in the proximity of the [[rebar]] and other metal used in concrete construction, preventing them from gaining access to their spawning grounds and contributing to a catastrophic decline in their numbers.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

As the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.&lt;ref&gt;Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctBsJJ0oKHEC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Fish+passage+technologies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WPVWTaHnGtOdcZb1oe8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities''] Diana Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4289-2016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Fish pass.jpg|thumb|right|A small fish ladder on the [[River Otter, Devon]]]]

{{see also|eel ladder|fish migration}}

There are six main types of fishways:
* Pool and weir
* Baffle fishway (Denil, Larinier, Alaskan Steeppass, or other baffle configuration)
* Fish elevator
* Rock-ramp fishway
* Vertical-slot fish passage
* Fish siphon

A '''pool and weir''' is one of the oldest styles of fish ladders. It uses a series of small dams and pools of regular length to create a long, sloping channel for fish to travel around the obstruction. The channel acts as a fixed [[canal lock|lock]] to gradually step down the water level; to head upstream, fish must jump over from box to box in the ladder.

A '''baffle fishway''' uses a series of symmetrical close-spaced baffles in a channel to redirect the flow of water, allowing fish to swim around the barrier. Baffle fishways need not have resting areas, although pools can be included to provide a resting area or to reduce the velocity of the flow. Such fishways can be built with [[hairpin turn|switchbacks]] to minimize the space needed for their construction.
Baffles come in variety of designs. The original design for a Denil fishway was developed in 1909 by a Belgian scientist, G. Denil; it has since been adjusted and adapted in many ways. The ''Alaskan Steeppass'', for example, is a modular prefabricated Denil-fishway variant originally designed for remote areas of Alaska. Baffles have been installed by [https://arcg.is/1XCCrj Project Maitai] in several waterways in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand, to improve fish passage as part of general environmental restoration.

A '''fish elevator''' or '''fish lift''', as its name implies, breaks with the ladder design by providing a sort of [[elevator]] to carry fish over a barrier. It is well suited to tall barriers. With a fish elevator, fish swim into a collection area at the base of the obstruction. When enough fish accumulate in the collection area, they are nudged into a hopper that carries them into a flume that empties into the river above the barrier.

On the [[Connecticut River]], for example, two fish elevators lift up to 500 fish at a time, 52 feet (15.85 m), to clear the [[Holyoke Dam]]. In 2013, the elevator carried over 400,000 fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Connecticut River Migratory Fish
|url=http://www.fws.gov/r5crc/fish/old13.html |website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rock-ramp fishway''' uses large rocks and timbers to create pools and small falls that mimic natural structures. Because of the length of the channel needed for the ladder, such structures are most appropriate for relatively short barriers. They have a significant advantage in that they can provide fish spawning habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Luther P. Aadland |title=Reconnecting Rivers: Natural Channel Design in Dam Removals and Fish Passage |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |year=2010 |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/streamhab/reconnecting_rivers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vertical-slot fish passage''' is similar to a pool-and-weir system, except that each "dam" has a narrow slot in it near the channel wall. This allows fish to swim upstream without leaping over an obstacle. Vertical-slot fish passages also tend to handle reasonably well the seasonal fluctuation in water levels on each side of the barrier. Recent studies suggest that navigation locks have a potential to be operated as vertical slot fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Silva S., Lowry M., Macaya-Solis C., Byatt B., Lucas M. C. | year = 2017 | title = Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages?

Turbulent flow field comparison and related suitability for fish
passage of a standard and a simplified low‐gradient vertical slot
fishway. River Research and Applications, 33, 1295-1305.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fish siphon''' allows the pass to be installed parallel to a water course and can be used to link two watercourses. The pass utilises a syphon effect to regulate its flow. This style is particularly favoured to aid flood defence.

==Effectiveness==
Fish ladders have a mixed record of effectiveness. They vary in effectiveness for different types of species, with one study showing that only three percent of American Shad make it through all the fish ladders on the way to their spawning ground.&lt;ref name="BlockedMigration"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waldman|first1=John|title=Blocked Migration: Fish Ladders On U.S. Dams Are Not Effective|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/blocked_migration_fish_ladders_on_us_dams_are_not_effective/2636/|website=Yale Environment 360|publisher=Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Sciences|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectiveness depends on the fish species' swimming ability, and how the fish moves up and downstream. A fish passage that is designed to allow fish to pass upstream may not allow passage downstream, for instance.&lt;ref name="UpstreamBattle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kraft|first1=Amy |date=February 20, 2013 |title=Upstream Battle: Fishes Shun Modern Dam Passages, Contributing to Population Declines|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/upstream-battle-fishes-shun-modern-dam-passages-population-declines/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish passages do not always work.
In practice a challenge is matching swimming performance data to hydrodynamic measurements.&lt;ref name="Katopodis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Katopodis, C., Gervais, R.]  |title= Fish Swimming Performance Database and Analyses |journal=DFO CSAS Research Document No. 2016/002, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Ottawa, Canada  |pages= 1–550 |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang2017b"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]]  |title= How a better understanding of Fish-Hydrodynamics Interactions might enhance upstream fish passage in culverts |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:696033  |journal=Civil Engineering Research Report No. CE162  |pages= 1–43 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swim tests rarely use the same protocol and the output is either a single-point measurement or a bulk velocity. In contrast, physical and numerical modelling of fluid flow (i.e. hydrodynamics) deliver a detailed flow map, with a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Regulatory agencies face a difficult task to match hydrodynamic measurements and swimming performance data.

==Culverts==
During the last three decades, the ecological impact of [[culvert]]s on natural streams and rivers has been recognised. Baffles may be installed along the barrel invert to provide some fish-friendly alternative.&lt;ref name="Olsen2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olsen, A. and Tullis, B.  |title= Laboratory Study of Fish Passage and Discharge Capacity in Slip-Lined, Baffled Culverts |journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages= 424–432 |issn= 0733-9429 |year=2013 |doi=10.1061/(asce)hy.1943-7900.0000697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_Uys2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] and Uys, W. |title= Baffle Designs to Facilitate Fish Passage in Box Culverts: A Preliminary Study |url= https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:396517 |journal=6th IAHR International Symposium on Hydraulic Structures, Hydraulic Structures and Water System Management |pages= 295–304 |doi= 10.15142/T300628160828 |isbn= 978-1-884575-75-4 |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabonce2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cabonce, J., Fernando, R., Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Using Triangular Baffles to Facilitate Upstream Fish Passage in Box Culverts: Physical Modelling| url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:653838 |publisher= Hydraulic Model Report No. CH107/17, School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, 130 pages |year=2017 |isbn= 978-1-74272-186-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low discharges, the baffles decrease the flow velocity and increase the water depth to facilitate fish passage. At larger discharges, baffles induce lower local velocities and generate recirculation regions. Unfortunately, baffles can reduce drastically the culvert discharge capacity for a given afflux,&lt;ref name="Lariner2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larinier, M.  |title= Fish Passage through Culverts, Rock Weirs and Estuarine Obstructions |journal=Bulletin Français de Pêche et Pisciculture |volume=364 |issue=18 |pages= 119–134 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing substantially the total cost of the culvert structure to achieve the same design discharge and afflux. It is believed that fish-turbulence interplay may facilitate upstream migration, albeit an optimum design must be based upon a careful characterisation of both hydrodynamics and fish kinematics.&lt;ref name="Wang2017b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Baffle Systems to Facilitate Upstream Fish Passage in Standard Box Culverts: How About Fish-Turbulence Interplay? |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:678859 |journal=37th IAHR World Congress, IAHR &amp; USAINS, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |volume=3 |pages= 2586–2595 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WangChanson2018"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, H., [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title= Modelling Upstream Fish Passage in Standard Box Culverts: Interplay between Turbulence, Fish Kinematics, and Energetics |journal=River Research and Applications |volume=34|issue=3  |pages= 244-252 |year=2018 |doi=10.1002/rra.3245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harald Lesch''' (born 28 July 1960 in [[Gießen]], [[Hessen]]) is a [[Germany|German]] physicist, astronomer, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], author, television presenter, professor of physics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU) and professor of natural philosophy at the [[Munich University of Philosophy]]. In the German speaking world, Lesch plays a similar role to that of [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]],{{cn|date=July 2017}} as a bridge between the scientific community and the public.

==Education==

After completing secondary school in 1978 at the Theo-Koch-Schule in [[Grünberg, Hesse]], Lesch studied physics at the [[University of Giessen]], then at the [[University of Bonn]], where he completed his doctoral degree in 1987 and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy.  From 1988 to 1991 he was a research assistant at the state observatory at [[Heidelberg]]-Königstuhl.  In 1992 he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Toronto]].  In 1994 he was [[Habilitation|habilitated]] at the [[University of Bonn]].

==Work==
[[File:Harald Lesch Hannover 1.jpg|thumb|Lesch during a public lecture in 2010]]
Since 1995 Lesch has been a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the LMU Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de./people/lesch/lesch.html|title=Prof. Dr. Harald Lesch|publisher=LMU|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he teaches [[natural philosophy]] at the University for Philosophy in Munich.  His main areas of research are cosmic [[plasma physics]], [[black hole]]s, and [[neutron star]]s.  He is the expert on astrophysics in the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG) (German Research Society) and a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft (Astronomical Society). He is also a textbook author.

Lesch has made television appearances for the longstanding, self-presented production of the channel [[BR-alpha]]: alpha-Centauri, Lesch &amp; Co., Denker des Abendlandes (Thinkers of the Western World), and Alpha bis Omega (From Alpha to Omega). He also presented shorter television series.  His presentations attempt to make complex physical or philosophical issues more accessible to the public. In 2005 he was awarded the Communicator Prize by the DFG and the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Foundation for German Scholarship) for his television appearances and publications. To honor his work on making scientific findings understandable to the broad public, the Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Emden (nature research society) awarded him an honorary membership on March 15, 2011.

==Television appearances==
For many years, Lesch has presented a number of television series for the channel BR-alpha, beginning with alpha-Centauri, in which he is to be seen since 1998. In "Lesch &amp; Co." and "Denker des Abendlandes" (thinkers of the occident), he converses with the philosophy professor [[Wilhelm Vossenkuhl]] about philosophical topics. Alpha bis Omega deals with contradiction and consistency of religion and natural science, through conversations between Lesch and the Catholic theologist Thomas Schwartz.

In celebration of the Year of Einstein 2005, BR-alpha aired the 8-part series The Physics of [[Albert Einstein]], where in each episode, one single scientific finding of Einstein was introduced by Lesch, who explained its significance. Starting in August 2007, the 16-part program The 4 Elements was aired weekly, which deals with the structure of the world, and in addition to scientific aspects, also handles cultural-historical aspects.

For the Pay-TV channel ''Syfy'' he differentiates scientifically based and fictional components of Star Trek in the series ''Star Trek – Science vs. Fiction''. From April to the end of 2007, Lesch moderated  the weekly 5-minute program sci_xpert for this channel, which dealt with viewer questions, which mostly had to do with feasibility of science fiction concepts (such as "How realistic are the huge spaceships from Independence Day?"), but which also addressed purely scientific topics (for example "What is gravity?"), which were handled in the tradition of alpha-Centauri.  There were a total of 35 episodes.

Since September 2008 Lesch has been presenting the [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen|ZDF]] scholarly magazine ''Abenteuer Forschung'' (Adventures in Research). His predecessor was Joachim Bublath, who presented the show for many years.

At the start of the "International Year of Astronomy 2009", Lesch moderated in ZDF the 2½ hour special “How Light Was Born: the Long Night with Harald Lesch”, in which he, between short documentary films, led conversations with the cabaret artist and hobby-philosopher [[Christoph Süß]], the physics professor Günther Hasinger, and the theology professor Thomas Schwartz.

Since 2010, Lesch presents the show "Lesch's Kosmos", a 15-minute programme on the German documentary channel ZDFneo that deals with issues from various scientific fields.

'''Herbert Marcuse''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr|ˈ|k|uː|z|ə}}; {{IPA-de|maɐ̯ˈkuːzə|lang}}; July 19, 1898 – July 29, 1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory|Critical Theory]]. Born in [[Berlin]], Marcuse studied at the [[University of Berlin|universities of Berlin]] and then at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], where he received his PhD.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings. Westview Press, Boulder, CO. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent figure in the Frankfurt-based [[Institute for Social Research]] – what later became known as the [[Frankfurt School]]. He was married to Sophie Wertheim (1924–1951), Inge Neumann (1955–1973), and Erica Sherover (1976–1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/sophie/sophie.htm |title=Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/inge/inge.htm |title=Inge Neumann (1913–1973) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/ricky/ricky.htm |title=Erica Sherover-Marcuse (1938–1988) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his written works, he criticized [[capitalism]], modern technology, [[historical materialism]] and entertainment culture, arguing that they represent new forms of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. "A Survey of Modern Social Theory". Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in US government service for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) where he criticized the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in the book ''[[Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis]]'' (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the [[New Left]] and the student movements of [[West Germany]], France, and the United States; some consider him the "father of the New Left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKs0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177|page=177|title=The End of the Experiment: The Rise of Cultural Elites and the Decline of America's Civic Culture|first=Stanley|last=Rothman|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351295628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known works are ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955) and ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964). His [[Marxism|Marxist]] scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally.  He viewed the integration of [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] and ''[[Logos]]'' to be the liberation of society.&lt;ref name=marcuse64&gt;[https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm6.html Marcuse 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eroscivil /&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/ ''SEP'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=kApRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=marcuse+eros+and+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=marcuse%20eros%20and%20logos&amp;f=false | title=Eros and Revolution: The Critical Philosophy of Herbert Marcuse| isbn=9789004308701| last1=Castro| first1=Javier Sethness| date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Herbert Marcuse was born July 19, 1898, in [[Berlin]], to Carl Marcuse and Gertrud Kreslawsky. His family was [[Jewish]]. In 1916 he was drafted into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], but only worked in horse stables in Berlin during [[World War I]]. He then became a member of a Soldiers' Council that participated in the aborted [[socialism|socialist]] [[Spartacist uprising]]. He completed his PhD thesis at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1922 on the German ''[[Künstlerroman]]'' after which he moved back to Berlin, where he worked in publishing. In 1924 he married Sophie Wertheim, a mathematician. He returned to [[Freiburg]] in 1928 to study with [[Edmund Husserl]] and write a [[habilitation]] with [[Martin Heidegger]], which was published in 1932 as ''[[Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity]]'' (''Hegels Ontologie und die Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit''). This study was written in the context of the Hegel renaissance that was taking place in Europe with an emphasis on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ontology of life and history, idealist theory of spirit and dialectic.&lt;ref name=kellner12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm|title=Illuminations: Kellner|author=Douglas Kellner|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his academic career blocked by the rise of the [[Third Reich]], in 1933 Marcuse joined the [[Institute for Social Research]], popularly known as the [[Frankfurt School]], in 1932. He went almost at once into exile with them, first briefly in [[Geneva]], then in the [[United States]]. Unlike some others, Marcuse did not return to [[Germany]] after the war, and when he visited Frankfurt in 1956, the young [[Jürgen Habermas]] was surprised to discover that he was a key member of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Theory.html?id=sf93K6SYMxIC |title=Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings|author=Lemert, Charles|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=9780786749577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Marcuse published his first major review, of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]''. In this review, Marcuse revised the interpretation of [[Marxism]], from the standpoint of the works of the early Marx.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

While a member of the Institute of Social Research, Marcuse developed a model for critical social theory, created a theory of the new stage of state and monopoly capitalism, described the relationships between philosophy, social theory, and cultural criticism, and provided an analysis and critique of German fascism. Marcuse worked closely with critical theorists while at the institute.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

===Emigration to the United States===
After emigrating from Germany in 1933, Marcuse immigrated to the United States in 1934, where he became a citizen in 1940. Although he never returned to Germany to live, he remained one of the major theorists associated with the Frankfurt School, along with [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (among others). In 1940 he published ''Reason and Revolution'', a dialectical work studying [[G. W. F. Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].

===World War II===

During World War II, Marcuse first worked for the US [[Office of War Information]] (OWI) on anti-Nazi propaganda projects. In 1943, he transferred to the [[Research and Analysis Branch]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

Directed by the Harvard historian [[William L. Langer]], the Research and Analysis Branch was in fact the biggest American research institution in the first half of the twentieth century. At its zenith between 1943 and 1945, it comprised over twelve hundred employees, four hundred of whom were stationed abroad. In many respects, it was the site where post–World War II American social science was born, with protégés of some of the most esteemed American university professors, as well as a large contingent of European intellectual émigrés, in its ranks.

These men comprised the "theoretical brain trust" of the American war machine, which, according to its founder, [[William J. Donovan]], would function as a "final clearinghouse" for the secret services—that is, as a structure that, although not engaged in determining war strategy or tactics, would be able to assemble, organize, analyze, and filter the immense flow of military information directed toward Washington, thanks to the unique capacity of the specialists on hand to interpret the relevant sources.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Reports on Nazi Germany. The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort by [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]], Herbert Marcuse &amp; [[Otto Kirchheimer]] Edited by Raffaele Laudani (Princeton University Press 2013) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1943, Marcuse joined his fellow [[Frankfurt School]] scholar [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]] in R &amp; A's Central European Section as senior analyst and rapidly established himself as "the leading analyst on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Laudani, Secret Reports p3&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the OSS in 1945, Marcuse was employed by the [[US Department of State]] as head of the Central European section, retiring after the death of his first wife in 1951.

===Post-war===
In 1952, Marcuse began a teaching career as a political theorist, first at [[Columbia University]], then at [[Harvard University]]. Marcuse worked at [[Brandeis University]] from 1958 to 1965, then at the [[University of California San Diego]] until his retirement. It was during his time at [[Brandeis University]] that he wrote his most famous work, ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Anthony and Larry Ray. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Blackwell Publishers. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse was a friend and collaborator of the [[political sociology|political sociologist]] [[Barrington Moore Jr.]] and of the political philosopher [[Robert Paul Wolff]], and also a friend of the [[Columbia University]] sociology professor [[C. Wright Mills]], one of the founders of the [[New Left]] movement.  In his "Introduction" to ''One-Dimensional Man'', Marcuse wrote, "I should like to emphasize the vital importance of the work of C. Wright Mills."&lt;ref&gt;''One-Dimensional  Man (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period, Marcuse rejected the theory of [[class struggle]] and the Marxist concern with labor, instead claiming, according to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], that since "all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant." He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski 1981 416"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192851093|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse's critiques of [[capitalism|capitalist]] society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests and his essay ''[[Repressive Tolerance]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt; Marcuse soon became known in the media as "Father of the New Left."&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt;  Contending that the students of the sixties were not waiting for the publication of his work to act,&lt;ref name=marcuseweb&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/booksabout/70s/Bourne1979MarcuseGrandfatherNewLeft.pdf Tom Bourne (Sept. 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse brushed the media's branding of him as "Father of the New Left" aside lightly,&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt; saying "It would have been better to call me not the father, but the grandfather, of the New Left."&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt;  His work heavily influenced intellectual discourse on [[popular culture]] and scholarly [[popular culture studies]]. He had many speaking engagements in the US and [[Western Bloc]] in the late 1960s and 1970s. He became a close friend and inspirer of the French philosopher [[André Gorz]].

Marcuse defended the arrested [[East Germany|East German]] dissident [[Rudolf Bahro]] (author of ''Die Alternative: Zur Kritik des real existierenden Sozialismus'' [trans., ''The Alternative in Eastern Europe'']), discussing in a 1979 essay Bahro's theories of "change from within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stefan Meretz |url=http://www.opentheory.org/marcuse_ueber_bahro/text.phtml |title=open theory · offene theorie: Protosozialismus und Spätkapitalismus.

===The New Left and radical politics===
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Many radical scholars and activists were influenced by Marcuse, such as [[Norman O. Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dufresne, Todd |title=Tales from the Freudian Crypt: The Death Drive in Text and Context |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |year=2000 |page=112 |isbn=978-0-8047-3885-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angela Davis]],&lt;ref name="Ebony-July1971"&gt;{{cite news

(See the List of Scholars and Activists link, below.) Among those who critiqued him from the left were [[Marxist humanism|Marxist-humanist]] [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], fellow German emigre [[Paul Mattick]], both of whom subjected ''One-Dimensional Man'' to a Marxist critique, and [[Noam Chomsky]], who knew and liked Marcuse "but thought very little of his work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Barsky |first= Robert |year= 1997 |title= Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= MIT Press |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=RKUbyYPG4mcC&amp;pg=PA134 134] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse's 1965 essay "[[Repressive Tolerance]]", in which he claimed capitalist [[democracy|democracies]] can have [[totalitarian]] aspects, has been criticized by conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/booksabout/haters/haters.htm marcuse.org (books about)]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse argues that genuine tolerance does not permit support for "repression", since doing so ensures that marginalized voices will remain unheard. He characterizes tolerance of repressive speech as "inauthentic". Instead, he advocates a form of tolerance that is intolerant of repressive (namely right-wing) political movements:

{{quote|Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left.

Surely, no government can be expected to foster its own subversion, but in a democracy such a right is vested in the people (i.e. in the majority of the people). This means that the ways should not be blocked on which a subversive majority could develop, and if they are blocked by organized repression and indoctrination, their reopening may require apparently undemocratic means. They would include the withdrawal of toleration of speech and assembly from groups and movements that promote aggressive policies, armament, chauvinism, discrimination on the grounds of race and religion, or that oppose the extension of public services, social security, medical care, etc.&lt;ref name="marcuse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/60spubs/65repressivetolerance.htm |title=Repressive Tolerance, by Herbert Marcuse (1965) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marcuse later expressed his radical ideas through three pieces of writing. He wrote ''[[An Essay on Liberation]]'' in 1969, in which he celebrated liberation movements such as those in [[Vietnam]], which inspired many radicals. In 1972 he wrote ''[[Counterrevolution and Revolt]]'', which argues that the hopes of the 1960s were facing a counterrevolution from the right.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

After Brandeis denied the renewal of his teaching contract in 1965, Marcuse taught at the [[University of California San Diego]] until his retirement and devoted the rest of his life to teaching, writing and giving lectures around the world. His efforts brought him attention from the media, which claimed that he openly advocated violence, although he often clarified that only "violence of defense" could be appropriate, not "violence of aggression". He continued to promote Marxian theory, with some of his students helping to spread his ideas. He published his final work ''[[The Aesthetic Dimension]]'' in 1979 on the role of art in the process of what he termed "emancipation" from bourgeois society.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

===Marriages===
[[Image:Grave-of-Herbert-Marcuse.jpg|thumb|Grave in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery]], Berlin, where Marcuse's ashes were buried in 2003]]

Marcuse married three times. His first wife was [[mathematician]] Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951), with whom he had a son, Peter (born 1928). Herbert's second marriage was to Inge Neumann (1910–1973), the widow of his close friend [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]] (1900–1954). His third wife was Erica Sherover (1938–1988), a former graduate student and forty years his junior, whom he married in 1976. His son [[Peter Marcuse]] is professor emeritus of [[urban planning]] at [[Columbia University]]. His granddaughter is the novelist [[Irene Marcuse]] and his grandson, [[Harold Marcuse]], is a professor of history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

===Death===
On July 29, 1979, ten days after his eighty-first birthday, Marcuse died after suffering a [[stroke]] during a visit to Germany. He had spoken at the Frankfurt ''Römerberggespräche'', and was on his way to the [[Max Planck Society#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in Starnberg, on invitation from second-generation Frankfurt School theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In 2003, after his ashes were rediscovered in the United States, they were buried in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery]] in Berlin.

==Philosophy and views==
Marcuse's famous concept [[repressive desublimation]] refers to his argument that postwar mass culture, with its profusion of sexual provocations, serves to reinforce political repression. If people are preoccupied with inauthentic sexual stimulation, their political energy will be "desublimated"; instead of acting constructively to change the world, they remain repressed and uncritical. Marcuse advanced the prewar thinking of critical theory toward a critical account of the "one-dimensional" nature of bourgeois life in Europe and America. His thinking could, therefore, also be considered an advance of the concerns of earlier liberal critics such as [[David Riesman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Key_Contemporary_Social_Theorists.html?id=fTowST-_gmYC |title=Key Contemporary Social Theorists – Google Books|date= 2002-10-22|accessdate=2013-09-06|isbn=9780631219729|last1=Elliott|first1=Anthony|last2=Ray|first2=Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Marcuse's philosophy was centered around the belief that [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] had to integrate with ''[[Logos]]'' in order to strive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marcuse-Eros-and-Civilization-Part-I-Under-the-Rule-of-the-Reality-Principle1.pdf freudians.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://footnotes2plato.com/2011/03/25/psychoanalysis-and-philosophy-towards-the-eroticization-of-logos/ footnotes2plato.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defended Plato's argument that while Eros was constructive, ''Logos'' was superior and would eventually absorb it.&lt;ref name=eroscivil&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=autxu8JMA1gC&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Eros and Civilization|author=Herbert Marcuse|publisher=Beacon Press|page=125–126|date=1955|accessdate=September 1, 2018|isbn=9780807015551}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''One Dimensional Man'', he argued that ''Logos'' would also liberate's one's gratification.&lt;ref name=marcuse64 /&gt;

Two aspects of Marcuse's work are of particular importance, first, his use of language more familiar from the critique of Soviet or Nazi regimes to characterize developments in the advanced industrial world; and second, his grounding of critical theory in a particular use of psychoanalytic thought. Both of these features of his thinking have often been misunderstood and have given rise to critiques of his work that miss the point of his targets.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Blackwell Publishing. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcuse's early "Heideggerian Marxism"===
During his years in Freiburg, Marcuse wrote a series of essays that explored the possibility of synthesizing Marxism and Heidegger's fundamental ontology, as begun in the latter's work ''Being and Time'' (1927). This early interest in Heidegger followed Marcuse's demand for "concrete philosophy," which, he declared in 1928, "concerns itself with the truth of contemporaneous human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "On Concrete Philosophy." 1929. In Heideggerian Marxism. Eds. John Abromeit and Richard Wolin. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; These words were directed against the neo-Kantianism of the mainstream, and against both the revisionist and orthodox Marxist alternatives, in which the subjectivity of the individual played little role.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of Marcuse's perspectives on the Marxisms of his day, see Benhabib's introduction to Hegel's Ontology. (Marcuse, Herbert. Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity. 1932. Trans. Seyla Benhabib. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987. pp. xi–xix.)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Marcuse quickly distanced himself from Heidegger following Heidegger's endorsement of Nazism, it has been suggested by thinkers such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] that an understanding of Marcuse's later thinking demands an appreciation of his early Heideggerian influence.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Marcuse, Herbert. ''Heideggerian Marxism'', edited by Richard Wolin and John Abromeit, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005, pp. xi–xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcuse and capitalism===
Marcuse's analysis of capitalism derives partially from one of Karl Marx's main concepts: Objectification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#objectification |title=Glossary of Terms: Ob |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which under capitalism becomes Alienation. Marx believed that capitalism was exploiting humans; that by producing objects of a certain character, laborers became alienated and this ultimately dehumanized them into functional objects themselves. Marcuse took this belief and expanded it. He argued that capitalism and industrialization pushed laborers so hard that they began to see themselves as extensions of the objects they were producing. At the beginning of ''One-Dimensional Man'' Marcuse writes, "The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/quotes/QuotRedThread.html#Capitalism marcuse.org (quotations)]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that under capitalism (in consumer society) humans become extensions of the commodities that they buy, thus making commodities extensions of people's minds and bodies. Affluent mass technological societies, he argues, are totally controlled and manipulated. In societies based upon mass production and mass distribution, the individual worker has become merely a consumer of its commodities and entire commodified way of life. Modern Capitalism has created false needs and false consciousness geared to consumption of [[commodities]]: it locks one-dimensional man into the one-dimensional society which produced the need for people to recognize themselves in their commodities.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_A_Z_guide_to_modern_social_and_polit.html?id=_1mFAAAAMAAJ |title=The A–Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists |publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1997|authors=Parker, Noel; Sim, Stuart|isbn=9780135248850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very mechanism that ties the individual to his society has changed and social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced. Most important of all, the pressure of consumerism has led to the total integration of the working class into the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system. Its political parties and trade unions have become thoroughly bureaucratized and the power of [[Negative dialectics|negative thinking]] or critical reflection has rapidly declined.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; The working class is no longer a potentially subversive force capable of bringing about revolutionary change. As a result, rather than looking to the workers as the revolutionary vanguard, Marcuse put his faith in an alliance between radical intellectuals and those groups not yet integrated into one-dimensional society, the socially marginalized, the substratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and persecuted of other ethnicities and other colors, the unemployed and the unemployable. These were the people whose standards of living demanded the ending of intolerable conditions and institutions and whose resistance to one-dimensional society would not be diverted by the system. Their opposition was revolutionary even if their consciousness was not.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_A_Z_guide_to_modern_social_and_polit.html?id=_1mFAAAAMAAJ |title=The A–Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists |publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1997|authors=Parker, Noel; Sim, Stuart|isbn=9780135248850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Leszek Kołakowski]] described Marcuse's views as essentially anti-Marxist, in that they ignored Marx's critique of Hegel and discarded the historical theory of [[class struggle]] entirely in favor of an inverted Freudian reading of human history where all social rules could and should be discarded to create a "New World of Happiness." Kołakowski concluded that Marcuse's ideal society "is to be ruled despotically by an enlightened group [who] have realized in themselves the unity of ''Logos'' and Eros, and thrown off the vexatious authority of logic, mathematics, and the empirical sciences."&lt;ref name="Kołakowski 1981 416"/&gt;

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] asserted that almost all of Marcuse's key positions are false and that his generalizations were based upon the total absence of any account of contemporary social structure. Featherstone criticized his portrayal of modern consumerism: it falsely assumed that consumers were completely passive, uncritically responding to corporate advertising.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Herbert Marcuse appealed to students of the New Left through his emphasis on the power of critical thought and his vision of total human emancipation and a non-repressive civilization. He supported students he felt were subject to the pressures of a commodifying system, and has been regarded as an inspirational intellectual leader.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt; He is also considered among the most influential of the Frankfurt School critical theorists on North American culture, due to his studies on student and counter-cultural movements on the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. A Survey of Modern Social Theory. Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of the 1960s, of which Marcuse was a vital part, lives on, and the [[Great Refusal]] is still practiced by oppositional groups and individuals who refuse to conform to the existing systems of oppression and domination.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt;

Wolf von Laer, in a podcast titled ''Campus Speech and the Libertarian Student Movement'', cites the influence of Marcuse as an unacknowledged source for the disruptive tactics of the "New Left" on today's campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/multimedia/cato-daily-podcast/campus-speech-libertarian-student-movement cato.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]]), which is widely seen as the earliest extant printed book]]

Traditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing ([[xylography]]) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Fifty Wonders of Korea"&gt;Fifty Wonders of Korea: Volume 1. Seoul: Samjung Munhwasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-1-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of [[Xi'an]] (then called [[Chang'an]], the capital of Tang China), [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;Pan, Jixing.

Pages 979&amp;ndash;980.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or [[Lotus Sutra]] printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|The Pure Light Dharani Sutra is the world's oldest surviving woodblock print.]]

In [[Korea]], an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}), discovered in [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]] in a [[Silla]] dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=149,150}}&lt;/ref&gt; was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the [[Seokgatap|Shakyamuni Pagoda]] of [[Bulguk Temple]], Kyongju Province in 751 AD.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith|title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn= 978-1861893352|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593746&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 Early Printing in Korea.

=== The printing process ===

The manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.

To print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.

Sample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of printing in East Asia ===
Printing started in China in 593 AD.&lt;ref name="minnesota-china.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.
 
The Buddhist scroll known as the "Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light" or "Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra" ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|title=Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001405/http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736|title=Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at [[Haeinsa]]. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the [[Goryeo]] government collection numbered several tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], one thousand copies of the [[Lotus sutra]] were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=338–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward movement of printing started from eastern [[Turkestan]] where printing in the [[Uyghur language]] appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at [[Turfan]] as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the [[Mongol]]s conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated [[Persia]] in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in [[Tabriz]] in 1294, following the Chinese system. The [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani#Book transmission: printing and translation|first description of the Chinese printing system]] was made by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1301–11 in his history of the world.

Some fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in [[Egypt]] printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 1955, pp 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the print scholar [[A. Hyatt Mayor]], "it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age."&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos. 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by [[Typography|western-style printing]], initially [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The phase of technological development that distinguished China's and particularly Shanghai's early Westernized printing industry was that involving lithography."

{{Further|Movable type}}

=== Ceramic movable type in China ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;Man, John. ''The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world'' (c) 2002 Headline Book Publishing, a division of Hodder Headline, London. {{ISBN|0-7472-4504-5}}. A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

:When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

:For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

:If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

In 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂杂记》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐忆农《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001, p22&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;

=== Wooden movable type in China ===
Wooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the ''[[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]]'' that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang Yuzhen (张玉珍) |title=世界上现存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛经《吉祥遍至口和本续》介绍 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal=Library and Information (《图书与情报》) |year=2003 |issue=1 |url=http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn=1003-6938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s whose command is required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.

=== Metal movable type in China ===
Bronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/ 韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步]&lt;/ref&gt; in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued in large scale and in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], there is mention of [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]
During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia [[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]] (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725, the [[Qing dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|[[Jikji]], "Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters", the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, printed in [[Korea]] in 1377. Bibliothèque Nationale de France.]]

The transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'' were printed with movable metal type in 1234.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the [[Joseon]] dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):

:''At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy &lt;nowiki&gt;[clay]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters &lt;nowiki&gt;[molds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative molds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;Michael Twyman, ''The British Library Guide to Printing: History and Techniques'', London: The British Library, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802081797&amp;id=KXoaalwyOjAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=korea+gutenberg+surviving&amp;sig=4QBhy9ty1jbXJASJcUzFBDfKbGo available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:

:''Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.''&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April–June  1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe&amp;mdash;when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters called [[Hangul]] for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.

Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a Western [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], printing equipment&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). ''Images of the Floating World''. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. P.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961). ''A History of Japan: 1334–1615''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

== Comparison of woodblock and movable type in East Asia ==
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|China Block Printing Museum in [[Yangzhou]]]]

Despite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of [[lithography]] and [[photolithography]] in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.

Given that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.

This system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.

It is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.

As a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

== Mechanical presses ==

Mechanical presses as used in [[Europe]]an printing remained unknown in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;printing. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 5, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual "rubbing" with a hand tool.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt; In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83,&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman, "Korea's First Newspaper: The Japanese Chosen shinpo", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4. (August 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;685–696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Melvin McGovern"&gt;Melvin McGovern, "Early Western Presses in Korea", ''Korea Journal'', 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (34).&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (33 ''et seq.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p.&amp;nbsp;64–127 , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.

'''Inclusion''', in [[education]] refers to the a model wherein [[special needs]] students spend most or all of their time with non-special (general education) needs students.  It arises in the context of special education with an [[individualized education program]] or [[504 plan]], and is built on the notion that it is more effective for students with special needs to have said mixed experience for them to be more successful in social interactions leading to further success in life.  Inclusion rejects but still provides the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities. Schools with inclusive classrooms do not believe in separate classrooms. They do not have their own separate world so they have to learn how to operate with students while being less focused on by teachers due to a higher student to teacher ratio.

Implementation of these practices varies.  Schools most frequently use the inclusion model for selected students with mild to moderate special needs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, K.E., Schwartz, I&lt;/ref&gt;  Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, do not separate "general education" and "special education" programs; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scheyer ''et al.'' (1996). The Inclusive Classroom Teacher Created Materials, Inc. ''[http://lib.syndetics.com/hw7.pl?isbn=1557348804/LC.JPG The Inclusive Classroom]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the 'integration' or '[[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreaming]]' model of education, which tended to be concerned principally with disability and special educational needs, and learners changing or becoming 'ready for' or deserving of accommodation by the mainstream.  By contrast, inclusion is about the child's right to participate and the school's duty to accept the child.

A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights.  Feeling included is not limited to physical and cognitive disabilities, but also includes the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and of other forms of human differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Inclusive Design|url=http://idrc.ocadu.ca/about-the-idrc|website=Inclusive Design Research Centre|publisher=OCAD University|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett wrote, "student performance and behaviour in educational tasks can be profoundly affected by the way we feel, we are seen and judged by others.  When we expect to be viewed as inferior, our abilities seem to diminish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Richard|last2=Pickett|first2=Kate|title=The Spirit Level- Why Equity is Better for Everyone|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location=England|isbn=978-0-241-95429-4|pages=113|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and mainstreaming==
Inclusion has different historical roots which may be integration of students with severe disabilities in the US (who may previously been excluded from schools or even lived in institutions)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. &amp; Ferguson, D. (1985). A summary of strategies utilized in model programs and resource materials. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Integration of Students with Severe Handicaps in Regular Schools''. Washington, DC: The Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnorr, R. (1990). Peter? He comes and goes...First graders' perspectives on a part-time mainstream student. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 15(4): 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. (1986, winter). Education Integration/Integracion Scolaire. ''Entourage'', 1(1): 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; or an inclusion model from Canada and the US (e.g., Syracuse University, New York) which is very popular with inclusion teachers who believe in participatory learning, cooperative learning, and inclusive classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sapon-Shevin, M., Ayres, B., &amp; Duncan, J. (1994). Cooperative learning and inclusion. In: J. S. Thousand, R.A. Villa, &amp; A.I. Nevins, ''Creativity and Collaborative Learning: A Practical Guide to Empowering Students and Teachers''. (pp. 45-58). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the early university 
  professor's work (e.g., 1970s, Education Professor Carol Berrigan of Syracuse University, 1985; Douglas Biklen, Dean of School of Education through 2011) in ''[[Educational integration|integration]]'' and ''mainstreaming''&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1985). ''Achieving the Complete School: Strategies for Effective Mainsreaming''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which were taught throughout the world including in international seminars in Italy. Mainstreaming (e.g., the Human Policy Press poster; If you thought the wheel was a good idea, you'll like the ramp)tended to be concerned about "readiness" of all parties for the new coming together of students with significant needs. Thus, integration and mainstreaming principally was concerned about disability and 'special educational needs' (since the children were not in the regular schools) and involved teachers, students, principals, administrators, School Boards, and parents changing and becoming 'ready for'&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, C., Palombaro, M., &amp; Hollowood, T. (1993). On the nature and change of an inclusive elementary school. ''JASH'', 18(2): 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt; students who needed accommodation or new methods of curriculum and instruction (e.g., required federal IEPs – [[individualized education program]])&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, P., Goetz, L., &amp; Anderson, J. (1986, Summer). The quality of IEP objectives associated with placement on integrated versus segregated school sites. ''The Journal of The Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 11(2): 125-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M. &amp; Browder, D.M. (1986, Spring). Community-referenced instruction: Research and issues. ''JASH'', 11(1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, P.S. (1994, Spring). Judgment of the social validity of instructional strategies used in community-based instructional sites. ''JASH'', 19(1): 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Table 6.3: Curriculum for students with severe handicaps. ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 134). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, A. &amp; Davern, L. (1989). Moving forward on school integration: Strategies for involving studennt with severe disabilities in the life of the school. In: R. Gaylord-Ross, ''Integration Strategies for Persons with Handicaps''. (pp. 11-31). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, inclusion is about the child’s right to participate and the school’s duty to accept the child returning to the US Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education decision and the new Individuals with Disabilities Education (Improvement) Act (IDEIA).  Inclusion rejects the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms, which remain popular among large multi-service providers, to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities.  A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities, in contrast to earlier concept of partial participation in the mainstream,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Schwarz, P., Udvari-Solner, A., Kampchroer, E., Johnson, F., Jorgensen, J., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1991, Spring). How much time should students with severe intellectual disabilities spend in regular education classrooms and elsewhere? ''JASH'', 16(1): 39-47.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights. Inclusion gives students with disabilities skills they can use in and out of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;"Students learn the importance of individual and group contributions and develop valuable life skills that are often unexplored in less inclusive settings" (Tapasak 216). Tapasak, Renee and Christine Walther-Thomas. "Evaluation of a First-Year Inclusion Program:Student Perceptions and Classroom Performance." Remedial and Special Education 20(1999): 216-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fully inclusive schools and general or special education policies==
Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, no longer distinguish between "general education" and "[[special education]]" programs which refers to the debates and federal initiatives of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. (1989). The regular education initiative debate: Its promises and pitfalls. ''Exceptional Children'', 55(5): 440-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, J. (1989). The regular education initiative as Reagan-Bush education policy: A trickle down theory of the education of the hard-to-teach. ''The Journal of Special Education'', 23(3): 256- 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, S. &amp; Stainback, W. (1984). A rationale for the merger of special and regular education. ''Exceptional Children'', 51: 102-11.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Community Integration Project&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, J. &amp; Meyer, L. (1986). Principles and practices for school integration of students with severe disabilities: An overview of the literature. In: M. Berres &amp; P. Knoblock, ''Managerial Models of Mainstreaming''. Rockville, MD: Aspen.&lt;/ref&gt; and the debates on home schools and special education-regular education classrooms;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Long, E., Udvari-Solner, A., Schwarz, P., VenDeventer, P., et al. (1989, Spring). Should students with severe intellectual disabilities be based in regular or in special education classrooms in home schools? ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 14(1): 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sailor, W. (1991, November/December). Special education in the restructured school. ''Remedial and Special Education'', 12(6): 8-22.&lt;/ref&gt; All approaches to inclusive schooling require administrative and managerial changes to move from the traditional approaches to elementary and high school education.&lt;ref&gt;Sage, D.D. (1996). Administrative strategies for achieving inclusive schooling. (pp. 105-116). In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion remains in 2015 as part of school (e.g., Powell &amp; Lyle, 1997, now to the most integrated setting from LRE)&lt;ref&gt;Powell, D. &amp; Hyle, A. (12997, May). Principals and school reform: Barriers to inclusion in three secondary schools. ''Journal of School Leadership'', Volume 7: 301-326&lt;/ref&gt; and educational reform initiatives in the US&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, T.G. (1989). Book Review of D. K. Liptsky and A. Gartner, ''School Reform for All Students: An Essay Review of Beyond Separate Education: Quality Education for All''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of the world. Inclusion is an effort to improve quality in education in the fields of disability, is a common theme in educational reform for decades,&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., (1999). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 219). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006). Inclusion has been researched and studied for decades, though reported lighly in the public with early studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous ability groupings (Stainback &amp; Stainback, 1989),&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, W. &amp; Stainback, W. C. (1989). Classroom organization for diversity among students. In: D. Biklen, D. Ferguson &amp; Al Ford, ''Schooling and Disability''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; studies of critical friends and inclusion facilitators (e.g., Jorgensen &amp; Tashie, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. &amp; Tashie, C. (2000). Turning points: The story of high school inclusion in New Hampshire. (pp. 131-176). In: J. Nisbet &amp; D. Hagner, ''Part of the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; self-contained to general education reversal of 90% (Fried &amp; Jorgensen, 1998),&lt;ref&gt;Fried, R.L. &amp; Jorgensen, C.M (1998). Equity and excellence: Finding common ground between inclusive education and school reform. In: C. M. Jorgensen, ''Restructuring High School For All Students''. (pp. 15–28). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; among many others obtaining doctoral degrees throughout the US.

==Classification of students and educational practices==
Classification of students by disability is standard in educational systems which use diagnostic, educational and psychological testing, among others. However, inclusion has been associated with its own planning, including MAPS which Jack Pearpoint leads with still leads in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. &amp; Pearpoint, J.. (1992). MAPS: Action planning. (pp. 52–56). In: J. Pearpoint, M. Forest, &amp; J. Snow, ''The Inclusion Papers: Strategies to Make Inclusion Work''. Toronto, Canada: The Inclusion Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[person-centred planning]] with John O'Brien and Connie Lyle O'Brien who view inclusion as a force for school renewal.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Lyle O'Brien, C. (1996). Inclusion as a force for school renewal. In : S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion has two sub-types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrE8sgg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |df= }} Definition of inclusion, accessed October 11, 2007.  2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; the first is sometimes called '''regular inclusion''' or '''partial inclusion''', and the other is '''full inclusion'''.&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;Bowe, Frank.  (2005).  ''Making Inclusion Work''.  Merrill Education/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inclusive practice'' is not always inclusive but is a form of integration.  For example, students with special needs are educated in regular classes for nearly all of the day, or at least for more than half of the day.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Whenever possible, the students receive any additional help or special instruction in the general classroom, and the student is treated like a full member of the class. However, most specialized services are provided outside a regular classroom, particularly if these services require special equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class (such as [[speech therapy]]), and students are pulled out of the regular classroom for these services.  In this case, the student occasionally leaves the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services, such as speech and language therapy, [[occupational therapy|occupational]] and/or [[physical therapy]], psychological services, and social work.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; This approach can be very similar to many [[mainstreaming in education|mainstreaming]] practices, and may differ in little more than the educational ideals behind it.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;

In the "full inclusion" setting, the students with special needs are always educated alongside students without special needs, as the first and desired option while maintaining appropriate supports and services. Some educators say this might be more effective for the students with special needs.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology&gt;"Understanding Psychology Eighth Edition", Feldman, Robert S. (2008), page 309. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the extreme, full inclusion is the integration of all students, even those that require the most substantial educational and behavioral supports and services to be successful in regular classes and the elimination of special, segregated special education classes.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt; Special education is considered a service, not a place and those services are integrated into the daily routines (See, ecological inventories) and classroom structure, environment, curriculum and strategies and brought to the student, instead of removing the student to meet his or her individual needs. However, this approach to full inclusion is somewhat controversial, and it is not widely understood or applied to date.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Student teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of children with special needs. Educational Psychology,'' Hastings. R.P., &amp; Oakford, S. (2003), page 23, 87-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mainstreaming to full inclusion: From orthogenesis to pathogenesis of an idea. International Journal of Disability, Development, and Education,'' Kavale, K.A. (2002), page 49, 201-214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Attitudes of elementary school principals toward the inclusion of students with disabilities. Exceptional Children,'' Praisner, C. L. (2003), page 69, 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more commonly, local educational agencies have the responsibility to organize services for children with disabilities. They may provide a variety of settings, from special classrooms to mainstreaming to inclusion, and assign, as teachers and administrators often do, students to the system that seems most likely to help the student achieve his or her individual educational goals.  Students with mild or moderate disabilities, as well as disabilities that do not affect academic achievement, such as using power [[wheelchair]], scooter or other mobility device, are most likely to be fully included; indeed, children with polio or with leg injuries have grown to be leaders and teachers in government and universities; self advocates travel across the country and to different parts of the world. However, students with all types of disabilities from all the different disability categories (See, also 2012 book by Michael Wehmeyer from the University of Kansas) have been successfully included in general education classes, working and achieving their individual educational goals in regular school environments and activities (reference needed).

===Alternatives to inclusion programs: school procedures and community development===
Students with disabilities who are not included are typically either mainstreamed or segregated.

A [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] student attends some general education classes, typically for less than half the day, and often for less academically rigorous, or if you will, more interesting and career-oriented classes.  For example, a young student with significant [[intellectual disabilities]] might be mainstreamed for physical education classes, art classes and storybook time, but spend reading and mathematics classes with other students that have similar disabilities ("needs for the same level of academic instruction"). They may have access to a [[resource room]] for remediation or enhancement of course content, or for a variety of group and individual meetings and consultations.

A segregated student attends no classes with non-disabled students with disability a tested category determined before or at school entrance.  He or she might attend a [[special school]] termed residential schools that only enrolls other students with disabilities, or might be placed in a dedicated, self-contained classroom in a school that also enrolls general education students.  The latter model of integration, like the 1970s Jowonio School in Syracuse, is often highly valued when combined with teaching such as [[Montessori education]] techniques. Home schooling was also a popular alternative among highly educated parents with children with significant disabilities.

Residential schools have been criticized for decades, and the government has been asked repeatedly to keep funds and services in the local districts, including for family support services for parents who may be currently single and raising a child with significant challenges on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). ''Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All''. Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs may already be involved with early childhood education which can have a [[family support]] component emphasizing the strengths of the child and family.&lt;ref&gt;Dunst, C.J. &amp; Trivette, C.M.

==Legal issues: education law and disability laws==
The new anti-discriminatory climate has provided the basis for much change in policy and statute, nationally and internationally. Inclusion has been enshrined at the same time that segregation and discrimination have been rejected. Articulations of the new developments in ways of thinking, in policy and in law include:
* The UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) which sets out children’s rights in respect of freedom from discrimination and in respect of the representation of their wishes and views.
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] of [[UNESCO]] prohibits any discrimination, [[social exclusion|exclusion]] or [[racial segregation|segregation]] in education.
* The [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/inclusive-education/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921043927/http://www.unesco.org/en/inclusive-education/ |archivedate=September 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salamanca Statement (1994) which calls on all governments to give the highest priority to inclusive education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/SALAMA_E.PDF ''Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs.''] (PDF-File, 198 KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the least restrictive to the most integrated setting===
For [[special education in the United States|schools in the United States]], the federal requirement that students be educated in the historic [[least restrictive environment]] that is [[reasonable]] encourages the implementation of inclusion of students previously excluded by the school system.&lt;ref&gt;Karp, N. &amp; Taylor, S.J. (1988). ''The Least Restrictive Environment and Community Integration: A Leadership Institute''. Washington, DC and Syracuse, NY: National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation and Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, M., Blacher, J., Duffy, S., Hardman, M., McDonnell, J., Nisbet, J., Safer, N., &amp; Snell, M.

Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and the American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a critical critique of the LRE principle, commonly used to guide US schools, indicates that it often places restrictions and segregation on the individuals with the most severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. (1988, Spring). Caught in the continuum: A critical analysis of the principles of the least restrictive environment. ''JASH'', 13(1): 41-53.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, individuals with significant disabilities and their families and caregivers were already living quality lives in homes and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Racino, J., Knoll, J., &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M.

(2012). ''Olmstead Implementation and the Concept of the Most Integrated Setting''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; as described by the national Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, which should result in better achievement of national integration and inclusion goals in the 21st Century.

==Inclusion rates in the world: "frequency of use"==
The proportion of students with disabilities who are ''included'' varies by place and by type of disability, but it is relatively common for students with milder disabilities and less common with certain kinds of severe disabilities.  In Denmark, 99% of students with [[learning disabilities]] like 'dyslexia' are placed in general education classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vouchers Help the Learning Disabled:  Lesson from 22 countries: Special-education students thrive in private schools

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, three out of five students with learning disabilities spend the  majority of their time in the general education classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009). [http://www.ncld.org/stateofld The State of Learning Disabilities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706072327/http://www.ncld.org/stateofld |date=2009-07-06 }} New York, NY: National Center for Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postsecondary statistics (after high school) are kept by universities and government on the success rates of students entering college, and most are eligible for either disability services (e.g., accommodations and aides) or programs on college campuses, such as supported education in psychiatric disabilities or College for Living. The former are fully integrated college degree programs with college and vocational rehabilitation services (e.g., payments for textbooks, readers or translators), and the latter courses developed similar to retirement institutes (e.g., banking for retirees).

==Principles and necessary resources==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}Although once hailed,{{By whom|date=August 2016}} usually by its opponents, as a way to increase achievement while decreasing costs, full inclusion does not save money, but is more cost-beneficial and cost-effective. It is not designed to reduce students' needs, and its first priority may not even be to improve academic outcomes; in most cases, it merely moves the special education professionals (now dual certified for all students in some states) out of "their own special education" classrooms and into a corner of the general classroom or as otherwise designed by the "teacher-in-charge" and "administrator-in-charge".  To avoid harm to the academic education of students with disabilities, a full panoply of services and resources is required (of education for itself), including:&lt;ref&gt;This list from the [[Utah Education Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate supports and services for the student
* Well-designed [[individualized education program]]s
* Professional development for all teachers involved, general and special educators alike
* Time for teachers to plan, meet, create, and evaluate the students together
* Reduced class size based on the severity of the student needs
* Professional skill development in the areas of cooperative learning, peer tutoring, adaptive curriculum
* Collaboration between parents or guardians, teachers or para educators, specialists, administration, and outside agencies.
* Sufficient funding so that schools will be able to develop programs for students based on student need instead of the availability of funding.
Indeed, the students with special needs do receive funds from the federal government, by law originally the Educational for All Handicapped Children Act of 1974 to the present day, Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which requires its use in the most integrated setting.

In principle, several factors can determine the success of inclusive classrooms:
* Family-school partnerships
* Collaboration between general and special educators
* Well-constructed plans that identify specific accommodations, modifications, and goals for each student
* Coordinated planning and communication between "general" and "special needs" staff
* Integrated service delivery
* Ongoing training and staff development
* Leadership of teachers and administrators

By the mid-1980s, school integration leaders in the university sector already had detailed schemas (e.g., curriculum, student days, students with severe disabilities in classrooms) with later developments primarily in assistive technology and communication, school reform and transformation, personal assistance of user-directed aides, and increasing emphasis on social relationships and cooperative learning.  In 2015, most important are evaluations of the populations still in special schools, including those who may be deaf-blind, and the leadership by inclusion educators, who often do not yet go by that name, in the education and community systems.

===Differing views of inclusion and integration===
However, early integrationists{{Who|date=August 2016}} [[community integration]] would still recommend greater emphasis on programs related to sciences, the arts (e.g., exposure), curriculum integrated field trips, and literature as opposed to the sole emphasis on community referenced curriculum. For example, a global citizen studying the environment might be involved with planting a tree ("independent mobility"), or going to an arboretum ("social and relational skills"), developing a science project with a group ("contributing ideas and planning"), and having two core modules in the curriculum.

However, students will need to either continue to secondary school (meet academic testing standards), make arrangements for employment, supported education, or home/day services (transition services), and thus, develop the skills for future life (e.g., academic math skills and calculators; planning and using recipes or leisure skills) in the educational classrooms. Inclusion often involved individuals who otherwise might be at an institution or residential facility.

Today, longitudinal studies follow the outcomes of students with disabilities in classrooms, which include college graduations and quality of life outcomes. To be avoided are negative outcomes that include forms of institutionalization.

==Common practices in inclusive classrooms==
Students in an inclusive classroom are generally placed with their chronological age-mates, regardless of whether the students are working above or below the typical academic level for their age.  Also, to encourage a sense of belonging, emphasis is placed on the value of friendships. Teachers often nurture a relationship between a student with special needs and a same-age student without a special educational need. Another common practice is the assignment of a [[wikt:buddy|buddy]] to accompany a student with special needs at all times (for example in the cafeteria, on the playground, on the bus and so on). This is used to show students that a diverse group of people make up a community, that no one type of student is better than another, and to remove any barriers to a friendship that may occur if a student is viewed as "helpless." Such practices reduce the chance for elitism among students in later grades and encourage cooperation among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Strully, J., &amp; Strully, C. (1996). Friendships as an educational goal: What we have learned and where we are headed. In W. Stainback &amp; S. Stainback (Eds.), ''Inclusion: A guide for educators''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers use a number of techniques to help build classroom communities:
* Using games designed to build community
* Involving students in solving problems
* Sharing songs and books that teach community
* Openly dealing with individual differences by discussion
* Assigning classroom jobs that build community
* Teaching students to look for ways to help each other
* Utilizing [[physical therapy]] equipment such as [[standing frames]], so students who typically use wheelchairs can stand when the other students are standing and more actively participate in activities
* Encouraging students to take the role of teacher and deliver instruction (e.g. read a portion of a book to a student with severe disabilities)
* Focusing on the strength of a student with special needs
* Create classroom checklists
* Take breaks when necessary
* Create an area for children to calm down
* Organize student desk in groups
* Create a self and welcoming environment
* Set ground rules and stick with them
* Help establish short-term goals
* Design a multi-faced curriculum
* Communicate regular with parents and/or caregivers
* Seek support from other special education teachers

'''Inclusionary practices are commonly utilized by using the following team-teaching models:'''
* One teach, one support:
In this model, the content teacher will deliver the lesson and the special education teacher will assist students individual needs and enforce classroom management as needed.
* One teach, one observe:
In this model, the teacher with the most experience in the content will deliver the lesson and the other teacher will float or observe.  This model is commonly used for data retrieval during IEP observations or Functional Behavior Analysis.
* Station teaching (rotational teaching):
In this model, the room is divided into stations in which the students will visit with their small groups.  Generally, the content teacher will deliver the lesson in his/her group, and the special education teacher will complete a review or adapted version of the lesson with the students.
* Parallel teaching:
In this model, one half of the class is taught by the content teacher and one half is taught by the special education teacher.  Both groups are being taught the same lesson, just in a smaller group.
* Alternative teaching:
In this method, the content teacher will teach the lesson to the class, while the special education teacher will teach a small group of students an alternative lesson.
* Team teaching (content/support shared 50/50):
Both teachers share the planning, teaching, and supporting equally.  This is the traditional method, and often the most successful co-teaching model.

===Children with extensive support needs===
For children with significant or severe disabilities, the programs may require what are termed health supports (e.g., positioning and lifting; visit to the nurse clinic), direct one-to-one aide in the classroom, assistive technology, and an individualized program which may involve the student "partially" (e.g., videos and cards for "visual stimulation"; listening to responses)in the full lesson plan for the "general education student". It may also require introduction of teaching techniques commonly used (e.g., introductions and interest in science) that teachers may not use within a common core class.

Another way to think of health supports are as a range of services that may be needed from specialists, or sometimes generalists, ranging from speech and language, to visual and hearing (sensory impairments), behavioral, learning, orthopedics, autism, deaf-blindness, and traumatic brain injury, according to Virginia Commonwealth University's Dr. Paul Wehman.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. (1997). ''Exceptional Individuals in School, Community and Work''. Austin, TX: PRO-ED.&lt;/ref&gt; As Dr. Wehman has indicated, expectations can include post secondary education, supported employment in competitive sites, and living with family or other residential places in the community.

In 2005, comprehensive health supports were described in National Goals for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities as universally available, affordable and promoting inclusion, as supporting well-informed, freely chose health care decisions, culturally competent, promoting health promotion, and insuring well trained and respectful health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, D., Bacon, A., Birenbaum, A., Campbell, V., Cerreto, M., Corbin, S., Crocker, A., Krahn, G., McClain, C., McDermott, Nehring, W., Pietrangelo, R., Rader, R., Spitalnik, D. &amp; White-Scott, S.(2005). Comprehensive health support and health promotion. (pp.109-124).  In: K. C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull, ''National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities''. Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mental health, behavioral, communication and crisis needs may need to be planned for and addressed.
 
"Full inclusion" – the idea that all children, including those with severe disabilities, can and should learn in a regular classroom has also taken root in many school systems, and most notably in the province of New Brunswick.

==Collaboration among the professions==
Inclusion settings allow children with and without disabilities to play and interact every day, even when they are receiving therapeutic services. When a child displays fine motor difficulty, his ability to fully participate in common classroom activities, such as cutting, coloring, and zipping a jacket may be hindered.  While occupational therapists are often called to assess and implement strategies outside of school, it is frequently left up to classroom teachers to implement strategies in school. Collaborating with occupational therapists will help classroom teachers use intervention strategies and increase teachers' awareness about students' needs within school settings and enhance teachers' independence in implementation of occupational therapy strategies.

As a result of the 1997 re-authorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals With Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), greater emphasis has been placed on delivery of related services within inclusive, general education environments. [Nolan, 2004] The importance of inclusive, integrated models of service delivery for children with disabilities has been widely researched indicating positive benefits. [Case-Smith&amp; Holland, 2009] In traditional "pull out" service delivery models, children typically work in isolated settings one on one with a therapist, Case-Smith and Holland(2009) argue that children working on skills once or twice a week are "less likely to produce learning that leads to new behaviors and increased competence." [Case Smith &amp;Holland, 2009, pg.419]. In recent years, occupational therapy has shifted from the conventional model of "pull out" therapy to an integrated model where the therapy takes place within a school or classroom.

Inclusion administrators have been requested to review their personnel to assure mental health personnel for children with mental health needs, vocational rehabilitation linkages for work placements, community linkages for special populations (e.g., "deaf-blind", "autism"), and collaboration among major community agencies for after school programs and transition to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., Destefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policy''. Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schall, C. &amp; McFarland-Whisman, J. (2009). Meeting transition goals through inclusion. (pp.95-110). In: P. Wehman, Datlow-Smith, M. &amp; Schall, C., ''Autism and the Transition to Adulthood: Success Beyond the Classroom''. Sydney, Australia: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly recommended are collaborations with parents, including parent-professional partnerships in areas of cultural and linguistic diversity (e.g., Syracuse University's special education Ph.D.'s Maya Kaylanpur and Beth Harry).

==Selection of students for inclusion programs in schools==
Educators generally say that some students with special needs are not good candidates for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Doug. "Transformation Ahead for Special Education"  ''The Arizona Republic.'' 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Many schools expect a fully included student to be working at or near [[grade level]], but more fundamental requirements exist:  First, being included requires that the student is able to attend [[school]].  Students that are entirely excluded from school (for example, due to long-term hospitalization), or who are educated outside of schools (for example, due to enrollment in a [[distance education]] program) cannot attempt inclusion.

Additionally, some students with special needs are poor candidates for inclusion because of their effect on other students.  For example, students with severe behavioral problems, such that they represent a serious physical danger to others, are poor candidates for inclusion, because the school has a duty to provide a safe environment to all students and staff.

Finally, some students are not good candidates for inclusion because the normal activities in a general education classroom will prevent them from learning.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  For example, a student with severe attention difficulties or extreme [[sensory processing disorder]]s might be highly distracted or distressed by the presence of other students working at their desks. Inclusion needs to be appropriate to the child's unique needs.

Most students with special needs do not fall into these extreme categories, as most students do attend school, are not violent, do not have severe sensory processing disorders, etc.

The students that are most commonly included are those with physical disabilities that have no or little effect on their academic work ([[diabetes mellitus]], [[epilepsy]], [[food allergies]], [[paralysis]]), students with all types of mild disabilities, and students whose disabilities require relatively few specialized services.

Bowe says that regular inclusion, but not full inclusion, is a reasonable approach for a significant majority of students with special needs.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  He also says that for some students, notably those with severe [[autism spectrum]] disorders or [[mental retardation]], as well as many who are [[deaf]] or have multiple disabilities, even regular inclusion may not offer an appropriate education.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes use antecedent procedures, delayed contingencies, self-management strategies, peer-mediated interventions, [[pivotal response training]] and naturalistic teaching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to progressive education ==
Some advocates of inclusion promote the adoption of [[progressive education]] practices.  In the progressive education or inclusive classroom, everyone is exposed to a "rich set of activities", and each student does what he or she can do, or what he or she wishes to do and learns whatever comes from that experience. [[Maria Montessori]]'s schools are sometimes named as an example of inclusive education.

Inclusion requires some changes in how teachers teach, as well as changes in how students with and without special needs interact with and relate to one another.  Inclusive education practices frequently rely on active learning, [[Authentic assessment|authentic assessment practices]], applied curriculum, multi-level instructional approaches, and increased attention to diverse student needs and individualization.

sometimes it is not necessary that there will always be a positive environment and therefore a lot of attention of the teachers is also required along with the support of other children which will ensure a peaceful and happy place for both kinds of children.

==Arguments for full inclusion in regular neighborhood schools==
Advocates say that even partial non-inclusion is morally unacceptable.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;Stainback, W., &amp; Stainback, S. (1995). ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education''. Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents believe that non-inclusion reduces the disabled students' social importance and that maintaining their social visibility is more important than their academic achievement. Proponents say that society accords disabled people less [[human dignity]] when they are less visible in general education classrooms. Advocates say that even if typical students are harmed academically by the full inclusion of certain special needs students, that the non-inclusion of these students would still be morally unacceptable, as advocates believe that the harm to typical students' education is always less important than the social harm caused by making people with disabilities less visible in society.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

A second key argument is that everybody benefits from inclusion. Advocates say that there are many children and young people who don't fit in (or feel as though they don't), and that a school that fully includes all disabled students feels welcoming to all. Moreover, at least one author has studied the impact a diversified student body has on the general education population and has concluded that students with mental retardation who spend time among their peers show an increase in social skills and academic proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Trainer, M. (1991). ''Differences in common: Straight talk on mental retardation, Down Syndrome, and life''. Rockville, MD" Woodbine house.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for inclusion say that the long-term effects of typical students who are included with special needs students at a very young age have a heightened sensitivity to the challenges that others face, increased empathy and compassion, and improved leadership skills, which benefits all of society.&lt;ref&gt;Giangreco, M.F., Cloninger, C.J., &amp; Iverson, V.S.(1998). Choosing outcomes and accommodations for Children (COACH): A guide to educational planning for students with disabilities (2nd ed.). Baltimore: Paul H Brookes Publishing Co&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of inclusion and pull-out (partial inclusion) services has been shown to be beneficial to students with learning disabilities in the area of reading comprehension, and preferential for the special education teachers delivering the services.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Douglas. ''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 30, No. 2, 121–132 (1996)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education can be beneficial to all students in a class, not just students with special needs. Some research show that inclusion helps students understand the importance of working together, and fosters a sense of tolerance and empathy among the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, R.M. (2004). The effects of cooperative learning on junior high school students during small group learning. ''Learning and Instruction'' there are inclusion units and other rooms in some schools which focus on these aspects, 14(2), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects in regular classrooms==
There are many positive effects of inclusions where both the students with special needs along with the other students in the classroom both benefit. Research has shown positive effects for children with disabilities in areas such as reaching individualized education program (IEP) goal, improving communication and social skills, increasing positive peer interactions, many educational outcomes, and post school adjustments.  Positive effects on children without disabilities include the development of positive attitudes and perceptions of persons with disabilities and the enhancement of social status with non-disabled peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, T., Deluca, D., &amp; Bruns, D. (1997). Putting inclusion into practice: perspectives of teachers and parents. ''Exceptional Children,'' 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several studies have been done on the effects of inclusion of children with disabilities in general education classrooms. A study on inclusion compared integrated and segregated (special education only) preschool students. The study determined that children in the integrated sites progressed in social skills development while the segregated children actually regressed.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, P., &amp; Carey, D. (1995). The Sociometric status of students with disabilities in a full-inclusion school. ''Exceptional Children,'' 62.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Another study shows the effect on inclusion in grades 2 to 5.  The study determined that students with specific learning disabilities made some academic and affective gains at a pace comparable to that of normal achieving students.  Specific learning disabilities students also showed an improvement in [[self-esteem]] and in some cases improved motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji, M., &amp; Dailey, R. (1995). A Study of the effects of an inclusion model on students with specific learning disabilities. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' 28(8), 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third study shows how the support of peers in an inclusive classroom can lead to positive effects for children with [[autism]].  The study observed typical inclusion classrooms, ages ranging from 7 years old to 11 years old.  The peers were trained on an intervention technique to help their fellow autistic classmates stay on task and focused.  The study showed that using peers to intervene instead of classroom teachers helped students with autism reduce off-task behaviors significantly.  It also showed that the typical students accepted the student with autism both before and after the intervention techniques were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Use of a peer support intervention for promoting academic engagement of students with autism in general education settings|last = McCurdy|first = E.

L.|volume = 44|issue = 4|pages = 883–893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of inclusion programs of school districts==
Critics of full and partial inclusion include educators, administrators and parents. Full and partial inclusion approaches neglect to acknowledge the fact that most students with significant special needs require individualized instruction or highly controlled environments.  Thus, general education classroom teachers often are teaching a curriculum while the special education teacher is remediating instruction at the same time.  Similarly, a child with serious inattention problems may be unable to focus in a classroom that contains twenty or more active children. Although with the increase of incidence of disabilities in the student population, this is a circumstance all teachers must contend with, and is not a direct result of inclusion as a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, R.A. (1998). ''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full inclusion may be a way for schools to placate parents and the general public, using the word as a phrase to garner attention for what are in fact illusive efforts to educate students with special needs in the general education environment.&lt;ref&gt;JM Kauffman, DP Hallahan.''The Illusion of Full Inclusion: A Comprehensive Critique of a Current Special Education Bandwagon''. PRO-ED, Inc., 8700 Shoal Creek Blvd., Austin, TX 78757-6897&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study examined the lack of individualized services provided for students with IEPs when placed in an inclusive rather than mainstreamed environment.&lt;ref&gt;Espin, C.A.Individualized Education Programs in Resource and Inclusive Settings.''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 32, No. 3, 164–174 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have maintained school districts neglect to prepare general education staff for students with special needs, thus preventing any achievement. Moreover, school districts often expound an inclusive philosophy for political reasons, and do away with any valuable pull-out services, all on behalf of the students who have no so say in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Laurence M. ''Preserving Special Education''. Weston: Nobb Hill Press Inc, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion is viewed by some as a practice philosophically attractive yet impractical.  Studies have not corroborated the proposed advantages of full or partial inclusion. Moreover, "push in" servicing does not allow students with moderate to severe disabilities individualized instruction in a [[resource room]], from which many show considerable benefit in both learning and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Resource Rooms for Children with Specific Learning Disabilities Lawrence H. Weiner Journal of Learning Disabilities, Apr 1969; vol. 2: pp. 223 - 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of disabled students may be cautious about placing their children in an inclusion program because of fears that the children will be ridiculed by other students, or be unable to develop regular life skills in an academic classroom.&lt;ref&gt;This information provided by SEDL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that inclusive schools are not a cost-effective response when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as [[special education]].  They argue that special education helps "fix" the special needs students by providing individualized and personalized instruction to meet their unique needs.  This is to help students with special needs adjust as quickly as possible to the mainstream of the school and community.  Proponents counter that students with special needs are not fully into the mainstream of student life because they are secluded to special education.  Some argue that isolating students with special needs may lower their self-esteem and may reduce their ability to deal with other people.  In keeping these students in separate classrooms they aren't going to see the struggles and achievements that they can make together. However, at least one study indicated [[mainstreaming in education]] has long-term benefits for students as indicated by increased test scores,&lt;ref&gt;van den Bos, K.P., Nakken, H., Nicolay, P.G.,&amp; van Houten, E.J. (2007). Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: Can their reading comprehension ability be improved? ''Journal of Intellectual Disability Research'', 51(11), 830–845.&lt;/ref&gt; where the benefit of inclusion has not yet been proved.

== Broader approach: social and cultural inclusion ==
As used by UNESCO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf|title=Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusion refers to far more than students with special educational needs.  It is centered on the inclusion of  marginalized groups, such as religious, racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities, immigrants, girls, the poor, students with disabilities, HIV/AIDS patients, remote populations, and more.  In some places, these people are not actively included in education and learning processes.&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines"&gt;UNESCO (2009) Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education. UNESCO: Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. this broader definition is also known as "culturally responsive" education, which differs from the 1980s-1990s cultural diversity and cultural competency approaches,&lt;ref&gt;Harry, B. (1992). ''Cultural Diversity, Families and the Special Education System''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, T.B., Bazron, B. &amp; Dennis, K. W. (1989). ''Towards Culturally Competent System of Care''. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Child Development Center.&lt;/ref&gt; and is promoted among the ten equity assistance centers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/equitycenters/index.html|title=Training and Advisory Services - Equity Assistance Centers|date=1 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the U.S. Department of Education, for example in Region IX (AZ, CA, NV), by the Equity Alliance at ASU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equityallianceatasu.org/|title=Home - The Equity Alliance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]]&lt;ref name="Gloria Ladson-Billings"&gt;Ladson-Billings, B. (1992). Reading between the lines and beyond the pages: A culturally relevant approach to literacy teaching.  Theory Into Practice, 31(4), 312-320.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that teachers who are culturally responsive know how to base learning experiences on the cultural realities of the child (e.g. home life, community experiences, language background, belief systems). Proponents argue that [http://ea.niusileadscape.org/lc/Record/137?search_query=Culturally%20Responsive culturally responsive pedagogy] is good for all students because it builds a caring community where everyone's experiences and abilities are valued.

Proponents want to maximize the participation of all learners in the community schools of their choice and to rethink and restructure policies, curricula, cultures and practices in schools and learning environments so that diverse learning needs can be met, whatever the origin or nature of those needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bps.org.uk/downloadfile.cfm?file_uuid=CE1DCB9D-1143-DFD0-7EA9-5C1B82EA4596&amp;ext=doc British Psychological Society position statement on inclusive education&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that all students can learn and benefit from education, and that schools should adapt to the physical, social, and cultural needs of students, rather than students adapting to the needs of the school. Proponents believe that individual differences between students are a source of richness and diversity, which should be supported through a wide and flexible range of responses. The challenge of rethinking and restructuring schools to become more culturally responsive calls for a complex systems view of the educational system (e.g.see Michael Patton&lt;ref name="Developmental Evaluation"&gt;Patton, M. (2011). Developmental evaluation: Applying complexity concepts to enhance innovation and use. New York, NY, The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;), where one can extend the idea of strength through diversity to all participants in the educational system (e.g. parents, teachers, community members, staff).

Although inclusion is generally associated with elementary and secondary education, it is also applicable in postsecondary education.  According to UNESCO, inclusion "is increasingly understood more broadly as a reform that supports and welcomes diversity amongst all learners."&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines" /&gt;  Under this broader definition of inclusion, steps should also be taken to eliminate discrimination and provide accommodations for all students who are at a disadvantage because of some reason other than disability.

===Benefiting in an inclusive environment===
"The inclusion of age-appropriate students in a general education classroom, alongside those with and without disability is beneficial to both parties involved. (Waitoller and Thorius) With inclusive education, all students are exposed to the same curriculum, they develop their own individual potential, and participate in the same activities at the same time. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which learning takes place because students learn differently, at their own pace and by their own style. (Carter, Moss, Asmus, Fesperman, Cooney, Brock, Lyons, Huber, and Vincent) Effectively, inclusive education provides a nurturing venue where teaching and learning should occur despite pros and cons. It is evident that students with disabilities benefit more in an inclusive atmosphere because they can receive help from their peers with diverse abilities and they compete at the same level due to equal opportunities given."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1258">In general usage the word '''indigen''' is treated as a variant of the word indigene, meaning a native.

==Usage in botany==
However, it was used in a strictly botanical sense for the first time in 1918 by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] ((1858–1954) an American horticulturist, botanist and cofounder of the American Society for Horticultural Science) and described as a plant 

&lt;blockquote&gt; " ''of known habitat'' ".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1918. The indigen and the cultigen. ''Science'' ser. 2, 47:306-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; Later, in 1923, Bailey formally defined the indigen as:

=== Botanical definition ===
&lt;blockquote&gt; " ... ''a species of which we know the nativity, - one that is somewhere recorded as indigenous''. "&lt;/blockquote&gt; The term was coined to contrast with [[cultigen]] which he defined in the 1923 paper as: &lt;blockquote&gt; " ... ''the species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication, – the plant is cultigenous.''"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1923. Various cultigens, and transfers ijuent change (see entry under [[cultigen]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The place of discovery of this seal is unknown, and it is currently part of [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]]'s private collection. The seal contains an [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|ancient Hebrew]] inscription mentioning the name of [[Ahaz]] of Judah, as well as the name of his father, [[Jotham of Judah|Yehotam]] (Jotham), identifying Ahaz as the "king of Judah".

The universal answer of all experts in the field is no.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8929">A '''lighting control system''' is an intelligent network based lighting control solution that incorporates communication between various system inputs and outputs related to lighting control with the use of one or more central computing devices.  Lighting control systems are widely used on  both indoor and outdoor lighting of commercial, industrial, and residential spaces. Lighting control systems serve to provide the right amount of light where and when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiLouie|first=Craig|title=Lighting controls handbook|year=2008|publisher=Fairmont Press [u.a.]|location=Lilburn, Ga. [u.a.]|isbn=1-4200-6921-7|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting control systems are employed to maximize the [[energy conservation|energy savings]] from the lighting system, satisfy [[building codes]], or comply with [[green building]] and [[energy conservation]] programs.  Lighting control systems are often referred to under the term [[Smart Lighting]].

== Lighting controls==
The term ''lighting controls'' is typically used to indicate stand-alone control of the lighting within a space. This may include [[occupancy sensor]]s, timeclocks, and [[photocells]] that are hard-wired to control fixed groups of lights independently. Adjustment occurs manually at each devices location. The efficiency of and market for residential lighting controls has been characterized by the [[Consortium for Energy Efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEE Residential Lighting Controls Market Characterization|url=http://library.cee1.org/content/cee-residential-lighting-controls-market-characterization|publisher=[[Consortium for Energy Efficiency]]|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''lighting control system'' refers to an intelligent networked system of devices related to lighting control. These devices may include [[relay]]s, [[occupancy sensor]]s, [[photocells]], light control switches or [[touchscreens]], and signals from other building systems (such as [[fire alarm]] or [[HVAC]]). Adjustment of the system occurs both at device locations and at central computer locations via software programs or other interface devices.

===Advantages===
The major advantage of a lighting control system over stand-alone lighting controls or conventional manual [[light switch|switch]]ing is the ability to control individual lights or groups of lights from a single [[user interface]] device.  This ability to control multiple light sources from a user device allows complex lighting scenes to be created. A room may have multiple scenes pre-set, each one created for different activities in the room.  A major benefit of lighting control systems is reduced energy consumption. Longer lamp life is also gained when dimming and switching off lights when not in use. Wireless lighting control systems provide additional benefits including reduced installation costs and increased flexibility over where switches and sensors may be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting control saves money and makes sense|url=http://www.daintree.net/downloads/whitepapers/smart-lighting.pdf|publisher=[[Daintree Networks]]|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automated control==
Lighting control systems typically provide the ability to automatically adjust a lighting device's output based on:
*Chronological time (time of day)
*Solar time ([[sunrise]]/[[sunset]])
*[[Occupancy]] using [[occupancy sensor]]s
*[[Daylight]] availability using [[photocell]]s
*[[Alarm]] conditions
*Program logic (combination of events)

===Chronological time===
Chronological time schedules incorporate specific times of the day, week, month or year.

===Solar time===
Solar time schedules incorporate [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] times, often used to switch outdoor lighting. Solar time scheduling requires that the location of the building be set. This is accomplished using the building's geographic location via either latitude and longitude or by picking the nearest city in a given database giving the approximate location and corresponding solar times.

===Occupancy===
Space occupancy is primarily determined with [[occupancy sensor]]s.

===Daylight availability===
Electric lighting energy use can be adjusted by automatically dimming and/or switching electric lights in response to the level of available [[daylighting|daylight]].  Reducing the amount of electric lighting used when daylight is available is known as [[daylight harvesting]].

===Alarm conditions===
Alarm conditions typically include inputs from other building systems  such as the [[fire alarm]] or [[HVAC]] system, which may trigger an emergency 'all lights on' or ' all lights flashing' command for example.

===Program logic===
Program logic can tie all of the above elements together using constructs such as [[if-then-else]] statements and [[logical operator]]s.

==Types==
In the 1980s there was a strong requirement to make commercial lighting more controllable so that it could become more energy efficient. Initially this was done with analog control, allowing [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] [[Electrical ballast|ballasts]] and [[dimmer]]s to be controlled from a central source. This was a step in the right direction, but cabling was complicated and therefore not cost effective.  

Tridonic was an early company to go digital with their broadcast [[communications protocol|protocol]]s, [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]], in 1991. [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]] was a basic protocol as it transmitted one control value to change the brightness of all the fixtures attached to the line. What made this protocol more attractive, and able to compete with the established analog option, was the simple wiring.

There are two types of lighting control systems which are:
* [[Analog electronics|Analog]] lighting control
* [[Digital electronics|Digital]] lighting control

Examples for analog lighting control systems are:
* [[0-10 V lighting control|0-10V]] based system.
* [[AMX192]] based systems (often referred to as AMX) ([[United States|USA]] standard).
* [[D54 (protocol)|D54]] based systems (European standard).

In production lighting 0-10V system was replaced by analog multiplexed systems such as D54 and AMX192, which themselves have been almost completely replaced by DMX512. For dimmable fluorescent lamps (where it operates instead at 1-10 V, where 1 V is minimum and 0 V is off) the system is being replaced by DSI, which itself is in the process of being replaced by DALI.

Examples for digital lighting control systems are:
* [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]] based systems 
* [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]] based system 
* [[DMX512]] based systems (often referred to as simply DMX).
* [[KNX (standard)|KNX]] based systems

Those are all wired lighting control system. There is also a [[wireless]] lighting control system that is based on some standard protocols like [[MIDI]], [[ZigBee]], [[Bluetooth Mesh]], and others.

==Theatrical lighting control==
{{Main|Stage lighting}}
Architectural lighting control systems can integrate with a  [[Theater (structure)|theater]]'s on-off and [[dimmer]] controls, and are often used for [[house lights]] and [[stage lighting]], and can include [[worklight]]s, [[rehearsal]] lighting, and [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] lighting.  Control stations can be placed in several locations in the building and range in complexity from single buttons that bring up preset options-looks, to in-wall or desktop [[LCD]] [[touchscreen]] consoles. Much of the [[technology]] is related to residential and commercial lighting control systems.

The benefit of architectural lighting control systems in the theater is the ability for theater staff to turn worklights and house lights on and off without having to use a [[lighting control console]].  Alternately, the light designer can control these same lights with light [[cue (theatrical)|cues]] from the lighting control console so that, for instance, the transition from houselights being up before a show starts and the first light cue of the show is controlled by one system.

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita Art Museum) 3.jpg|thumb|x150px|First painting of the Fujita scroll showing two courtiers on the balcony of a building and men lighting torches in the garden outside the house.]]
The {{nihongo|'''''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'''''|紫式部日記絵巻|Murasaki Shikibu nikki emaki}} is a mid-13th century [[emaki]], a Japanese picture scroll, inspired by the [[The Diary of Lady Murasaki|private diary]] (''[[Nikki Bungaku|nikki]]'') of [[Murasaki Shikibu]], [[lady-in-waiting]] at the 10th/11th centuries Heian court and author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. This emaki belongs to the classical style of [[Japanese painting]] known as ''[[yamato-e]]'' and revives the iconography of the [[Heian period]].

Today there remain four paper scrolls of the emaki in varying condition and stored in different collections: Hachisuka, Matsudaira, Hinohara scrolls ([[Tokyo]]), and Fujita scroll ([[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Osaka]]).&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131"&gt;{{harvnb|Okudaira|1973|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the extant scrolls, the first relates the celebrations on occasion of the birth of prince Atsunari (Atsuhira, later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]]) in 1008 and the last those of the birth of Prince Atsunaga (later [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]]) in 1009. This difference in time indicates that the original emaki most likely consisted of more scrolls than exist today.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"&gt;{{citation

== Description ==
{{nihongo|''[[The Diary of Lady Murasaki]]''|紫式部日記|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki}} records the daily life of the [[Heian era]] lady-in-waiting and writer, [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki Shikibu]], author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Most likely written between 1008 and 1010, the largest portion consists of descriptive passages of the birth of [[Empress Shōshi]]'s (Akiko) children (future Emperors [[Emperor Go-Ichijō|Go-Ichijō]] and [[Emperor Go-Suzaku|Go-Suzaku]]) and related festivities, with smaller [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] describing life at the Imperial court and relations between other ladies-in-waiting and court writers such as [[Izumi Shikibu]], [[Akazome Emon]] and [[Sei Shōnagon]].&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt; It also gives a lively account of the regency of the powerful [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]].&lt;ref name="Hempel-p203"/&gt; Like the romantic novel Genji Monogatari, the diary deals with emotions and human relationships, particularly with Murasaki Shikibu's constraints at the court of Akiko, loneliness and futility after her husband's death (in 1001).&lt;ref name="mason-p30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author is critical of her contemporaries, the men for their discourteous ways (including Fujiwara no Michinaga) and the women for their inexperience and lack of education and will.&lt;ref name="Keene99.42"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Donald |last1=Keene  |title=Travelers of a Hundred Ages: The Japanese as revealed through 1000 years of diaries |publisher =[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1999 |pages=42–46 |isbn=978-0-231-11437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diary is considered a masterpiece of [[Nikki Bungaku]].&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;

Emaki, which are long paper scrolls telling a story through texts and paintings, came to Japan through exchange with the Chinese Empire around the 6th century and spread widely among the Heian aristocracy.  The subsequent [[Kamakura period]] was marked by internal strife and civil wars that fostered the rise of the warrior class. If the warriors of the ''[[bakufu]]'' preferred "quick-moving narrative scrolls" such as war tales or legends, the production of emaki at the Heian court subsisted. Pictures illustrating ''The Tale of Genji'' continued to be popular into the early Kamakura period and revived interest in the author, Murasaki Shikibu. Towards the end of the 13th century, a renewed interest in the refined culture of the Heian period led some artists to return to painting styles of the Imperial Court; many emaki were produced during this period.&lt;ref name="mason-p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'' belongs to this golden age of the emaki and according to Penelope Mason "may be regarded as one of the finest extant examples of prose-poetry narrative illustration from the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] period".&lt;ref name="mason-p29"/&gt; It was created about 200 years after the diary was written, in the mid-13th century.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Suzuki Keizō, a scholar of the history of costume dated it to around 1250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murase96.163"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Miyeko |last1=Murase|title=L’art du Japon|language=French|trans-title=Japanese Art|publisher=Éditions LGF - Livre de Poche|series=La Pochothèque| year=1996 |pages=163–164 |isbn=2-253-13054-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.193"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|2001|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clasica.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=144&amp;PHPSESSID=a002ac85757493eaae8791c0849f1324 |script-title=ja:紫式部日記繪詞 |trans-title=Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki |publisher=Clasica |language=Japanese |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122936/http://clasica.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=144&amp;PHPSESSID=a002ac85757493eaae8791c0849f1324 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It transcribes the solitude and the observations of palace life from the diary but adds to the text a certain nostalgia for the glorious past of the Heian court which is typical for the 13th century, giving an overall feeling of "lost golden age", according to Mason, even during happy events such as parties.&lt;ref name="mason-p183" /&gt; The explanatory notes (or captions), i.e. the non-painting part, show little textual deviations from  the diary.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;

An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is mentioned in the ''[[Meigetsuki]]'' ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar [[Fujiwara no Teika]]. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to [[Cloistered rule|cloistered]] [[Emperor Go-Horikawa]] planned to create a new emaki of ''The Tale of Genji'' (after the 12th century [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]], the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter [[Fujiwara Nobuzane]] and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frederic05.207"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Louis |last1=Frédéric |title=Japan encyclopedia |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2005 |page=207 |isbn=0-674-01753-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC |accessdate=2011-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and composition ==
Two elements  are found in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period,  such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems or talking to each other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason,  Mason calls the people in the emaki "house bound".&lt;ref name="mason-p22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left;  or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after-effects to the left.&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt; Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the ''onna-e'' genre of ''[[yamato-e]]'' and is in this respect similar to the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki|Tale of Genji Scrolls]] (1120–1140) but differs from them in many other aspects.&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murase96.163" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.53"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical for ''onna-e'', the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added.&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194" /&gt; Illustrations are relatively short&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the case of the Genji Monogatari Emaki, {{convert|43|cm|abbr=on}} on average.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to emaki of war or folktales,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Where a single scene could be more than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long&lt;/ref&gt; which according to Mason, "heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs".&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt;

The painting technique of ''tsukuri-e'' ("built painting"), used mainly in emaki of the court in the twelfth century, is also used here.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt; It is done in three stages: a first sketch of the scene is made with [[India ink|Indian ink]] (probably by a master of the workshop), then the color is applied on the entire surface of the paper in a specific order, from large areas in the background to fine details. Finally, the contours are enhanced or revived in ink to emphasize the depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/tsukurie.htm |title=Tsukuri-e |publisher=[[JAANUS]] (Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System) |accessdate =2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a visible change in style may again be noted, because the pigments are here less opaque than usual, and the more subtle shades are highlighted by fine outlines in ink; and in addition, the decorative aspect emerges strongly through extensive use of gold dust, and sometimes of silver.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt; According to Mason, the technique seems to be less careful than in the past, as can be seen in elements of the architectural interior (sliding doors, screens ...) which lack detail or in the silver powder which is used much less often in general compared to gold.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;

The cultural changes after the Heian period resulted in a more realistic depiction of figures including movements and gestures.&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;
Abandoning the Heian period ''[[hikime kagibana]]'' style ("slit eyes, hooked nose"),&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;technique of representing the faces with four lines on a white background, similar to [[Noh]] masks to mark the extreme reclusiveness of the aristocrats&lt;/ref&gt; figures were painted individual features and facial expressions that  conveyed emotions and moods.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194" /&gt; More generally, M. Murase notes that the expression of feelings subtly changed compared to the scrolls of the 12th century; here the rooms (or the inner space, because it depends on the fusuma) in the palace are larger and less intimate or private, and nobles come and go naturally and determined.&lt;ref name="Murase96.163" /&gt; Unlike earlier scrolls such as the Genji Emaki, in which architecture and landscape were used as metaphors for people's emotions, interpersonal or societal pressures, in these scrolls the people's feelings are painted directly on the faces or shown through gestures, in addition to being expressed by the placement of characters within the scene. Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods. Landscapes stand on their own as they are detached from the characters' emotions and gain a new function as a place to escape from the constraints of court life.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most emaki, the composition is based on the ''fukinuki yatai'' ("blown-off roof") technique, which consists of a [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of looking down from above into the inner spaces resulting in a plunging view. Furthermore, diagonals are used to mark depth.  Compared to earlier scrolls, in these scrolls, the interior spaces are depicted from a more normal perspective such as through rolled up bamboo blinds (''misu''&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt;) or spaces in the walls where sliding panels (''[[fusuma]]'') had been removed.&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt; The pace that is intentionally slow in ''tsukuri-e'', here seems slightly faster with illustrations depicting a single occurrence in time and temporally related events positioned close to each other in the emaki.&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.64"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |id=Okudaira73 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new decorative approach to paintings of the court (''onna-e'') inspired by the themes of literature is evident in several other works of the Kamakura period, such as [[uta monogatari (literature)|uta monogatari]] (e.g. ''[[The Tales of Ise]] Emaki''), [[tsukuri monogatari]] (e.g. ''[[Sumiyoshi Monogatari]] Emaki'') and romances (e.g. {{nihongo|Lord Takafusa's Love Songs|隆房卿艶詞絵巻|Takafusa Kyō tsuya kotoba emaki}}).&lt;ref name="mason-p29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|2001|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.33"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |id=Okudaira73 |p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
The illustrations provide insight into life and festivities at the [[Heian Palace]]; which sometimes consisted of something as simple as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]] or the [[Pillow Book Emaki]] (''Makura no Sōshi Emaki'') they provide valuable information on the architectural [[shinden-zukuri]] style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and traditional Japanese influences.&lt;ref name="mason-p107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Extant scrolls==
It is thought that the emaki originally consisted of 10–12 scrolls.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt; The ancestral heritage of the emaki before the [[Edo period]] is not known and an investigation conducted during the [[Meiji period]], found that only four scrolls had survived, each {{convert|21.0|cm|abbr=on}} high and about {{convert|4.5|-|5.4|m|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; The owners and state of preservation of all four scrolls has since changed.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; The extant parts correspond to about 15 percent of the original diary and are not in sequence.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt; They consist of 24 scenes of varying widths distributed among three scrolls, six single sheets and two hanging scrolls in six different locations: [[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Gotoh Museum]], [[Tokyo National Museum]] and three private collections.&lt;ref name="Hempel-p203"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hempel|first=Rose|title=The golden age of Japan, 794-1192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT7rAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2011-10-29|year=1983|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=978-0-8478-0492-4|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scroll begins with a text section and generally alternates scene descriptions with illustrations, ending with a painting. In two instances a long text section is split in two parts&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;3rd text of Hachisuka and 4th text of Hinohara scroll.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hachisuka scroll has an accumulation of three illustrations&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Paintings 3, 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; unseparated by text, and an accumulation of two unseparated independent text sections.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Texts 6 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hachisuka scroll===
Chronologically the oldest scenes of the emaki, combined with some of the later anecdotes in the diary, are contained in the Hachisuka scroll. Named after its former owner, the [[Hachisuka clan]], rulers of the [[Tokushima Domain]] in [[Awa Province (Tokushima)|Awa Province]], this scroll is privately owned. It consists of eight illustrations and seven text sections on 16 paper sheets.&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The long third text section is split in two parts and followed by three illustrations. The seventh text section immediately follows the sixth without a painting between the two. The full scroll is {{convert|537.5|cm|abbr=on}} long and has been designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]]. Scenes 1–5 correspond to a continuous part of the diary and are the oldest diary entries represented by any of the four extant emaki scrolls. Scenes 6 and 7 correspond to later diary entries and appear in the diary after several of the scenes described in the other three extant scrolls.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Third day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====

The Hachisuka scroll starts with a description of a banquet given by the queen's [[majordomo]] and managed by the governor of [[Ōmi Province]] on [[Kankō]] 5, 9th month, 13th day (October 14, 1008), the third night of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]]. On that occasion, the mother, [[Empress Shōshi]] received presents such as baby clothes and furniture. The illustration associated with this scene shows court nobles on the balconies outside of the principal building in which the queen is located.&lt;ref name="diary-p85-86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emak HachisukaS.jpg|thumb|right|Fourth painting (right), fifth painting (middle) and fourth text section (left)]]
The second to fifth scenes of the Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime minister and baby's grandfather, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls ([[mochi]]) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the scene as bright as in daylight. There is one illustration following this scene.&lt;ref name="diary-p86-87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third text is split in two parts, followed by three illustrations. The text contains a detailed description of how the dinner was served to the queen including the names of the maids of honour and their father's names. The ladies who had not been selected to attend "wept bitterly". Other people involved in the ceremony included uneme,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;beautiful women selected for their beauty&lt;/ref&gt; mohitori,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;officials in charge of wells, soy sauce and ice-houses&lt;/ref&gt; migusiage,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;attendants whose hair was done up with hairpins&lt;/ref&gt; tonomori,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;King's housekeepers&lt;/ref&gt; kanmori no nyokwan&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;cleaners&lt;/ref&gt; and door keepers. According to Murasaki Shikibu so many people were involved that it was hard to get through.&lt;ref name="diary-p87-88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively short fourth scene describes that the maids of honour exit from the queen's room which had been partitioned off by ''misu''&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"&gt;a thinly woven bamboo curtain hung before great people and women's apartments&lt;/ref&gt; entering the torch-lit garden. It also gives more details and an interpretation of the dress of one of those maids, Lady Oshikibu.&lt;ref name="diary-p88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - priest).jpg|thumb|right|The seventh painting, located between the 5th (right) and 6th (left) text sections]]
The short fifth passage is a continuation of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: ''You cannot see such a lovely thing every day'', to which he replies: ''Indeed! indeed!'' clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.&lt;ref name="diary-p88"/&gt;

====Our lady of the chronicle====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - Bai Juyi).jpg|thumb|left|Murasaki Shikibu (right) reading to Empress Shōshi (left). A scroll of {{nihongo|Bai Juyi's poetry anthology|白氏文集|Hakushi Monjū}} is spread on a [[maki-e]] writing desk between them.]]
This anecdote, the sixth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, occurs at an unspecified date in 1009. It is part of a description of the lady Saemon no Naishi who, Murasaki Shikibu writes in the diary, hated her. Naishi spread the rumour that Murasaki Shikibu was proud of her Chinese learning (which in the [[Heian period]] was the domain of the male aristocracy) and gave her the name "Japanese Chronicle Lady".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;After the [[Shoku Nihongi|Chronicles of Japan]] written in Classical Chinese.&lt;/ref&gt; In the anecdote, Murasaki Shikibu explains she learned Chinese in childhood, that she was taught not to be proud of  her learning, keeping it a secret during her life in fear of how others would judge her. The text in the emaki relates how [[Empress Shōshi]] requested that Murasaki Shikibu read to her in Chinese and teach her the poetical works of [[Bai Juyi]] (in particular the part known as {{nihongo||新楽府|shingafu}}) in secrecy. Nevertheless, the Emperor and Prime Minister found out about it and presented to the Empress a number of poetical works.&lt;ref name="diary-p135-136"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gosechi dancers====
This final scene in the Hachisuka scroll is about a scene from the Gosechi, an ancient dance performed by young beautiful girls in the 11th month to celebrate the harvest.&lt;ref name="Mostow1996-p178"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mostow|first=Joshua S.|title=Pictures of the heart: the Hyakunin isshu in word and image|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0KcAwrVksQC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=2011-11-30|year=1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1705-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emaki text begins  with a description of the appearance and clothing of two of the participating girls and ends with a scene in which the girls throw down their fans as the secretaries of the sixth rank approached them to take away their fans. Murasaki Shikibu considered the dancers graceful but unlike girls.&lt;!-- clarify here? not sure what she means here. the text in my translation reads: "Though they were graceful they did not seem like girls." perhaps check with Bowring --&gt; This particular scene is set on Kankō 5, 11th month, 22nd day (December 22, 1008).&lt;ref name="diary-p115-116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Painting only scenes====
The Hachisuka scroll contains paintings which are not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the [[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki#Thinking of the first time at court|second text section of the Hinohara scroll]], where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed ''[[tsumado]]'' (hinged plank door) and ''[[shitomido]]'' (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick on top of it (''[[tōdai (light)|tōdai]]'').&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For a reproduction as relief see the lower image on [http://kakitutei.web.fc2.com/murasaki/etizen/bridge2.html this page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The final illustration of the Hachisuka scroll has no corresponding text section in the extant emaki fragments. However its content can be matched to a scene from the diary in which Murasaki Shikibu expresses her sorrows as a widow&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Her husband had died in 1001.&lt;/ref&gt; worrying about the future. She relates how she is gazing dreamily at the moon when she is "hopelessly sad" and lonely. Playing the [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description of her room containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and that no one has touched since, the other with "old poems and romances", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in [[Kankō]] 6 (1009). The illustration present in the emaki&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For a reproduction as relief see the upper image on [http://kakitutei.web.fc2.com/murasaki/etizen/bridge2.html this page]. For a recent reproduction of the painting see [http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-1.htm this image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165712/http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-1.htm# |date=2012-05-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a tatami room playing the koto with a court lady walking outside her room on the balcony (''[[engawa]]'').&lt;ref name="diary-p132-133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fujita scroll===
Formerly in possession of the {{nihongo|[[Akimoto clan]]|秋元家}}, rulers of the [[Tatebayashi Domain]] in [[Kōzuke Province]], the extant Fujita scroll alternates five sections of text and five paintings. Based on this ancestral heritage it is sometimes referred to as former Akimoto scroll.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; A sixth text only section has been preserved as a 19th-century copy from the original emaki. The extant scroll is {{convert|434.0|cm|abbr=on}} long, in possession of the [[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Osaka]] and was designated as [[National Treasure of Japan]] on June 28, 1956.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbookXI"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ohishi|1990|p=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the time from the evening of the 5th day celebration of the birth of the first Imperial Prince, Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]], and ends with the furnishing of Michinaga's residence for the visit of [[Emperor Ichijō]].&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ohishi|1990|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki Fujita Art Museum 2ndpaint.JPG|thumb|x150px|right|Second painting.]]
Set shortly after the fifth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, this scene relates events from the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008), the day Michinaga celebrated the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō. Some people were casting ''da''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A gambling game played with dice now not known.&lt;/ref&gt; others composed poems. Murasaki Shikibu then praises [[Fujiwara no Kintō]]'s repartee and skills in the composition of poetry; however on this evening he did not participate in the exchange of poems. The queen gave gift of robes and baby dresses to the highest ranked ladies; lined kimonos to those of 4th rank; and [[hakama]] to the lesser sixth ranked ladies.&lt;ref name="diary-p89-90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A boating party====
The second section is a direct continuation of the previous scene, recounting an outing of young courtiers, dressed in white, going boating on a moonlit night the following day (Kankō 5, 9th month, 16th day, or 17 October 1008 in the Gregorian calendar). The ladies left behind appeared jealous according to Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;ref name="diary-p90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Fujita Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Ox-drawn carts of Emperor's ladies-in-waiting (illustration of the 3rd scene)]]
Continuing from the previous scene, confusion occurs among the people in the boats as palanquins of ladies-in-waiting of the Emperor's court appear near the shelter for conveyances. Michinaga welcomes them happily and distributes gifts among them.&lt;ref name="diary-p90-91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth celebration organized by the Imperial Court====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita - A).jpg|right|thumb|x150px|Murasaki Shikibu (center) catches a glimpse at the Empress (left) with undone hair beyond the ''misu''.&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt;]]
The Emperor celebrated on Kankō 5, 9th month, 17th day (October 18, 1008), the seventh day of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō. Presents were exchanged between court nobles and the Emperor. During the evening ceremony, Murasaki Shikibu catches a glance of the queen, remarking that she appeared weary, having lost weight and gaining a pale complexion. Her "hair would be better tied up" writes Murasaki Shikibu; however she stops the description, realizing the impropriety of her depiction of the  "mother of the nation".&lt;ref name="diary-p91-92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparations for the Imperial visit====
Set some time between Kankō 5, 10th month, 13th day and the morning of 16th day (November 13 to 16, 1008), this scene begins with a description of planting [[chrysanthemum]]s&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chrysanthemum flowers are associated with the Imperial Family.&lt;/ref&gt; at Michinaga's mansion in preparation for the Emperor's visit. In the second part of the section, Murasaki Shikibu is musing about her melancholic life because of an "extraordinary sorrow", wishing to be more adaptable and mindless. Wondering whether she is too sinful, she yearns for a religious life. Seeing waterfowl playing heedlessly in a pond, she writes the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:
&lt;poem&gt;
Waterfowl floating on the water—
They seem so gay,
But in truth
It is not gay to live anxiously seeking means of existence.
&lt;/poem&gt;

====Day of the Imperial visit (Tanaka Shinbi copy)====
A sixth text section of the Fujita scroll has been preserved in the form of a copy from the original manuscript made by {{nihongo|Tanaka Shinbi|田中親美}} (1875–1975), researcher and collector of Japanese fine arts who also assisted in the reproduction of old writings and ancient paintings including the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]].&lt;ref name="Shinbi-nipponica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Nipponica]] |title=田中親美 |trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi |url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E/ |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher=[[Shogakukan]] }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinbi-daijirin"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Daijirin]] |title=田中親美 |trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=112183000000 |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher=[[Sanseidō]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218184256/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=112183000000 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinbi-kokushi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Kokushi Daijiten]] |title=田中親美|trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi|url=http://dic.search.yahoo.co.jp/search?p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=opsrch |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher= [[Yoshikawa Kobunkan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1894 he worked on the reproduction of the Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki.&lt;ref name="Shinbi-nipponica"/&gt; This text fragment does not include any illustration and is in possession of the Tanaka family.[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita Art Museum) 2.jpg|left|thumb|x150px|Final painting of the extant scroll corresponding to the sixth scene: Michinaga on the veranda of his boathouse watching courtiers enjoying themselves in the boats he has provided&lt;ref name="mason-p107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p108"/&gt;]]

The scene, which in the diary directly follows the fifth scene of the Fujita scroll, tells of an exchange of letters between Murasaki Shikibu and the Lady Koshosho. Writing her response at the time of a brisk shower in a hurry in order not to keep the messenger waiting as the "sky looked threatening", Murasaki Shikibu adds the following poem to her letter:
&lt;poem&gt;
There are pauses between the showers of the outer world,
But there is no time when my sleeves, wet with tears, are dry.
&lt;/poem&gt;
After dark she receives the following reply from Lady Koshosho:
&lt;poem&gt;
The dark sky dulls my dreamy mind,
The down-dripping rain lingers–
O my tears down falling, longing after thee!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Changing topic, Murasaki Shikibu mentions shortly that at the same day, Michinaga inspected two new boats, one with a dragon's head the other with a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] head at the prow,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Both figures were said to have magical powers to prevent ships from sinking.&lt;/ref&gt; reminding her of animated living figures. The painting located in the emaki after the fifth text section, at the end of the extant Fujita scroll and originally before the sixth scene, illustrates this inspection of boats.&lt;ref name="diary-p95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowring-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Bowring|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penelope Mason sees this diverse composition as a nostalgic representation of the 13th century Imperial Court past its golden age, as despite of the "gaiety and splendor the scene is permeated with fleeting nature of joy and pleasure."&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;

===Matsudaira or former Morikawa scroll===
In 1920 Morikawa Kanichirō (森川勘一郎, 1887–1980) from [[Nagoya]] discovered a 5-segment scroll of the ''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'' consisting of alternatingly five illustrations and five captions.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"&gt;{{harvnb|Study and research institute of old writings|1989|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NagoyaCityMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.city.nagoya.jp/tenji080301.html|title=展覧会の案内|trans-title=Exhibition information|year=2000|publisher=[[Nagoya City Museum]]|accessdate=2011-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416025830/http://www.museum.city.nagoya.jp/tenji080301.html|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly in possession of the [[Matsudaira clan]], rulers of the [[Saijō Domain]] in [[Iyo Province]], this scroll is referred to as "Matsudaira clan edition" or after its finder as "Former Morikawa edition" (not to be confused with the Morikawa edition below which refers to the Morikawa family).&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; Two years after discovery Morikawa sold the scroll to the [[Niigata prefecture|Niigata]] businessman and master of the tea ceremony, Masuda Donō (益田鈍翁, 1847－1938, who had it cut into parts.&lt;ref name="masuda dono"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Biographical Dictionary of Art]] (美術人名辞典) |title=益田鈍翁|trans-title=Masuda Donō|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%9B%8A%E7%94%B0%E9%88%8D%E7%BF%81 |accessdate=2011-11-07|language=Japanese |edition=online }}&lt;/ref&gt; One part (Morikawa edition), the fifth segment, is bequeathed to the Morikawa family and today in a private collection. A year later, in 1933, Donō detached the third segment and reformatted it as a [[kakemono|hanging scroll]] (now in possession of the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]). The remaining three scenes (numbers 1, 2, 4) were framed in 1934, changed owner once more, eventually (via the Takanashi family)  ending up in the collection of the [[Gotoh Museum]].&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NagoyaCityMuseum"/&gt; They are known collectively as "Gotoh edition".&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; Today's Matsudaira scroll is spread over three locations and includes one [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]] and two [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]].
While this scroll has not survived in one piece, a 20th-century reproduction measures in at {{convert|453.1|cm|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; With the exception of the first scene of the Gotoh edition, the Matsudaira clan scroll depicts events on Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the ''ika-no-iwai'',&lt;ref group="nb" name="ikanoiwai"/&gt; the 50th day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō.

====Gotoh edition====
The Gotoh edition corresponds to scenes 1, 2 and 4 of the Matsudaira clan scroll and had been partitioned off from the scroll in 1932 and 1933 by Masuda Donō. It consists of 3 paintings and 3 associated captions each framed individually (six items in total).&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; This set has been designated as National Treasure on June 28, 1956 and is located at the [[Gotoh Museum]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

=====Moonlit night=====
[[Image:2000 Yen Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|The image of Murasaki Shikibu (bottom right) on the 2000 yen bank note is taken from this scene.]]
The scene dated to [[Kankō]] 5, 10th month, 17th day (November 17, 1008), shows two drunk courtiers trying to gain entrance to Murasaki Shikibu quarters after she had enjoyed the garden outside her apartment. In the illustration, Murasaki holds her window shut against the men.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt; First to arrive at the scene is the palace steward [[Sangi (Japan)|Sangi]] {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara no Sanenari]]|藤原実成}} (on right) who opens the upper part of Murasaki's lattice door and inquires whether anybody is at home. According to Murasaki Shikibu his intention is to be mentioned to [[Empress Shōshi|Akiko]]. Sanenari is joined by the consort's steward (associated with Akiko), Sangi {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara no Tadanobu]]|藤原斉信}} who also calls out: "Is anyone here?" Murasaki replies faintly, avoiding anything that could be regarded as flirting. Together the two courtiers are requesting her to open the lower part of the door. Such behaviour, somebody of higher rank trying to enter the house of somebody of lower rank, was in the Heian period considered disgraceful and only excused by the young age of the two courtiers.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"/&gt;

In the top right corner, Murasaki's friend, the maid Saishō no Kimi, is visible.&lt;ref name="mason-p33"/&gt; The large garden occupying the left half of the painting and the  diagonally positioned building are considered to be a bold scene arrangement.&lt;ref name="gotoh-nikki-2"&gt;{{citation

The third scene held by the Gotoh museum was originally the fourth segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll. It is therefore preceded by the segment held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and followed by the 5th segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll which is in possession of the Morikawa family. Like those segments, this scene is dated to the evening of the Ika-no-iwai&lt;ref group="nb" name="ikanoiwai"/&gt; celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō. It shows drunk and disordered court nobles amusing themselves with court ladies. This painting is particularly notable for its lifelike depiction of facial expressions and shapes of each figure in the scene.&lt;ref name="gotoh-nikki-6"&gt;{{citation

====Former Ōkura family fragment====

This item, consisting of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third scene of the Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] and in custody of the [[Tokyo National Museum]]. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day of the birth of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with [[kichō]] partitioners and the prince's grandfather, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] at the bottom is offering rice cake ([[mochi]]) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the bottom right is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100341/000/000?mode=simple&amp;d_lang=en&amp;s_lang=en&amp;word=murasaki&amp;class=&amp;title=&amp;c_e=&amp;region=&amp;era=&amp;century=&amp;cptype=&amp;owner=&amp;pos=1&amp;num=2 |title=Detached segment of The Diary of Lady Murasaki, emaki|publisher= [[Independent Administrative Institution National Institutes for Cultural Heritage]]|accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diary-p103-104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a single scene with a very short illustration showing the inside of a traditional Japanese style room with [[fusuma]] sliding doors, [[tatami]] and a curtain.&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Like all but the first segment of this scroll, the scene is set in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008) on occasion of the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]].&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi had been hiding from the drunken carousal of that evening, but were discovered by Michinaga, Saishō no Chūjō and others. The painting is dominated by the massive figure of Fujiwara no Michinaga dressed in brocade jacket and trousers and placed in the centre of the room.&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi are huddled near the border of the painting with heads bent down as a sign of submission and deference.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On discovering the two court ladies in hiding, Michinaga demands a poem from each of them. Murasaki being frightened and helpless in this situation recites the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:&lt;ref name="mason-p31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diary-p106-107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:On the fiftieth day how should one number those that follow?
:May the Prince's life span more than eight thousand years.

Despite being drunk, Michinaga answered quickly with another poem:

:O would I might live the life of a crane—
:Then might I reckon the years of the Prince
:Up to one thousand!

which according to Murasaki's diary "came from his innermost desire".&lt;ref name="diary-p106-107"/&gt; Based on the topic, this scene resembles the Azumaya edition of the Genji emaki where another court noble demands a response from a woman.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"/&gt;　This part of the scroll was designated [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]] on July 19, 1952.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Hinohara or former Hisamatsu scroll===
Formerly in possession of the [[Hisamatsu-Matsudaira clan]], a branch of the [[Matsudaira clan]] and rulers of the [[Iyo-Matsuyama Domain]], this scroll is now privately owned by the Hinohara family (日野原家). Due to this ancestral heritage it is variously referred to as "former Hisamatsu scroll" or "Hinohara scroll". The scroll is {{convert|531.6|cm|abbr=on}} long and consists of alternatingly six sections of text and six associated paintings on 13 sheets of paper.&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The fourth text part is relatively long and has been split in two.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The scroll has been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Day of the Bird festival====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 1 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 1st painting]]
Murasaki Shikibu tells of an anecdote at the festival of the Kamo Shrine held on Kankō 5, 11th month, 28th day (December 28, 1008), the last {{nihongo|Day of the Bird|酉の日|tori no hi}}.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Last day of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] in the 11th month.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, [[Fujiwara no Norimichi]], son of Michinaga, had the role of the Emperor's substitute. After a night of merriment, a joke is played on the [[Naidaijin]] by making him believe&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Through the content a characteristics of the present themselves.&lt;/ref&gt; that a present he had received is directly from the Empress; thus requiring an open return. Murasaki Shikibu goes on to describe how noble and dignified Norimichi looked on that day and how his nurse was overwhelmed by his appearance. In a sacred dance performed at night, the mediocre performance of one dancer who had been "very handsome last year" reminded Murasaki Shikibu "of the fleeting life of us all".&lt;ref name="diary-p119-120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration associated with this scene shows the Imperial Messenger, Fujiwara no Norimichi, his head decorated with wisteria branches on the top of a staircase of a shrine building. The [[Train (clothing)|train]] of his garment is flowing down the staircase and he is watched by three courtiers positioned near the bottom of the stairs.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=12–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thinking of the first time at court====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 2 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|x150px|left|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 2nd painting]]
Set on the evening of [[Kankō]] 5, 12th month, 29th day (January 27, 1009), in this scene, Murasaki Shikibu returns to the Imperial Court after a visit to her parents' home. As it is the anniversary of her coming to the court she is looking back at her former life nostalgically. Feeling lonely she goes to sleep murmuring the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:

:My life and the year are closing together.
:At the sound of the wind dreary is my heart.&lt;ref name="diary-p120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting following this text section shows a man on the stairs of a house and two men on a boat just outside the house. The illustration matching the scene described in the text is now the fifth painting of the Hachisuka scroll.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=15–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incident at night====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hinohara - scene 3).jpg|thumb|''All the night through, knocking louder than a water-rail, I stood in vain at the door of hinoki wood weary and lamenting.''&lt;ref name="diary-p140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This scene from an unknown day in the year Kankō 6 (1009) shows Murasaki asleep at night in a room close to the corridor; a man is knocking on the door. Afraid to open, she spends the night without making a sound. The next morning her nightly visitor reveals himself as Michinaga through a poem he sent to her. She replies with the lines:
:A cause of deep regret, indeed,
:Had the door opened at the knocking of the water-rail!&lt;ref name="diary-p140"/&gt;

====50th day celebration of Atsunaga-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki4L.JPG|thumb|x150px|left|Courtiers carrying food on the balconies of a building.]]
Scenes four to six describe the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsunaga-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]], on Kankō 7, 1st month, 15th day (February 1, 1010). The lengthy fourth section of text is split into two parts. Murasaki Shikibu briefly mentions her friendly relationship with Lady Kokosho and that they join their rooms separating them by ''kichō'' partitions only when both are at home. This behaviour made Michinaga believe that they are gossiping about other people.&lt;ref name="diary-p142-144"/&gt;  Murasaki Shikibu then describes the day's festivities: the Queen and her audience, the clothing, names and titles of the participants which included the Emperor, the infant prince and various court ladies. Dazzled in their presence, she escapes to an inner room. As the nurse, Madam Nakadaka comes away from the Emperor and Queen under the canopy, carrying the prince in her arms, Murasaki Shikibu praises her dignified demeanour, tranquility and earnestness.&lt;ref name="diary-p142-144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting associated with this scene shows four courtiers on the balcony (''[[engawa]]'') of a Japanese style building outside fabric enclosed rooms, which are not visible. Two of the men are shown walking, the others are kneeling and appear to be talking to a person inside the building or to be handing something to someone inside. Two of the men (one standing, one walking) carry trays with cups.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the full painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=21–22}}. For a recent reproduction of the full painting see [http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-6.htm this image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165636/http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-6.htm# |date=2012-05-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 5 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 5th painting]]
In  the subsequent scene, the [[dais]] at which the main persons are seated, covered by ''misu'',&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt; is opened and Murasaki Shikibu notes that the people present at the event and seated around the dais on the balcony were either of high rank or court ladies.  Lower rank officials later joined them on the steps below where the royalty is seated to perform music with a lute (''[[biwa]]''), harp (''[[Koto (instrument)|koto]]'') and [[Fue|flute]] (''[[Shō (instrument)|shō]]'').&lt;ref name="diary-p144-145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting corresponding to this scene shows two ladies on the balcony with rolled up misu. Both are squeezed in the corner of the image and appear to be talking to each other.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 6 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|left|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 6th painting]]
A short text section follows, which is the final scene of the scroll and the final part of the known diary. The official musicians mentioned in the previous scene are joined by outsiders, one of which "made a mistake in the notes and was hissed". The [[Minister of the Right]] made a great mistake in praising the six-stringed koto. The emaki text (and diary) ends abruptly with mention of Michinaga's gift of flutes in two boxes.&lt;ref name="diary-p145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration to this scene shows three courtiers seated in a row on the balcony with their backs facing the outside. The left figure is shown with a Japanese harp (''koto'') in front of him, his head is turned toward the other two who appear to be concentrating on something in front of them (likely instruments).

'''Neuropolitics''' investigates the interplay between the brain and politics.  It combines work from a variety of scientific fields including [[neuroscience]], political science, [[psychology]], [[behavioral genetics]], [[primatology]], and [[ethology]].  Often, neuropolitics research borrow methods from [[cognitive neuroscience]] to investigate classic questions from [[political science]] such as how people make political decisions, form political / ideological attitudes, evaluate political candidates, and interact in political coalitions.  However, another line of research considers the role that evolving political competition has had on the development of the brain in humans and other species.  The research in neuropolitics often intersects with work in [[genopolitics]], [[political psychology]], political physiology, [[sociobiology]], [[neuroeconomics]], and [[neurolaw]].

==History==
Philosophers, including [[Plato]] and [[John Locke]], have long theorized about the nature of human thought and used these theories as a basis for their [[political philosophy]].  In Locke's view, humans entered the world with a mind that was a [[blank slate]] and formed governments as a result of the necessities imposed by the [[state of nature]].  Though Locke was trained in medicine, he became skeptical about the value of anatomical studies of the brain and concluded that no useful insights about mental faculties could be developed by studying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |year=2005 |title=Soul Made Flesh |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Sperry]] and colleagues performed the first published neuropolitics experiment in 1979 with [[split-brain]] patients who had their corpus-callosum severed and thus had two brain hemispheres with severely impaired communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002839327990006X |title=Self recognition and social awareness in the deconnected minor hemisphere |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=17 |pages=153–166 |year=1979 |last=Sperry |first=Roger |author2=Eran Zaidel |author3=Dahlia W Zaidel  |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(79)90006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers showed photos of political figures to each of the patients' eyes (and thus each distinct brain hemisphere) separately and asked them to give a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" evaluation.  Both hemispheres were shown to be capable of rendering a political attitude about the people they were viewing.  For instance, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Fidel Castro]] were given a thumbs down, while [[Winston Churchill]] was given a thumbs up, and [[Richard Nixon]] was given a thumb in the neutral position (the experiments were carried out prior to full revelation of the [[Watergate scandal]].)  Each hemisphere attempted to communicate clues about the identity of the individuals to the other hemisphere.  This study demonstrated that neurological approaches could inform researchers' understanding of political attitudes.

[[Frans de Waal]]'s first book in 1982, ''Chimpanzee Politics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Frans |year=1982 |title=Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex among Apes}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the brains of non-human primates like [[chimpanzees]] enabled them to engage in the strategic manipulation of others.  This "[[Machiavellian intelligence]]" facilitated the formation of coalitions and political dynamics with many analogues to human politics.  Later work by [[Robin Dunbar]] suggested a relationship between the size of an animal's neo-cortex and the size of the social group it could successfully manage.  While [[Aristotle's Politics]] compared the mental faculties of humans to other animals in trying to establish a foundation for understanding human politics, the systematic work of de Waal and Dunbar brought rigorous methods for illuminating the relationship between the brain and politics, even across distantly related species.

==Neuroimaging==
The advent of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] gave a new set of tools to [[neuroscience]] that could be used to investigate questions that were difficult or impossible to address previously.  The first neuropolitics studies using fMRI looked at the differences in brain activity between people who were knowledgeable about national politics and those who were not, while they answered political questions.  Following in the tradition of work by [[Philip Converse]] and [[John Zaller]], it found that the politically knowledgeable had elevated levels of activity in the [[default mode network]] of the brain while political novices had diminished activity in the same areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Darren |last=Schreiber |title=Evaluating politics: A search for the neural substrates of political thought |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |year=2005 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/31/96/3196356.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/912.abstract |title=Biology, Politics, and the Emerging Science of Human Nature |journal=Science |volume=322 |pages=912–914 |year=2008 |last=Fowler |first=James |author2=Darren Schreiber  |format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.1158188 |issue=5903 |pmid=18988845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A subsequent study by [[Drew Westen]] and colleagues confirmed the elevated default mode network activity for political sophisticates and suggested differences between Republicans and Democrats in how they think about political questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1947 |title=Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1947–1958 |year=2006 |last=Westen |first=Drew |author2=Pavel S.

==Politics in other species==
Despite the risks of anthropomorphizing the behaviors of non-human animals, researchers have investigated the politics of a number of social species.  In addition to de Waals' work on chimpanzees, scientists have investigated the dynamics of coalitions in [[hyenas]], [[dolphins]], [[elephants]], and other animals.  In the [[spotted hyena]], for instance, social interactions are characterized by a [[fission-fusion society]] in which groups of hyenas can form and dissolve on a regular basis.  The greater complexity of the political dynamics among the spotted hyena appears to require a larger [[neocortex]] than in related species with simpler social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain Size and Social Complexity: A Computed Tomography Study in Hyaenidae |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Evolution |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=91–104 |year=2011 |last=Sakai |first=Sharleen |author2=Bradley M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">'''Numerical taxonomy'''  is a [[Biological classification|classification system]] in biological [[systematics]] which deals with the grouping by [[numerical method]]s of [[taxon|taxonomic units]] based on their character states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title=Numerical Taxonomy (biology) |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to create a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] using numeric algorithms like [[cluster analysis]] rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by [[Robert R. Sokal]] and [[Peter H. A. Sneath]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;Sokal &amp; Sneath: ''Principles of Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and later elaborated by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Sneath and Sokal: ''Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; They divided the field into [[phenetics]] in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and [[cladistics]] in which classifications are based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa.{{cn span|In recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors.|date=May 2017}}

Although intended as an objective method, in practice the choice and implicit or explicit [[weighting]] of characteristics is influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create [[dendrogram]]s and [[cladogram]]s using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data.

In marine environments, a '''nursery [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]''' is a subset of all habitats where juveniles of a [[species]] occur, having a greater level of productivity per unit area than other juvenile habitats (Beck et al. 2001).  Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass are typical nursery habitats for a range of marine species.  Some species will use nonvegetated sites, such as Yellow Eyed Mullet, Blue Sprat and Flounder.

==Overview==
The nursery habitat hypothesis states that the contribution per unit area of a nursery habitat is greater than for other habitats used by juveniles for the species.  Productivity may be measured by density, survival, growth and movement to adult habitat (Beck et al. 2001).

There are two general models for the location of juvenile habitats within the total range for a species which reflect life history strategies of the species.  These are the Classic Concept: Juveniles and Adults in separate habitats.  Juveniles migrate to adult habitat.  General Concept: overlap of juvenile and adult habitats.  

Some marine species do not have juvenile habitats, e.g. arthropods and scallops.  Commonly fish, ells, some lobsters, blue crabs (and so forth) do have distinct juvenile habitats, whether with or without overlap with adult habitats.    

In terms of management, use of the nursery role [[hypothesis]] may be limiting as it excludes some potentially important nursery sites.  In these cases the Effective Juvenile Habitat concept may be more useful.  This defines a nursery as that which supplies a higher percentage of individuals to adult populations.  

Identification and subsequent management of nursery habitats may be important in supporting off shore fisheries and ensuring species survival into the future.  If we are unable to preserve nursery habitats, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations may decline, reducing population numbers and compromising the survival of species for [[biodiversity]] and human harvesting.

==Determination==
In order to determine the nursery habitat for a species, all habitats used by juveniles must be surveyed.  This may include [[kelp forest]], seagrass, mangroves, tidal flat, mudflat, wetland, salt marsh and oyster reef.  While density may be an indicator of productivity, it is suggested that alone, density does not adequately provide evidence of the role of a habitat as a nursery. Recruitment biomass from juvenile to adult population is the best measure of movement between the two habitats.  

Consider also biotic, abiotic and landscape variability in the value of nursery habitats.  This may be an important consideration when looking at which sites to manage and protect.  Biotic factors include: structural complexity, food availability, larval settlement cues, competition, and predation.  Abiotic: temperature, salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, freshwater inflow, retention zone and disturbance.  Landscape factors involve: proximity of juvenile and adult habitats, access to [[larva]]e, number of adjacent habitats, patch shape, area and fragmentation.  The effects of these factors may be positive or negative depending on species and broader environmental conditions at any given time.  

It may be more holistic to consider temporal variation in habitats used as nurseries, and incorporating temporal scales into any testing is important.  Also consider assemblages of species.  Single species approaches may not be able to be used to adequately manage systems appropriately.

Acosta and Butler conducted experimental observation of spiny lobster to determine which habitats are used as nurseries.  Mangroves are used as preferred nursery habitat when coral density is low.  Predation on newly settled larvae was lower in mangrove than in seagrass beds and coral crevices.    In comparison, Pipefish prefer seagrass over algae and sand habitats.  King George Whiting have a more complex pattern of development.  Settlement is preferred in seagrass and [[algae]].  Growth stages are primarily preferred in reef algae.  4 months post settlement, they move into unvegetated habitats (Jenkins and Wheatley, 1998).

'''Omni Processor''' is a name proposed by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] for a group of physical, biological or chemical treatment processes to process [[septage|fecal sludge]] – a mixture of human [[excreta]] and water – in developing countries. One of the main treatment aims is [[pathogen]] removal to stop the spread of disease from fecal sludge. The term was created by staff of the Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Program at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kuchenrither, R. D., Stone, L., Haug, R. T. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1640 Omni-Processor Landscaping Project]. Consultancy report by WERF (Water Environment Research Foundation), commissioned by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a trade mark for one specific product or technology. Several research teams are currently developing various types of omni processors with funding from the foundation. Examples of technologies which Omni Processors may employ include [[combustion]], [[supercritical water oxidation]] and [[pyrolysis]].

The term "omni" in its name refers to the fact that an Omni Processor machine can process a variety of waste streams or fuel sources.

== Background and aims ==
Since 2012, the  Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has been funding research into what they have named "Omni Processors". An Omni Processor (OP) is any of various types of technologies that treat fecal sludge, also known as [[septage]]. The aim of the treatment is to remove all [[pathogens]] and at the same time to generate outputs of commercial value. These beneficial products can be energy and soil nutrients and might have the potential to allow a development of local business and revenue.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The soil nutrients could be used as a form of [[reuse of excreta]] in agriculture. The Omni Processor program targets community scale solutions that may combine fecal sludge and [[solid waste]] processing. It complements the foundation's [[pit latrine]] emptying ("Omni-Ingestor") and "Reinvent the Toilet" investment programs.

== Challenges ==
The Omni Processor is targeted as a solution for [[developing countries]], although challenges around technical and financial aspects remain.&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wateraid.org/news/news/gates-drinks-water-made-from-faeces|title = Gates drinks water made from faeces – and so do you!|date = 9 January 2015|accessdate = 13 January 2015|website = WaterAid UK|publisher = Rémi Kaupp|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Omni Processors and Omni Ingestors are being designed to provide an alternative to [[sewerage]] system-based technologies. They are also intended to address the large number of existing [[pit latrine]]s which lack a supporting infrastructure of fecal sludge collection and processing when the pits are full. Sludge from pit latrines has to be removed from the pits for treatment and disposal either by pumping (if the fecal sludge is sufficiently liquid) or by manual emptying with shovels or other devices (in India, this practice is called [[manual scavenging]]). Despite new low-cost pumps being developed, only a small fraction of sludge is safely extracted and treated currently in many African and Asian cities.&lt;ref name="WA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/WSP-Fecal-Sludge-12-City-Review-Research-Brief.pdf|title=The Missing Link in Sanitation Service Delivery, A Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities|date=April 2014|publisher=WSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be necessary to adapt established technologies in ways to fit [[developing world]] communities. The success of such technologies will depend on how well the process is managed.

== Examples ==

=== Janicki Bioenergy ===
[[File:IJANICKI OMNI PROCESSOR.jpg|thumb|Omni Processor (sewage sludge treatment system using combustion) at Janicki Bioenergy’s headquarters in the U.S.]]
The U.S.-based company Janicki Bioenergy presented in 2014 a prototype using [[combustion]]. Their process is a [[sewage sludge treatment]] system that produces drinking water and electrical energy as end products from [[sewage sludge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://janickibioenergy.com/s100.html|title = Omni Processor - S100|date = |accessdate = 8 May 2015|website = |publisher = Janicki Bioenergy|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109083138/http://janickibioenergy.com/s100.html|archivedate = 9 January 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by Janicki Bioenergy, the proof of concept model was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The S100 prototype model can produce 10,800 liters of drinking water per day and 100&amp;nbsp;kW net electricity.  A larger model under development, the S200, is designed to handle the waste from 100,000 people, produce 86,000 litres of drinking water per day and 250&amp;nbsp;kW net output electricity.  These systems are designed to provide a "self-sustaining [[bioenergy]]" process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30709273|title=BBC news article "Bill Gates drinks water distilled from human faeces"|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Omniprocessor-From-Poop-to-Potable|title = From poop to portable, This Ingenious Machine Turns Feces Into Drinking Water|date = 5 January 2015|accessdate = 13 January 2015|website = gatesnotes, The Blog of Bill Gates|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment process first involves boiling the [[sewage sludge]], during which water vapour is boiled off and recovered. A dry sludge is left behind which is then combusted as fuel to heat a boiler. This boiler produces steam and the heat necessary for the boiling process. The steam is then used to generate electrical energy. Some of this electrical energy is used for the final water [[reverse osmosis]] purification stages to produce safe drinking water, and to power ancillary pumps, fans and motors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5279">A '''patrocladogram''' is a [[cladistic]] branching pattern that has been precisely modified by use of patristic distances (i.e., divergences between lineages); a type of [[phylogram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hörandl E |author2=Stuessy T.F. |year=2010 |title=Paraphyletic groups as natural units of biological classification |journal= [[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=345–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patristic distance is defined as, "the number of apomorphic step changes separating two taxa on a cladogram,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stuessy T.F. |author2=König C |date=May 2008 |title=Patrocladistic classification |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]|volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=594–601}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and is used exclusively to determine the amount of divergence of a characteristic from a common ancestor. This means that cladistic and patristic distances are combined to construct a new tree using various phenetic [[algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Achigan-Dako|first=Enoch G.|title=Phylogenetic and Genetic Variation Analyses in Cucurbit Species (Cucurbitaceae) from West Africa: definition of Conservation strategies|year=2008|publisher=Cuvillier Verlag|isbn=978-3867277853|pages=1–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the patrocladogram in [[biological classification]] is to form a hypothesis about which evolutionary processes are actually involved before making a taxonomic decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hörandl E. |date=April 2010 |title=Beyond cladistics: Extending evolutionary classifications into deeper time levels |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=345–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrocladograms are based on [[biostatistics]] that include but are not limited to: [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]], [[distance matrix]], [[maximum likelihood|likelihood method]]s, and [[Bayesian probability]]. Some examples of genomically related [[data]] that can be used as inputs for these methods are: [[Sequencing|molecular sequences]], whole [[genome]] sequences, gene frequencies, [[restriction site]]s, distance matrices, unique characters, mutations such as [[SNPs]], and [[mitochondrial genome]] data.

==Cautions with patrocladogram usage==

Patrocladograms are graphs that assert [[hypotheses]] of similarity whereas [[phylogenetic]] trees are graphs that assert hypotheses of common [[ancestry]]. When a patrocladogram does not logically match with a comparable phylogenetic tree hypothesis it should not be used to define monophyletic groups. The usage of patrocladograms can skew interpretations of novel evolution or depict [[homology (biology)|homologous]] traits as [[Convergent evolution|homoplastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wiley E.O. |date=February 2009 |title=Patrocladistics, nothing new |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=2–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs for patrocladogram analysis==

Most phylograms are saved in some variant of the [[Newick format]] such as: [[PAUP*]], [[MEGA, Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis]], [[Clustal]], [[PHYLIP]], or [[Nexus file]]. These various versions of the Newick format can then be used as an input for patristic distances in patrocladogram formation. There are two widely used pieces of [[software]]; one is used for [[analyzing]] patristic distance, and the other for creating a viewable patrocladogram.

See both programs below:

===PATRISTIC===
Patristic is a Java program that uses different tree files as input and computes their patristic distances. Patristic allows saving and editing those distances. Patristic provides different graphic views of the results as well as the possibility to save them in the CSV format for building graphics using Excel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fourment M. |author2=Gibbs M. J. |year=2006|title= PATRISTIC: a program for calculating patristic distances and graphically comparing the components of genetic change |journal= BioMed Central Evolutionary Biology |volume=6 |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-6-1|pmid=16388682 |pmc=1352388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAMI===
RAMI uses branch lengths to create clusters which can then be visualized as a patrocladogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pommier T. |author2=Canbäck B. |author3=Lundberg P. |author4=Hagström A. |author5=Tunlid A. |year=2009 |title= RAMI: a tool for identification and characterization of phylogenetic clusters in microbial communities |journal= [[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]] |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=736–742 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp051|pmid=19223450 |pmc=2654800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiation therapy''' or '''radiotherapy''', often abbreviated '''RT''', '''RTx''', or '''XRT''', is [[therapy]] using [[ionizing radiation]], generally as part of [[oncology|cancer treatment]] to control or kill [[Malignancy|malignant]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and normally delivered by a [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]]. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of [[adjuvant therapy]], to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with [[chemotherapy]], and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called '''radiation oncology'''.

Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous tissue leading to [[mitotic catastrophe|cellular death]].  To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger [[absorbed dose]] there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from [[radiology]], the use of radiation in [[medical imaging]] and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Radiation may be prescribed by a [[radiation oncologist]] with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as [[Palliative care|palliative treatment]] (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with [[surgery]], chemotherapy, [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone therapy]], [[immunotherapy]] or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.

The precise treatment intent (curative&lt;!--let's not use the term radical till we define it (below)--&gt;, adjuvant, [[Neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant therapeutic]], or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. [[Total body irradiation]] (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a [[bone marrow transplant]]. [[Brachytherapy]], in which a [[radioactive source]] is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of [[trigeminal neuralgia]], [[Vestibular schwannoma|acoustic neuromas]], severe [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|thyroid eye disease]], [[pterygium]], [[pigmented villonodular synovitis]], and prevention of [[keloid]] scar growth, vascular [[restenosis]], and [[heterotopic ossification]]. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.

==Medical uses==
[[File:Palliative Care Options for a Young Adult Patient with a Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma - Fig. 3.png|thumb|Radiation therapy for a patient with a [[diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma]], with radiation dose color-coded.]]
Different cancers respond to radiation therapy in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;CK Bomford, IH Kunkler, J Walter. Walter and Miller’s Textbook of Radiation therapy (6th Ed), p311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Radiosensitivity" on GP notebook http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=2060451853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Radiation therapy- what GPs need to know" on patient.co.uk http://patient.info/doctor/radiotherapy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: these refs support the whole list here --&gt;

The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.
Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include [[leukemias]], most [[lymphomas]] and [[germ cell tumors]].
The majority of [[epithelial cancers]] are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70&amp;nbsp;Gy) to achieve a radical cure.
Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. [[Renal cell cancer]] and [[melanoma]] are generally considered to be radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with [[immunotherapy]] is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maverakis E, Cornelius LA, Bowen GM, Phan T, Patel FB, Fitzmaurice S, He Y, Burrall B, Duong C, Kloxin AM, Sultani H, Wilken R, Martinez SR, Patel F | title = Metastatic melanoma - a review of current and future treatment options | journal = Acta Derm Venereol | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 516–524 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25520039 | doi = 10.2340/00015555-2035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation "curability" of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example: [[Skin neoplasm|non-melanoma skin cancer]], [[head and neck cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], [[anal cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]. [[Metastatic]] cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.

Before treatment, a CT scan is often performed to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields.&lt;ref name=camphausen&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Patient positioning is crucial at this stage as the patient will have to be set-up in the identical position during treatment.  Many patient positioning devices have been developed for this purpose, including masks and cushions which can be molded to the patient.

The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. Due to complex [[radiobiology]], very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with [[wide local excision]] or [[mastectomy]] followed by [[adjuvant radiation therapy]]. Another method is to shrink the tumor with [[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: [[Cisplatin]], [[Nimorazole]], and [[Cetuximab]].

The effect of radiotherapy on control of cancer has been shown to be limited to the first five years after surgery, particularly for breast cancer. The difference between breast cancer recurrence in patients who receive radiotherapy vs. those who don't is seen mostly in the first 2–3 years and no difference is seen after 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickberg A, Holmberg L, Adami HO, Magnuson A, Villman K, Liljegren G | title = Sector resection with or without postoperative radiotherapy for stage I breast cancer: 20-year results of a randomized trial | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 791–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24493730 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2013.50.6600 | lay-summary = http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~rmhkjsv/TARGIT-A-follow-up.pdf | lay-source = Jayant S Vaidya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Radiation therapy is in itself painless. Many low-dose [[Palliative care|palliative treatments]] (for example, radiation therapy to bony [[metastases]]) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.

Most side effects are predictable and expected. Side effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patient's body that is under treatment. Side effects are dose- dependent; for example higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with [[cardiovascular]] complications, [[thyroid]] dysfunction, and [[pituitary]] axis dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mahmood SS |title=Cardiovascular Complications of Cranial and Neck Radiation |journal=Current Treatment Options in Cardiovascular Medicine|volume=18 |issue=45 | year= 2016|pmid=27181400 |doi=10.1007/s11936-016-0468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.

The main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but  may not be as elastic as it was before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |title=Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer: Possible Side Effects |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301041308/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute side effects===
; Nausea and vomiting
:This is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen (which commonly react a few hours after treatment), or with radiation therapy to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the [[vestibule of the ear|vestibules of the inner ears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee VH, Ng SC, Leung TW, Au GK, Kwong DL | title = Dosimetric predictors of radiation-induced acute nausea and vomiting in IMRT for nasopharyngeal cancer | journal = International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–82 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22245210 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330060027/http://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }} Common radiation side effects&lt;/ref&gt;
; Damage to the [[epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping/radiation-therapy-and-you/page8 |title=Radiation Therapy Side Effects and Ways to Manage them|publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this [[moist desquamation]] is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.
; Mouth, throat and stomach sores

; Intestinal discomfort
:The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.
; Swelling
:As part of the general [[inflammation]] that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised [[intracranial pressure]] or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (e.g., [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or main [[bronchus]]). Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive [[steroids]] during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.
; Infertility
:The [[gonads]] (ovaries and testicles) are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce [[gametes]] following '''direct''' exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment.

===Late side effects===
Late side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.

; [[Fibrosis]]
: Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process.
; Epilation
: Epilation (hair loss) may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1&amp;nbsp;Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field/s. Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10&amp;nbsp;Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45&amp;nbsp;Gy.
; Dryness
: The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] in 2&amp;nbsp;Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]) and dry eyes ([[xerophthalmia]]) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]]. Similarly, [[sweat gland]]s in treated skin (such as the [[armpit]]) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal [[mucosa]] is often dry following pelvic irradiation.
; [[Lymphedema]]
: Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .&lt;ref name="pmid9874399"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meek AG | title = Breast radiation therapy and lymphedema | journal = Cancer | volume = 83 | issue = 12 Suppl American | pages = 2788–97 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9874399 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981215)83:12B+&lt;2788::AID-CNCR27&gt;3.0.CO;2-I }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Cancer
: Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in a very small minority of patients – usually less than 1/1000. It usually occurs 20 – 30 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 5 – 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer. The cancer occurs within the treated area of the patient.
; [[Cardiovascular disease]]
: Radiation can increase the risk of heart disease and death as observed in previous breast cancer RT regimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor CW, Nisbet A, McGale P, Darby SC | title = Cardiac exposures in breast cancer radiotherapy: 1950s-1990s | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 1484–95 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18035211 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.05.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event (i.e., heart attack or stroke) by 1.5 to 4 times a person's normal rate, aggravating factors included.&lt;ref name="pmid:20298931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weintraub NL, Jones WK, Manka D | title = Understanding radiation-induced vascular disease | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1237–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20298931 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.053 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase is dose dependent, related to the RT's dose strength, volume and location.

; Cognitive decline
: In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause [[Radiation induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]]. Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5 year old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/lateeffects/HealthProfessional/page4|title=Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Depending upon the irradiated zone, late effect neuropathy may occur in either the [[Central nervous system|central nervous system (CNS)]] or the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system (PNS)]].

===Cumulative side effects===
Cumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieder C, Milas L, Ang KK | title = Tissue tolerance to reirradiation | journal = Semin Radiat Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11034631 | doi = 10.1053/srao.2000.6593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.

===Effects on reproduction===
During the first two weeks after [[fertilization]], radiation therapy is lethal but not [[teratogenic]].&lt;ref name="arnon2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnon J, Meirow D, Lewis-Roness H, Ornoy A|year=2001|title=Genetic and teratogenic effects of cancer treatments on gametes and embryos|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=7|issue=4|pages=394–403|doi=10.1093/humupd/7.4.394|pmid=11476352}} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce [[congenital anomaly|anomalies]], [[Intrauterine growth restriction|impaired growth]] and [[intellectual disability]], and there may be an increased risk of [[childhood leukemia]] and other tumours in the offspring.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt;

In males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt; However, the use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt;

===Effects on pituitary system===
[[Hypopituitarism]] commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, head and neck tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_2009/&gt; Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects [[growth hormone]] and [[gonadal hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="Fernandez_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fernandez A, Brada M, Zabuliene L, Karavitaki N, Wass JA | title = Radiation-induced hypopituitarism | journal = Endocr.

===Radiation therapy accidents===
There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine [[Therac-25]] was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in [[Missouri]] overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25radiation.html|title=Missouri Hospital Reports Errors in Radiation Doses|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 February 2010|access-date=26 February 2010 | first1=Walt | last1=Bogdanich | first2=Rebecca R. | last2=Ruiz | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called  [https://www.astro.org/Patient-Care-and-Research/Patient-Safety/Target-Safely Target Safely] that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from happening. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |title=What Questions Should I Ask My Doctor?: Questions to ask after treatment ends |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-09-22 |access-date=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412020804/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |archive-date=2012-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in non-cancerous diseases==
[[File:DupuytrensRadiotherapyHamburg.jpg|thumb|The beam's eye view of the radiotherapy portal on the hand's surface with the lead shield cut-out placed in the machine's gantry]]

Radiation therapy is used to treat early stage [[Dupuytren's contracture|Dupuytren's disease]] and [[Plantar fibromatosis|Ledderhose disease]]. When Dupuytren's disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress. Low doses of radiation are used typically three gray of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three gray of radiation for five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Charles|last2=Seegenschmiedt|first2=M.

==Technique==

===Mechanism of action===
Radiation therapy works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous cells. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy, [[photon]] or [[charged particle]]. This damage is either direct or indirect [[ionization]] of the atoms which make up the DNA chain. Indirect [[ionization]] happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], notably [[hydroxyl]] radicals, which then damage the DNA.

In photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and [[double-stranded DNA]] damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are much more difficult to repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo [[Apoptosis|cell death]]. Cancer cells are generally less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] and more [[stem cell]]-like; they reproduce more than most healthy [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.

One of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in [[oxygen]]. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Oxygen is a potent [[radiosensitizer]], increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harrison LB, Chadha M, Hill RJ, Hu K, Shasha D | title = Impact of tumor hypoxia and anemia on radiation therapy outcomes | journal = Oncologist | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 492–508 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12490737 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.7-6-492 | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12490737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, [[hyperthermia therapy]] (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as [[misonidazole]] and [[metronidazole]], and hypoxic [[cytotoxins]] (tissue poisons), such as [[tirapazamine]].  Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]] such as [[trans sodium crocetinate]] (TSC) as a  [[radiosensitizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheehan JP, Shaffrey ME, Gupta B, Larner J, Rich JN, Park DM | title = Improving the radiosensitivity of radioresistant and hypoxic glioblastoma | journal = Future Oncology | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 1591–1601 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21062158 | doi = 10.2217/fon.10.123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charged particles such as [[proton]]s and [[boron]], [[carbon]], and [[neon]] ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET ([[linear energy transfer]]) and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the [[Bragg peak]] effect. See [[proton therapy]] for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. [[charged particle therapy]]. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker DG, Edwards BK, Tucker MA, Fraumeni JF Jr. (eds). New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973–2000. National Cancer Institute. NIH Publ. No. 05-5302. Bethesda, MD, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: [[head and neck cancers]]).
This x-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and they have a 30% chance of a second malignancy after 5 years post initial RT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/ISS/PDF/Risikoanalyse/Georgetown/Robison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dose===
The amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy), and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80&amp;nbsp;Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;Gy.

Preventive (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45–60&amp;nbsp;Gy in 1.8–2&amp;nbsp;Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers.) Many other factors are considered by [[radiation oncologist]]s when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.

Delivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during [[treatment planning]] (part of [[dosimetry]]). Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the [[dosimetry]] technique known as [[gel dosimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldock C, De Deene Y, Doran S, Ibbott G, Jirasek A, Lepage M, McAuley KB, Oldham M, Schreiner LJ | year = 2010 | title = Polymer gel dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 55 | issue = 5| page = R1 | doi=10.1088/0031-9155/55/5/r01 | pmid=20150687 | pmc=3031873| bibcode=2010PMB....55R...1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fractionation
{{hatnote|This section only applies to photon radiotherapy although other types of radiation therapy may be fractionated}}
The total dose is fractionated (spread out over time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ang|first1=K. Kian|title=Altered fractionation trials in head and neck cancer|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|date=October 1998|volume=8|issue=4|pages=230–236|doi=10.1016/S1053-4296(98)80020-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2&amp;nbsp;Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.

In some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller.

;Schedules for fractionation
One fractionation schedule that is increasingly being used and continues to be studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2&amp;nbsp;Gy/fraction to 20&amp;nbsp;Gy/fraction, the latter being typical of stereotactic treatments (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, or SABR – also known as SBRT, or stereotactic body radiotherapy) for subcranial lesions, or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for intracranial lesions. The rationale of hypofractionation is to reduce the probability of local recurrence by denying clonogenic cells the time they require to reproduce and also to exploit the radiosensitivity of some tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed . Hypofractionation: Scientific Concepts and Clinical Experiences. 1st. Ellicot City: LimiText Publishing, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, stereotactic treatments are intended to destroy clonogenic cells by a process of ablation – ''i.e.'' the delivery of a dose intended to destroy clonogenic cells directly, rather than to interrupt the process of clonogenic cell division repeatedly (apoptosis), as in routine radiotherapy.

==== Estimation of dose based on target sensitivity ====

==Types==
Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are :
*[[external beam radiation therapy]] (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy; 
*brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy; and 
*systemic radioisotope therapy or [[unsealed source radiotherapy]]. 
The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel.

[[Particle therapy]] is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are [[proton]]s or heavier [[ions]].

===External beam radiation therapy===

{{Main|External beam radiation therapy}}

The following three sections refer to treatment using x-rays.

====Conventional external beam radiation therapy====

}}]]
Conventional external beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill R, Healy B, Holloway L, Kuncic Z, Thwaites D, Baldock C | title = Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = R183-231 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24584183 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/6/R183 | bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.183H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thwaites DI, Tuohy JB | title = Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 51 | issue = 13 | pages = R343-62 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790912 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/51/13/R20 | bibcode = 2006PMB....51R.343T }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. ''Conventional'' refers to the way the treatment is ''planned'' or ''simulated'' on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired ''plan''. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lagendijk JJ, Raaymakers BW, Van den Berg CA, Moerland MA, Philippens ME, van Vulpen M | title = MR guidance in radiotherapy | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 21 | pages = R349-69 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25322150 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/21/R349 | bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.349L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stereotactic radiation====

{{main|Radiosurgery}}

Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.

There are two types of stereotactic radiation. '''Stereotactic radiosurgery''' (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. '''Stereotactic body radiation therapy''' (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |title=American Society for Radiation Oncology |publisher=Astro.org |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613154749/http://astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.

Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, [[Cyberknife]], [[Gamma Knife]], Novalis, Primatom, Synergy, [[X-Knife]], [[TomoTherapy]], Trilogy and [[Truebeam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |title=Treatment Types: Stereotactic Radiation Therapy |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091107/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.

====Virtual simulation, and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy====

The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucci MK, Bevan A, Roach M | title = Advances in radiation therapy: conventional to 3D, to IMRT, to 4D, and beyond | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–34 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15761080 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.55.2.117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.

An enhancement of virtual simulation is '''3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)''', in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a [[beam's eye view]] (BEV) using a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) and a variable number of beams. &lt;!--I took this out -- see discussion: The aim of this process is to improve the [[therapeutic index]] of the radiation therapy: by conforming the treatment volume--&gt;When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.&lt;ref name=camphausen/&gt;

==== Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) ====
[[File:Varian TruBeam.jpg|thumb|[[Varian Medical Systems|Varian]] TruBeam [[Linear Accelerator]], used for delivering IMRT]]
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.&lt;ref name="Galvin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galvin JM, Ezzell G, Eisbrauch A, Yu C, Butler B, Xiao Y, Rosen I, Rosenman J, Sharpe M, Xing L, Xia P, Lomax T, Low DA, Palta J | title = Implementing IMRT in clinical practice: a joint document of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine | journal = Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 1616–34 | date = Apr 2004 | pmid = 15050343 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes,&lt;ref name="camphausen" /&gt; for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irsa.org/imrt.html |title=Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy |publisher=Irsa.org |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and treatment simulation ([[Treatment Planning]]). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam’s intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissues is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.

3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast, and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency programs must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.

Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers in a series of pivotal trials performed by Professor [[Christopher Nutting]] of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT,&lt;ref name="pmid12694826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall EJ, Wuu CS | title = Radiation-induced second cancers: the impact of 3D-CRT and IMRT | journal = Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12694826 | doi = 10.1016/S0360-3016(03)00073-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.

Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wing-Fai Loke |author2=Tae-Young Choi |author3=Teimour Maleki |author4=Lech Papiez |author5=Babak Ziaie |author6=Byunghoo Jung |title=Magnetic Tracking System for Radiation Therapy  |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems |year=2010 |doi= 10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2046737 |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |pages= 223–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=M.

==== Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) ====
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2007&lt;ref name="pmid22011829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teoh M, Clark CH, Wood K, Whitaker S, Nisbet A | title = Volumetric modulated arc therapy: a review of current literature and clinical use in practice | journal = The British Journal of Radiology | volume = 84 | issue = 1007 | pages = 967-96 | date = Nov 2011 | pmid = 22011829 | doi = 10.1259/bjr/22373346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360° rotating fields with one or more arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) ("sliding window" system of moving) and fluence output rate (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT has an advantage in patient treatment, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), of reduced radiation delivery times.&lt;ref name="pmid20188427"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertelsen A, Hansen CR, Johansen J, Brink C | title = Single Arc Volumetric modulated Arc therapy of head and neck cancer | journal = Radiotherapy and Oncology : Journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–8 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20188427 | doi = 10.1016/j.radonc.2010.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSN:1748-717X-8-37"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = VanGestel D, VanVliet-Vroegindeweij C, VanDenHeuvel F, Crijns W, Coelmont A, DeOst B, Holt A, Lamers E, Geussens Y, Nuyts S, VanDenWeyngaert D, VanDenWyngaert T, Vermorken JB, Gregoire V | title = RapidArc, SmartArc and TomoHD compared with classical step and shoot and sliding window intensity modulated radiotherapy in an oropharyngeal cancer treatment plan comparison | journal = Radiation Oncology | volume = 8 | issue = 37 | date = Feb 2013 | doi = 10.1186/1748-717X-8-37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons between VMAT and conventional IMRT for their sparing of healthy tissues and Organs at Risk (OAR) depends upon the cancer type.

====Particle therapy====

{{Main|Particle therapy}}

In particle therapy ([[proton therapy]] being one example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are directed at the target tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html|title=Brain tumor patient 'unaware' treatment was available on NHS|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622115602/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html|archivedate=22 June 2009|first=Jeremy|last=Laurance|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the [[Bragg peak]]) that occurs near the end of the particle's [[Range (particle radiation)|range]], and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.

====Auger therapy====

{{Main|Auger therapy}}

[[Auger therapy]] (AT) makes use of a very high dose&lt;ref name="pmid1461197"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kereiakes JG, Rao DV | title = Auger electron dosimetry: report of AAPM Nuclear Medicine Committee Task Group No. 6 | journal = Med Phys | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1359 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1461197 | doi =  10.1118/1.596925| last2 = Rao | bibcode = 1992MedPh..19.1359K }}&lt;/ref&gt; of ionizing radiation in situ that provides molecular modifications at an atomic scale. AT differs from conventional radiation therapy in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations. Instead, the in situ delivery of a very high dose at the molecular level using AT aims for in situ molecular modifications involving molecular breakages and molecular re-arrangements such as a change of stacking structures as well as cellular metabolic functions related to the said molecule structures.

===Contact x-ray brachytherapy===
Contact x-ray brachytherapy (also called "CXB", "electronic brachytherapy" or the "Papillon Technique") is a type of radiation therapy using kilovoltage [[X-ray]]s applied close to the tumour to treat [[rectal cancer]]. The process involves inserting the [[x-ray tube]] through the [[anus]] into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue, then high doses of X-rays are emitted directly into the [[tumor cells|tumor]] at two weekly intervals.  It is typically used for treating early rectal cancer in patients who may not be candidates for surgery.&lt;ref name=NICE&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg532|title=Contact X-ray Brachytherapy for early rectal cancer|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|first=|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIieBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109|title=Modern Management of Cancer of the Rectum|last1=Sun Myint|first1=Arthur|last2=Gerard|first2=Jean-Pierre|last3=Myerson|first3=Robert J.|date=2014|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9781447166092|editor1-last=Longo|editor1-first=Walter E. | name-list-format = vanc |location=|pages=109ff|language=en|chapter=Contact X-Ray Brachytherapy for Rectal Cancer|editor2-last=Reddy|editor2-first=Vikram|editor3-last=Audisio|editor3-first=Riccardo A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPM-report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_152.pdf | title = The 2007 AAPM response to the CRCPD request for recommendations for the CRCPD's model regulations for electronic brachytherapy | access-date = 17 April 2010 | author = American Association of Physicists in Medicine | authorlink =  |date= February 2009 |publisher = American Association of Physicists in Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.&lt;ref name=NICE/&gt;

In brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.&lt;ref name="GEC-ESTRO-General" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart 2007"&gt;
{{Cite book | last = Stewart AJ | editor = Devlin P | year = 2007 | title = Brachytherapy. Applications and Techniques | chapter = Radiobiological concepts for brachytherapy | publisher = LWW | location = Philadelphia | id =  | displayauthors =  etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2007" /&gt;

As one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid19744892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yashar CM, Blair S, Wallace A, Scanderbeg D | title = Initial clinical experience with the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant brachytherapy applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation | journal = Brachytherapy | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–72 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19744892 | doi = 10.1016/j.brachy.2009.03.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsealed source radiotherapy (systemic radioisotope therapy)===
{{Main|Unsealed source radiotherapy}}
Systemic radioisotope therapy (RIT) is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through [[Route of administration|infusion]] (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of [[metaiodobenzylguanidine]] (MIBG) to treat [[neuroblastoma]], of oral [[iodine-131]] to treat [[thyroid cancer]] or [[thyrotoxicosis]], and of hormone-bound [[lutetium-177]] and [[yttrium-90]] to treat [[neuroendocrine tumors]] ([[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]]).

Another example is the injection of yttrium-90 radioactive glass or resin microspheres into the [[Hepatic artery proper|hepatic artery]] to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases.  These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as [[selective internal radiation therapy]]. The microspheres are approximately 30&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] in diameter (about one-third of a human hair) and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a [[catheter]] up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently two different kinds of microspheres: [[SIR-Spheres]] and [[TheraSphere]].

A major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of [[bone metastasis]] from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are [[radium-223]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Christopher |title=Alpha Emiiter Radium-223 and Survival in Metastatic Prostate Cancer |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=July 18, 2013 |volume=369 |issue=3 |pages=213-23 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1213755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strontium-89]] and [[Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|samarium (&lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Sm) lexidronam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sartor O | title = Overview of samarium sm 153 lexidronam in the treatment of painful metastatic bone disease | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 6 Suppl 10 | issue = Suppl 10 | pages = S3–S12 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16985930 | pmc = 1472939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[ibritumomab tiuxetan]] (Zevalin), which is an anti-[[CD20]] [[monoclonal antibody]] conjugated to yttrium-90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html Fda Approves First Radiopharmaceutical Product To Treat Non-Hodgkin’S Lymphoma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119111338/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html |date=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the FDA approved the [[tositumomab]]/iodine (&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I) tositumomab regimen (Bexxar), which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab – Product Approval Information – Licensing Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513024727/http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm |date=May 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These medications were the first agents of what is known as [[radioimmunotherapy]], and they were approved for the treatment of refractory [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]].

===Intraoperative radiotherapy===
{{main|Intraoperative radiation therapy}}
[[Intraoperative radiation therapy]] (IORT) is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a [[cancerous|cancer]] tumor, while the area is exposed during [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutta SW, Showalter SL, Showalter TN, Libby B, Trifiletti DM | title = Intraoperative radiation therapy for breast cancer patients: current perspectives | journal = Breast Cancer | volume = 9 | pages = 257–263 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28458578 | pmc = 5402914 | doi = 10.2147/BCTT.S112516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationale====
The rationale for IORT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.&lt;ref name="pmid18316551"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belletti B, Vaidya JS, D'Andrea S, Entschladen F, Roncadin M, Lovat F, Berton S, Perin T, Candiani E, Reccanello S, Veronesi A, Canzonieri V, Trovò MG, Zaenker KS, Colombatti A, Baldassarre G, Massarut S | title = Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy impairs the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 1325–32 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316551 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep inspiration breath-hold ===
[[Deep inspiration breath-hold]] (DIBH) is a method of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanley J, Debois MM, Mah D, Mageras GS, Raben A, Rosenzweig K, Mychalczak B, Schwartz LH, Gloeggler PJ, Lutz W, Ling CC, Leibel SA, Fuks Z, Kutcher GJ | title = Deep inspiration breath-hold technique for lung tumors: the potential value of target immobilization and reduced lung density in dose escalation | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–11 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10524412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer.

==History==
[[File:X-ray treatment of tuberculosis 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|X-ray treatment of [[tuberculosis]] in 1910.  Before the 1920s, the hazards of radiation were not understood, and it was used to treat a wide range of diseases. ]]
{{Main|History of radiation therapy}}

Medicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]].&lt;ref name="UAB"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 | title=University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, History of Radiation Oncology|format=from the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043216/http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 |archivedate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Emil Grubbe]] of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.&lt;ref name=pioneer&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pioneer in X-Ray Therapy | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |series=New Series | volume = 125 | date = 4 January 1957 | pages=18–19 | issue = 3236 | bibcode =   1957Sci...125T..18.| doi = 10.1126/science.125.3236.18 | jstor = 1752791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of [[Nobel Prize]]–winning scientist [[Marie Curie]] (1867–1934), who discovered the radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research.&lt;ref name="UAB"/&gt;  Through the 1920s the hazards of radiation exposure were not understood, and little protection was used. Radium was believed to have wide curative powers and radiotherapy was applied to many diseases.

Prior to World War 2, the only practical sources of radiation for radiotherapy were [[radium]], its "emanation", [[radon]] gas, and the [[x-ray tube]].  [[External beam radiotherapy]] (teletherapy) began at the turn of the century with relatively low voltage (&lt;150&amp;nbsp;kV) x-ray machines.  It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage x-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages.  [[Orthovoltage X-rays]], which used tube voltages of 200-500&amp;nbsp;kV, began to be used during the 1920s.  To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1&amp;nbsp;MV or above, called "megavolt" radiation.  Producing megavolt x-rays required [[voltage]]s on the x-ray tube of 3 to 5 million [[volt]]s, which required huge expensive installations.  Megavoltage x-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions.    One of the first, installed at [[St. Bartholomew's hospital]], London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long x-ray tube and weighed 10 tons.    Radium produced megavolt [[gamma ray]]s, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores.  In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.

The invention of the [[nuclear reactor]] in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War 2 made possible the production of artificial [[radioisotope]]s for radiotherapy.  [[Cobalt therapy]], [[teletherapy]] machines using megavolt gamma rays emitted by [[cobalt-60]], a radioisotope produced by irradiating ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, revolutionized the field between the 1950s and the early 1980s.  Cobalt machines were relatively cheap, robust and simple to use, although due to its 5.27 year [[half-life]] the cobalt had to be replaced about every 5 years.

Medical [[linear particle accelerator]]s, developed since the 1940s, began replacing x-ray and cobalt units in the 1980s and these older therapies are now declining. The first medical linear accelerator was used at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in London in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thwaites DI, Tuohy JB | title = Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 51 | issue = 13 | pages = R343-62 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790912 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/51/13/R20 | bibcode = 2006PMB....51R.343T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear accelerators can produce higher energies, have more collimated beams, and do not produce radioactive waste with its attendant disposal problems like radioisotope therapies.

With [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]’s invention of [[computed tomography]] (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient's anatomy.   The advent of new imaging technologies, including [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) in the 1970s and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) [[tomotherapy]]. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |title=History of Radiation Therapy: The Evolution of Therapeutic Radiology |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301041554/http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While access to radiotherapy is improving globally, more than half of patients in low and [[Developing country|middle income countries]] still do not have available access to the therapy as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21728893-science-will-win-technical-battle-against-cancer-only-half-fight-closing|title=Closing in on cancer|date=16 September 2017|work=The Economist|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ridge and furrow''' is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] pattern of ridges (Medieval Latin ''sliones'') and troughs created by a system of [[plough]]ing used in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], typical of the [[open field system]]. It is also known as '''rig''' (or '''rigg''') '''and furrow''', mostly in the North East of England and in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levick|first=Paula|title=Ridge and Furrow|url=https://www.archeox.net/fact-sheets/ridge-and-furrow|work=Archaeology of East Oxford|accessdate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219171656/https://www.archeox.net/fact-sheets/ridge-and-furrow|archivedate=19 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiggSpellingExampleBreamish&gt;{{cite web|title=Breamish Valley Archaeology Project|url=http://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/understanding/historyarchaeology/hillfortheritageintroduction/breamishvalleyproject|publisher=Northumberland National Park Authority|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/thesaurus/1/54/RIG%20AND%20FURROW|title=RIG AND FURROW {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples date to the immediate post-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period and the system was used until the 17th century in some areas, as long as the open field system survived. Surviving ridge and furrow topography is found in Great Britain, Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  The surviving ridges are parallel, ranging from {{Convert|3|to|22|yd|m|0}} apart and up to {{Convert|24|in|cm}} tall – they were much taller when in use. Older examples are often curved. 

Ridge and furrow topography was a result of ploughing with non-reversible ploughs on the same strip of land each year.  It is visible on land that was ploughed in the Middle Ages, but which has not been ploughed since then.  No actively ploughed ridge and furrow survives.

The ridges or ''lands'' became units in landholding, in assessing the work of the [[ploughman]] and in reaping in autumn.&lt;ref name=Homans&gt;[[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991: "The Skills of Husbandmen" pp44ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Ploughing match from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ploughing with a single-sided plough in a ploughing match, showing furrows heaped towards centre of strip (The different strips will eventually meet). Note that this is not yet ridge and furrow, as the strip has only been ploughed once in this location.]]

Traditional ploughs have the [[Plowshare|ploughshare and mouldboard]] on the right, and so turn the soil over to the right (see [[Plough#Single-sided ploughing|single-sided ploughing]]).  This means that the plough cannot return along the same line for the next furrow.  Instead, ploughing is done in a clockwise direction around a long rectangular strip (a ''land'').  After ploughing one of the long sides of the strip, the plough is removed from the ground at the end of the field, moved across the unploughed ''headland'' (the short end of the strip), then put back in the ground to work back down the other long side of the strip.  The width of the ploughed strip is fairly narrow, to avoid having to drag the plough too far across the headland. This process has the effect of moving the soil in each half of the strip one furrow's-width towards the centre line each time the field is ploughed.

In the Middle Ages each strip was managed by one family, within large open fields held in common (see [[strip cultivation]]), and the locations of the strips were the same each year.  The movement of soil year after year gradually built the centre of each strip up into a ridge, leaving a dip, or "furrow" between each ridge (note that this use of "furrow" is different from that for the small furrow left by each pass of the plough).  The building up of a ridge was called ''filling'' or ''gathering'', and was sometimes done before ploughing began.  The raised ridges offered better drainage in a wet climate: moisture drained into the furrows, and since the ridges were laid down a slope, in a sloping field water would collect in a ditch at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Homans/&gt; Only on some well-drained soils were the fields left flat. In damper soil towards the base of the ridge, pulses ([[pea]]s or [[Vicia faba|bean]]s) or dredge (a mixture of [[oat]]s and [[barley]]) might be sown where [[wheat]] would have become waterlogged, as [[Thomas Tusser]] suggested in the 16th century:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
For wheat till land
Where water doth stand.
Sow pease or dredge
below in that redge.
{{Full|date=August 2018|reason=Need title of poem.}}&lt;/poem&gt;  

The dip often marked the boundary between plots.  Although they varied, strips would traditionally be a [[furlong]] (a "furrow-long") in length, (220 yards, about 200 metres), and from about {{Convert|5|yd|m}} up to a [[chain (unit)|chain]] wide (22 yards, about 20 metres), giving an area of from {{Convert|0.25|to|1|acre|ha|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba33/ba33feat.html David Hall, "Medieval fields in their many forms", ''British Archaeology'', '''33''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverreatrail.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=120 George Demidowicz, ''Ridge and Furrow Survey (King's Norton)'', Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eyre/&gt;

In most places ploughing continued over the centuries, and later methods (especially the [[Plough#Reversible_plough|reversible plough]]) removed the ridge and furrow pattern.  However, in some cases the land became grassland, and where this has not been ploughed since, the pattern has often been preserved.  Surviving ridge and furrow may have a height difference of {{Convert|18|to|24|in|m|abbr=on|1}} in places, and gives a strongly rippled effect to the landscape.  When in active use, the height difference was even more, over {{convert|6|ft|m}} in places.&lt;ref name=Eyre&gt;[http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/03n2a2.pdf Eyre,  S R. "The Curving Plough-strip and its Historical Implications".  ''Agricultural History Review'' '''3''' pp 80–94]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
[[File:Ridge and furrow-en.svg|600px|This drawing explains the origin of ridge and furrow patterns.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

==Curved strips==
In the early Middle Ages ploughing was done with large teams of small [[ox]]en (commonly eight oxen in four pairs), and the plough itself was a large, mainly wooden implement.  The team and plough together were therefore many yards long, and this led to a particular effect in ridge and furrow fields.  When reaching the end of the furrow, the leading oxen met the end first, and were turned left along the headland, while the plough continued as long as possible in the furrow (the strongest oxen were [[yoke]]d at the back, and could draw the plough on their own for this short distance).  By the time the plough eventually reached the end, the oxen were standing lined up facing leftwards along the headland.  Each pair was then turned around to walk rightwards along the headland, crossing the end of the strip, and they then started down the opposite furrow.  By the time the plough itself reached the beginning of the furrow, the oxen were already lined up ready to pull it forwards.

The result of this was to twist the end of each furrow slightly to the left, making these earlier ridge and furrows into a slight reverse-S shape.&lt;ref name=Eyre/&gt;  This shape survives in some places as curved field boundaries, even where the ridge and furrow pattern itself has vanished.

If the oxen had been turned right at the end of the furrow, they would immediately have had to turn right again down the returning furrow, making the line of oxen cut across the top of the ploughed strip and thus pulling the plough out of the ground before it reached the end of the furrow, as well as having potential difficulty from two adjacent lines of oxen moving in opposite directions.  Alternatively, if lined up rightwards along the headland, some would already be past the beginning of the new furrow, and these would have to be moved awkwardly sideways into the furrow to be ready to plough.  Turning to the left made one turn at a time and avoided a sideways move.

As oxen became larger and ploughs more efficient, smaller teams were needed.  These took less room on the headland, and straight ploughing became easier – and easier still when [[Draft horse|heavy horses]] were introduced.  Late Middle Ages ridge and furrow is therefore straight.

==Surviving locations==
[[File:Blackhillrig1.jpg|thumb| Rig and furrow at Roughrig reservoir, near Airdrie, Scotland]]
Some of the best-preserved ridge and furrow survives in the [[English counties]] of:
* [[Buckinghamshire]]
* [[Cambridgeshire]]
* [[County Durham]]
* [[Derbyshire]]
* [[Gloucestershire]]
* [[Lincolnshire]]
* [[Leicestershire]]
* [[Northamptonshire]]
* [[Nottinghamshire]]
* [[Oxfordshire]]
* [[Warwickshire]]
* [[West Yorkshire]]

In Scotland, 4-600 acres of rig and furrow survive in one area outside the town of Airdrie.

Ridge and furrow often survives on higher ground where the arable land was subsequently turned over to [[Sheep husbandry|sheep walk]] in the 15th century and has never been ploughed out since by modern ploughing methods, today surviving still as pasture and grazing for sheep where the effect is clearly visible, especially when the sun is low or after a dusting of snow. It is often associated with [[deserted medieval village]]s.

The '''Royal Society of the Humanities at Uppsala''' (''Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala'') is a Swedish Royal academy for the study of the humanities.

==Founding==
The society was founded in 1889 by a donation from tannery factory owner [[Jacob Westin]] in Stockholm who gave SEK 50,000 in his will dated 1878 to form a scientific community to further the study of philosophy, philology and history sciences. Westin also donated a large collection of books and manuscripts to [[Uppsala University]] library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khvsu.se/historik/ Kort historik.] Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala. Retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's statutes were ratified by the Swedish king on 28 March 1896.{{citation required|date=November 2015}}

==Prizes==
The society annually awards a prize to two doctoral dissertations, known as the Westinska prize.

[[File:Random rubble masonry.jpg|thumb|right|A rubble trench foundation]]
The '''rubble trench foundation''', an ancient construction approach popularized by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], is a type of [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that uses loose stone or rubble to minimize the use of [[concrete]] and improve drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, Steve (1998) ''The Alternative building sourcebook: for traditional, natural, and sustainable building products and services''. Brownfield, Me.: Fox Maple Press. p. 9. {{ISBN|1889269018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered more environmentally friendly than other types of foundation because cement manufacturing requires the use of enormous amounts of energy. However, some soil environments are not suitable for this kind of foundation; particularly expansive or poor load-bearing (&lt; 1 ton/sf) soils.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Joseph F. (2002) ''The art of natural building: design, construction, resources''. Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers. p. 111. {{ISBN|0865714339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A rubble trench foundation with a concrete grade beam is not recommended for earthquake prone areas.&lt;ref&gt;Chiras, Daniel D. (2004). ''The new ecological home: the complete guide to green building options''. White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Pub. Co. p. 75. {{ISBN|1931498164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A foundation must bear the structural loads imposed upon it and allow proper drainage of ground water to prevent expansion or weakening of soils and frost heaving. While the far more common concrete foundation requires separate measures to ensure good soil drainage, the rubble trench foundation serves both foundation functions at once.

To construct a rubble trench foundation a narrow trench is dug down below the [[frost line]]. The bottom of the trench would ideally be gently sloped to an outlet. Drainage tile, graded 1":8' to daylight, is then placed at the bottom of the trench in a bed of washed stone protected by filter fabric. The trench is then filled with either screened stone (typically 1-1/2") or recycled rubble. A steel-reinforced concrete grade beam may be poured at the surface to provide ground clearance for the structure.

If an insulated slab is to be poured inside the grade beam, then the outer surface of the grade beam and the rubble trench should be insulated with rigid XPS foam board, which must be protected above grade from mechanical and UV degradation.

The rubble-trench foundation is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and environment-friendly alternative to a conventional foundation, but may require an engineer's approval if building officials are not familiar with it. Frank Lloyd Wright used them successfully for more than 50 years in the first half of the 20th century, and there is a revival of this style of foundation with the increased interest in green building.

The '''San Buenaventura Conservancy''' is an [[historic preservation]] organization in [[Ventura, California]] also known by its early name of San Buenaventura. It works to recognize and revitalize historic, archeological and cultural resources in the region. The Conservancy is a membership based historic preservation non-profit 501c3 organization. The group was formed in 2004 after the demolition of the Mayfair Theater, an [[S. Charles Lee]], [[Streamline Moderne]], movie theater in downtown [[Ventura, California]] that was razed and replaced with a condo project.

== Mission ==

The San Buenaventura Conservancy mission statement: ''"To work through advocacy and outreach to recognize preserve and revitalize the irreplaceable historic, architectural and cultural resources of San Buenaventura and surrounding areas. To seek to increase public awareness of and participation in local preservation issues, and disseminate information useful in the preservation of structures and neighborhoods of San Buenaventura."''  [http://www.sbconservancy.org San Buenaventura Conservancy website]

== Programs &amp; Projects ==

The organization produces annual historic architecture tours in the historic neighborhoods and districts in midtown, downtown and the west side of  [[Ventura, California]]. The conservancy is an all-volunteer organization with a ten-member board. Some of the Conservancy's most successful projects outside of the Ventura architectural Weekend tours and trade shows has been the ability of the board to work closely the City of  [[Ventura, California]] and developers to find preservation solutions for historic buildings. At times the Conservancy advocates for specific historic buildings like Willett Ranch [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2008/feb/27/historical-willett-buildings-to-remain-on-site/ link to article] and the Top Hat Burger Palace in Ventura, the Frank Petit House in South [[Oxnard, California]], the Charles McCoy house, in [[Port Hueneme, California]], and the Bracero farm Worker Camp in [[Piru, California]], and the [[Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, California|Wagon Wheel Motel]] on the 101 Freeway in [[Oxnard, California]]. Additionally the Conservancy works to strengthen preservation policies of local municipalities. It has achieved success at integrating appropriate preservation actions and policies into Ventura's General Plan, Downtown Specific Plan, and Westside Community Plan.

On March 2, 2009 the San Buenaventura Conservancy – with attorney Susan Brandt-Hawley – filed suit in Ventura County Superior Court against the City of [[Oxnard, California]], claiming that the City’s approval of the Oxnard Village Specific Plan project violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). [http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/todays-news/lawsuit-stalls-loss-of-1947.html link to article] The project, as approved, requires the demolition of the Wagon Wheel Motel and restaurant, El Ranchito and bowling alley along with everything built on the {{convert|64|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. The Conservancy case argues that the project can be feasibly accomplished without demolition of the Wagon Wheel, and CEQA therefore does not allow the Class 1 impact. The lawsuit requests issuance of a peremptory writ ordering the City to set aside its approval of the project pending compliance with CEQA.

The original Ventura County Superior Court case was presented July 10, 2009. The Judge sided with the city of Oxnard. The San Buenaventura Conservancy has appealed the ruling and received a stay of demolition until the outcome of the appeal case: San Buenaventura Conservancy v. City of Oxnard et al. (CEQA) (Case: B220512 2nd District, Division 6.) [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2010/dec/15/final-arguments-presented-in-wagon-wheel-case/ link to article]  On Wednesday December 15, a three judge panel at the California 2nd district Court of Appeal in [[Ventura, California]] heard arguments from attorneys representing the case: Susan Brandt-Hawley for the San Buenaventura Conservancy, and Rachel Cook representing the developer ( Oxnard Village Investments, LLC.) and the city of [[Oxnard, California]]. The Appeals Court sided with the City of Oxnard on March 17, 2011 and agreed with the Superior court that the CEQA review was sufficient. The Wagon Wheel was demolished a week later.

'''Secotioid''' fungi are an intermediate growth form between mushroom-like [[hymenomycete]]s and closed bag-shaped [[gasteroid fungi|gasteromycetes]], where an evolutionary process of '''gasteromycetation''' has started but not run to completion.  Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical [[geotropism|geotropic]] orientation of the [[hymenophore]] needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the [[basidiospores]] are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e.g. gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]'')—note—some mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost [[ballistospory]].&lt;ref name="Hibbett_1994"/&gt;

==Explanation of secotioid development and gasteromycetation==

Historically [[agarics]] and [[boletes]] (which bear their spores on a [[hymenium]] of gills or tubes respectively) were classified quite separately from the [[gasteroid fungi]], such as [[puff-balls]] and [[truffles]], of which the spores are formed in a large mass enclosed in an outer skin.  However, in spite of this apparently very great difference in form, recent mycological research, both at microscopic&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; and molecular&lt;ref name=Hibbett/&gt; level has shown that sometimes species of open mushrooms are much more closely related to particular species of gasteroid fungi than they are to each other.  Fungi which do not open up to let their spores be dispersed in the air, but which show a clear [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] relation to agarics or boletes, constitute an intermediate form and are called '''secotioid'''.&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt;

The word is derived from the name of the genus ''[[Secotium]]'', which contains such species.&lt;ref name=Conard/&gt;

On a microscopic scale, secotioid fungi do not expel their spores forcibly from the basidium and so the spores are statismospores.  Like gasteroid fungi, secotioid ones rely on animals such as rodents or insects to distribute their spores.

It seems that sometimes it can be disadvantageous for a mushroom to open up and free its spores in the usual way.  If this development is aborted, a secotioid form arises, perhaps to be followed eventually by an evolutionary progression to a fully gasteroid form.  This type of progression is called '''gasteromycetation''' and seems to have happened several times independently starting from various genera of "normal" mushrooms.  This means that the secotioid and also the gasteroid fungi are [[polyphyletic]].  According to the paper by Thiers,&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; in certain climates and certain seasons, it may be an advantage to remain closed because moisture can be conserved in that way.

There is a spectrum of secotioid species ranging from the open form to the closed form in the following respects:
*there may be an evident stipe, or there may be only a remnant consisting of a column of non-fertile tissue,
*if there is a stipe the edge of the cap may separate from it (partially opening), or may not,
*there may be recognizable gills (though oriented in all directions and very convoluted), or the fertile interior may be uniform like the [[gleba]] of gasteroid fungi, and
*the spore-bearing tissue may be above ground ([[epigeous]]), or underground ([[wikt:hypogeous|hypogeous]]), or partly buried.

The adjective "'''sequestrate'''" is sometimes used as a general term to mean "either secotioid or gasteroid".

==Examples==

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b11 168-5.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cross-section of ''Hymenogaster tener'']]
For example, the secotioid genus ''[[Hymenogaster]]'' has been shown to be closely related to agaric genera such as ''[[Hebeloma]]'', which were formerly placed in family [[Cortinariaceae]] or [[Strophariaceae]].  This is found by DNA analysis and also indicated on a microscopic scale by the resemblance of the spores and basidia.  According to a current classification system, ''Hebeloma'' now belongs to family [[Hymenogastraceae]], and is considered more narrowly related to the closed ''[[Hymenogaster]]'' fungi than, for instance, to the ordinary mushrooms in genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;

A similar case is the well-known "Deceiver" mushroom ''[[Laccaria laccata]]'' which is now classified in the ''[[Hydnangiaceae]]'', ''Hydnangium'' being a gastroid genus.

''[[Cortinarius]]'' is a very widespread genus of agarics, but also contains some secotioid species, such as ''C. leucocephalus'', ''C. coneae'' and ''C. cartilagineus''.

Secotioid genus ''Nivatogastrium'' corresponds to agaric genus ''[[Pholiota]]''&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; and provides a vivid example of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Nivatogastrium/&gt;

It has been found that a change in a single locus of a gene of the gilled mushroom ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]'' causes it to have a closed fruiting body.  This suggests that the emergence of a secotioid species may not require many mutations.&lt;ref name=Hibbett/&gt;

''[[Gastroboletus]]'' is a secotioid [[bolete]] genus where the fruiting bodies may or may not open, but in any case the tubes are not aligned vertically as in a true bolete.&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt;

''[[Agaricus deserticola]]'' is a secotioid species of ''[[Agaricus]]'' (the genus of common cultivated mushrooms) which at one time was placed in the genus ''Secotium''. Similarly, ''[[Agaricus inapertus]]'' was formerly known as ''Endoptychum depressum'' until [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis revealed it to be closely aligned with ''Agaricus''.&lt;ref name=Vellinga2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellinga EC |author2=de Kok RPJ |author3=Bruns TD. |title=Phylogeny and taxonomy of ''Macrolepiota'' (Agaricaceae) |journal=Mycologia |year=2003 |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=442–56 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0095/003/0442.htm |doi=10.2307/3761886 |pmid=21156633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories.  Stand-up tragedy is often performed in bars, nightclubs, private homes, art museums, galleries and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Jon. "Interview: Bryan Lewis Saunders." ''Rhythmplex'' April 2009.

When two [[probability distribution]]s overlap, '''statistical interference''' exists.  Knowledge of the distributions can be used to determine the likelihood that one parameter exceeds another, and by how much.

This technique can be used for dimensioning of mechanical parts, determining when an applied load exceeds the strength of a structure, and in many other situations.   This type of analysis can also be used to estimate the ''probability of failure'' or the ''frequency of failure''.

==Dimensional interference==
[[File:Interference.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Interference of measurement distributions to determine fit of parts]]

Mechanical parts are usually designed to fit precisely together. For example, if a shaft is designed to have a "sliding fit" in a hole, the shaft must be a little smaller than the hole. (Traditional [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerances]] may suggest that all dimensions fall within those intended tolerances.  A [[process capability]] study of actual production, however, may reveal [[normal distribution]]s with long tails.) Both the shaft and hole sizes will usually form normal distributions with some average ([[arithmetic mean]]) and [[standard deviation]].

With two such normal distributions, a distribution of interference can be calculated.  The derived distribution will also be normal, and its average will be equal to the difference between the means of the two base distributions.  The [[variance]] of the derived distribution will be the sum of the variances of the two base distributions.

This derived distribution can be used to determine how often the difference in dimensions will be less than zero (i.e., the shaft cannot fit in the hole), how often the difference will be less than the required sliding gap (the shaft fits, but too tightly), and how often the difference will be greater than the maximum acceptable gap (the shaft fits, but not tightly enough).

==Physical property interference==
[[File:Interference Forces.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Interference of distributions of applied load and strength]]

Physical properties and the conditions of use are also inherently variable.  For example, the applied load (stress) on a mechanical part may vary.  The measured strength of that part (tensile strength, etc.) may also be variable.  The part will break when the stress exceeds the strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

With two normal distributions, the statistical interference may be calculated as above. (This problem is also workable for transformed units such as the [[log-normal distribution]]).  With other distributions, or combinations of different distributions, a [[Monte Carlo method]] or simulation is often the most practical way to quantify the effects of statistical interference.

'''The Streeter–Phelps equation''' is used in the study of [[water pollution]] as a [[water quality modelling]] tool. The model describes how [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) decreases in a river or stream along a certain distance by degradation of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). The equation was derived by [[H. W. Streeter]], a sanitary engineer, and [[Earle B. Phelps]], a consultant for the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], in 1925, based on field data from the [[Ohio River]]. The equation is also known as the DO sag equation.

== Streeter-Phelps equation ==
The Streeter–Phelps equation determines the relation between the [[dissolved oxygen]] concentration and the [[biological oxygen demand]] over time and is a solution to the linear first order differential equation&lt;ref name="Streeter 1925"&gt;Streeter  H. W., Phelps E. B., 1925, A Study of the pollution and natural purification of the Ohio river. III. Factors concerned in the phenomena of oxidation and reaeration, Public Health Bulletin no. 146, Reprinted by U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Public Health Service, 1958, ISBN B001BP4GZI, http://dspace.udel.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/handle/19716/1590/C%26EE148.pdf?sequence=2&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial D}{\partial t} = k_1 L_t -k_2 D &lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation states that the total change in oxygen deficit (D) is equal to the difference between the two rates of [[deoxygenation]] and reaeration at any time.

The Streeter–Phelps equation, assuming a plug-flow stream at steady state is then
:&lt;math&gt; D =\frac{k_1 L_a}{k_2-k_1} (e^{-k_1 t}-e^{-k_2 t}) + D_a e^{-k_2 t} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:DOsag curve.jpg|thumb|Streeter-Phelps DO sag curve and BOD development.]]

where
*&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation deficit, which can be derived from the dissolved oxygen concentration at saturation minus the actual dissolved oxygen concentration (&lt;math&gt;D = DO_{sat} - DO&lt;/math&gt;). &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; has the dimensions &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deoxygenation]] rate, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; is the reaeration rate, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is the initial oxygen demand of organic matter in the water, also called the ultimate BOD (BOD at time t=infinity). The unit of &lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; is the oxygen demand remaining at time t, &lt;math&gt;L_t=L_a e^{-k_1 t}&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;D_a&lt;/math&gt; is the initial oxygen deficit &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the elapsed time, usually &lt;math&gt;[d]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; lies typically within the range 0.05-0.5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; lies typically within the range 0.4-1.5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"&gt;Schnoor J., 1996, Environmental Modeling, Fate and Transport of Pollutants in Water, Air and Soil, Wiley-Interscience, {{ISBN|978-0-471-12436-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Streeter–Phelps equation is also known as the DO sag equation. This is due to the shape of the graph of the DO over time.

=== Critical oxygen deficit ===
On the DO sag curve a minimum concentration occurs at some point, along a stream. If the Streeter–Phelps equation is differentiated with respect to time, and set equal to zero, the time at which the minimum DO occurs is expressed by
:&lt;math&gt; t_{crit}= \frac{1}{k_2-k_1} \ln {\left[ \frac{k_2}{k_1}  \left({1- \frac{D_a(k_2-k_1)}{L_a k_1} }\right) \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the value of the critical oxygen deficit, &lt;math&gt;D_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;, the Streeter–Phelps equation is combined with the equation above, for the critical time, &lt;math&gt;t_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration is
:&lt;math&gt;DO_{crit} = DO_{sat}-D_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that, mathematically it is possible to get a negative value of &lt;math&gt;DO_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;, even though it is not possible to have a negative amount of DO in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gotovtsev A.V., 2010, Modification of the Streeter–Phelps System with the Aim to Account for the Feedback between Dissolved Oxygen Concentration and Organic Matter Oxidation Rate, ISSN 0097-8078, Water Resources, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 245–251. Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance traveled in a river from a given point source pollution or waste discharge downstream to the &lt;math&gt;DO_{crit}&lt;/math&gt; (which is the minimum DO) is found by
:&lt;math&gt;x_{crit}=v t_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity of the stream. This formula is a good approximation as long as the flow can be regarded as a plug flow (turbulent).

=== Estimation of reaeration rate ===
Several estimations of the reaeration rate exist, which generally follow the equation
:&lt;math&gt;k_2=K v^a H^{-b}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity [m/s].
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the depth [m].
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.
* &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

The constants depend on the system to which the equation is applied, i.e. the flow velocity and the size of the stream or river. Different values are available in the literature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The software “International Hydrological Programme” applies the following equation derived on the basis of values used in published literature&lt;ref name="Jol1997"&gt;Jolánkai G., 1997, Basic river water quality models, Computer aided learning (CAL) programme on water quality modelling (WQMCAL version 1.1), International Hydrological Programme, Technical Documents in Hydrology, No. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_2=2.148 v^{0.878} H^{-1.48}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;[d^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the average flow velocity [m/s].
*&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the average depth of flow in the river [m].

=== Temperature correction ===
Both the deoxygenation rate, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and reaeration rate, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; can be temperature corrected, following the general formula.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k=k_{20} \theta ^{(T-20)}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*&lt;math&gt;k_{20}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at 20 degrees Celsius.
*'''θ''' is a constant, which differs for the two rates.
*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the actual temperature in the stream in degC.

Normally '''θ''' has the value 1.048 for &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and 1.024 for &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;.
An increasing temperature has the most impact on the deoxygenation rate, and results in an increased critical deficit (&lt;math&gt;D_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;x_{crit}&lt;/math&gt; decreases. Furthermore, a decreased &lt;math&gt;DO_{sat}&lt;/math&gt; concentration occurs with increasing temperature, which leads to a decrease in the DO concentration.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

===Mixing of rivers===
When two streams or rivers merge or water is discharged to a stream it is possible to determine the BOD and DO after mixing assuming [[steady state]] conditions and instantaneous mixing.  The two streams are considered as dilutions of each other thus the initial BOD and DO will be &lt;ref name="Jol1997"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L_a= \frac{L_sQ_s+L_bQ_b}{Q_s+Q_b}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; DO_0= \frac{DO_s Q_s+DO_b Q_b}{Q_s+Q_b}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is the initial concentration of BOD in the river downstream of the mixing, also called BOD(0). The unit of &lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  L_b &lt;/math&gt; is the background BOD of the concentration in the river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  L_s &lt;/math&gt; is the BOD of the content of the merging river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  DO_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the initial concentration of the dissolved oxygen in the river downstream of the conjoining point &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  DO_b &lt;/math&gt; is the background concentration of the dissolved oxygen content in the river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  DO_s &lt;/math&gt; is the background concentration of the dissolved oxygen content in the merging river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_b &lt;/math&gt; is the flow in the river upstream from the mixing point &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{m^3}{s}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_s &lt;/math&gt; is the flow in the merging river upstream from the mixing point &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{m^3}{s}]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Numerical approach ===
Nowadays it is possible to solve the classical Streeter–Phelps equation numerically by use of computers. The [[differential equation]]s are solved by integration.

== History ==
In 1925, a study on the phenomena of oxidation and reaeration in the [[Ohio River]] in the US was published by the sanitary engineer, Harold Warner Streeter and the consultant, [[Earle B. Phelps|Earle Bernard Phelps]] (1876–1953). The study was based on data obtained from May 1914 to April 1915 by the [[United States Public Health Service]] under supervision of Surg. W.H. Frost.&lt;ref name="Streeter 1925"/&gt;

More complex versions of the Streeter-Phelps model were introduced during the 1960s, where computers made it possible to include further contributions to the oxygen development in streams. At the head of this development were O'Connor (1960) and Thomann (1963).&lt;ref&gt;Russell C. S.,Vaughan W. J., Clark C. D., Rodriguez D. J., Darling A. H., 2001, Investing in water quality: measuring benefits, costs and risks,
Inter-American Development Bank, Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor added the contributions from photosynthesis, respiration and sediment oxygen demand (SOD).&lt;ref&gt;Lung W. S., 2001, Water quality modeling for wasteload allocations and TMDLs, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomann expanded the Streeter-Phelps model to allow for multi segment systems.&lt;ref&gt;Wurbs R. A., 1994, Computer Models for Water-Resources Planning and Management, Texas A &amp; M University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and limitations ==

The simple Streeter-Phelps model is based on the assumptions that a single BOD input is distributed evenly at the cross section of a stream or river and that it moves as [[plug flow]] with no mixing in the river.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"/&gt; Furthermore only one DO sink (carbonaceous BOD) and one DO source (reaeration) is considered in the classical Streeter-Phelps model.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1986"&gt;Schnoor J., 1986, Environmental Modeling, Fate and Transport of Pollutants in Water, Air and Soil, Wiley-Interscience&lt;/ref&gt; These simplifications will give rise to errors in the model. 
For example the model does not include BOD removal by sedimentation, that suspended BOD is converted to a dissolved state, that sediment has an oxygen demand and that photosynthesis and respiration will impact the oxygen balance.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Lin SD,Lee CC|title=Water and Wastewater Calculations Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjx6ZXNPcOEC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2001|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-137195-7|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the oxidation of organic matter and the reaeration process, there are many other processes in a stream which affect the DO.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"/&gt; In order to make a more accurate model it is possible to include these factors using an expanded model.

The expanded model is a modification of the traditional model and includes internal sources (reaeration and photosynthesis) and sinks (BOD, background BOD, SOD and respiration) of DO.
It is not always necessary to include all of these parameters. Instead relevant sources and sinks can be summed to yield the overall solution for the particular model.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
Parameters in the expanded model can be either measured in the field or estimated theoretically.

=== Background BOD ===
Background BOD or benthic oxygen demand is the diffuse source of BOD represented by the decay of organic matter that has already settled on the bottom. This will give rise to a constant diffuse input thus the change in BOD over time will be
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dL}{dt}= -k_1 L + L_b &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the rate for oxygen consumption by BOD, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the BOD from organic matter in the water &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;L_b&lt;/math&gt; is the background BOD input &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sedimentation of BOD ===
Sedimented BOD does not directly consume oxygen and this should therefore be taken into account. This is done by introducing a rate of BOD removal combined with a rate of oxygen consumption by BOD. Giving a total rate for oxygen removal by BOD &lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k_r=k_1 + k_3 &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of oxygen consumption by BOD, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; k_3 &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of settling of BOD, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The change in BOD over time is described as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dL}{dt}= -k_r L &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the BOD from organic matter in the water &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;k_r&lt;/math&gt; is typically in the range of 0.5-5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

=== Sediment oxygen demand ===
[[File:sedimentation Oxygen demand10.jpg|thumb|Measurement of SOD using an oxygen electrode. A: Water, B: Sediment, C: Box, D: Oxygen electrode.]]
Oxygen can be consumed by organisms in the sediment. This process is referred to as sediment oxygen demand (SOD). Measurement of SOD can be undertaken by measuring the change of oxygen in a box on the sediment.(benthic respirometer)

The change in oxygen deficit due to consumption by sediment is described as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dD}{dt} = -k_2 D + \frac{S}{H} &lt;/math&gt;
where 
* &lt;math&gt;H &lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the river [m]
* &lt;math&gt;S &lt;/math&gt; is the SOD &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{g}{m^2 d}]&lt;/math&gt;
* D is the saturation deficit &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt; k_2 &lt;/math&gt; is the reaeration rate [&lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;].

The range of the SOD is typically in the range of 0.1 – 1 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{g}{m^2 d}&lt;/math&gt; for a natural river with low pollution and 5 – 10 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{g}{m^2 d}&lt;/math&gt; for a river with moderate to heavy pollution.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

=== Nitrification ===
[[Ammonium]] is oxidized to [[nitrate]] under aerobic conditions
:NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Ammonium oxidation can be treated as part of BOD, so that BOD = CBOD + NBOD, where CBOD is the [[carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand]] and NBOD is nitrogenous BOD. Usually CBOD is much higher than the ammonium concentration and thus NBOD often does not need to be considered. The change in oxygen deficit due to oxidation of ammonium is described as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dD}{dt} = k_{N} N -k_2D &lt;/math&gt;

where
* D is the saturation deficit.
*&lt;math&gt;k_N&lt;/math&gt; is the nitrification rate &lt;math&gt;[d^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is ammonium-nitrogen concentration.

The range of &lt;math&gt;k_N&lt;/math&gt; is typically 0.05-0.5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

=== Photosynthesis and respiration ===
[[Photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] are performed by algae and by macrophytes. Respiration is also performed by bacteria and animals. Assuming [[steady state]] (net daily average) the change in deficit will be
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dD}{dt} = -k_2 D + (R+P)_{avg} &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is the respiration &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is the photosynthesis &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that BOD only includes respiration of [[microorganism]]s e.g. algae and bacteria and not by [[macrophyte]]s and animals.

Due to the variation of light over time, the variation of the photosynthetic oxygen can be described by a periodical function over time, where time is after sunrise and before sunset&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P(t)=P_{max} sin \left( \frac{\pi}{f}+(t-t_s) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;P(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the photosynthesis at a given time &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P_{max} &lt;/math&gt; is the daily maximum of the photosynthesis &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of day with sunlight, usually &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; day.
* &lt;math&gt; t_s &lt;/math&gt; is the time at which sun rises &lt;math&gt;[d]&lt;/math&gt;.

The range of the daily average value of primary production &lt;math&gt;(P-R)&lt;/math&gt; is typically 0.5-10 &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{mg}{Ld}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4596">'''Tierra templada''' (Spanish for ''temperate land'') is a pseudoclimatological term used in Latin America to refer to places which are either located in the [[tropics]] at a moderately high elevation or are marginally outside the astronomical tropics, producing a somewhat cooler overall [[climate]] than that found in the tropical lowlands, the zone of which is known as the [[tierra caliente]].

In countries situated close to the [[equator]], the tierra templada typically commences at an altitude of approximately 750 meters (roughly 2,500 feet), and extends to about 1,850 meters (or 6,000 feet), where the still cooler [[tierra fría]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

Trenton Kostbade (2005); ''Essentials of World Regional Geography'' 2nd Edition. NY: Harcourt Brace. p.464-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harpercollege.edu/mhealy/g101ilec/midamer/mmd/mmphys/mmaltzon/mmaltfr.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724052006/http://www.harpercollege.edu/mhealy/g101ilec/midamer/mmd/mmphys/mmaltzon/mmaltfr.htm |archivedate=2009-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These thresholds become lower as the [[latitude]] increases. The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal used following altitudes: 

*1,000 m as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
*2,300 m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (''[[Yunga#Fluvial Yunga|Yunga fluvial]]'')
*3,500 m as the treeline
*4,800 m as the puna end&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: ''Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú''. Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979. First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, ''Boletín del Museo de historia natural „Javier Prado“'', n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the English translation of its name, the tierra templada is not considered "[[Temperateness|temperate]]" by climatologists, for most of the areas so designated have average temperatures in their coldest months of above 18°C (64.4°F), thus making them tropical under climate classification schemes such as that of [[Vladimir Köppen]].  In the aforementioned scheme, many locations within the tierra templada are sometimes designated ''[[Köppen Climate Classification#Group A: Tropical|Afb]]'' or ''[[Köppen Climate Classification|Awb]]'', with the ''b'' denoting the fact that the warmest month has an average temperature of below 22°C (71.6°F), meaning that all twelve months of the year have averages of between 18°C and 22°C.  [[Chinchina, Colombia]], altitude 1,360 m, is an example of a place which would be labelled ''Afb'', as it has abundant rainfall year-round, while the climate of [[San José, Costa Rica]], altitude 1,161 m,  would fall under ''Awb'' since the latter city's rainfall regime consists of a wet summer and a dry winter. The "temperate" moniker in Spanish stems from these year-round warm temperatures that are not too hot (Tierra caliente) nor become too cold (Tierra fría). Various cities in this range have been nicknamed ''City of Eternal Spring'', most notably [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico.

In the tierra templada project pat, [[coffee]] is grown extensively as a cash crop, with grains such as [[wheat]] and [[maize|corn]] being cultivated for subsistence purposes - in contrast to the warmer tierra caliente, where tropical fruits predominate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="626">'''Usus''' ({{lang-la|usus}} — usage; long-established rule, practice, custom) is a term referring to the common usage of [[linguistic unit]]s (words, idioms, forms) in a particular speech community.

Usus can be contrasted with both occasional usage and prescribed [[standard language|standard usage]]. The term is used to designate usage that has wide currency and acceptance among speakers of a language, even if it diverges from the "high" literary standard. 

Usus is one of the crucial terms in the research of Danish linguists [[Otto Jespersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]].

[[File:XASEdges.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Transitions that contribute to XAS edges]]
[[File:XASFig.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Three regions of XAS data for the K-edge]]

'''X-ray [[absorption spectroscopy]]''' (XAS) is a widely used technique for determining the local geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is usually performed at [[synchrotron radiation]] facilities, which provide intense and tunable [[X-ray]] beams. Samples can be in the gas-phase, solution, or as solids.

XAS data is obtained by tuning the [[photon]] energy, using a crystalline monochromator, to a range where [[core electron]]s can be excited ({{convert|0.1|-|100|keV|aJ|abbr=on|disp=comma}}). The edges are, in part, named by which core electron is excited: the [[principal quantum number]]s n = 1, 2, and 3, correspond to the K-, L-, and M-edges, respectively. For instance, excitation of a 1s electron occurs at the [[metal K-edge|K-edge]], while excitation of a 2s or 2p electron occurs at an [[metal L-edge|L-edge]] (Figure 1).

There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data (Figure 2):
# The ''absorption threshold'' determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied states: {{ordered list
 | list-style-type=lower-alpha
 | the states at the Fermi energy in metals giving a "rising edge" with an [[arc tangent]] shape; 
 | the [[exciton|bound core excitons]] in insulators with a [[Cauchy distribution|Lorentzian]]  line-shape (they occur in a pre-edge region at energies lower than the transitions to the lowest unoccupied level);
 }} 
# The X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure [[XANES]] introduced in 1980 and later in 1983 called also [[NEXAFS]] (Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) which are dominated by core transitions to quasi bound states (multiple scattering resonances) for photoelectrons with kinetic energy in the range from 10 to 150 eV above the chemical potential, called "shape resonances" in molecular spectra since they are due to final states of short life-time degenerate with the continuum with the Fano line-shape. In this range multi-electron excitations and many-body final states in strongly correlated systems are relevant; 
# In the high kinetic energy range of the photoelectron the scattering cross-section with neighbor atoms is weak and the absorption spectra are dominated by [[EXAFS]] (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) where the scattering of the ejected [[photoelectron]] of neighboring atoms can be approximated by single scattering events. After it was shown in 1985 that multiple scattering theory can interpret both [[XANES]] and [[EXAFS]] the experimental analysis focusing on both regions is called [[XAFS]] [2].

XAS is a type of [[absorption spectroscopy]] from a core initial state with a well defined symmetry therefore the quantum mechanical [[selection rules]] select the symmetry of the final states in the continuum which usually are mixture of multiple components. The most intense features are due to electric-dipole allowed transitions (i.e. ''Δℓ'' = ± 1) to unoccupied final states. For example, the most intense features of a K-edge are due to core transitions from 1s → p-like final states, while the most intense features of the L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-edge are due to 2p → d-like final states.

XAS methodology can be broadly divided into four experimental categories that can give complementary results to each other: [[metal K-edge]], [[metal L-edge]], [[ligand K-edge]], and [[EXAFS]].

== Applications ==

XAS is a technique used in different scientific fields including [[Molecular physics|molecular]] and [[condensed matter physics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[earth science]], and [[biology]]. In particular, its unique sensitivity to the local structure, as compared to [[x-ray diffraction]], have been exploited for studying:

* [[Amorphous solid]]s and [[liquid]] systems
* [[Solid solution]]s
* [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] and [[ion implantation]] materials for [[electronics]]
* Local distortions of [[crystal structure|crystal lattices]]
* [[Organometallic chemistry|Organometallic compounds]]
* [[Metalloproteins]]
* [[Cluster chemistry|Metal clusters]]
* [[Catalysis]]
* Vibrational dynamics{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[Ion]]s in [[solution]]s
* Speciation of elements
* [[Liquid water]] and aqueous solutions
* Used to detect bone fracture
* Used to determine the concentration of any liquid in any tank
