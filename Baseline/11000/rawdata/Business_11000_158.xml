===83rd Saudi National Day===
{{see|Saudi National Day}}
''[[Al Jazirah (newspaper)|Al Jazirah]]'' in 2013 published official statements of Dr Al Hammad on his praising of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah Al Saud]] at the eve of 83rd Saudi National Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com/2013/20130924/ym159.htm|title=اليوم الوطني وحصاد المنجزات السنوي|website=www.al-jazirah.com|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|تهل علينا ذكرى اليوم الوطني كل عام كموسم سنوي يتكرر لحصاد المنجزات الشاملة في ربوع مملكتنا الحبيبة التي صار يوم إعلان تأسيسها عيدا ومناسبة للفرح.

وهذا العام يتعانق اليوم الوطني مع مرور 8 أعوام مجيدة منذ مبايعة سيدي خادم الحرمين الشريفين الملك عبدالله بن عبدالعزيز - حفظه الله - فقد امتدت مسيرة العطاء والإنجاز من لدن القائد الموحد الملك عبدالعزيز - طيب الله ثراه - مرورا بأبنائه الملوك الميامين حتى وصلت إلى خادم الحرمين الشريفين الملك عبدالله فواصل العطاء والبناء بحدب الأب الرحيم على أبنائه وعم الخير في عهده الميمون كل أبناء الوطن.

ولكن ونحن في غمرة أفراحنا بمنجزات عام من عمر المملكة المديد ماذا علينا أن نتمثل وما هي الوقفة المطلوب منا أن نقفها أبناء المملكة مع أنفسنا ومع الوطن وأولياء أمره وهي وقفة أو وقفات تجعل من المناسبة فرصة للتأمل والمراجعة لا فرحة عابرة.

الوقفة الأولى مع التاريخ وهي لا بد أن نتذكر كيف كنا وكيف أصبحنا كيف كنا قبل قيام المملكة وتوحيدها قبائل متنافرة متناحرة لا يجمعها جامع تعيش شظف العيش وقسوة الحياة حتى منّ الله علينا بنعمة التوحيد التي امتن بها على أوائل هذه الأمة {وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا} (103) سورة آل عمران، أجل كنا أعداء فأصبحنا بنعمة الله إخوانا ومن تمام شكر النعمة علينا ان نغرس في نفوس أبنائنا استشعار قيمة هذا المنجز العظيم وأهمية المحافظة عليه بصدق الانتماء والإخلاص بالولاء لهذا الوطن.

الوقفة الثانية بالطبع مع الإنجازات التي تتحقق على مختلف الأصعدة وفي شتى المجالات والميادين مما جعل المملكة مضرب الأمثال في التنمية وفي السياسة الحكيمة التي لا تثني المملكة من القيام بواجبها تجاه أمتها وقضايا العالم ولا تسمح لنفسها بالتدخل في شؤون الآخرين الأمر الذي أكسبها احتراما وبوأها مكانة دولية مرموقة ليس مبعث هذه المكانة قوة السلاح والتجبر لكن العقل والصدق واحترام الآخرين.

وبعيدا عن استعراض دور المملكة في إطار دول العشرين ومحافظتها الواعية على استقرار اقتصاد العالم المعتمد على النفط كطاقة حياتية يتوقف عليها نمو المجتمعات بعيدا عن كل ذلك نتوقف أمام التنمية المحلية المرتكزة على بناء الإنسان بالدرجة الأساسية لأنه هدف التنمية ووسيلتها معا ولذا اتجهت السياسة الحكيمة لخادم الحرمين الشريفين إلى بناء اقتصاد المعرفة الذي ينطلق أساسا من الاستثمار في الإنسان وإطلاق العقل المبدع فكان برنامج خادم الحرمين للابتعاث الخارجي مكملا لمؤسسات التعليم العملاقة والنموذجية من جامعات ومعاهد تعددت مستوياتها وامتدت لتشمل كل أرجاء الوطن.

ومن أوجه الاستثمار في الإنسان الصحة ويشهد العالم بمدى التطور الذي وصلت إليه المنشآت الصحية في المملكة وخدماتها المعتمدة أساساً على الكفاءات الوطنية السعودية من الأطباء والطبيبات الذين طبقت شهرتهم الآفاق وحققوا إنجازات عالمية تضاف إلى سجل العطاء الإنساني البشري في هذا المجال.

ووقفة أخرى في يومنا الوطني مع الوضع الذي تعيشه مملكتنا في هذه المرحلة الحرجة التي شهد العالم فيه من حولنا انعدام الأمن والاستقرار ونشوب الحروب والاضطرابات الداخلية التي تعاني من ويلاتها عدد من البلدان العربية وغير العربية ونحن ننعم بأمن واستقرار عظيمين يجب علينا إزاؤهما حمد الله أولا على هذه النعمة ثم الوفاء والولاء والالتفاف حول قيادتنا الحكيمة التي حمت الوطن والمواطن عبر سياسات قائمة على العدل الذي هو أساس الملك في كل المجالات وهو أمر نعض عليه بالنواجذ ونعلم أبنائنا والأجيال من بعدنا كيف يحافظوا عليه ويحمونه، والسعيد من اعتبر بغيره.

ويطول بنا الحديث في هذا المجال بعظمة المناسبة ولا نملك إلا أن ندعو الله أن يحفظ على هذه البلاد أمنها واستقرار ويوفق ولاة أمرها إلى ما فيه الخير وإلى الأمام يا موطن الخير عزيزاً مهاباً.}}

{{cquote|Every year, the National Day is celebrated every year as an annual season that is repeated in order to reap the comprehensive achievements of our beloved Kingdom, which on the day of its founding became a holiday and occasion for joy. 

And this year embraces the national day with the passage of 8 glorious years since the allegiance of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz - may God preserve him - has extended the process of giving and achievement of the unified leader King Abdulaziz - may God rest his soul - through his sons the kings of the Miamin until it reached the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah will continue to offer and build the father of the merciful to his children and the good deeds in his auspicious reign all the sons of the nation. 

But we are in the midst of our joys with the general achievements of the long life of the Kingdom. What should we represent and what is the position that we are required to hold for the Kingdom's people with ourselves and with the nation and its guardians, a pause or pause that makes the occasion an opportunity to reflect and review?

The first stop with history and it is necessary to remember how we were and how we became how we were before the establishment of the Kingdom and unify rival tribes rivalry not collected by the living and the harsh living and cruelty of life even God to us the blessing of monotheism, which they entrusted to the early this nation {Remember the grace of God upon you as you (103) Surat Al-Imran, so we were enemies, we became by the grace of God our brothers and the full thanks of grace we have to instill in the hearts of our children the sense of the value of this great achievement and the importance of maintaining it honestly Belief and loyalty Loyalty to this country.

The second stop of course with the achievements achieved at various levels and in various fields and fields, which made the Kingdom a model of proverbs in development and wise policy that does not dissuade the Kingdom from performing its duty towards its nation and world issues and does not allow itself to interfere in the affairs of others, which earned them respect and prestige. The origin of this status is not the power of arms and coercion, but reason, honesty and respect for others.

Apart from reviewing the role of the Kingdom within the framework of the G-20 and its conscious preservation of the stability of the oil-dependent world economy as a life-force dependent on the growth of societies, we stop in front of local development based on building the human being mainly because it is the goal of development and its means together. Therefore, the prudent policy of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques To build a knowledge economy that stems primarily from investment in human beings and the launch of the creative mind, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Program for External Scholarships complemented the huge and model educational institutions from universities and institutes of various levels, To the homeland. 

The world is witnessing the development of health facilities in the Kingdom and its services mainly based on the Saudi national competencies of doctors and physicians who have applied their fame to the horizons and achieved international achievements in addition to the human humanitarian tender record in this field.

And another moment in our national day with the situation of our Kingdom at this critical stage in which the world around us the insecurity and stability and the outbreak of wars and internal strife, which suffer a number of Arab and non-Arab countries and we enjoy great security and stability, Grace, loyalty, loyalty and circumvention of our wise leadership, which protected the homeland and the citizen through policies based on justice, which is the basis of the king in all areas, which we bite by the people and we know our children and generations after us how to protect and protect him, 

It is a long time for us to talk in this area of greatness of the occasion and we can only pray to God to preserve this country's security and stability and agree the governors of what is good and forward, the home of good dear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">Baron '''Adolf Kohner''' Szaszberek ([[Budapest]], April 26, 1866; Budapest, January 30, 1937) was a Hungarian businessman, landowner and a leading member of the Jewish community in that country.

==Life==

In 1874 Baron Kohner founded ''Adolf Kohner and Sons'', a private bank. Through his efforts as manager and director, the bank grew to become one of the largest private banks in Hungary. In addition to being a leading figure in Hungarian financial circles, Kohner was also one of the country’s most well educated large landowner and industrialist. His range of interests and knowledge was widespread, ranging from mechanical engineering to agricultural science. He was a significant figure in the Hungarian Jewish community and served as president of the ''Jewish Communities Federation'' in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1928/05/07/archive/adolph-kohner-heads-jewish-communities-federation-in-hungary Adolf Kohner Heads Jewish Communities Federation in Hungary] JTA - May 7, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Collector==

Baron Kohner was famous for his role as an art collector and patron of the arts in Hungary. In 1902 he became president of the ''Hungarian National Art Association''. In the same year he founded the artists’ colony in [[Szolnok]],&lt;ref&gt;Budapest, 1890-1919: l'anima e le forme. Casa editrice Electa 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary. His private collection was focused on the paintings of the French impressionistic and post-impressionistic periods. Among the artists represented in his collection were [[Théodore Géricault]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Honoré Daumier]], painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Jean-François Millet]], Antoine Chintreuil, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]]. The collection also included works from other periods such as Nuns” by [[Alessandro Magnasco]] and several paintings by [[John Constable]] and [[Francisco Goya]]. Leading Hungarian artists were also represented in his collection. These included Meszoly Geza, Laszlo Paal and [[Mihály Munkácsy]] and painters of the Hungarian artists' colonies Nagybanya and Szolnok. Many of the paintings were subsequently donated by Kohner to the Art Gallery of the National Museum of Hungary.

==Salotto Kohner==

Kohner used the earnings from his banking and other businesses to buy an estate of 28.000 acres near Szolnok, Hungary, with the goal of transforming it into a model farm and university study center. Professors and students from the Agrarian University of Budapest used this land as an experimental laboratory and it ultimately became one of the most avant-garde farming system of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandra Farkas: ''Pranzo di Famiglia'', Sperling&amp;Kupfer Editori, 2006 {{ISBN|88-200-4059-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohner was also a talented musician. He plays the cello and had a vast collection of Stradivarius and Guarneri violins. Among his closest friends were many famous musicians including [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Béla Bartók]].&lt;ref&gt;Alessandra Farkas: ''Pranzo di Famiglia'', Sperling&amp;Kupfer Editori, 2006 {{ISBN|88-200-4059-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Béla Bartók supporter==

Kohner was a major benefactor of Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, providing him with an annual stipend for many years that enabled Bartók to travel throughout Hungary and assemble a collection of ancient Hungarian folk songs. In his memoirs Bartók recalled the help Kohner offered him in 1905 and he stated: "''... he wanted me to understand that I could turn to him with confidence in case I needed money. He would be willing to help me from time to time. . It’s so kind of Kohner to be interested in my life ..''".&lt;ref&gt;Budapest, 1890-1919: l'anima e le forme. Casa editrice Electa 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Bartók also evoked the two weeks he spent in 1918 at Kohner’s castle in the Hungarian countryside: "''The house was just like a hotel where guests would come and go. The home library was full of manuscripts... People talked about many topics: music, literature, Jewish issues, religion, Bolshevik movement, manufacturing, trade. Mr. Baron is familiar with music, he plays the violin ... he is a close friend of some painters (the Kohner family loves [[Adolf Fényes]] very much. He was there for few days), one of his daughters is a painter as well and she is studying at Fényes’, the other one goes to university''".

==Businessman==

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Kohner was considered one of the richest men of the Hungarian-Jewish upper class.  In addition to his success as a banker, he played a prominent  role in the textile, food and chemical industries of Hungary. He was also a large landowner and, with his sons, developed a successful livestock farming business and canning company.

==Social Role==

As a leading figure of the Hungarian-Jewish upper class, Kohner was a prominent social figure in the larger Hungarian community.  The most important recognition of his role was the 1912 decision of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] to name Kohner a Baron and Court Counselor.

==Last Years of Life==

In the early 1930s Kohner unsuccessfully engaged in financial speculation which had negative effects on his businesses and ultimately dragged him to the brink of bankruptcy in 1933. The following year  he was forced to auction most of his art collection in order to pay off his debts. Later, he was also obliged to sell his castle and many other real estate holdings.
Upon his death in 1937, his obituary, appearing in the journal Past and Future, stated that, despite the financial collapse that forced him to a retired life, ''Kohner had endured with dignity finding solace in his beloved books''.

Kohner died on January 30th 1937 and he was buried on February 2 in the Jewish cemetery in Salgotarjan. He left four children: Karoly, Ida, wife of the painter [[István Farkas (painter)|István Farkas]], Lujza, Katalin.

'''Alcon''' is swiss global [[medical]] company specializing in eye care products and headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].  Alcon's American headquarters are located in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Alcon is a subsidiary of [[Novartis]] although the company announced intention to seek shareholder approval for 100% spinoff of Alcon eye care devices business in order to create an independent company in 2019.&lt;ref name="novartis.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/content/new-alcon|title=Novartis announces intention to seek shareholder approval for 100% spinoff of Alcon eye care devices business|work=Alcon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Alcon was founded in 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/about-us/who-we-are/history|title= Improving Vision through Innovation Since 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], USA.  The company started as a small [[pharmacy]] in Fort Worth and was named for its founders, [[pharmacist]]s Robert Alexander and William Conner.  Conner and Alexander focused on [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] products.

[[Nestlé]] of [[Switzerland]] purchased Alcon in 1977.  Alcon expanded its manufacturing capability with new plants in South America and Europe and drastically increased its investment in research.  In 1979, Alcon acquired Texas Pharmacal Company which became Dermatological Products of Texas (and is now [[DPT Laboratories]]). In 1984, Alcon founded the Technical Excellence Award to promote achievements in R&amp;D excellence and has awarded it to more than 100 recipients. The Alcon product line has expanded from [[pharmaceuticals]] to the surgical arena. Today, Alcon has operations in 75 countries and their products are sold in over 180 countries.

[[Nestlé]] conducted an initial public offering of 25% of its stake in Alcon in 2002. The stock is traded under the [[ticker symbol]] ACL. In July 2008, Novartis purchased approximately 25% of Nestlé's stake in Alcon, with an option to buy Nestlé's remaining shares beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.reuters.com/r/SCXS8/P81DY/JIQCHE/H9SK4/IOW2A/YT/h Reuters - Novartis announces offer to buy Nestlé's shares in Alcon] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novartis bought 52% stake from Nestlé for $28.1 Billion. This deal brought the total ownership of Novartis to 77%. Beginning January 2010 Novartis formally announced it will be completing the exercise options for finishing purchasing the rest of Alcon and then promptly continue to exercise merger and takeover of Alcon.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/content/new-alcon|title=Novartis announces intention to seek shareholder approval for 100% spinoff of Alcon eye care devices business|work=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, 2010, Alcon acquired Durezol and Zyclorin from Sirion Therapeutics. Alcon received regulatory approval to acquire the rights of Durezol emulsion in the US and the global rights, excluding Latin America, for Zyclorin from Sirion Therapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100329006744/en/Alcon-Completes-Acquisition-DUREZOL%E2%84%A2-ZYCLORIN%E2%84%A2-Sirion|title=Alcon Completes Acquisition of DUREZOL™ and ZYCLORIN™ from Sirion|date=March 29, 2010|access-date=March 16, 2016|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2010, Alcon's Independent Director Committee announced that a recommendation by the Committee was an indispensable first step before the board of the company can decide on the merger proposal of [[Novartis AG]], refuted Novartis’ public implications that it would be able to unilaterally impose the merger irrespective of the Independent Director Committee’s position once Novartis became Alcon’s majority shareholder. On July 8, 2010, Alcon's independent director committee (IDC) had set up a $50 million litigation trust to ensure company's minority shareholders get the best deal from bidder Novartis AG.&lt;ref name="ceoworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2010/07/08/alcon-acl-sets-up-trust-for-litigation-between-with-novartis-to-protect-minorities |title=Alcon (ACL) Sets up trust for litigation between with Novartis to protect minorities |work=The Chief Executive Forum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710193111/http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2010/07/08/alcon-acl-sets-up-trust-for-litigation-between-with-novartis-to-protect-minorities |archivedate=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Joseph Munby''' (19 August 1828 – 29 January 1910) was a British [[diarist]], [[poetry|poet]], portrait photographer, [[barrister]] and [[solicitor]]. He is also known by his initials, '''A. J. Munby'''.

==Biography==
Arthur Munby was born in [[York]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating with a BA in 1851, and was [[called to the Bar]] from [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MNBY847AJ|name=Munby, Arthur James}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a civil servant in the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]]' office from 1858 until his retirement in 1888. His published poetry included ''Benoni'' (1852) and ''Verses New and Old'' (1865). He taught [[Latin]] at the [[Working Men's College]] for more than a decade and helped promote the Working Men's College Volunteer Corps, a response to the national call for Volunteer Rifle Corps (1859) to combat a perceived threat from Napoleon the Third. Munby penned verses of support, the ''Invicta: a Song of 1860'', for the 19th [[Middlesex Regiment]], a regiment to which the W.M.C.V.C. was attached.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison|Harrison, J. F. C.]] ,''A History of the Working Men's College (1854-1954)''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, a sister Working Women's College was established; Munby was a leading spirit of, and teacher at, the new college.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

Munby had a lifelong fascination with working-class women, particularly those who did hard physical labour. His favourite pastime was wandering the streets of London and other industrial cities where he approached working women to ask about their lives and the details of their work, while noting their clothes and [[dialect]]s. The observations were recorded in his journals.

He was an amateur artist, and his diaries contain sketches of working women. He collected hundreds of photographs of [[Pit brow women|women who worked at collieries]], kitchen maids, milkmaids, charwomen, acrobats and so on. His diaries and images provide historical information on the lives of working-class Victorian women. Much of his obsession is hinted at in his last book, ''Faithful Servants: being epitaphs and obituaries recording their names and services'' (1891).

His papers are housed at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], there is a list of his papers on the Cambridge Janus website&lt;ref name="Munby papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity College Library Cambridge: MUNB|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0016%2FMUNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hannah Cullwick ===
In 1854, while on one of his urban wanderings, Munby met [[Hannah Cullwick]], a Shropshire-born maid-of-all-work. They formed a relationship in which Munby was the master and Cullwick the slave, with him training her in the virtues of hard work and loyalty. His scenarios included elements of [[ageplay]] and [[paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]], with Cullwick holding him in her lap or carrying him.

They married secretly in 1873 but Cullwick resisted his efforts to make her into a lady and she lived with him as a domestic servant, not a wife. She played the role of a lady wife on trips to Europe. They separated in 1877, but continued to see each other until Cullwick's death in 1909. The marriage was secret from all but a few close friends; he revealed it to his brother only a few months before his own death from [[pneumonia]].

More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative [[Crown immunity|governmental immunity]]:&lt;ref&gt;There are differing opinions whether the immunity in Australia should be referred to as "Crown immunity" or "governmental immunity". For example, {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}} refers to governmental immunity; while {{Harvnb|Seddon|2009}} refers to Crown immunity. Without judging the merits of which term is more appropriate, this article uses "governmental immunity"&lt;/ref&gt; whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.

The High Court's judgment marked a successful appeal for the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]], the Australian regulator of anti-competitive conduct, having lost at first instance and on appeal in the [[Federal Court of Australia]]. The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration, ending eight years of litigation between the parties. The High Court's judgment was received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.

==Background==

===Facts===
Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian subsidiary of the multinational health care company [[Baxter International]]. Baxter manufactured [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (IV) and [[peritoneal dialysis]] (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[6]-[7] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the cost of importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and [[Parenteral nutrition|parenteral nutrition fluids]]. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for [[peritoneal dialysis]] fluids (PD fluids).{{sfn|Duns|2008|p=51}}

A number of [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]] issued [[tendering|requests for tender]] for the supply of sterile fluids and PD fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[10]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=374}}

===Legislation===
Section&amp;nbsp;46 of the TPA prohibited corporations from misusing market power.&lt;ref name="TPA s46"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param355 |title=s.46 Misuse of market power}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Section&amp;nbsp;47 prohibited [[exclusive dealing]].&lt;ref name="TPA s47"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param358 |title=s.47 Exclusive dealing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical provision to the case was Section&amp;nbsp;2B of the TPA. Section&amp;nbsp;2B provided that Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... bind the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory, so far as the Crown carries on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory ...&lt;ref name="TPA s2B"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param4 |title=s.2B  Application of Act to States and Territories}} which provides that the Crown is bound by Part IV of the TPA, which includes Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;2B thus provided an immunity from state and territory governments from Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA insofar as the governments were not carrying on a business.

===The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission===
The [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC), the Australian government authority responsible for regulating the TPA, commenced an action in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] seeking declarations that Baxter's bundling pricing structure in its tenders had contravened [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare#Legislation|Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47]] of the TPA. The ACCC sought the imposition of injunctions and pecuniary penalties by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative governmental immunity before ''Baxter''===
Derivative governmental immunity refers to the extension of a government's immunity from a statute to a non-government party on the basis the government would be affected if the statute was to apply to the other party.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=116}}

Prior to ''Baxter'', the leading case on derivative governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in ''Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|15|1979|litigants=Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd |parallelcite=(1979) 145 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 107 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=116–120}}{{sfn|Heydon|1989|p=[2.115]}} In ''Bradken'', the High Court upheld a claim for derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=116–117}}

''Bradken'''s application of the principle of derivative governmental immunity had been subject to criticism. Robertson Wright SC, a [[Senior Counsel]] specialising in competition and trade practices law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://12thfloor.com.au/robertson-wright.htm|title=Robertson Wright SC|publisher=Wentworth Selborne Chambers (12th floor)|accessdate=13 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112013720/http://www.12thfloor.com.au/robertson-wright.htm|archivedate=12 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued there are "a number of difficulties" with the judgment, including the "unsatisfactory nature" of the authorities it relied on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2008|p=117}}. Wright details his criticisms in {{citation|last=Wright|first=Robertson|year=2007|title=The future of Derivative Crown Immunity—with a competition law perspective|journal=Competition and Consumer Law Journal |publisher=Lexis Nexis Australia |location=Sydney |volume=14 |page=240 |issn=1039-5598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court's judgment in ''Baxter'' would mark a retreat from ''Bradken''.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=375}}

===Federal Court litigation===
The ACCC conceded that the state governments were not carrying on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=168}} On 16 May 2005, The [[Federal Court of Australia]] ([[James Allsop|Allsop J]] presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the court held that Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section&amp;nbsp;2B extended to Baxter Healthcare.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=374}} Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices [[John Mansfield (judge)|Mansfield]], [[John Dowsett|Dowsett]] and [[Roger Gyles|Gyles]] presiding).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCAFC|128|2006|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of ''Bradken''.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=122}}

==High Court appeal==
The ACCC was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court against the judgment of the full bench of the Federal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCATrans|60|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |courtname=auto |date=9 February 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The [[Australian Government Solicitor]] acted for the ACCC, with [[Lindsay Foster]] as [[Senior Counsel]]; [[Blake Dawson]] and [[David Yates (judge)|David Yates SC]] represented Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCATrans|202|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |courtname=auto |date=15 May 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.&lt;ref name="Baxter"/&gt;

===Judgments===

====Joint judgment====
Five judges ([[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] and Justices [[William Gummow|Gummow]], [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]], [[Dyson Heydon|Heydon]] and [[Susan Crennan|Crennan]]) joined in the leading majority judgment allowing the ACCC's appeal. The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part&amp;nbsp;IV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=169}} In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was "nothing unusual" about such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[44]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases. In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government, the judgment adopted the following position of Justice [[Frank Kitto|Kitto]], then dissenting, in the 1955 High Court case of ''Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |date=15 December 1955 ||parallelcite=(1955)&amp;nbsp;93&amp;nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 376 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=376}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |pinpoint=[9] per Kitto J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wynyard Investments'' was a case about governmental immunity generally (not derivative governmental immunity specifically), but Justice Kitto's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |pinpoint=[5] per Kitto J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour, the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a "remarkable" conclusion and "far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments, or to prevent a divesting of proprietary, contractual or other legal rights and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[64]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kirby J====
[[Michael Kirby (judge)|Justice Kirby]]'s judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment, for different reasons. Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself, stating that "persisting with [governmental immunity] into the twenty-first century is unacceptable."{{sfn|Duns|2008|pp=53–4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[97]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Callinan J====
[[Ian Callinan|Justice Callinan]] dissented from the majority, holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed ''Bradken'', concluding that it remained authoritative.{{sfn|Duns|2008|pp=53–4}}

==Reaction to judgment==

===Significance===
Robertson Wright, writing after the judgment was handed down, claimed that ''Baxter'' represented a change to the law, drawing the following conclusions from the judgment:
* The application of derivative governmental immunity depends on a construction of the particular statute (particularly the object and purpose of the statute).
* As a general rule, derivative governmental immunity applies if the statute's coverage of a person would divest the government of proprietary, contractual, or other legal rights or interests (as opposed to commercial or policy rights or interests).{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=126}}

The judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/business/back-to-the-trade-law-books-as-samuel-scores/2007/08/29/1188067191295.html|title=Back to the trade law books as Samuel scores|work = [[Brisbane Times]]|last=Maiden|first=Malcolm|date=29 August 2007|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment was also received as an "historic decision" setting a precedent for government procurement, on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/businesses-could-lose-immunity-after-ruling/2007/08/29/1188067189790.html|title=Businesses could lose immunity after ruling|work =[[The Age]]|last=Murphy|first=Mathew|date=30 August 2007|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Nicholas Seddon, a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blakedawson.com/Templates/Profiles/x_profile_content_page.aspx?id=8833|title=Nicholas Seddon: Special Counsel, Canberra|publisher=[[Blake Dawson]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}} At the time of writing his criticisms, Seddon was an employee of [[Blake Dawson]], the firm that represented Baxter throughout the Federal Court and High Court litigation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=358|title=ANU College of Law: Our Staff|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=13 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710032458/http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=358|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed the High Court's judgment leaves "many uncertainties", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government).{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=171}} Robertson Wright echoed these concerns, arguing the joint judgment did not "set out in as helpful detail" as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government.{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=126–127}} Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is "difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow" from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=170}}

==Later action==
The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, upon the remittal of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCAFC|141|2008|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |date=11 August 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That judgment ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The '''Austrian Federal Economic Chamber''' ([[German language|de]]: ''Wirtschaftskammer Österreich'' or '''WKO''') functions as the federal parent organization for the nine [[States of Austria|State]] Chambers and 110 trade associations for different industries within [[Austria]]'s [[economy|system of economy]].&lt;ref name="AdvantageAustria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advantageaustria.org/international/index.en.html|title=AdvantageAustria|accessdate= December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most State Chambers and associations have local offices to provide services in close proximity to members. 
&lt;!--The Presiding Committee of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber consists of President Christoph Leitl, the Vice Presidents Richard Schenz, Martha Schultz, Matthias Krenn, Christoph Matznetter, Ulrike Rabmer-Koller and Jürgen Roth, Secretary General Anna Maria Hochhauser and Deputy Secretary General Herwig Höllinger.&lt;ref name="WKO Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/wir/Management_of_the_Austrian_Federal_Economic_Chamber.html|title=WKO Management|accessdate= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;      

Compulsory membership by Austrian federal law is automatic with obtaining the operating licence of the company and thus includes all Austrian [[Company|companies]] in operation. The resultant membership of 517.477 active businesses as per 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wko.at/statistik/jahrbuch/mg-km.pdf|title=Yearbook of the Federal Economic Chamber|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes diverse sectors such as trade and [[craft]], [[commerce]], [[industry]], [[transportation]], [[tourism]], services industries, [[finance]] and [[insurance]], but not agriculture, as this sector is served by its own Chamber.

==Main tasks and activities==
[[File:Wirtschaftskammer Österreich.jpg|thumb|Building of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Industry Day in Vienna|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann14070/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Observatory|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Representation of membership interests at all levels of government. By law governments are obliged to consult with Chambers on legislative projects and important regulation. In many laws a provision is made to involve Chambers in decision-making and administrative procedures. 
Information and advisory service to members: Typical issues include taxation, labour law, vocational training, industry-specific legislation, industry-wide advertising and market research.

===Collective bargaining with unions===
Trade associations engage in negotiations with their respective sectoral countrywide union. 
Economic Promotion and Development as well as training and consulting are mainly organised by a specialised department in each region (WIFI, Wirtschaftsfoerderungsinstitut).

===Business Support===
Business Support and Promotion of International Trade is provided by a specialised department at a national level (AWO - AUSSENWIRTSCHAFT ÖSTERREICH), 110 field offices around the world (Austrian Trade Commissions) plus a network of specialised experts within the State Chambers. 
Public law (Wirtschaftskammergesetz) provides a legal foundation for the Austrian Federal Economic Chambers, supplying the legal framework for all Chambers, their co-operation, mandatory membership, and rules for setting membership fees. Although established by public law the Federal Economic Chambers are exclusively business driven.

Every 5 years entrepreneurs elect officers and representatives for the trade associations and the Chamber (amounting to a total of more than 10.000 officers) from their own ranks. In these elections free associations of entrepreneurs field their candidates to compete for the leadership of the Chambers and individual trade associations. Some of these entrepreneurial associations are affiliated with political parties while others are independent platforms. Since 1999,[[Dr. Christoph Leitl]] has been elected President of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber thrice.

[[File:Wirtschaftskammer Graz 20130802.jpg|thumb|Building of the Economic Chamber in [[Graz]].]]
The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber is financially self-sufficient with around 85% of expenditure covered by member contributions and a further 15% by revenues from marketable sales. This factor, combined with organisational management through democratic self-government, makes us fully independent from public authorities.

==AdvantageAustria.org==
In Austria the promotion of foreign trade constitutes, by law, one major part of the activities of the Economic Chamber. The immense importance of foreign trade to Austria is reflected in the extraordinary range of services provided by AdvantageAustria.org (AWO - AUSSENWIRTSCHAFT ÖSTERREICH) with an international network of 113&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wko.at/Content.Node/service/aussenwirtschaft/AussenwirtschaftsCenter.html&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian Trade Offices worldwide, in most cases sections of the Austrian embassies in the respective countries.

Furthermore, AdvantageAustria.org offers Austrian businesses a wide range of complementary services including: specialist services related to Austria's EU membership, information and advice. The primary aim is to help create and sustain successful sales and promotion of Austrian goods and services in international markets.

AdvantageAustria.org is also responsible for the organization of trade missions and official participation in international trade fairs and provides advice and assistance to inbound buying missions.

The heads of each Austrian Trade Offices, the Austrian Trade Commissioners or Delegates, help Austrian companies to find new contacts and develop existing business. Trade Commissioners put buyers in contact with potential agents, importers and co-operation partners. They also obtain credit ratings and assist with trade name and patent registration.

'''Charles Handy''' [[CBE]] (born 1932) is an Irish author/philosopher specialising in [[organisational behaviour]] and management.  Among the ideas he has advanced are the "portfolio worker" and the "[[Shamrock Organization]]" (in which professional core workers, freelance workers and part-time/temporary routine workers each form one leaf of the "Shamrock").

He has been rated among the [[Thinkers 50]], a private list of the most influential living management thinkers.  In 2001 he was second on this list, behind [[Peter Drucker]], and in 2005 he was tenth. When the [[Harvard Business Review]] had a special issue to mark their 50th Anniversary they asked Handy, [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Henry Mintzberg]] to write special articles.

In July 2006 he was conferred with an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] by [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

==Life==
Born the son of a [[Church of Ireland]] [[archdeacon]] in [[Clane]], [[Co. Kildare]], Ireland, Handy was educated as a boarder at [[Bromsgrove School]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]].

Handy's business career started in marketing at [[Shell International]]. He left Shell to teach at the [[London Business School]] in 1972 and spent a year in Boston observing the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s way of teaching business. &lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.economist.com/node/13847396|title= Charles Handy |publisher=The Economist|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and style==
A feel for Handy's style can be gained from the opening of his autobiography: "Some years ago I was helping my wife arrange an exhibit of her photographs of Indian tea gardens when I was approached by a man who had been looking at the pictures. 'I hear that Charles Handy is here,' he said. 'Indeed he is,' I replied, 'and I am he.'  He looked at me rather dubiously for a moment, and then said, 'Are you sure?'  It was, I told him, a good question because over time there had been many versions of Charles Handy, not all of which I was particularly proud."&lt;ref&gt;''Myself and other more important matters'' p1&lt;/ref&gt;

When presenting to an audience, he has been known to use a personal framing device to help explain a complex concept. At an HR conference in Australia he couched his talk about the future of work as a letter he would write to his grandchildren.
“I tell my grandchildren, it seems frightening now but you will learn to live with these changes and you will think, how could the world have existed before this?”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrmonline.com.au/section/featured/not-human-resource-name/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yu-hwei Chen''', also known as '''Zheng Feng''', is a [[wuxia]] novelist.

==Biography==
Born in 1973 in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] to [[Chen Li-an]], a former president of [[Control Yuan]] of [[Republic of China]] and Cecilia Tsao, the founder of Cecilia Arts, Chen is the fourth child and the only daughter of a prominent clan. Her great grandfather [[Tan Yankai]] is a former president of [[Republic of China]] and her grandfather [[Chen Tsyr-shiou]] is a former vice president of [[Republic of China]].

Chen attended Fu-Hsing Private School and [[Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University]] in [[Taipei]] for primary and secondary education. Encouraged by her father, she began reading [[wuxia]] novels by [[Louis Cha]] since primary school and was fascinated with his works, which deeply influenced her future writing career. During her childhood and teenage years, Chen was also obsessed with classic [[Chinese literature]], and this equipped her with eloquent narrative skills in [[Old Chinese]].

Chen was enrolled in [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1991 and earned a bachelor's degree from [[Sloan Business School]] in 1995. After graduation, she moved to [[Hong Kong]] and worked for [[JP Morgan Chase]] as an investment banker. She spent one year in [[London]]. Her experience in [[London]] inspired her imagination and she set pen on the draft of her first [[wuxia]] novel.

She returned to [[Hong Kong]] and resumed her investment banking career with [[ABN AMRO]], where she retired as director in 2009. Her first novel was published in 2006 and won the Best Novel Award in a [[wuxia]] novel competition in Greater China. After that, she published another four novels.

She became a professional novelist in 2009 and began serving on the board of [[Independent Schools Foundation Academy]].

Roebuck has held senior [[Human resource management|human resource]] and organisational transformation roles at [[London Underground]], [[KPMG]], [[HSBC]], and [[UBS]].{{fact|date=March 2018}} In 2011, 2012 and 2013, he was nominated by HR Magazine as one of the top 20 Most Influential HR Thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmostinfluential.com/profiles/chris-roebuck "Chris Roebuck, Visiting professor of transformational leadership, Cass Business School"] ''HR Most Influential''&lt;/ref&gt; Roebuck advises the [[Chartered Management Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managers.org.uk/chris-roebuck&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]], business groups such as the Corporate Leadership Council, and the media, such as The Times, Wall Street Journal and the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/news/?q=chris%20roebuck&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Roebuck studied economics and geography at [[University College London]] where he chaired the Students Union commercial enterprises committee, whose operations turned over in excess of £1m in 1976 and employed 32 staff.{{fact|date=March 2018}} He later chaired the Union Council, overseeing the constitutional governance process, elections, and negotiations with the UCL senior leadership team and Provost.{{fact|date=March 2018}} Roebuck graduated in 1977.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Military service==

Roebuck served with the Royal Engineer sub unit of the University of London Officer Training Corps and was commissioned into the Territorial Army. During this period he led the team that blew up the 150&amp;nbsp;ft high chimney at the old pottery at Sandford near Wareham in Dorset to make way for a new housing estate. Roebuck was subsequently commissioned into the regular Army [[Royal Engineers]] via the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. He was the Best Young Officer on his Course at the [[Royal School of Military Engineering]]. During his service in Germany, Roebuck developed the modern pipe [[fascine]], now used by the British Army in operations globally to rapidly cross small gaps and obstacles that restrict the mobility of armoured and other units.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Career==

After leaving the Army, Roebuck used his knowledge of leadership to help SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) develop their leadership capability as he found they often lack resources or knowledge to achieve this. He frequently worked with entrepreneurs, helping them develop better leadership skills to take their businesses forward. This later fed into his work with larger organisations, particularly UBS, around developing entrepreneurial leadership.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

In 1992 he received his [[MBA]] from [[Cass Business School]] in [[London]]. His final dissertation on organisational communication was featured in [[The Times]], on [[BBC Television]] and was published worldwide in the International Journal of Strategic Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024630196000283 | doi=10.1016/0024-6301(96)00028-3 | volume=29 | title=Constructive feedback: Key to higher performance and commitment | year=1996 | journal=Long Range Planning | pages=328–336 | last1 = Roebuck | first1 = Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his MBA he was asked to develop performance improvement initiatives in organisations such as [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Bank of New York]], [[Bank of England]], [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council of England and Wales]], legal firms, and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] amongst others.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

In the late 1990s Roebuck lectured at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and the [[Joint Services Command and Staff College|Joint Services Command College]] on utilising the best of both military and commercial leadership techniques for the benefit of military officers. In 1996, he also advised on updating the course at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

In 1999, Roebuck was invited to be a member of an expert panel on improving leadership in British business in order to enhance competitiveness, reporting to the UK government &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideopolis.info/documents/FinalReport6b.pdf "Leadership and Management in the Changing Economy" ''Ideopolis International'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After roles with the executive team at [[London Underground]] developing the Public Private Partnership, the largest Public Finance Initiative to date in the UK, he then worked to build a new business line for [[KPMG]] based on providing outsourced services. He then moved on to building a business-driven core leadership management system for [[HSBC]] investment bank. In 2002, Roebuck moved to Zurich at the request of [[UBS]] where he worked until 2006.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

At UBS, Roebuck and colleagues led the delivery of a new development and leadership strategy for the bank’s top 500 leaders. They subsequently co-ordinated the strategy via the business divisions for the other 70,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf Business-driven integrated talent strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231722/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This underpinned a new corporate alignment, culture and brand, improving the bottom line and the position of UBS in the global banking rankings through entrepreneurial leadership. In 2004, he was appointed Global Head of Talent and Leadership. The project at UBS progressed well with top management support and, as a result, in 2005 UBS won the title "Best Company for Leaders Europe" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internalcommshub.com/open/news/hewitt_study.shtml|title=En dansk blog om mode, skønhed og livsstil|author=|date=|website=www.internalcommshub.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Best New Corporate University" awards, the "Corporate University Best Practice" and "Excellence" awards in 2006/7,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corpu.com/site_media/journal/2004/1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked one of the top 10 best companies in Europe in 2007.

The UBS talent and leadership initiative now forms a key part of a Harvard Business School Case Study "UBS: Towards the Integrated Firm" on supporting strategic business change, realignment and improvement via talent and leadership activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbr.org/product/a/an/506026-PDF-ENG?cm_sp=doi-_-case-_-506026-PDF-ENG&amp;referral=00103|title=UBS: Towards the Integrated Firm|author=|date=|website=hbr.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is also reviewed from the organisational culture and performance perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf UBS Case Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231722/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at UBS, Roebuck built on his experience of entrepreneurial leadership in SMEs to enable it to be used at UBS as a catalyst for improving organisational performance. He also developed the initial concept of Entrepreneurial HR to support this, which he continues to expand on and refine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfNUiWGeQns "Episode 101 - HR can lead the way in creating entrepreneurial leaders"]. Interview on YouTube. Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, Roebuck has helped develop leadership and values-based high performance working with or in organisations as diverse as the British [[National Health Service]] (1.4m staff), and in sectors including international logistics, finance, legal, transport, facilities, media, pharmaceutical, and not-for-profit.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

Roebuck was part of the expert group developing the 2009 report on Employee Engagement "Engaging for Success" for the [[UK Government]] to improve performance in British Business. He also subsequently worked on its implementation. In 2011 he was commissioned by the [[King's Fund]], the UKs leading Health Sector think tank, to deliver a report and recommendations on developing leadership in the NHS to enhance patient care for their Commission to the UK Government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/document.rm?id=9114 King's Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Executive Committee of the [[European Coaching and Mentoring Council]] 2004 -6 and also is an expert on developing leadership via mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;Mentoring in Action: A Practical Guide for Managers - By David Clutterbuck, Bob Garvey. P 178, Kogan Page 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He is  also an executive coach and business mentor.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Early life==
Wiese studied at [[Paarl Boys' High School]] in the [[Western Cape]] region of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabsa.co.za/presses/7.pdf Article about the richest men in South Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205083922/http://www.sabsa.co.za/presses/7.pdf |date=5 February 2013 }} at Sabsa.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; Wiese attended [[Stellenbosch University]], from where he received BA and LLB degrees.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Career==
After university, Wiese practised law at the Cape Bar for some years before working as a Director at [[Pepkor]], the discount clothing chain that his parents helped to found.&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Meet South African Billionaire Christo Wiese, Mr. Shoprite|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2012/07/24/meet-south-african-billionaire-christo-wiese-mr-shoprite/|accessdate=8 January 2015|work=Forbes|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his leadership, [[Shoprite (South Africa)|Shoprite]] started out as a chain of eight supermarkets in [[Cape Town]] that was purchased for 1 million [[South African rand|rand]] (equivalent to $122,000 USD) which grew into a multibillion-dollar business due to various acquisitions and expansion strategies made in the first 30 years of operations. After playing a role in helping Shoprite acquire distributor Senta, Wiese started expanding his business into [[franchising]] new locations for Shoprite department stores.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web

Wiese had a net worth of US$6.8 billion,&lt;ref&gt;businesstech.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; but as of December 2017 is reported to be worth only $742 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42353260|title=Steinhoff investors decide fate of firm|first1=Joshua|last1=Cheetham|first2=Daniele|last2=Palumbo|date=19 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the executive director of South African retail giant [[Shoprite (South Africa)|Shoprite]] ([[JSE Limited|JSE]]: SHP).&lt;ref name="wiese"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiese2"/&gt; Wiese has been chairman of Invicta Holdings Limited since 2006. Wiese formerly was the 11th-most successful businessman in his chosen fields of industry (accounting, banking, finance, consumer goods, fashion, and retail) and previously was the 69th-most successful person in South African history.&lt;ref name="whowhosa"&gt;[http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/christo-wiese-1134 ''Christoffel Wiese''] at Who's Who SA&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, it was reported that [[Virgin Group]] and their private equity backers had sold 80% of [[Virgin Active]] to the South African investment firm [[Brait]], owned by Wiese. The sale price will be £682 million for an 80% stake, valuing the business at £1.3 billion, including debt, and the transaction should be completed in summer 2015, and the company will continue to operate under the Virgin Active brand.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kollewe|first1=Julia|title=Virgin Active stake sold to South Africa's Brait for £682m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/virgin-active-stake-sold-to-south-africas-brait|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2016, Wiese is also chairman and largest shareholder of [[Steinhoff International]], a German-listed $22 billion furniture conglomerate.&lt;ref name=MattressFirm&gt;{{cite web | title = South Africa's Steinhoff to Buy Mattress Firm for $3.8 Billion | url = http://fortune.com/2016/08/08/steinhoff-south-africa-mattress-firm-acquire/ | work = Fortune | agency = Reuters | date = August 8, 2016 | accessdate = August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lanzerac Manor &amp; Winery===
Wiese bought a South African farm dating back from the 19th century in 1991, and converted it into a [[Star (classification)|five-star]] hotel, ''[[Lanzerac Manor &amp; Winery]]'', with 48 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanzerac.co.za/ Lanzerac Manor &amp; Winery information] at Lanzerac.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; He later sold the property to a foreign investment firm for an undisclosed sum on 7 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin24.com/Companies/TravelAndLeisure/Wiese-sells-Lanzerac-to-foreigners-20120307 Wiese sells Lanzerac to foreigners] at Fin24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial controversies===
As of August 2012, it was reported that Wiese owed [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]] an estimated R2 billion in back taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining.com/south-africas-third-wealthiest-man-owes-the-taxman-250-million-53346/ ''South Africa’s third wealthiest man owes the taxman $250 million''] at Mining.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/Mr-Peps-R2bn-tax-bill-20120812|title=Christo Wiese's R2bn tax bill|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiese faced a legal battle to recover $1 million that he was carrying while boarding a flight from England to Luxembourg in 2009. This amount was confiscated by customs officers as the sum was in hard cash bundled up in rubber bands in his luggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/06/27/billionaire-christo-wiese-south-africa-richest-cash-luggage/#1af3573c50c4|title=This Is What Happens When A Billionaire Tries To Get On A Plane With $1 Million Cash In His Luggage|last=O'Connor|first=Clare|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Consumers Union of Japan'''|日本消費者連盟|}} or '''CUJ''' was founded in 1969 by [[Takeuchi Naokazu]]. CUJ is certified as a [[non-profit organization]] by [[Japan]]'s NPO legislation. With offices in [[Nishi-Waseda]], [[Tokyo]], CUJ publishes "Consumer Report" as a member newsletter, as well as an online service in Japanese.

CUJ has been an associate member of [[Consumers International]] since 1972, promoting [[consumer protection]] in Japan.

==History==
In 1971, CUJ invited US consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]] to Japan for a workshop. Early campaigns had a distinct focus on food safety and environmental concerns, including class action lawsuits against illegal oil industry cartels. CUJ was an early opponent of [[nuclear power]] and [[food irradiation]] in Japan, holding various events throughout the country during the anti-nuclear power action week in 1977. CUJ has supported the campaign to stop the [[Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant]] in the [[Aomori Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nishoren.org/en/?p=19 Rokkashomura: Call for Action] Nishoren.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, CUJ called for an end to liberalization of agricultural products. The campaign was called, "Yes to Complete Grain Self-sufficiency" and in 1985 CUJ organized meetings of rice farmers and consumers to discuss how to protect [[rice production in Japan]] from pressure to liberalize Japan’s rice market, in order to restore Japan’s food self-sufficiency. CUJ has also protested imports of [[whale meat]] from [[Norway]], noting that [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] contents were 7.6 times the Japanese government's maximum permissible level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2002/2002-03-06-03.asp ENS: Japan to Import Norwegian Whale Meat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetically Modified Food==
Since 1996, CUJ has been the center of the opposition to [[genetically modified food]] (GMO)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nishoren.org/en/?cat=14 CUJ Biotechnology Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan, starting the "No! GMO" Campaign, and demanding mandatory labeling of all GMO foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=10569 Another Japan Is Possible: New Social Movements and Global Citizenship Education. Stanford University Press (2008). Edited by Jennifer Chan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==BSE Controversy==
In 2005, CUJ was highly critical of the resumption of imports to Japan of beef from the [[United States]] due to fears about [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]. "This conclusion was made politically and hastily in response to the American demand that we resume beef imports from the United States," said [[Yasuaki Yamaura]] to [[CBS News]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/19/health/main656645.shtml CBS News: Japan Close To Lifting Beef Ban]&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2006, he also noted to [[Reuters]]: "Safety inspection by Japan at U.S. meatpacking plants is merely nominal and superficial..." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/politics/544338/no_deal_yet_on_us_beef_imports_to_japan/index.html Reuters: No deal yet on US beef imports to Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US beef imports in Japan]] were stopped from the United States in December 2003. In December 2005, Japan once again allowed imports of U.S. beef, but reinstated the ban in January 2006 after a technical violation of the U.S.-Japan beef import agreement. In order to protect Japanese consumers from mad cow disease, only meat from cattle that is less than 21 months old is accepted; and [[spinal cord]]s, [[vertebrae]], brains and [[bone marrow]] must be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4631580.stm BBC: New US beef import ban in Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Michiko Kamiyama from Food Safety Citizen Watch and Yoko Tomiyama, Consumers Union of Japan, said about this: "The government has put priority on the political schedule between the two countries, not on food safety or human health."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fswatch.org/newsletter/english/issue05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Francesco Antonio Maria Matarazzo, Count Matarazzo''' (March 9, 1854 in [[Castellabate]] – December 10, 1937 in São Paulo, [[Brazil]]), was an Italian-Brazilian businessman and [[Nobility|noble]] who created a large business in [[South America]], particularly in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://entrepreneurreview.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/count-francesco-matarazzo-royalty-in-life-and-in-business/|title=Count Francesco Matarazzo: Royalty in Life and in Business|last=entrepreneurreview|date=2015-12-18|website=The Entrepreneur Review|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Castellabate]], [[Salerno]], Italy, the eldest of Doctor Costabile Matarazzo's nine sons, and Mariangela Jovane. At the age of 26, when [[Italian Brazilian#Italian immigration to Brazil|Italian emigration to Brazil]] was widespread, he moved to  the city of [[Sorocaba]], [[São Paulo]] with his brothers, wife and children.&lt;ref name=Treccani&gt;{{cite web|title=MATARAZZO, Francesco|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-matarazzo_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|work=TRECCANI, La cultura italiana|access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially he sold oranges and lottery tickets and shined shoes, reinvesting the proceeds in new businesses, eventually including plantations of tea, coffee, corn, rice, rubber and cotton.&lt;ref name="Barnes &amp; Barnes, 2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nazi Refugee Turned Gestapo Spy: The Life of Hans Wesemann, 1895–1971 | publisher=Praeger Publishers |author1=Barnes, James J  |author2=Barnes, Patience P | year=2001 | pages=11 | isbn=0-275-97124-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, he moved to São Paulo and with his brothers, Giuseppe and Luigi, founded Matarazzo and Irmãos. He diversified its business and imported wheat flour from the [[United States of America]]. Giuseppe took part in the company with a lard factory in [[Porto Alegre]] and Luigi with a deposit-warehouse in São Paulo.

The following year the company was dissolved and replaced by Companhia Matarazzo SA with 43 minority shareholders. This corporation also controlled the factories in Sorocaba and Porto Alegre.

War between [[Spain]] and [[Central America]]n countries made it difficult buy wheat flour and he obtained credit from the [[London and Brazilian Bank]] to build a mill in São Paulo. From there, his business expanded rapidly to a total of 365 factories{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} throughout Brazil. The conglomerate became the fourth largest in the country and 6% of the population depended on its factories in São Paulo. The business was renamed '''Indústrias Reunidas Francisco Matarazzo''' (IRFM) in 1911.

The Gestapo spy [[Hans Wesemann]] reported that:

{{bq|text=An entire fleet sails under his flag. Tens of thousands of workers toil in his factories. He makes cement, cuts down trees and turns the pulp into paper, on which he prints his newspapers. The public drinks his beer and watches films in his cinemas. He contrives to be both wealthy and popular and when the president of Brazil visits Sao Paolo, he calls upon Matarazzo first.&lt;ref name="Barnes &amp; Barnes, 2001"/&gt;}}

In recognition of his financial and material assistance to Italy during the [[First World War]] King Victor Emmanuel III conferred the title of [[Count]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Matarazzo died in 1937 after an attack of [[uremia]]. At that time he was Brazil's's richest man, with an estimated fortune of 10 billion U.S. dollars.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Critical management studies''' ('''CMS''') is a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of [[management]], business and organisation, grounded originally in a [[critical theory]] perspective. Today it encompasses a wide range of perspectives that are critical of traditional theories of management and the business schools that generate these theories.

==History==

It is generally accepted that CMS began with [[Mats Alvesson]] and [[Hugh Willmott]]'s edited collection ''Critical Management Studies'' ([[#AlvessonWillmott1992|1992]]). Critical Management Studies (CMS) initially brought together [[critical theory]] and [[post-structuralist]] writings, but has since developed in more diverse directions.

A dominant narrative within CMS is that perhaps the most important development in its stimulation was the global expansion of business schools, an American invention, especially in Europe. Decreases in state funding, so the narrative has it, for social sciences and increases in funding for business schools during the 1980s resulted in many academics with graduate training in [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and other social sciences ending up with jobs "training managers".

These academics brought different theoretical tools and political perspectives into business schools. They began to question the politics of [[managerialism]] and to link the techniques of management to neo-liberalism. These new voices drew on the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory, and the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. Later [[Feminism]], [[queer theory]], [[post-colonial theory]], [[anarchism]], ecological philosophies, and radical democratic theory also had some influence. (See [[#AlvessonWillmott2003|Alvesson and Willmott 2003]] for a survey of the field.)

The roots of CMS also came from a series of UK Labour Process Conferences that began in 1983 and reflected the impact of [[Harry Braverman|Braverman]]'s ([[#Braverman1974|1974]]) attempt to make [[Marxist]] categories central to understanding work organisations. Industrial relations and labor studies scholars have joined the CMS fold in the US, seeking new opportunities for employment as labor-related programs have diminished in number.

At the same time a significant strand of critical accounting studies began to develop marked by the publication of Tony Tinker's ''Paper Prophets'' (1985) and the appearance of the journal ''Critical Perspectives on Accounting''.

Contrasting with the dominant origin narrative is an account which states that, along with the contributors to CMS from the intellectual traditions identified here, there is a significant - and overlapping - bloc among CMS scholars of those who have had extensive pre-University experience as workers and managers. The inconsistencies between their experiences in the workplace and the claims of mainstream managerialism, and an intention to connect those experiences to broader explanations and theorizing leads these people to CMS.

==Geographical base==

The main home of CMS has been in the [[Organizational studies|organisation theory]] and behaviour parts of British, Australian and Scandinavian business schools,&lt;ref&gt;Engwall, L. 2004. The Americanization of Nordic management education. Journal of Management Inquiry, 13: 109–117.&lt;/ref&gt; though there are strong contributions in related fields such as [[sociology]], [[sociology of education]], and [[critical pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Perriton, L. &amp; Reynolds, M. 2004: Critical Management Education From Pedagogy of Possibility to Pedagogy of Refusal? Management Learning 35, 61-77&lt;/ref&gt; Further, contributions stem from [[accounting]] with growing interest in other management specialisms, such as [[marketing]], international business, [[operational research]], [[logistics]] etc. Since the 1990s academics from North America and other parts of the world are also engaging with this body of writing and research. The CMS Division within the (American) Academy of Management (AoM), with a membership of around 800, is larger and more international than some of its other divisions.

Many heterodox scholars in various parts of the world had been inspired by the international activities of the Standing Conference on Organisational Symbolism. This latter grouping developed work which drew variously on [[post-structuralism]] and [[symbolic interactionism]] in order to develop a cultural and [[anthropology|anthropological]] understanding of contemporary organizations. Others, though, were without affiliation and/or seeking new formations and alliances. Since 1999, there has been a bi-annual CMS conference held in the UK as well as workshops and a bi-annual conference held at US Academy of Management.

Today there are significant concentrations of CMS scholars in the UK at the School of Business and Management at Queen Mary, [[University of London]], at the School of Management at the [[University of Leicester]], the Essex Business School at the [[University of Essex]], Alliance [[Manchester Business School]] at the [[University of Manchester]], and the Marketing Research Group at [[Royal Holloway]].  Elsewhere, [[Copenhagen Business School]], [[Lund School of Economics and Management]] at [[Lund University]] and [[Istanbul Bilgi University]] have clusters of CMS scholars, but many CMS scholars globally rely on conferences and journals like ''Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Studies'', ''ephemera: theory and politics in organization'', ''Culture and Organization'', or ''Organization: the critical journal of organization, theory and society'' for their affiliations.

==Controversy and debate==

Major points of debate have focused on the relationship with more orthodox forms of [[Marxism]], the nature and purposes of CMS critique, as well as on questions of inclusion and exclusion ([[#FournierGrey2000|Fournier and Grey 2000]]), the possibilities of social transformation from within business schools ([[#Parker2002|Parker 2002]]), and the development of alternative models of globalisation.

One trend in CMS has seen the incorporation of [[autonomist]] Marxist theory, first introduced in the English-speaking world by the work of [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] (2000).  New CMS scholars using these theories have interests in proposing alternative non-capitalist forms of organizing work and [[personal life|life]] - often around the notion of [[collective responsibility]] for the [[commons]].  Other developments include engagements with [[post-colonial theory]] and [[critical race theory]] to investigate the way management and business schools contribute to what [[Cedric Robinson]] (1983) has called "racial capitalism". Recent critical works have referred to [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]sian theory (structuralist [[constructivism (disambiguation)|constructivism]])&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P., &amp; Passeron, J. C. 1977. Reproduction in education, society and culture. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. 2005. The social structures of the economy. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to point to the risks of elitism&lt;ref&gt;Vaara, E., &amp; Faÿ, E. 2011. How can a Bourdieusian perspective aid analysis of MBA education? Academy of Management Learning and Education, 10: 27–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaara, E., &amp; Faÿ, E. 2012. Reproduction and change on the global scale: A Bourdieusian perspective on management education. Journal of Management Studies, 49: 1023–1051.&lt;/ref&gt; and social inequality,&lt;ref&gt;Lueg, K., &amp; Lueg, R. 2015. Why do students choose English as a medium of instruction? A Bourdieusian perspective on the study strategies of non-native English speakers. Academy of Management Learning and Education, 14: 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in management education. Michael Loughlin of Manchester  Metropolitan University has discussed aspects of management theory as "[[pseudo-science]]".&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last1 = Loughlin
| first1 = Michael
| chapter = 4. The pseudo-science of management
| title = Ethics, management, and mythology: Rational decision making for health service professionals 
| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_o5k8fnmIFgC
| series = Radcliffe Series
| location = Abingdon
| publisher = Radcliffe Medical Press
| publication-date = 2002
| pages = 77–91
| isbn = 9781857755749
| access-date = 2016-04-19
| quote = In addition to the claim that 'quality' is somehow foundational to evaluation, such that to improve a service means to increase or improve its quality, we have seen that a key claim of management theory is that there are 'basic organisational criteria' common to all complex organisations (Berwick 1993, IHSM 1993, Laffel and Blumenthal 1993, Peters 1992). The existence of these common organisational criteria provides the basis for the claim that management is a science, a specific discipline with its own distinctive methods and principles, such that theories developed for the manufacturing sector [...] can meaningfully be applied to the project of improving such radically different practices as healthcare and education. [...] Books like ''The Textbook of Total Quality'' have as much claim to the title of a work of 'science' as ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''.
| year = 2002
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider impatience with market-managerial forms of organization occur commonly enough outside the business school, from [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] protest to popular-media presentations of managers. CMS attempts to articulate these voices within the [[business school]], and to provide ways of thinking beyond current dominant theories and practices of organizations.

This confusing situation awaits the definition of justice to find out who was legitimately elected to chair the [[Argentine Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elintransigente.com/notas/2011/10/18/daniel-habria-elegido-presidente-asamblea-paralela-107414.asp|title=Daniel Vila have been elected as President of the AFA, in a parallel assembly|author=El Intransigente|date=8 October 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Stern''' ({{Lang-he-n|דוד שטרן}}, 29 March 1910 – 13 February 2003) was an [[Israel]]i businessman and politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] between 1979 and 1981.

==Biography==
Stern was born in [[Suwałki]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (today in [[Poland]]) in 1910. During [[World War I]] his mother fled the Germans with him and his brother, [[Avraham Stern|Avraham]], and found refuge with her sister in [[Russia]]. Stern studied engineering in [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. He made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1935, and became a member of [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], of which Avraham was the leader.

He worked as a building contractor, and was president of the Building Contractors Association.

A member of the [[Herut]] central committee, he became a member of [[Tel Aviv]] city council in 1969. He was on the Likud list (an alliance of Herut and other right-wing parties) for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]], but failed to win a seat. However, he entered the Knesset on 18 June 1979 as a replacement for [[Shmuel Rechtman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexByKnesset_eng.asp?knesset=9 Knesset Members in the Ninth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; who had resigned his seat after failing in an appeal against a conviction for bribery. Stern lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]].

He died in 2003 at the age of 92.

'''Sir Ernest Oppenheimer''' (22 May 1880 – 25 November 1957) was a [[diamond]] and [[gold]] mining entrepreneur, [[financier]] and [[philanthropist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=YxH9CLm2K6sC|title=In Good Company: An Anatomy of Corporate Social Responsibility|last=Rajak|first=Dinah|date=2011-11-09|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804781619|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=YrPIDAAAQBAJ|title=Corporate Social Responsibility: Academic Insights and Impacts|last=Vertigans|first=Stephen|last2=Idowu|first2=Samuel O.|date=2016-08-02|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319350837|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernest-Oppenheimer|title=Sir Ernest Oppenheimer {{!}} South African industrialist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who controlled [[De Beers Consolidated Mines|De Beers]] and founded the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American Corporation]] of [[South Africa]].

==Career==
He was born in [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]], Germany, the son of Edward Oppenheimer, a [[cigar]] merchant. Oppenheimer began his working life at 17, when he entered Dunkelsbuhler &amp; Company, a diamond brokerage in [[London]]. His efforts impressed his employer and in 1902, at the age of 22, he was sent to South Africa to represent the [[company (law)|company]] as a buyer in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], where he eventually rose to the position of mayor.

He became great friends with William Lincoln Honnold, an American engineer and chairman of Transvaal Coal Trust, Brakpan Mines, Springs Mines and The New Era Company.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 1917, they launched the Anglo American Corporation with financial assistance from [[J. P. Morgan]]. The initial capital was £1 million. Half of the capital was subscribed in America and half in England and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Oppenheimer, R. B. Hagart, W. D. Wilson, Francis Whitmore, H. MacConachie, Dr. J. E. Holloway, ''[http://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/inventories/inv_pdfo/A1132/A1132-C450-001-jpeg.pdf Optima]'', September 1967 Volume seventeen number three, Commemorates the Fiftieth Anniversary of Anglo American Corporation September 25th 1967, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Ernest Oppenheimer managed to wrest control of Cecil Rhodes's De Beers empire and built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the world's diamond industry until his retirement.

He was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing, [[antitrust]] behaviour and an allegation of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raO8jHBdDhYC|title=Glitter &amp; Greed|author=Janine P.

He died in [[Johannesburg]] in 1957. He was born into a [[Jew]]ish family, but as an adult, he converted to [[Anglicanism]] and was buried at St George's Church, [[Parktown, Gauteng|Parktown]]. He was succeeded in the business by his son [[Harry Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer's brother, [[Bernard Oppenheimer|Sir Bernard Oppenheimer]], was also heavily involved in the diamond industry.

In 1964, the [[Oppenheimer Diamond]] was named in his honour by its owner, [[Harry Winston]], who donated the stone (not a [[Gemstone|gem]], as it remains uncut and unpolished) to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as a memorial.

'''Henry Adolph Frost''' (26 June 1844 – 21 July 1909) was a German-born saddler and businessman known for his association with the company which eventually produced the [[Holden]] automobile. His name may have been originally Heinrich Friedrich Adolphe Frost, but he evidently preferred "Adolph Frost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41029970 |title=Rhynie |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=XXX, |issue=6033 |location=South Australia |date=5 March 1866 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}} He is early referred to as "A. Frost", and later frequently as "H. Adolph Frost"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Adolph was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany the only son of Johann Joachim Domenicus ( John ) Frost ( 31 MAR 1813 - 14 Dec 1865) and his wife Catharina Maria Louisa Juncken (March 1821 – 11 February 1905), who emigrated to South Australia on the ''Steinwaerder'' (''Steinwärder'') from Hamburg, arriving on the 12th January 1849.

They settled at [[Lyndoch, South Australia|Lyndoch]], and on completion of his schooling learned the skills of the saddler, after which he followed his trade at [[Rhynie, South Australia|Rhynie]], then around 1869 to [[Port Wakefield, South Australia|Port Wakefield]] then [[Yorketown, South Australia|Yorketown]], where he ran a lucrative business, and for a time served as mayor.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88298261 |title=Death of Mr. H.

[[File:Holden &amp; Frost.jpg|thumb|Holden &amp; Frost, 100 Grenfell Street c. 1915]]
Around 1879 he moved to Adelaide to take a position with [[J. A. Holden]], who on 1 May 1884&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39819489 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=XXXIX, |issue=8590 |location=South Australia |date=28 May 1874 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; took him on as partner in J. A. Holden &amp; Co., which was in a precarious position financially. In August 1885 J. A. Holden sold to his son [[H. J. Holden]] and H. A. Frost his interest in the retail arm of the company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44949108 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=L, |issue=12,092 |location=South Australia |date=15 August 1885 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in November 1885 became '''Holden &amp; Frost'''. He sold the wholesale business and his Kensington Park mansion with its extensive grounds. Under the terms of the voluntary liquidation the company continued to operate in the premises at 100 Grenfell Street.

Under the new management the company progressed from the world of saddles and harness to motor vehicle bodies and upholstery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">The '''International Young Publisher of the Year''' is a British Council award programme, which has been developed with the support of the [[London Book Fair]]. It is targeted at [[publishing|publishers]] aged 25 to 35 from emerging economies. The winner receives a free exhibition stand at the next London Book Fair and a financial award. The winner then goes on to develop a publishing project between the UK and their country.

The final of the international competition with eight to ten participants is held every year to coincide with the London Book Fair. Finalists are selected in national competitions organised locally by the British Council's overseas offices.

The finalists take part in an industry tour, which familiarises them with the dynamics of the UK publishing sector and introduces them to leading players in the industry. The finalists develop a network between themselves and with their peers in the UK sector. The finalists are also asked to select works from their country, which they then present at a [[book pitch]] to an expert jury and the general public.

All the finalists have now formed an alumni network which pioneers the importance of [[social network|business networking]] internationally for young entrepreneurs in the publishing business.

In 2007, the award was renamed International Young Publishing Entrepreneur, as part of a rebranding which coincided with the launch of the final awards in the programme. The British Council's Young Creative Entrepreneur programme now has nine international awards: communications, design, fashion, interactive, music, performing arts, publishing, screen and visual arts.

==IYPY 2004==
Among finalists from [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Poland]], the inaugural IYPY finalists went on a tour of the UK publishing industry to [[London]], [[Cambridge]], [[Tiptree]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Hay-on-Wye]]. Mexican publisher Eduardo Rabasa of [[Editorial Sexto Piso]] was chosen as the inaugural winner. The award was presented by Jude Kelly, OBE, a British Council board member.

==IYPY 2005==
Finalists of the 2005 edition came from Argentina, [[Bulgaria]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], Poland, [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]], and Maria Deskur of [[Muchomor|Muchomor Publishers]] from Poland was chosen as the winner. Maria used her award to publish the teenage novel [[Operation Red Jericho]] by the British author [[Joshua Mowll]] in Polish. The award was presented by Lord Heseltine, of Haymarket Publishing.

==IYPY 2006==
In 2006 ten creative young publishers, from Argentina, [[Colombia]], [[Jordan]], Lebanon, Lithuania, Mexico, [[Oman]], [[Slovenia]], South Africa and Thailand, came to the UK to present their work to an international jury chaired by Simon Winder, Publishing Director at [[Penguin Press]]. Joanna El-Mir from Lebanese children's publisher was chosen as the winner. The award was presented by Alistair Burtenshaw, the Director of London Book Fair.

==IYPY 2007==
The 2007 event had finalists from Argentina, [[Egypt]], [[Hungary]], India, [[Malta]], Romania, Slovenia, South Africa and [[Syria]], and [[S. Anand]] of [[Navayana (publishing house)|Navayana Publishing]] in [[Chennai]], India was chosen as the winner. Anand leads the first independent imprint in India to deal exclusively with the issues of caste inequalities and identity politics. The event was preceded by a meeting of finalists from the previous editions, to officially form the IYPY alumni network. The award was presented by Liz Calder, Publishing Director of Bloomsbury.

==IYPE 2008==
The 2008 event had finalists from Argentina, Egypt, India, Lebanon, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, UAE and Yemen.For the first time, the award went to a book retailer, Nashwan Al-Maghafi, the Managing Director of Yemen Bookshop, a business that he established in 1995 when he was 19. The award was presented by Cherie Booth QC, the wife of the former British Prime Minister and a longstanding supporter of the programme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="563">'''''La règle de non-cumul''''' is a principle of [[French law]] which regulates whether an action should be brought under [[contract law]] (''la responsibilité civile'') or [[tort law]] (''la responsibilité delictuelle'').

It states that where there is a contract, an action can only be brought under contract law and when there is no contract an action can only be brought under tort law.

'''''Les Échos''''' is the first daily [[France|French]] financial [[newspaper]], edited in [[Paris]] since 1908.

==History and profile==
The paper was established as a monthly publication under the name of ''Les Échos de l’Exportation'' by the brothers Robert and [[Émile Servan-Schreiber]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="urlLes Echos vendus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/medias/les-echos-vendus-a-lvmh-la-tribune-a-news-participations-les-rachats-font-flores-dans-la-presse-economique_220423.html |title="Les Echos" vendus à LVMH, "La Tribune" à...

''Les Échos'' has a [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance and is published on weekdays.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Echos|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=1371|work=Euro Topics|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is headquartered in Paris and has a website which was launched in 1996.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Newspapers: First in a Series on the French Media|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2006/11/06PARIS7251.html|work=Wikileaks|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=6 November 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207141142/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2006/11/06PARIS7251.html|archivedate=7 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper publishes economical analyses by leading economists, including [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff]].&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Echos|url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-information/71401-les-echos|work=Vox Europ|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003 ''Les Échos'' switched from [[tabloid format]] to [[Berliner format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Size matters... if you are a Brit|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/516459/size-matters-brit|accessdate=23 February 2015|work=MediaWeek|date=13 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the newspaper won the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epica-awards.com/pages/pastresults2004_epicador_press.html|title=Epica d'Or 2004 (print)|year=2008|work=Epica Awards|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205095633/http://www.epica-awards.com/pages/pastresults2004_epicador_press.html|archivedate=5 December 2008|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the coverage of ''Les Échos'' was expanded to cover such topics as innovations in science, technologies, green growth, medicine and health and skills concerning marketing and advertising, management, education, strategy and leadership, law and finance.&lt;ref name=pub10&gt;{{cite news|title=Business daily Les Echos offers a new model with a new layout and expands its digital offer|url=http://www.publicitas.com/singapore/media-news-events/news-detail/?newsid=43070&amp;title=france-business-daily-les-echos-offers-a-new-model-with-a-new-layout-and-expands-its-digital-offer#.VHEGFVesUX4|accessdate=22 November 2014|work=Publicitas|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former separate sections of IT and communications were merged under the section of high tech and media.

In 2013 the newspaper started a project called LesEchos360, a business news aggregation platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rachel McAthy|title=France's Les Echos launching business news aggregation|url=https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/france-s-les-echos-launching-business-news-aggregation/s2/a553361/|work=Journalism|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Phooi Peck Lye''' (born 22 August 1962) is a Singaporean entrepreneur in the design industry. He is the founder and CEO of First Media Pte Ltd (FM), a holding company that manages a collection of design agencies and design institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmedia.com.sg Objective of First Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103022034/http://www.firstmedia.com.sg/ |date=3 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first business venture at the age of 27 was a design agency he started on his own with a capital of S$2,000. He called it Lancer Design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Swati |last=Chaudhary |title=First Media eyes more M&amp;As |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=18 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deriving the name Lancer from the word "freelancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rossara |last=Jamil |title=Visionary By Design |location = Singapore |work=Marketing Magazine |date= September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 32, he earned his first million.

In 2006, Phooi founded First Media Design School (FMDS), a progressive private educational institution specialising in the field of design. In August 2011, FMDS was awarded the Council for Private Education's (CPE) four-year EduTrust mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly |last=Tan |title=Surviving the school of hard knocks |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=1 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Phooi was born in Singapore. His father worked as a contractor for [[PSA International]] and his mother was a contract labourer. At the age of 9, he joined [[The Singapore Scout Association]](SSA) as a Sea Scout and at the age of 12, he became a qualified lifeguard.

Phooi attended his secondary school education from the age of 13 to 16 at [[Tanglin Secondary School]]. At the age of 24, he enrolled into a Fine Arts diploma program at the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]](NAFA), but switched to a Graphic Design pathway soon after. He graduated from NAFA in 1989 at the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rossara |last=Jamil |title=Visionary By Design |location = Singapore |work=Marketing Magazine |date= September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he graduated from the [[University of New South Wales]] with a Master of Design.

==Career==

===Lifeguard and swimming coach===
While waiting to be enlisted into the National Service, Phooi worked for a year as a lifeguard at Big Splash, a water theme park in Singapore that was launched in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyplaces.com/singapore/singapore_attraction.html Fun Days Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126133012/http://www.everyplaces.com/singapore/singapore_attraction.html |date=26 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he also taught swimming to a handful of students, aged between 6 and 10 years old, on a part-time basis.

While serving his term with the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], Phooi continued to coach swimming during his weekends to supplement his income. After his National Service term was completed, he started to teach on a full-time basis, only retiring from coaching at the age of 29.

Midway through his coaching career, Phooi embarked on a training program to attain the CLASS 1 Swimming Coach qualification. As part this program, he was attached to the [[People's Association]] swimming team, under the tutelage of the late Kee Soon Bee, a prolific national swimming coach. Kee was well known for being able to spot and groom
competitive national swimmers such as [[Junie Sng]], [[Mark Chay]] and [[Joscelin Yeo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsmuseum.com.sg/heroes/roll_of_honour/coach/kee_soon_bee.html KEE SOON BEE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226061611/http://www.sportsmuseum.com.sg/heroes/roll_of_honour/coach/kee_soon_bee.html |date=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designpreneur===
Phooi began his career as a designpreneur (entrepreneur in the design industry) by setting up Lancer Design in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cover Story: Mark Phooi |location = Singapore |work=The Executive |date=June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its early years, he was running the company as a one-man show, which meant that he had to adopt all the required roles to sustain his company, such as being the salesman, project coordinator, creative head, planner and administrator.

In 2002, Mark established First Media Pte Ltd (FM) as a holding company for his design firms and design schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Enterprise 50 Awards 2005 |location = Singapore |work=The Straits Times |date=24 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His design agencies specialised in various design and media disciplines, such as corporate design, interactive media, events, publishing and advertising and promotion. Companies under the First Media brand include Lancer Design and Mint Editions in Singapore, Brand Smart in China, Auromedia, Discover Jakarta and Imago in Indonesia, BnBc Advertising Sdn Bhd and BnBc Events and Promotions Sdn Bhd in Malaysia, Clever Brand Strategy Co. Ltd in Taiwan, and P.0.P. House in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmedia.com.sg First Media Companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103022034/http://www.firstmedia.com.sg/ |date=3 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, FM was one of only five recipients to receive the Enterprise 50 Award – an annual business award recognising Singapore's most promising privately held companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Swati |last=Chaudhary |title=First Media eyes more M&amp;As |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=18 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Mark was awarded one of the Top Entrepreneurs of the Year Awards (organised by the
Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) and the Rotary Club of Singapore) – one of the highest business award recognitions in Singapore, and one that no trained designer had ever attained previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cover Story: Mark Phooi |location = Singapore |work=The Executive |date=June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Mark was also selected as one of the finalists in Singapore's top design accolade – the President's Design Award.

===Principal===
In 2006, Mark founded First Media Design School (FMDS), a boutique private design institution that offers diploma, advanced diploma and degree programs in the areas [[Graphic design]], [[Multimedia]] and Fashion design. Its [[Bachelor's degree]] program is conferred by the [[University of the West of England]](UWE).

The institution's mission statement specifies that FMDS strives to cultivate a new generation of 'whole brain' trained, industry-ready designers who possess both creative and commercial cognitive abilities, through its holistic design thinking and design management teaching system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmedia.edu.sg/aboutus/visionmission.html Vision &amp; Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303042613/http://www.firstmedia.edu.sg/aboutus/visionmission.html |date=3 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its teaching methodology is partly derived from the [[Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument]] system.

The students enrolled in FMDS consist of a mixture of local and international students, mostly from Indonesia and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=U-wen |last=Lee |title=Designing a career |location = Singapore |work=Today |date=11 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FMDS equips career starters and career switchers with the necessary skills to go from mere practitioner to business-owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=U-wen |last=Lee |title=Designing a career |location = Singapore |work=Today |date=11 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2006, when Mark was asked about how he envisions FMDS to be different from other design schools in Singapore, he said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Swati |last=Chaudhary |title=First Media eyes more M&amp;As |location = Singapore |work=The Business Times |date=18 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We will differentiate ourselves by developing designers to become design managers. This is what is lacking in the industry today. There are many designers but not enough creative managers. We have thousands of graduates every year with few job opportunities. Not only will we create enterprising graduates, but we will also offer them jobs in our companies.}}

==Books==
In 2013, Mark co-authored ''[[Think like a Sage, Work like a Fool, Act like a Criminal]]'' ({{ISBN|978-981-07-5167-8}}), which consists of his biography, and a compilation of business theories, life lessons and personal reflections garnered from the early years of his career as a designpreneur to the present.

'''Maurits "Maup" Caransa''' (5 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 6 August 2009) was a Dutch businessman who became one of the most important real-estate developers in post-[[World War II]] [[Amsterdam]].  Caransa was the first well-known Dutch person to be kidnapped for ransom. Caransa owned and built many notable buildings in Amsterdam including the [[Maupoleum]] (now demolished) and the [[Caransa Hotel]] (still standing on the [[Rembrandtplein]]). He influenced the Amsterdam football club [[AFC Ajax]], through his friendship with its chairman, and by supporting the team and players financially.

==Biography==
Caransa was born on 5 January 1916 into a family of [[Sephardi Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/Stijl/nieuws/2009/8/Miljonair-Maurits-Maup-Caransa-93-overleden-ELSEVIER242973W/|title=Miljonair Maurits 'Maup' Caransa (93) overleden|last=Willems|first=Maartje|date=8 August 2009|work=[[Elsevier]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Amsterdam. He grew up poor, and had his first paying job at age 5. At age 16, according to a well-known story, he bought a wrecked car for one and a half [[Dutch guilder|guilder]]s, sold the parts for profit, then bought more cars.&lt;ref name=Verkerk/&gt;

===World War II===
During World War II, according to Frank Bovenkerk, emeritus professor of criminal science in Utrecht, Caransa, angered by the anti-Jewish violence of the NSB ([[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]]), joined one of the many ''knokploegen'', "assault groups" that in turn beat up on NSB members and especially members of the WA ([[Weerbaarheidsafdeling]]), the NSB's violent paramilitary wing. After the war, Caransa would not speak of these matters, saying it brought back too many painful memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websitevoordepolitie.nl/columns/caransa-461.html|title=Caransa|last=Bovenkerk|first=Frank|date= 9 Aug 2014| page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[February strike]] in response to Nazi pogroms, almost all of Caransa's family, including his brother Joel who lived next door to him, had already been arrested. His sister Femma managed to hide, while Maup himself reported at [[Westerbork transit camp]] after his parents were taken there. He spent a week with them but was let go, while his parents were deported to Germany.&lt;ref name=Pelt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onsamsterdam.nl/component/content/article/377-nummer-2-februari-2006?showall=1|title=Van autosloper tot vastgoedtycoon: Amsterdamse ondernemer Maup Caransa|last=Pelt|first=Wim|date=February 2006|work=[[Ons Amsterdam]]|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents and his three brothers died in [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name=Verkerk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4/AMSTERDAM/article/detail/257579/2009/08/08/Ten-Slotte-Maup-Caransa-1916---2009.dhtml|title=Ten Slotte Maup Caransa 1916 - 2009|last=Verkerk|first=Corrie|date=8 August 2009|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he married a Catholic woman in 1941 and did not appear stereotypically Jewish to the Nazis and their allies&lt;ref name=beth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethhaim.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cultuurhistorisch_Landpark_Beth-Haim_Plan_Kossman_deJong_lowres.pdf|title=Plan voor een nieuw educatief cultuurhistorisch landschapspark|publisher=[[Beth Haim of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel|Beth Haim]]|page=53|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraaf&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/20489814/__Caransa_dwong_geluk_af__.html|title=Caransa dwong geluk af|date=8 August 2009|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maup (Maurits) Caransa - van straatarm tot multimiljonair|url=http://www.joodsamsterdam.nl/perscaransamaup.htm|work=Joods Amsterdam|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he had blond, almost red hair and light-blue eyes&lt;ref name=Verkerk/&gt;), he was "destarred" after having agreed to [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilisation]].&lt;ref name=Pelt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joodsamsterdam.nl/strutrechtsedwarsstraat.htm|title=Utrechtsedwarsstraat|work=Joods Amsterdam|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He survived the war living in the [[Jodenbuurt (Amsterdam)|Jodenbuurt]], the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam; he and his sister were the family's only survivors.&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt;

===After the war: trade and real estate===
After the war he began a career as a [[military surplus]] trader ({{lang-nl|dumphandel}}), selling leftover material from British and US forces.&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt; In 1958, ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' described Caransa's stock in Amsterdam's Entrepot dock, listing hundreds of trucks, bulldozers, and other vehicles (to be shipped to Thailand, Singapore, and the Middle East) and five German [[E-boat]]s (for France and Spain).&lt;ref name=meneer/&gt; Caransa invested his profits in real estate,&lt;ref name=Meeus&gt;{{cite news| url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/binnenland/article2323270.ece/Zakenman_Maurits_Caransa_93_overleden| title=Maurits Caransa (1916-2009)|last=Meeus|first=Jan|date=8 August 2009|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when the dump trade fell flat he continued as a real-estate developer,&lt;ref name=Verkerk/&gt; becoming a millionaire.&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt; He owned the [[Schiller Hotel]], much of the [[Rembrandtplein]]&lt;ref name=meneer/&gt; (where he had [[Piet Zanstra]] build the Caransa Hotel), and had bought and sold the [[InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam|Amstel Hotel]] and the [[American Hotel, Amsterdam|Hotel Americain]]&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt;—he owned almost all of the luxury hotels in the city.&lt;ref name=Telegraaf/&gt; One of his treasured acquisitions was [[De Doelen (Amsterdam)|De Doelen]], another luxury hotel; as a child, when he was unable to fall asleep, his mother would tell him to "go sleep in De Doelen".&lt;ref name=Verkerk/&gt;

Toward the end of his life he had acquired many of the properties in the Jodenbuurt. He financed the building of the [[Maupoleum]] (also by Piet Zanstra), widely cited as ugly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rooijendijk|first=Cordula|title=That City is Mine!: Urban Ideal Images in Public Debates and City Plans, Amsterdam &amp; Rotterdam 1945-1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW9ZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA378|year=2005|publisher=AmsterdamP|isbn=9789056293826|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-archief/de-zwarte-madonna~a596822/|title=De Zwarte Madonna|last=Klerck|first=Hanneke de|date=8 February 2001|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoogstraten|first=Dorine van|year=1997|title=Bouwen in de binnenstad.

In the 1960s and 1970s Caransa was involved with the Amsterdam football club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. He was a close friend of Ajax chairman [[Jaap van Praag (sports director)|Jaap van Praag]], was often seen in the Ajax offices, and frequently traveled with the team, which he most likely supported financially—at the time Ajax was not as popular or rich as it later became. He was asked to take a financial interest in the team as well but apparently said there were too many amateurs in the organization. During Van Praag's chairmanship, however, Ajax grew and developed a reputation for success and wealth, for which Caransa's money, which supported the team and its players, was partly responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2009/augustus/Ajax-was-voor-Maup-Caransa-als-een-goede-familie.html|title=Ajax was voor Maup Caransa als een goede familie: Amsterdammer speelde belangrijke rol bij voetbalclub|last=Vooren|first=Jurryt van de|date=14 August 2009|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, the club, which has a number of nicknames including "Sons of the Gods",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perryman|first=Mark|title=Hooligan Wars: Causes and Effects of Football Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpzYlUPrKj0C&amp;pg=PT167|year=2013|publisher=Mainstream|isbn=9781780578132|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokvis|first=Ruud|title=Lege kerken, volle stadions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWmCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45|year=2014|publisher=Amsterdam UP|isbn=9789048521807|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was referred to as "Caransajax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldblatt|first=David|title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1158WHUTvwC&amp;pg=PA466|year=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=9781594482960|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping===
[[File:Graf Maurits Caransa.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Caransa's gravestone, with a memorial stone he had raised in remembrance of his family members who died in the Holocaust]]
In 1977, he was kidnapped on leaving the Continental Club after his customary weekly game of bridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0QdlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5HkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3812%2C6055779 |title=Nationwide Search Is On For Dutch Kidnap Victim |newspaper=[[Nashua Telegraph]] |date=October 29, 1977 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19771031&amp;id=cu9hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hpIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5049,9355755 |title=Caransa kidnap mystery continues |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=October 31, 1977 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and held for five days; he was released after a reported payment of ten million guilders in ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/55805267/ |title=Kidnap victim freed: $4 million ransom paid |newspaper=[[Pottstown Mercury]] |date=November 2, 1977 |page=7 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912015,00.html |title=Kidnaping: $4 Million Deal |newspaper=[[Time magazine|Time]] |date=November 14, 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers were never found.&lt;ref name=Verkerk/&gt;

Caransa was the first well-known Dutch person to be held for ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2009/augustus/De-ontvoering-van-Maup-Caransa.html|title=De ontvoering van Maup Caransa|date=8 August 2009|publisher=[[Geschiedenis 24]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his captivity, though, Caransa continued to negotiate: his kidnappers wanted 40&amp;nbsp;million, and he offered 300,000.&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt; The ten million was paid with marked money; by 2009, about a half a million guilders had been recovered. An Italian member of the Mafia was caught after depositing 480 of the 1000-guilder notes, but he refused to talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/article20489812.ece|title=Slechts half miljoen van het losgeld achterhaald|date=8 August 2009|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and death===
In November 1977 he opened a bridge tournament, one of the first public events after his release, and joked that two minutes of applause for him at the occasion was better than two minutes of silence. His love of bridge only became well publicized after the kidnapping; from 1971 to 1988 he sponsored bridge tournaments that brought the world's best players to Amsterdam, and he supported a semi-professional team for three years.&lt;ref name=meneer&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2664/Nieuws/article/detail/353068/2009/08/09/Meneer-Caransa-werd-ineens-Maupie-uit-Mokum.dhtml|title=Meneer Caransa werd ineens Maupie uit Mokum|last=Beusekamp|first=Willem|date=9 August 2009|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caransa's real estate company, the Caransa Group, is run by two of his grandchildren; the year before his death he ranked 186 on the list of the 500 richest Dutch people, with an estimated 161 million [[euro]]. He died in [[Vinkeveen]] on 6 August 2009,&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt; and was buried in the country's oldest Jewish cemetery, [[Beth Haim of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel|Beth Haim]] in [[Ouderkerk aan de Amstel]].&lt;ref name=beth/&gt;

The '''Monsanto Company''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|æ|n|t|oʊ}}) was an American [[agrochemical]] and [[agricultural biotechnology]] corporation that existed from 1901 until 2018 when it was acquired by [[Bayer]]. It was headquartered in [[Creve Coeur, Missouri|Creve Coeur]], [[Missouri]]. Monsanto developed [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]], a [[glyphosate]]-based [[herbicide]] in the 1970s, and became a major producer of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops.

Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants (1983),&lt;ref name="pbn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vib.be/en/about-vib/plant-biotech-news/Pages/The-race-towards-the-first-genetically-modified-plant.aspx|title=The race towards the first genetically modified plant|publisher=Plant Biotech News|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the first to conduct field trials of [[genetically modified crops]], (1987). It was one of the top 10 U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on [[biotechnology]]. Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the [[History of biotechnology#Biotechnology and industry|biotechnology industry]] business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Leonard-Barton, Gary P.

Monsanto's roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products and lobbying of government agencies and roots as a chemical company resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the [[insecticide]] [[DDT]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Agent Orange]] and [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[bovine somatotropin|bovine growth hormone]]. Its seed patenting model was criticized as [[biopiracy]] and a threat to [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Parsai"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2861063.ece|title=Opposition to Monsanto patent on Indian melons|last=Parsai|first=Gargi|date=February 5, 2012|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/nov/15/genetics2?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Biopirates who seek the greatest prizes|last=Vidal|first=John|date=November 15, 2000|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, [[Bayer]] announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion. After gaining US and EU regulatory approval, the sale was completed on June 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/bayer-closes-monsanto-deal-to-cap-63-billion-transformation|title=Bayer Closes Monsanto Deal to Cap $63 Billion Transformation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at [[Cefn Mawr]], Wales. The venture produced vanillin, [[aspirin]] and its raw ingredient [[salicylic acid]], and later [[rubber]] processing chemicals. In the 1920s, Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as [[sulfuric acid]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]. Queeny's son [[Edgar Monsanto Queeny]] took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in [[Illinois]] (now known as [[Sauget, Illinois|Sauget]]). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for Monsanto plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115984289083380869|title=Yes, in My Backyard: Tiny Sauget, Illinois, Likes Business Misfits|last=Spain|first=William|date=2006-10-03|work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Monsanto bought the [[Swann Chemical Company]] in [[Anniston, Alabama]], and thereby entered the business of producing [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]].&lt;ref name="CIA1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poisoned By PCBs: 'A Lack of Control'|url=http://www.chemicalindustryarchives.org/dirtysecrets/anniston/2.asp|website=Chemical Industry Archives|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Head|first1=Thomas R., III|title=PCBs—The Rise and Fall of an Industrial Miracle|journal=Natural Resources &amp; Environment|date=Spring 2005|page=18|url=http://www.americanbar.org/tools/digitalassetabstract.html/content/dam/aba/publishing/natural_resources_environment/environ_mo_premium_nr_nre_spring05_Head.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montague"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montague|first1=Peter|title=How We Got Here -- Part 1:  The History of Chlorinated Diphenyl (PCB's)|url=http://www.hudsonwatch.net/rachels01.html|website=HudsonWatch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Monsanto acquired Thomas &amp; Hochwalt Laboratories in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to acquire the expertise of [[Charles Allen Thomas]] and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became Monsanto's Central Research Department.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;Ralph Landau, [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4548&amp;page=338 "Charles Allen Thomas," ''Memorial Tributes''], vol. 2, National Academy of Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340–341}} Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951–1960) and Board Chair (1960–1965). He retired in 1970.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;David Bird, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/obituaries/charles-thomas-ex-chairman-of-monsanto.html "Charles Thomas, Ex-Chairman of Monsanto" (obituary)], ''The New York Times'', March 31, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, D.C., with [[Leslie Groves]], commander of the [[Manhattan Project]], and [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], president of [[Harvard University]] and chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC).&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;''Dayton Daily News''. September 18, 1983 [http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/building_the_bomb_in_oakw.html "Building the Bomb in Oakwood"].&lt;/ref&gt; They urged Thomas to become co-director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Robert Oppenheimer]], but Thomas was reluctant to leave Dayton and Monsanto.&lt;ref name="Building" /&gt; He joined the NDRC, and Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct related research.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey V.

==== Post-WWII====
In 1946, Monsanto developed and marketed "All" laundry detergent, which they sold to [[Lever Brothers]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published: September 15, 2003 |url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/unilever-lever-brothers/98749/ |title=Unilever (Lever Brothers Co.) &amp;#124; AdAge Encyclopedia of Advertising – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=September 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, its [[styrene]] factory was destroyed in the [[Texas City Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fire on the Grandcamp| url=http://www.texascity-library.org/disaster/first.php| publisher=Moore Memorial Public Library| location=Texas City, TX|date=n.d.|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Monsanto acquired American Viscose from [[Courtaulds]]. In 1954, Monsanto partnered with German chemical giant [[Bayer]] to form [[Mobay]] and market [[polyurethane]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Cynthia Day|title=Legal control of the multinational enterprise : national regulatory techniques and the prospects for international controls|date=1982|publisher=Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=9789024726684|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto began manufacturing [[DDT]] in 1944, along with some 15 other companies. This insecticide was critical to the fight against [[malaria]]-transmitting mosquitoes. Due to DDT's toxicity, it was banned in the United States in 1972. In 1977, Monsanto stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/about.htm Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)].

====1960s and 1970s====
In the mid‑1960s, [[William Standish Knowles]] and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize [[enantiomers]] via [[asymmetric hydrogenation]]. This was the first method for the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] production of pure [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Knowles. [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/knowles-lecture.pdf ASYMMETRIC HYDROGENATIONS]. Nobel Lecture, December 8, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles' team designed the "first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound"—[[L-dopa|L‑dopa]], which is used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yun |first=O. |date=November 22, 2005 |title=Profile of William S.

In the mid-1960s, chemists at Monsanto developed the [[Monsanto process]] for making [[acetic acid]], which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, Monsanto chemists invented [[AstroTurf]] (initially ChemGrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroturf.com/1964/06/|title=June - 1964 - AstroTurf|publisher=|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, Monsanto was a producer of [[Agent Orange]] for [[United States Armed Forces]] operations in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and settled out of court in a lawsuit brought by veterans in 1984.&lt;ref name="EncNatSec"&gt;"Agent Orange" entry in Encyclopedia of United States National Security, edited by Richard J. Samuel. SAGE Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|9781452265353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), using [[gallium arsenide]] [[phosphide]]. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards. The primary markets then were [[Calculator|electronic calculators]], [[Watch|digital watches]] and digital clocks.&lt;ref name="Schubert"&gt;{{Cite book|author=E. Fred Schubert|title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|chapter=1|isbn=978-0-8194-3956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto became a pioneer of [[optoelectronics]] in the 1970s. Between 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the [[PGA Tour]] event in Pensacola, Florida, which was renamed the [[Pensacola Open|Monsanto Open]].

In 1974, [[Harvard University]] and Monsanto signed a 10-year [[Medical research#Privately .28industry.29 funded biomedical research|research grant]] to support the cancer research of [[Judah Folkman]], which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit [[patent application]].&lt;ref name=NASbio&gt;Patricia K Donahoe.

====1980 to 1989: Becoming an agribiotech====
Monsanto scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983.&lt;ref name=pbn/&gt; Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of [[genetically modified crops]]. Increasing involvement in [[agricultural biotechnology]] dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as Monsanto's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involvement increased under the leadership of [[Robert B. Shapiro|Robert Shapiro]], appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1985, Monsanto acquired [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]], a [[life sciences]] company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for [[celecoxib|Celebrex]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/patexclnew.cfm?Appl_No=020998&amp;Product_No=003&amp;table1=OB_Rx Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations]. accessdata.fda.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5466823 |title=Patent US5466823 – Substituted pyrazolyl benzenesulfonamides – Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1998 became the first selective [[COX-2 inhibitor|COX‑2 inhibitor]] to be approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/98/20998.cfm |title=Drug Approval Package: Celebrex (Celecoxib) NDA# 20-998 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrex became a [[blockbuster drug]] and was often mentioned as a key reason for [[Pfizer]]'s acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Frank, Robert |author2=Hensley, Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Pfizer to Buy Pharmacia For $60 Billion in Stock|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1026684057282753560|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990 to 1999: Moving into the seed market &amp; industry consolidation====
In 1994, Monsanto introduced a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] version of [[bovine somatotropin]], brand-named Posilac.&lt;ref name = MG&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html | title = General information – Posilac| year = 2007 | publisher = Monsanto | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101123956/http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html| archivedate = January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto later sold this business to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].

In 1996, Monsanto purchased [[Agracetus]], the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which Monsanto had been licensing technology since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = WR Grace Sells Agracetus to Monsanto for $150M|url = http://www.biotechprofiles.com/companyfiles/madisonnetwork/c81a944349224f0984a586f89719edb6.pdf|date = April 8, 1996|publisher = W. R. Grace|via = BiotechProfiles&lt;!--http://www.biotechprofiles.com/companyprofile/Monsanto.aspx--&gt;&lt;!--found in archive.org--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto first entered the [[maize]] seed business when it purchased 40% of [[DEKALB Genetics Corporation|Dekalb]] in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite press release |title = Justice Department Approves Monsanto's Acquisition of Dekalb Genetics Corporation|date = November 30, 1998|url = http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/2103.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040218013852/http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/2103.htm|archivedate=February 18, 2004 |publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company first published an annual report citing Monsanto's Law, a biotechnological take on [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]], indicating its future directions and exponential growth in the use of biotechnology. In 1998, Monsanto purchased [[Cargill]]'s international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2005, it finalized the purchase of [[Seminis Inc]], a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monsanto closes $1.4 billion buy of Seminis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/03/21/daily37.html|accessdate=2018-01-06|work=St. Louis Business Journal|date=23 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it the world's largest conventional seed company.

In 1999 Monsanto sold off NutraSweet Co.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In December of the same year, Monsanto agreed to merge with [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]], in a deal valuing the transaction at $27 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deogun|first1=Nikhil|last2=Langreth|first2=Robert|last3=Burton|first3=Thomas M.|title=Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Monsanto Boards Approve $27 Billion Merger of Equals|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB945650774971796642|accessdate=2018-01-06|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the "new" Pharmacia; Monsanto's medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barboza|first1=David|title=Monsanto and Pharmacia to Join, Creating a Pharmaceutical Giant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/20/business/monsanto-and-pharmacia-to-join-creating-a-pharmaceutical-giant.html |accessdate=2018-01-06|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. Monsanto's goal was to obtain "a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/monsanto_to_acquire_emergent_genetics__stoneville_and_nexgen_cotton_brands-25250.html |title=Monsanto to Acquire Emergent Genetics, Stoneville and NexGen Cotton Brands |publisher=Seed Today |date=February 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015161004/http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/monsanto_to_acquire_emergent_genetics__stoneville_and_nexgen_cotton_brands-25250.html |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Glyphosate herbicides====
{{see also|Glyphosate}}

Following its 1970 introduction, Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. Glyphosate has since been marketed by many [[agrochemical]] companies, in various solution strengths and with various [[Agricultural spray adjuvant|adjuvants]], under dozens of tradenames.&lt;ref&gt;Farm Chemicals International [http://www.farmchemicalsinternational.com/crop-protection-database/#//product/brief/203900 Glyphosate entry in Crop Protection Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fruits/gapeach/pdf/mirror.pdf |title=Mirror or Mirror on the Wall Show Me the Best Glyphosate Formulation of All |author=Mitchem W |publisher=North Carolina State University Extension |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlISU Weed Science Online - Glyphosate - A Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeds.iastate.edu/mgmt/2001/glyphosate%20review.htm#Glyphosate%20Products |title=ISU Weed Science Online - Glyphosate - A Review |author=Hartzler B |format= |website= |publisher=Iowa State University Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weed Handbook Glyphosate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invasive.org/gist/products/handbook/14.Glyphosate.pdf |title=Glyphosate |vauthors=Tu M, Hurd C, Robison R, Randall JM |date=November 1, 2001 |format= |work=Weed Control Methods Handbook |publisher=The Nature Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14904184 |title=The debate over whether Monsanto is a corporate sinner or saint |date=November 19, 2009 |work=The Economist |accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's [[gross margin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/29/monsanto-potash-fertilizer-personal-finance-investing-ideas-agrium-mosaic.html |title= The Seeds Of A Monsanto Short Play | author= Cavallaro M |date=June 26, 2009 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crop seed====
{{see also|Hybrid seed|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}

As of 2015, Monsanto's line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.

==== Row crops ====
Many of Monsanto's agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to [[herbicide]]s, including glyphosate and [[dicamba]]. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds ''Roundup Ready''. Monsanto's introduction of this system (planting a glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together.&lt;ref name=HighPlainsJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=High Plains Journal |date=August 10, 2010 |author=Latzke, Jennifer M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.&lt;ref name=HighPlainsJ /&gt; Farmers widely adopted the technology—for example over 80% of maize ([[Mon 832]]), [[Roundup Ready soybean|soybean]] (MON-Ø4Ø32-6), cotton, [[sugar beet]] and [[canola]] planted in the United States are [[glyphosate]]-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready [[genetically modified wheat]] ([[MON 71800]]) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about the rejection of genetically modified (GM) wheat by foreign markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Person|first1=Daniel|title=Sale could change wheat industry: WestBred's owner Monsanto looks to develop 'genetically modified' varieties|url=http://missoulian.com/business/agriculture/sale-could-change-wheat-industry-westbred-s-owner-monsanto-looks/article_1db27912-ac3b-11de-8024-001cc4c002e0.html|website=Missoulian|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto invented and sells genetically modified seeds that make a crystalline insecticidal protein from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto's potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A0YyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4631,1776980&amp;dq=bacillus+thuringiensis+potato+1996+approved&amp;hl= Genetically Altered Potato Ok'd For Crops]
''Lawrence Journal-World'', May 6, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto subsequently developed [[Transgenic maize#Bt corn|Bt maize]] ([[MON 802]], [[MON 809]], [[MON 863]], [[MON 810]]), [[Genetically modified soybean|Bt soybean]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Crop Biotech Update |url=http://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=6565 |title=Monsanto's Bt Roundup Ready 2 Yield Soybeans Approved for Planting in Brazil – Crop Biotech Update (8/27/2010) &amp;#124; ISAAA.org/KC |publisher=Isaaa.org |date=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bt cotton]].

Monsanto produces seed that has multiple genetic modifications, also known as "stacked traits"—for instance, cotton that make one or more Bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate. One of these, created in collaboration with [[Dow Chemical Company]], is called [[SmartStax]]. In 2011 Monsanto launched the Genuity brand for its stacked-trait products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southeastfarmpress.com/agribusiness-monsanto-unveils-genuity-branding "Agribusiness: Monsanto unveils Genuity branding"]. ''SE Farm News'', March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the agricultural seed lineup included ''Roundup Ready'' alfalfa, canola and sugarbeet; Bt and/or ''Roundup Ready'' cotton; sorghum hybrids; soybeans with various oil profiles, most with the ''Roundup Ready'' trait; and a wide range of wheat products, many of which incorporate the nontransgenic "clearfield" imazamox-tolerant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agproducts.basf.us/products/clearfield-wheat.html |title=The CLEARFIELD Production System for Wheat|publisher=Agproducts.basf.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; trait from [[BASF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/monsanto-agricultural-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Agricultural Seeds |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids branded DroughtGard.&lt;ref&gt;OECD BioTrack Database. [http://www2.oecd.org/biotech/Product.aspx?id=MON-8746%C3%98-4 MON87460]&lt;/ref&gt; The MON 87460 trait is provided by the insertion of the cspB gene from the soil microbe ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''; it was approved by the USDA in 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/fedregister/BRS_20111227c.pdf Federal Register], Vol. 76, No. 248, December 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and by China in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eisenstein [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7468_supp/full/501S7a.html "Plant breeding: Discovery in a dry spell"] ''Nature'' 501, S7–S9 (26 September 2013) Published online September 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Xtend Crop System" includes seed genetically modified to be resistant to both glyphosate and [[dicamba]], and a herbicide product including those two active ingredients.&lt;ref name="XtendOfficial"&gt;[http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/roundup-ready-xtend-crop-system.aspx Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System] Accessed May 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the system was approved for use in the US.

===== India-specific issues =====
In 2009, Monsanto scientists discovered insects that had developed resistance to the [[Bt cotton|Bt Cotton]] planted in [[Gujarat]]. Monsanto communicated this to the Indian government and its customers, stating that "Resistance is natural and expected, so measures to delay resistance are important. Among the factors that may have contributed to [[pink bollworm]] resistance to the Cry1Ac protein in Bollgard I in Gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved Bt cotton seed, planted prior to GEAC approval of Bollgard I cotton, which may have had lower protein expression levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx|title=Monsanto ~ Cotton In India|date=November 3, 2008|publisher=Monsanto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of Bt cotton – Bolguard II – which had two resistance genes instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/06/stories/2010030664831400.htm|title=Bt cotton ineffective against pest in parts of Gujarat, admits Monsanto|date=March 6, 2010|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this advice was criticized: "an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it 'appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events [that is, the first-generation Bollgard I product] and promote double genes [the second generation Bollgard II] which would fetch higher price.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/12/stories/2010031263690900.htm|title=Monsanto 'admission' has business motives?|date=March 12, 2010|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto's GM cotton seed was the subject of NGO agitation because of its higher cost. Indian farmers crossed GM varieties with local varieties, using [[plant breeding]], violating their agreements with Monsanto.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab (June 17, 2003), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/science/nature/2998150.stm "India's GM seed Piracy"], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, high prices of Bt Cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of [[Jhabua]] district into debt when the crops died due to lack of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/25/stories/2009082554841400.htm|title=Jhabua on its way to becoming Vidarbha-II?|date=August 25, 2009|publisher=Hindu.com|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vegetables ====
In 2012 Monsanto was the world's largest supplier of non-GE vegetable seeds by value, with sales of $800M. 95% of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding. The company concentrates on improving flavor.&lt;ref name="wsj0612" /&gt; According to their website they sell "4,000 distinct seed varieties representing more than 20 species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/vegetable-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Monsanto Vegetable Seeds |publisher=Monsanto.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610041315/http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/vegetable-seeds.aspx |archivedate=June 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Broccoli, with the brand name ''Beneforté'', with increased amounts of [[glucoraphanin]] was introduced in 2010 following development by its [[Seminis]] subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/01/new-monsanto-vegetables/|title=Monsanto is going organic in a quest for the perfect veggie|journal=Wired|year=2015|author=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AFACT stated that "absence" labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior.&lt;ref name = "nytimes milk label" /&gt;

===Uncommericalized products===
Monsanto also developed notable technologies that were not ultimately commercialized.

===="Terminator" seeds====
{{Main article|Genetic use restriction technology}}

Genetic use restriction technology, colloquially known as "terminator technology", produces plants with sterile seeds. This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild. It also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest, requiring them to purchase seed for every planting, allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology. Farmers have been buying [[hybrid seed]]s for generations, instead of replanting their harvest, because second-generation hybrid seeds are inferior. Nevertheless, most seed companies contract only with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds.

Terminator technology has been developed by governmental labs, university researchers and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngin.tripod.com/353.htm |title=RAFI on new Terminator patent |publisher=Ngin.tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=gm-104#gm-104 |title=Context of 'July 20, 1999: USDA and Delta &amp; Pine Land Secure New Patent for Improvements in Terminator Genetic Seed Sterilization Technology' |publisher=Historycommons.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warwick Terminator"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Hugh |last=Warwick |editor-last=Wijeratna |editor-first=Alex |editor2-last=Meienberg |editor2-first=François |editor3-last= Meienberg |title = Syngenta – Switching off farmers' rights? |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date=October 2000 |url = http://www.fao.org/righttofood/KC/downloads/vl/docs/AH428.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512172032/http://www.fao.org/righttofood/KC/downloads/vl/docs/AH428.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology has not been used commercially.&lt;ref name="monsanto pledge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/terminator-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Is Monsanto Going to Develop or Sell "Terminator" Seeds? |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banterminator.org/The-Issues/Introduction |title=Introduction / The Issues / |publisher=Ban Terminator |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors that Monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology caused protests, for example in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/465969.stm |work=BBC News |title=Farmers welcome halt of 'terminator' |date=October 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/doc/RHerring.pdf |title=CAS 38-4 24 Oct 2006.vp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531024738/http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/doc/RHerring.pdf |archivedate=May 31, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and litigation ==
{{Main article|Monsanto legal cases}}Monsanto is internationally notable for its involvement in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It defended lawsuits mostly over its products' health and environmental effects. Monsanto used the courts to enforce its patents, particularly in agricultural [[biotechnology]], an approach similar to that of other companies in the field, such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Dupont Pioneer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/93431968/Pioneer-Hi-Bred-International-v-Does-1-5|title=Pioneer Hi Bred International v.

===Argentina===
Argentina approved ''Roundup Ready'' soy in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 soy production grew from 14 million acres to 42 million acres. The growth was driven by Argentine investors' interest in export markets.&lt;ref name="SoyRepublic"&gt;[http://www.towardfreedom.com/32-archives/environment/1600-the-soy-republic-of-argentina The Soy Republic of Argentina]. Towardfreedom.com (September 2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation led to a decrease in production of many staples such as [[milk]], [[rice]], [[maize]], [[potato]]es and [[lentils]]. As of 2004 about 150,000 small farmers had left the countryside; including 50% as of 2009 in the Chaco region.&lt;ref name="SoyRepublic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianArgentina"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/apr/16/gm.food GM soya 'miracle' turns sour in Argentina]. ''The Guardian'' (April 16, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Reboratti (2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130606074701/http://www.geo.puc.cl/html/revista/PDF/RGNG_N45/art05.pdf "A sea of soybean: Consequences of the new agriculture in Argentina (Un mar de soja: La nueva agricultura en Argentina y sus consecuencias)"]. [[Norte Grande Geography Journal]] Revista de geografía Norte Grande 45: 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a Monsanto representative had said, "any problems with GM soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture, not because it was GM. If you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems."&lt;ref name="GuardianArgentina" /&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, Monsanto attempted to enforce its patents on soymeal imported into Spain from Argentina by having Spanish customs officials seize the soymeal shipments. This has been an attempt made by Monsanto to put pressure on the Argentinian government for allowing them to enforce their seed patents in Argentina as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cropchoice.com/leadstrygmo013106.html Seeds of conflict take root in debate over Michigan farming bill]. Cropchoice.com, January 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 environmentalist groups objected to a Monsanto corn seed conditioning facility in [[Malvinas Argentinas, Córdoba]]. Neighbours objected to the risk of environmental impact. Court rulings supported the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/monsanto-podra-continuar-con-obra-civil-pero-no-con-operativa|title=Monsanto podrá continuar con obra civil pero no con operativa|date=April 23, 2013|publisher=La Voz|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but environmentalist groups organised demonstrations and opened an online petition for the subject to be decided in a popular [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argenpress.info/2013/12/monsanto-contamina-el-medio-ambiente-y.html|title=Monsanto contamina el medio ambiente y también la democracia|author=Marín|first=Emiliom|date=December 2, 2013|website=|publisher=Argenpress.info|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rulings stipulated that while construction could continue, the facility could not begin operating until the [[environmental impact report]] required by law had been duly presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/ratifican-que-monsanto-podra-continuar-con-la-obra-civil|title=Ratifican que Monsanto podrá continuar con la obra civil|date=October 10, 2013|publisher=La Voz|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Monsanto reached an agreement with Argentina's government on soybean seed royalty payments. Monsanto agreed to give the Argentine Seed Institute (Inase) oversight over crops grown from Monsanto's Intacta genetically modified soybean seeds. Before the agreement, Argentine farmers generally avoided royalties by using seeds from previous harvests or purchased from non-registered suppliers. Inase agreed to delegate testing to grain exchanges. About 6 million sample tests were to be conducted annually. Seeds that appear to be GMOs may be tested again using a [[polymerase chain reaction]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-14/monsanto-argentina-seed-pact-said-to-become-effective-next-week|title=Monsanto-Argentina Seed Pact Said to Become Effective Next Week|last=Gonzalez|first=Pablo Rosendo|date=2016-06-14|work=|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-12-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the second largest producer of GMO soy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/Politics/superpower082205.php|title=The High Costs of Brazil Turning into an Agro-Export Superpower|last=Chu|first=Henry|last2=Hirsh|first2=Jerry|date=21 August 2005|website=www.organicconsumers.org|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding soy cultivation led to large-scale deforestation and displacement of small-scale rural farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/monsantos-gm-soybeans-drive-toxics-deforestation-and-social-conflict-latin-america|title=Monsanto's GM Soybeans Drive Toxics, Deforestation, and Social Conflict in Latin America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]] approved GM crops in 1998, but advocacy groups successfully sued to overturn the approval.&lt;ref name="EconomistBrazil"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/2102001 "GM crops in Brazil: An amber light for agri-business"]. ''The Economist'' (October 2, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Brazil allowed a one-year exemption when GM soy was found in fields planted in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].&lt;ref name="EconomistBrazil" /&gt; This was a controversial decision, and in response, the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] protested by invading and occupying several Monsanto farm plots used for research, training and seed-processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/2961284.stm Americas | Brazil activists target Monsanto]. BBC News (June 3, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Brazil passed a law creating a regulatory pathway for GM crops. Agriculture minister Roberto Rodrigues stated, "Brazilian soy farmers, who have used cloned or smuggled versions of the biotechnology company's Roundup Ready variety for years, will no longer have to worry about breaking the law or facing legal action from Monsanto as long as regulators approve the seeds for planting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/13773 "Brazil Approves Law to Legalize Genetically Modified Crops"].

===China===
Monsanto was criticized by [[China|Chinese]] economist [[Larry Hsien Ping Lang|Larry Lang]] for controlling the Chinese soybean market, and for trying to do the same to Chinese corn and cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class4/201001/128373.html |title=郎咸平：孟山都的转基因帝国-大豆、玉米与棉花 |publisher=Wyzxsx.com |date=January 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328142034/http://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class4/201001/128373.html |archivedate=March 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{main article|Farmers' suicides in India}}
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, public attention was drawn to suicides by indebted farmers following crop failures.&lt;ref name=FrontLine&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2005/07/seeds_of_suicid.html FRONTLINE/WORLD. Rough Cut. Seeds of Suicide]. PBS (July 26, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the early 2000s, farmers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] (AP) were in economic crisis due to high-interest rates and crop failures, leading to widespread unrest and farmer suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3855517.stm | work=BBC News | title=India PM pledge over suicide farmers | date=July 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto was one focus of protests with respect to the price and yields of Bt seed. In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu Business Line. May 26, 2005 [http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-agri-biz-and-commodity/nuziveedu-launches-bt-cotton-strains/article2178519.ece Nuziveedu launches Bt cotton strains]&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling Bt cotton seed, because Monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide pay about Rs 4.5 crore (about one million US$) to indebted farmers in some districts, and because the government blamed Monsanto's seeds for crop failures.&lt;ref name="Andra Uproots"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Angry Andhra uproots Monsanto |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/angry-andhra-uproots-monsanto/139771/0 |work=financialexpress.com |location=Hyderabad |date=June 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was later lifted.

In 2006, AP tried to convince Monsanto to reduce the price of Bt seeds.

==== PCBs ====
In the late 1960s, the Monsanto plant in [[Sauget, Illinois]], was the nation's largest producer of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which remained in the water along Dead Creek there. An EPA official referred to Sauget as "one of the most polluted communities in the region" and "a soup of different chemicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06276/727066-28.stm |title=Tiny Sauget, Illinois, likes business misfits |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=October 3, 2006 |first=William |last=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anniston, Alabama]], plaintiffs in a 2002 lawsuit provided documentation showing that the local Monsanto factory knowingly discharged both [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and PCB-laden waste into local creeks for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Monsanto Hid Decades Of Pollution|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0101-02.htm|work=Washington Post| first=Michael| last=Grunwald| date=January 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 Monsanto dumped 45 tons of PCBs into Snow Creek, a feeder for Choccolocco Creek, which supplies much of the area's drinking water, and buried millions of pounds of PCB in open-pit landfills located on hillsides above the plant and surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= PCB Pollution Suits Have Day in Court in Alabama |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EED7143AF934A15752C0A9649C8B63|work=The New York Times| first=Kevin | last=Sack | date=January 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003, [[Solutia]] and Monsanto agreed to pay plaintiffs $700 million to settle claims by over 20,000 Anniston residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=$700 million deal announced in Anniston PCBs cases|date=August 19, 2003|url=http://www.ewg.org/node/15673|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Polluted sites ====
As of November 2013, Monsanto was associated with nine "active" [[Superfund]] sites and 32 "archived" sites in the US, in the EPA's Superfund database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/srchsites.cfm EPA superfund search engine] Search for "Monsanto" in "Alias/Alternative Site Name" field, first in "active" sites, then "archived" sites, October 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto was sued and settled multiple times for damaging the health of its employees or residents near its Superfund sites through pollution and poisoning.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-338869.html |title=Monsanto Held Liable For PCB Dumping | work=The Washington Post |date=February 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalindustryarchives.org/dirtysecrets/annistonindepth/toxicity.asp "The Inside Story: Anniston, AL In-depth: Monsanto knew about PCB toxicity for decades"].

==== GM wheat ====

In 2013 a Monsanto-developed strain of [[glyphosate]]-resistant [[genetically modified wheat|wheat]] (a GMO) was discovered on a farm in Oregon, growing as a weed or [[volunteer (botany)|"volunteer plant"]]. The final Oregon field test had occurred in 2001. As of May 2013, the GMO seed source was unknown. Volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and was not found to be glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto faced penalties up to $1 million over potential violations of the [[Plant Protection Act]]. The discovery threatened world-leading US wheat exports, which totaled $8.1 billion in 2012.&lt;ref name="BloombergWheat"&gt;Alan Bjerga, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-29/monsanto-modified-wheat-unapproved-by-usda-found-in-oregon-field.html "Monsanto Modified Wheat Not Approved by USDA Found in Field"], ''Bloomberg News''.

Monsanto said it had destroyed all the material it held after completing trials in 2004 and it was "mystified" by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23638-monsanto-modified-wheat-mystery-deepens-in-oregon.html|title=Monsanto modified wheat mystery deepens in Oregon |author=Andy Coghlan|publisher=New Scientist|date=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, 2013, the USDA announced: "As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm.

==== Cancer risks of Roundup ====

Monsanto has faced controversy in the United States over claims that its herbicide products might be carcinogens. There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, as in agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening.&lt;ref name=cruk&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cancer Research UK| title=Food Controversies&amp;mdash;Pesticides and organic foods|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/food-controversies#food_controversies4 |date=2016 |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scientific consensus|consensus]] among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ibrahim |first1=Yehia A |title=A regulatory perspective on the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Health |date=2015 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1 |doi=10.7243/2056-3779-2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarazona&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tarazona |first1=Jose V. |last2=Court-Marques |first2=Daniele |last3=Tiramani |first3=Manuela |last4=Reich |first4=Hermine |last5=Pfeil |first5=Rudolf |last6=Istace |first6=Frederique |last7=Crivellente |first7=Federica |title=Glyphosate toxicity and carcinogenicity: a review of the scientific basis of the European Union assessment and its differences with IARC |journal=Archives of Toxicology |date=3 April 2017 |volume=91 |issue=8 |pages=2723–2743 |doi=10.1007/s00204-017-1962-5 |pmid=28374158 |pmc=5515989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], [[European Commission]], Canadian [[Pest Management Regulatory Agency]], and the German [[Federal Institute for Risk Assessment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The BfR has finalised its draft report for the re-evaluation of glyphosate - BfR| accessdate = 2018-08-18| url = https://www.bfr.bund.de/en/the_bfr_has_finalised_its_draft_report_for_the_re_evaluation_of_glyphosate-188632.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or [[genotoxic]] risk to humans.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"/&gt; Only one international scientific organization, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), affiliated with the WHO, has made claims of carcinogenicity in research reviews. The IARC has been criticized for its assessment methodology by failing to consider the broad literature and only assessing [[hazard]] rather than [[Risk#Health, safety, and environment|risk]].&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"/&gt;

Over 8,000 cancer patients are suing Monsanto in numerous state courts for failure to warn the public about the risk of cancer associated with the [[glyphosate]]-based weedkiller Roundup after the IARC report in 2015 linking glyphosate to cancer in humans.&lt;ref name="8K Roundup lawsuits"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bayer's Monsanto faces 8,000 lawsuits on glyphosate |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuits/bayers-monsanto-sued-by-8000-plaintiffs-on-glyphosate-idUSKCN1L81J0 |newspaper=Reuters |accessdate=11 September 2018|date=2018-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureonWHO2015&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Daniel | last1 = Cressey | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nature.com/news/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer-1.17181 | title = Widely used herbicide linked to cancer | journal = Nature | date = March 25, 2015 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2015.17181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IARC Mono 112"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://monographs.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mono112.pdf|title=IARC Monographs, Volume 112.

In March 2017, 40 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit at the Alameda County Superior Court, a branch of the California Superior Court, asking for damages caused by the company’s glyphosate-based weed-killers, including Roundup, and demanding a jury trial.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Breitler|first1=Alex|title=SJ, Lode residents among those suing Monsanto claiming Roundup linked to cancer|url=http://www.recordnet.com/news/20170327/sj-lode-residents-among-those-suing-monsanto-claiming-roundup-linked-to-cancer|accessdate=2017-04-25|publisher=''The Stockton Record''|date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2018, Monsanto lost the first decided case. Dewayne Johnson, who has [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma|non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], was initially awarded $289 million dollars in damages after a jury in San Francisco said that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide, but the award pending appeal was later reduced to $78.5 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monsanto appeals Roundup cancer verdict |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-11-monsanto-appeals-roundup-cancer-verdict.html |publisher=Phys.org |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC7"&gt;{{cite web |title=Roundup maker Monsanto appeals $78.5 million verdict over Bay Area man's cancer |url=https://abc7news.com/society/roundup-maker-monsanto-appeals-$785-million-verdict-over-bay-area-mans-cancer/4728882/ |website=ABC7 San Francisco |accessdate=30 November 2018 |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, Monsanto appealed the judgement asking an appellate court to consider a motion for a new trial.&lt;ref name="ABC7"/&gt;

===Improper accounting for incentive rebates ===
From 2009 to 2011, Monsanto improperly accounted for incentive rebates. The actions inflated Monsanto's reported profit by $31 million over the two years. Monsanto paid $80 million in penalties pursuant to a subsequent settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|US Securities and Exchange Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/business/for-monsanto-whistle-blower-a-22-million-award-that-fell-short.html|title=Monsanto Whistle-Blower: $22 Million Richer, but Not Satisfied|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|date=2016-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings in response to losing market share of Roundup to generic producers.

===Alleged ghostwriting controversy===

A review of glyphosate's carcinogenic potential by four independent expert panels, with a comparison to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] assessment, was published in September 2016. Using emails released in August 2017 by plaintiffs' lawyers who are suing Monsanto, ''[[Bloomberg Business Week]]'' reported that "Monsanto scientists were heavily involved in organizing, reviewing, and editing drafts submitted by the outside experts." A Monsanto spokesperson responded that Monsanto had provided only non-substantive cosmetic copyediting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsanto Was Its Own Ghostwriter for Some Safety Reviews|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/monsanto-was-its-own-ghostwriter-for-some-safety-reviews|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto made political contributions of $186,250 to federal candidates in the 2008 election cycle through its [[political action committee]] (PAC) (42% to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 58% to [[Republican Party (USA)|Republicans]]) and  $305,749 in the 2010 election cycle (48% Democrat, 52% Republicans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strID=C00042069 2008 PAC Summary Data], ''Open Secrets.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, [[WikiLeaks]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; documents suggested that US diplomats in Europe responded to a request for help from the Spanish government.

Monsanto was a member of [[EuropaBio]], the leading biotechnology trade group in Europe. One of EuropaBio's initiatives is "Transforming Europe's position on GM food".

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Monsanto donated $255,000 for disaster relief&lt;ref name=SeedDaily&gt;[http://www.seeddaily.com/reports/Haitian_farmers_protest_Monsanto_seed_donations_999.html Haitian farmers protest Monsanto seed donations], Hinche, Haiti (AFP) June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 60,000 seed sacks (475 tons) of hybrid (non-GM) corn and vegetable seeds worth $4 million.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Jonathan M. |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FMUQN80.htm |title=Monsanto gives Haiti $4 million in hybrid seeds |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Catholic Relief Services]] (CRS) rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the five most common food security crops found that the Haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds be introduced only on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151257/http://oneresponse.info/Disasters/Haiti/Agriculture/publicdocuments/CRS.%20Rapid%20Seed%20Assessment.%20Mars-10.pdf "A Rapid Seed Assessment in the Southern Department of Haiti."] Catholic Relief Services, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuel Prophete, head of Haiti's Ministry of Agriculture's Service National Semencier (SNS), stated that SNS was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because they at least double yields. Louise Sperling, Principal Researcher at the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) told HGW that she was not opposed to hybrids, but noted that most hybrids required extra water and better soils and that most of Haiti was not appropriate for hybrids.

Activists objected that some of the seeds were coated with the [[fungicide]]s Maxim or [[thiram]]. In the United States, [[pesticide]]s containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not have adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1009J9G.PDF US EPA: Pesticides – RED Facts Thiram].

The donated seeds were sold at a reduced price in local markets.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek /&gt; However, farmers feared that they were being given seeds that would "threaten local varieties"&lt;ref name=SeedDaily /&gt; and an estimated 8,000–12,000 farmers attended a protest of the donation on June 4, 2010, organized by a Haitian farmers' association, the Peasant Movement of Papay, where a small pile of seeds was symbolically burned.&lt;ref name=Epoch&gt;{{cite news |title=Haiti GM food aid is a 'trojan horse' |author=Skorbach, Kristina |url=http://epoch-archive.com/a1/en/ie/nnn/2010/06-June/24/ET220610005.pdf |newspaper=The Epoch Times |date=June 24 – July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] approved new listing requirements for both, which were influenced by NACD’s recommendations.

The ten core recommendations are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Boards should be composed of a substantial majority of [[Non-executive director|independent directors]]. At a minimum, these directors should meet the definition of “independent director” as defined under relevant SRO standards, although boards may consider adopting even more stringent standards of independence. Furthermore, boards should formulate and adhere to clear conflict of interest policies applicable to all board members.
* Boards should require that key committees—including but not limited to audit, compensation, and governance/nominating—be composed entirely of independent directors, and are free to hire independent advisors as necessary.
* Each key committee should have a board-approved written charter detailing its duties. [[Audit committee]] duties, at a minimum, should include two key elements: a) oversight of the quality and integrity of [[financial reports]] and the process that produces them; b) oversight of the management of risk. Compensation committee duties should include performance goals that align the pay of managers with the long-term interests of shareholders. Governance/nominating committee duties should include setting board and committee performance goals and nominating directors and committee members with the qualifications and time to meet these goals.
* Boards should consider formally designating an independent director as chairman or lead director. If they do not make such a designation, they should designate, regardless of title, an independent member to lead the board in its most critical functions, including setting board agendas with the CEO, evaluating CEO and board performance, holding executive sessions, and anticipating and responding to corporate crises.
* Boards should regularly and formally evaluate the performance of the CEO, other senior managers, the board as a whole, and individual directors. Independent directors should control the methods and criteria for this evaluation.
* Boards should review the adequacy of their companies’ [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] and reporting systems at least annually. In particular, boards should ensure that management pays strict attention to ethical behavior and compliance with laws and regulations, approved auditing and accounting principles, and with internal governing documents. In addition to meeting the current requirements for disclosure of management compensation, boards should disclose the total value of each director’s compensation, including the value of any stock options or grants awarded during the year.
* Boards should adopt a policy of holding periodic sessions of independent directors only. These meetings should provide board and committee members the opportunity to react to management proposals and/or actions in an environment free from formal or informal constraints.
* [[Audit committee]]s should meet independently with both the internal and [[Auditor independence|independent auditors]].
* Boards should be constructively engaged with management to ensure the appropriate development, execution, monitoring, and modification of their companies’ strategies. The nature and extent of the board’s involvement in [[Strategic management|strategy]] will depend on the particular circumstances of the company and the industry or industries in which it is operating.
* Boards should provide new directors with a director orientation program to familiarize them with their companies’ business, industry trends, and recommended governance practices. Boards should also ensure that directors are continually updated on these matters.

The '''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium''' (NCOIC) is an international not-for-profit, chartered in the United States, whose goal is to facilitate the adoption of [[cross-domain interoperability]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, H. [http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/09/30/interoperability-efforts-bear-fruit.aspx "NCOIC's efforts toward product interoperability are showing promise"], ''Washington Technology'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Formed in September 2004, the organization is composed of more than 50 members and advisors representing business,  government organizations and academic institutions in 12 countries.&lt;ref&gt;ASDNews, [http://www.asdnews.com/news-1619/Network_Centric_Operations_Industry_Consortium_-NCOIC-_Launch.htm "Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium -NCOIC- Launch"], ''Aerospace &amp; Defense News'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

NCO is the application of the fundamental tenets of network-centric warfare to aspects of national security, especially industry support for the missions of both the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS). NCOIC does not only subscribe to the military use of this theory, but also works to apply NCO and interoperability across nations and industries, including emergency response, health care, [[aerospace]], [[information technology]] cyber security &amp; [[cloud computing]], energy and financial services.

NCOIC’s technical teams have developed resources to further the use of network-centric systems and interoperability in both the public and private sectors. These resources – including processes, tools, frameworks, patterns, principles and databases—are available free of charge on the NCOIC website. They are aimed at helping an organization lower engineering costs, speed program implementation, increase capability and reduce risk. The consortium also provides training and services such as interoperability demonstrations, acquisition strategies, evaluations and verification.

NCOIC focuses on four interdependent areas in identifying solutions that will enable cross-domain interoperability: business, culture, governance and technical. The interaction, influence and impact of factors—such as financial objectives, business goals, laws and regulations, and cultural considerations – are all taken into account when planning and/or implementing technology change.

==Key Technical Resources==

'''Pierre Bellanger''' (born 1958) is founder and CEO of [[Skyrock (radio)|Skyrock]], a French commercial radio station, and founder of [[skyrock (social network site)|skyrock.com]], a French-language social network.

== Biography ==
Bellanger created Skyrock in 1985 as a national FM station in France. Today, it ranks as the country's most popular radio station among 13- to 24-year-olds, with four million listeners each day.

As a biology student in late 1970s Paris, Bellanger participated in the [[Pirate radio|free radio]] movement that helped to topple the state's monopoly on broadcasting. Since then, as an entrepreneur in media and Internet, he has created a TV station, several radio stations, as well as numerous cable and satellite services. His interactive experience began in the mid-1980s with the [[Minitel]] and phone services. His first Internet company was created in 1994 as a joint venture with France Telecom.

Bellanger is the author of two books: ''The Future of Radio'' (1992) and ''La convergence, c'est le code''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyrock.fm/bellanger/la_convergence_c_est_le_code.pdf La convergence, c'est le code]&lt;/ref&gt; (2003). In 2006, the French Ministry of Culture and Communication named him to the Counsel for Strategic Analysis of Cultural and Communications Industries.

In 2004, Bellanger helped to spearhead the French government's introduction of the Dispositif Alerte-Enlèvement, modeled on the North American [[AMBER Alert]] systems.

'''Preference regression''' is a statistical technique used by marketers to determine consumers’ [[Preference|preferred]] core benefits. It usually supplements  [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]] techniques like [[multi dimensional scaling (in marketing)|multi dimensional scaling]] or [[factor analysis]] and is used to create ideal vectors on [[perceptual mapping|perceptual maps]].

==Application==
Starting with raw data from surveys, researchers apply positioning techniques to determine important dimensions and plot the position of competing [[product (business)|products]] on these dimensions. Next they [[regression analysis|regress]] the survey data against the dimensions. The independent variables are the data collected in the survey. The dependent variable is the preference datum. Like all regression methods, the computer fits weights to best predict data. The resultant regression line is referred to as an ideal vector because the slope of the vector is the ratio of the preferences for the two dimensions.

If all the data is used in the regression, the program will derive a single equation and hence a single ideal vector. This tends to be a blunt instrument so researchers refine the process with [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]]. This creates clusters that reflect [[market segment]]s. Separate preference regressions are then done on the data within each segment. This provides an ideal vector for each segment.

==Alternative methods==
[[Self-stated importance method]] is an alternative method in which direct survey data is used to determine the weightings rather than statistical imputations. A third method is [[conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]] in which an additive method is used.

'''Proteolix, Inc.''', was a private [[biotechnology]] company with headquarters in [[South San Francisco]], [[California]].  Proteolix was founded in 2003 based on technology developed by co-founders [[Craig M. Crews|Dr. Craig Crews]] (Yale University) and Dr. Raymond J. Deshaies (California Institute of Technology). Drs. Susan Molineaux and Phil Whitcome (deceased) joined Drs. Crews and Deshaies as co-founders. Proteolix was launched based on an $18.2 million A round comprising investments by Latterell Venture Partners, US Venture Partners, Advanced Technology Ventures, and The Vertical Group. Proteolix focused primarily on the [[proteasome]] as a therapeutic target.  Its lead product candidate, [[carfilzomib]] (PR-171), is a [[tetrapeptide]] [[epoxyketone]].  At the time of its sale (see below), the company had two earlier-stage programs, an orally-bioavailable proteasome inhibitor for oncology (PR-047), and an agent preferentially targeting the immuno form of the proteasome (PR-957), with potential utility in areas such as rheumatoid arthritis.  At the time of sale, Carfilzomib's route of administration was [[intravenous]], and the company was exploring its potential utility in [[multiple myeloma]], [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL) and other cancers.  

Proteolix was acquired by [[Onyx Pharmaceuticals]] in 2009 for $810 million (nominal value).  Onyx renamed PR-047 to "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065128/http://www.onyx-pharm.com/clinical-development/onx-091 ONX 0912]" and PR-957 to "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065128/http://www.onyx-pharm.com/clinical-development/onx-091 ONX 0914]".

'''Reach Limited''' is a Bermuda-incorporated holding company. It is a joint venture of [[Telstra]] and [[PCCW]]. Reach, headquartered in [[Hong Kong]], has interests in more than 40 submarine cables (including [[Australia–Japan Cable|AJC]], [[APCN 2 (cable system)|APCN2]], [[CUCN (cable system)|CUCN]], [[Japan-US (cable system)|Japan–US]], [[RNAL (cable system)|RNAL]], [[SEA-ME-WE 3]]) and international satellite systems, mainly servicing the Asia Pacific area. Reach has operating licences and landing rights in most major markets including Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, North America and Europe.

== History ==
Reach was established as a joint venture between [[Telstra]] and [[PCCW]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.reach.com/news/in_the_news_archive/20010207_Telstra_and_PCCW_Join_Forces_In_Pan.pdf|title=Telstra and PCCW Launch Joint Ventures|date=7 February 2001|access-date=18 March 2018|publisher=Reach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/42988/telstra_pccw_reach_into_singapore_market/|title=Telstra, PCCW reach into Singapore market|date=10 July 2001|access-date=18 March 2018|work=Computer World|publisher=IDG Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telstra and PCCW injected their international assets, including subsea cables, gateways and satellite capacity into Reach. These assets were supplemented later the same year by the acquisition of [[Level 3 Communications]]' Asian assets. After financial difficulties, its shareholders negotiated a debt settlement in June 2004,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reach.com/news/news_archive/Reach_release_180604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now financially stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/459967/pccw-telstra-settle-reach-debt|title=PCCW, Telstra settle Reach debt|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reach was restructured,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/739626/pccw-telstra-restructure-reach|title=PCCW, Telstra restructure Reach|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 announced that nearly all future expansion would be used for Telstra and PCCW requirements, though it would continue to service its other customers. Reach's website advertises their wholesale voice &amp; data services.

== Network ==

The company operates {{convert|364000|km|mi|abbr=on|-3}} of network cables connecting 240 countries and territories.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reach.com/about/overview.php|title=REACH : About REACH : Overview|work=reach.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working with FBI ==
Telstra was compelled to strike a 2001 deal with the [[FBI]] and the [[US Department of Justice]] to give them surveillance access to the undersea cables owned by its subsidiary Reach, a new [[document]] released online and provided to Crikey reveals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/07/12/telstras-deal-with-the-devil-fbi-access-to-its-undersea-cables/|title=Telstra PCCW Reach deal with FBI and Department of Justice surveillance access to cables - Crikey|work=crikey.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://media.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/US-NSAs-Telstra.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1282142/why-us-spies-wanted-tap-reach-pccw-telstra-cable-joint-venture|title=Why US spies wanted to tap Reach, PCCW-Telstra cable joint venture|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
{{European patent law}}
In the [[European Economic Area]] ([[European Union]] member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), a '''supplementary protection certificate''' ('''SPC''') is a ''[[sui generis]]'' intellectual property (IP) right that extends the duration of certain rights associated with a patent. It enters into force after expiry of a patent upon which it is based. This type of right is available for various regulated, biologically active agents, namely human or veterinary medicaments and plant protection products (e.g. [[insecticide]]s, and [[herbicide]]s). Supplementary protection certificates were introduced to encourage innovation by compensating for the long time needed to obtain regulatory approval of these products (i.e. authorisation to put these products on the market).&lt;ref&gt;"''... Whereas at the moment the period that elapses between the filing of an application for a patent for a new medicinal product and authorization to place the medicinal product on the market makes the period of effective protection under the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into the research ...''" in [http://europa.eu/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992R1768:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products]&lt;/ref&gt;

A supplementary protection certificate comes into force only after the corresponding general patent expires. It normally has a maximum lifetime of 5 years. The duration of the SPC can, however, be extended to 5.5 years when the SPC relates to a human medicinal product for which data from clinical trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) have been submitted (as set out in Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2006_1901/reg_2006_1901_en.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The total combined duration of market exclusivity of a general patent and SPC cannot normally exceed 15 years. However, the reward of a 6-month SPC extension for the submission of data from an agreed PIP can extend this combined duration to 15.5 years.

SPCs extend the monopoly period for a "product" (active ingredient or a combination of active ingredients) that is protected by a patent. For many SPC applications, there is no controversy about the definition of the "product" or whether it is protected by the patent upon which the SPC application was based. However, there are other SPC applications (particularly for medicinal products containing multiple active ingredients) where there may not be clear answers to questions such as what is a permissible definition of a "product", and what test should be applied for determining whether a patent protects that "product".

Supplementary protection certificates in the European Union are based primarily upon two [[European Union regulation|regulation]]s. Although all countries in the EU are required to provide supplementary protection certificates, no unified cross-recognition exist. Applications must be filed and approved on a country-by-country basis.

== Scope ==
According to Article 4 of [[Council of the European Union|Council]] Regulation ([[European Community|EEC]]) No 1768/92, the scope of an SPC extends "''only to the product covered by the authorization to place the corresponding medicinal product on the market and for any use of the product as a medicinal product that has been authorized before the expiry of the certificate''".

The European Court of Justice has decided, however, that the scope of an SPC is sometimes capable of encompassing more than just the single form of the active ingredient that is included in the medicinal product authorised for sale. Thus, in case C-392/97,&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;newform=newform&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;alljur=alljur&amp;jurcdj=jurcdj&amp;jurtpi=jurtpi&amp;jurtfp=jurtfp&amp;alldocrec=alldocrec&amp;docj=docj&amp;docor=docor&amp;docop=docop&amp;docav=docav&amp;docsom=docsom&amp;docinf=docinf&amp;alldocnorec=alldocnorec&amp;docnoj=docnoj&amp;docnoor=docnoor&amp;typeord=ALL&amp;docnodecision=docnodecision&amp;allcommjo=allcommjo&amp;affint=affint&amp;affclose=affclose&amp;numaff=C-392%2F97&amp;ddatefs=&amp;mdatefs=&amp;ydatefs=&amp;ddatefe=&amp;mdatefe=&amp;ydatefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Farmitalia Carlo Erba Srl's SPC Application (Case C-392/97)]&lt;/ref&gt; the European Court of Justice held that:
"''where an active ingredient in the form of a salt is referred to in the marketing authorisation concerned and is protected by a basic patent in force, the certificate is capable of covering the active ingredient as such and also its various derived forms such as salts and esters, as medicinal products, in so far as they are covered by the protection of the basic patent''".

== Legal basis ==
Supplementary protection certificates in the European Union were based primarily upon two regulations:

* [[Council of the European Union|Council]] Regulation ([[European Community|EEC]]) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992R1768:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products]&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force on 2 January 1993. This has been cancelled by the below specified recodified regulation No [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:152:0001:0010:en:PDF 469/2009] with effect from May 2009
* Regulation ([[European Community|EC]]) No 1610/96 of the [[European Parliament]] and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996R1610:EN:HTML Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products]&lt;/ref&gt; which entered into force on 8 February 1997

The above Regulations have now been codified under the following regulation:
* Regulation ([[European Community|EC]]) No [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:152:0001:0010:en:PDF 469/2009] of the [[European Parliament]] and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (Codified version)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:152:0001:0010:en:PDF Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products (Codified version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplementary protection certificates may come into life at the expiry of a national or European patent. However, the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) needed to be modified to allow such "extension" of the term of European patent. Article 63 of the EPC was modified on 17 December 1991 to specify to, although European patents have a [[term of patent|term]] of 20 years as from the date of filing of the application (Art. 63(1)),

:" nothing (...) shall limit the right of a Contracting State to extend the term of a European patent, or to grant corresponding protection which follows immediately on expiry of the term of the patent, under the same conditions as those applying to national patents: (...)
:(b) if the subject-matter of the European patent is a product or a process of manufacturing a product or a use of a product which has to undergo an administrative authorisation procedure required by law before it can be put on the market in that State. " &lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This constituted the first revision of the European Patent Convention since its signature in 1973.

The paediatric extension is based primarily upon:

* Regulation 1901/2006 of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2006_1901/reg_2006_1901_en.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regulation 1902/2006 of 20 December 2006 amending Regulation 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/vol-1/reg_2006_1902/reg_2006_1902_en.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1902/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 amending Regulation 1901/2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determination of term ==
The term of an SPC depends on the date of issuance of the first marketing authorization (MA) within the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and can be determined by the equation:
:Term = '''date of 1st MA in the EEA &amp;minus; date of filing of corresponding patent &amp;minus; 5 years'''

Under normal circumstances, this means the following.
* No SPC term is available if less than 5 years have elapsed between the date of filing of the corresponding patent and the date of issuance of the first MA in the EEA.
* If the first MA is issued more than five years but less than ten years after the filing date of the corresponding patent, an SPC is granted for a term corresponding to the period elapsed between the five-year point and the MA issuance date.
* If the first MA is issued more than ten years after the filing date of the corresponding patent, an SPC is granted for a five-year term.

There have been very few cases where there was any controversy over the precise date of the 1st MA in the EEA. The Hässle AB case (ECJ case C-127/00&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;newform=newform&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;alljur=alljur&amp;jurcdj=jurcdj&amp;jurtpi=jurtpi&amp;jurtfp=jurtfp&amp;alldocrec=alldocrec&amp;docj=docj&amp;docor=docor&amp;docdecision=docdecision&amp;docop=docop&amp;docppoag=docppoag&amp;docav=docav&amp;docsom=docsom&amp;docinf=docinf&amp;alldocnorec=alldocnorec&amp;docnoj=docnoj&amp;docnoor=docnoor&amp;radtypeord=on&amp;typeord=ALL&amp;docnodecision=docnodecision&amp;allcommjo=allcommjo&amp;affint=affint&amp;affclose=affclose&amp;numaff=C-127%2F00&amp;ddatefs=&amp;mdatefs=&amp;ydatefs=&amp;ddatefe=&amp;mdatefe=&amp;ydatefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-127/00]&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of that small number. In that case, the ECJ ruled that the decisive date for SPC purposes is the date of an authorisation from a regulatory body tasked with assessing safety and efficacy, and not the date of a subsequent authorisation that may be required under national pricing or reimbursement provisions.

So-called "centralised" ([[European Medicines Agency]] / European Commission) MAs were introduced by Regulation 2309/93&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/reg_1993_2309/reg_1993_2309_en.pdf Regulation 2309/93]&lt;/ref&gt; and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 years after the introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with "centralised" authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) the date of notification of that decision to the MA applicant.  Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1).  Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike Snodin&lt;ref&gt;[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/every-day-counts-but-how-do-we-count.html Mike Snodin October 2011 article]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a "centralised" authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant.

The UK Intellectual Property Office has now accepted Snodin's arguments on this point and has changed its standard practice regarding the calculation of SPC term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-types/pro-patent/p-law/p-pn/p-pn-spcduration.htm UK IPO Practice Notice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173040/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-types/pro-patent/p-law/p-pn/p-pn-spcduration.htm |date=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It remains to be seen whether any other national offices will follow suit. However, inspection of Belgian SPC certificates for products authorised via the "centralised" procedure reveals that at least the patent office in Belgium already appears to base calculations of SPC term upon date (2). Thus, there are divergent practices across different territories within Europe with regard to the selection of a date for a "centralised" MA, with Belgium and the UK IPO being in the minority. If the issue were ever to be debated in a national court, this fact that there are divergent practices across different territories could provide basis for such a court to seek an authoratitive ruling from the ECJ in relation to which of dates (1) and (2) should be used for SPCs. This is because, as European Commission legislation, the Regulations governing SPCs should be interpreted consistently across all member states of the EU.

An MA in [[Switzerland]] was also considered as being a first MA for the calculation of the SPC duration, even though Switzerland is not part of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). This is because such a MA was automatically effective in [[Liechtenstein]], which is a member of the EEA (since 1 May 1995). This was decided by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) in joined cases ''Novartis et al. v. Comptroller-General'' and ''Ministère de l'Economie v. Millennium Pharmaceuticals''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/c_158/c_15820030705en00170017.pdf Case C-207/03]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/c_200/c_20020030823en00120012.pdf Case C-252/03]&lt;/ref&gt;  The same point was also confirmed in case C-617/12 (''AstraZeneca AB v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=144849&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=288106 Case C-617/12]&lt;/ref&gt; in a case where the data that persuaded Swissmedic to grant the (earlier) Swiss MA was held by the European Medicines Agency to not be complete or persuasive enough to justify the grant of a MA under EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC).
However, as answer to the decision of the ECJ the contract between Switzerland and Liechtenstein was amended. Since 1 July 2005 the automatic effect of a Swiss MA in Liechtenstein is abolished. The recognition is now delayed by a time period, which is normally 12 months.

=== Paediatric extension ===
Article 36 of Regulation 1901/2006 provides for a 6-month extension to SPC term. The extension is available only under certain conditions, the most notable being the requirement for the submission of a new MA application containing data from all trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).

Consequences of the 6-month SPC extension include:
* the maximum term of an SPC can now be up to 5.5 years; and
* the maximum duration of market exclusivity (patent + SPC) can now be up to at least 15.5 years.

An extension of an SPC can only be awarded if there is an SPC to extend.  As an unextended SPC only has a positive term if more than 5 years have elapsed between patent filing and MA issuance, this leads to the following two questions.

(1) Is an SPC available if less than 5 years and 1 day have elapsed between filing of the corresponding patent and issuance of the first MA in the EEA?

(2) If the answer to (1) is yes, what term should be awarded to the (unextended) SPC?

A July 2007 paper by Snodin and Miles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.potterclarkson.com/pdfs/newsletters/making-the-most-of-paediatric-spc-extensions.pdf Snodin and Miles ''RAJ Pharma'' 18(7), 459 (2007)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127093250/http://www.potterclarkson.com/pdfs/newsletters/making-the-most-of-paediatric-spc-extensions.pdf |date=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; put forward three possible answers to this combination of two questions.

If the answer to question (1) is no, then it is not relevant to consider question (2). This corresponds to "Model B" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper, and produces a curious situation where longer marketing exclusivity can be obtained if the issuance of the first MA in the EEA is delayed (to at least 5 years and 1-day from filing of the corresponding patent).

If the answer to question (1) is yes, then question (2) becomes relevant. This question can be answered in two ways, corresponding to either "Model A" or "Model C" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper.

Model A assumes that SPC term can validly be either zero or negative if 5 years or less have elapsed from filing of the corresponding patent to issuance of the first MA in the EEA. In this event, a positive (and non-zero) SPC term is obtained (after extension) if the time from patent filing to MA issuance is more than 4.5 years.

Model C assumes that all term calculations that provide a negative answer are 'rounded up' to zero. This has the consequence of providing a minimum of 6 months of SPC term, irrespective of how little time has elapsed from patent filing to MA issuance.

Subsequent to the publication of the Snodin and Miles article, Merck &amp; Co. filed SPC applications for the product [[sitagliptin]]. For example, from mid-August to mid-September 2007, Merck &amp; Co. filed SPC applications in various countries, including the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-find-spc-byspc-results.htm?number=SPC/GB07/046 Register Extract for UK SPC for sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentsoffice.ie/eregister/register/SPRegister.aspx?idappli=2007/029  Register Extract for IE SPC for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.octrooicentrum.nl/register/gegevens/CERT/300287  Register Extract for NL SPC for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uibm.gov.it/uibm/dati/Codice.aspx?load=info&amp;id=1541780&amp;table=CCP  Register Extract for IT SPC for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; These SPC applications provided an early opportunity for Models A to C to be tested in practice. Curiously, the patent offices of various EU member states did not reach any consensus on which model is correct. For example, the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.octrooicentrum.nl/register/gegevens/CERT/300287 Register Extract for NL SPC for sitagliptin, showing an SPC expiry date earlier than the expiry date of the basic patent]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-types/pro-patent/pro-p-os/o10808.pdf UKIPO decision granting negative term SPC]&lt;/ref&gt; favoured Model A, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/full-translation-of-german-sitagliptin.html Translation of referral from BGH to the CJEU in Merck's appeal against refusal of sitagliptin SPC application in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal and Slovenia favoured Model B and Greece&lt;ref&gt;[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/sitagliptin-nl-negative-term.html Commentary on SPC applications for sitagliptin]&lt;/ref&gt; favoured Model C.

In connection with an appeal against refusal of the SPC application in Germany, and in view of the different stances taken by different national patent offices, the [[German Federal Court of Justice]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'') sought clarification of the law from the Court of Justice of the EU (in case C-125/10).

The decision of the Court of Justice, delivered on 8 December 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;jur=C,T,F&amp;num=C-125/10&amp;td=ALL C-125/10 – Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Judgment of the Court (Second Chamber) of 8 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; essentially agreed with Model A of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper. Thus, useful (extended) supplementary protection can now be obtained so long as at least 4 years, 6 months and one day has elapsed from the date of patent filing to the date of the first MA for the product in the EEA.

== Case law ==
ECJ cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 effectively ruled that SPCs for medicaments (human or veterinary) are only available for those "products" that:

(a) are protected by a patent;

(b) have been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure; and

(c) have not been placed on the market anywhere in the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] as a medicinal product prior to being subject to safety and efficacy testing and a regulatory review.

Until recently, decisions C-195/09 and C-427/09 could have been interpreted as ruling out the possibility of SPC protection for all "products" previously included in medicinal products that were marketed prior to the date(s) of the Marketing Authorisation(s) (MA(s)) specified in the SPC application. This is because the ECJ's rulings in C-195/09 and C-427/09 were based in part upon a desire to ensure that national patent offices are not required to assess whether an earlier MA was compliant with the standards for testing of safety and efficacy that were introduced in the 1970s (meaning that all prior MAs, whether or not compliant with those standards, should be treated equally under the SPC legislation).

However, the decision in Neurim Pharmaceuticals (C-130/11) has cast doubt upon this interpretation. In C-130/11, the ECJ held that an SPC can be granted regardless of the prior marketing of earlier (veterinary) medicinal products containing the "product" in question. Thus, cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 (which, in common with C-130/11, related to SPC applications based upon newly patented uses for old "products") could perhaps now be viewed as being of relevance only to those "products" that were marketed before being subject to a regulatory review. However, this might necessitate patent offices making a determination of whether prior MAs are compliant with current standards (i.e. whether the "product" had been subject to safety and efficacy testing prior to being granted an MA). As this is precisely the kind of determination that the ECJ had previously been keen for patent offices to avoid, further references to the ECJ may be necessary to clarify precisely which "products" fall within the scope of the SPC legislation and which do not.

With respect to (a) above, the question of how to determine whether a "product" is protected by a patent is the subject of ongoing controversy. Cases such as C-322/10 and C-422/10 have indicated that the "product" needs to be "specified [or identified] in the wording of the claims". However, the precise meaning of this test is yet to be clarified.

Further, although the SPC legislation mentions only Directives 2001/83/EC and 2001/82/EC as the "administrative authorisation procedure" for human or veterinary medicaments, SPCs are known to have been granted when MAs have not been obtained via those procedures (but instead via procedures that involve a similar level of safety and efficacy testing)[http://thespcblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/spc-on-basis-of-ma-for-active.html].

== Statistics ==
According to research, more than 8,000 SPCs for medicinal and plant protection products have been filed in Europe between 1991 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;EurActiv, [http://www.euractiv.com/en/health/eu-ruling-extension-pharma-patents-harder/article-154974 ''EU ruling makes extension of pharma patents harder''], 5 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swedish Companies Registration Office''' ({{lang-sv|Bolagsverket}}), is a [[Swedish government agency]] which mainly handles the registration of new companies and registry changes for existing businesses, such as change of address and change of board of directors and auditors. The Agency receives financial statements and records of [[chattel mortgage]]s and liquidations. The agency also provides corporate information (registers information about Swedish companies and associations) and is appointed by the Government to be the development agency for e-government in the area of business and enterprise.

The Swedish Companies Registration Office was formed in 2004. Its headquarters is located in [[Sundsvall]], where it employs about 500 employees. It is assigned to the [[Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation (Sweden)|Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14458">In [[Canada]], [[trade secret]]s are generally considered to include information set out, contained or embodied in, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, plan, compilation, computer program, method, technique, process, product, device or mechanism; it may be information of any sort; an idea of a scientific nature, or of a literary nature, as long as they grant an economical advantage to the business and improve its value.{{sfn|Turner|1962|p=4}} Additionally, there must be some element of secrecy. Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be the subject-matter of a trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vaver|first= David|date= 1981|title= Civil Liability for Taking or Using Trade Secrets in Canada|url= |journal= Canadian Business Law Journal|publisher= |volume= 5|issue= 1|page= 255|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[Trade secrets]] are a type of [[intellectual property]] that consists of certain [[information]], [[expertise]] or [[knowhow]] that has been developed or acquired by firms. This knowledge frequently gives firms their competitive edge in the market and it has to be kept as a secret.

In Canada any information that a firm or its employees produces or acquires for the purpose of the firm’s business can constitute confidential information that courts are willing to protect. All that is required is that the creator of the information “has used his brain and thus produced a result which can be produced by somebody who goes through the same process”.&lt;ref&gt;''Salman Engineering Co. Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Co. Ltd.'' (1948), [1963] 3 All E.R. 413 at 415 (C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Seager v. Copydex Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;''Seager Limited v Copydex Limited'', [1967] 2 All ER 415&lt;/ref&gt; courts will even act to protect a comparatively underdeveloped idea from misappropriation. However, information may stop being confidential and confident may be released from its obligations of confidence if the information subject to confidence is later publicly disclosed by the confider or a third party.

== Trade Secrets vs. Confidential Information ==
With one exception in the field of employer-employee relations, there is no recognized distinction in Canada between the rights and remedies afforded to [[trade secrets]] as opposed to mere [[confidential information]]. In the field of employer-employee relationships, the British case ''Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler'', which has been cited with approval by several Canadian courts, has drawn a distinction between the two.{{sfn|Belmore|Sartorio|2000|p=10}}

==Allocation of powers under the Constitution==
Under the ''[[Constitution Act 1867]]'', the exclusive Legislative Authority of the [[Parliament of Canada]] extends to most areas of intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyrights;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91(2), 91(22) and 91(23).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the provincial government has exclusive authority to legislate on matters related to [[property and civil rights]].  The federal Parliament also has exclusive jurisdiction to create offences under its criminal law power.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 91(29).&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, the federal ''[[Canadian trade-mark law|Trade-marks Act]]'' prohibited anyone from "do[ing] any other act or adopt[ing] any other business practice contrary to honest industrial or commercial usage in Canada,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Trade-marks Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =T-13|section =7|subsection = e|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-7-20021231.html}} (now repealed)&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered to include the taking of trade secrets.{{sfn|Vaver|1981|p=265}} However, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[MacDonald v. Vapor Canada Ltd.]]'' that the provisions encroached on the provinces' authority over [[property and civil rights]] and could not be upheld under the federal [[trade and commerce]] power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=MacDonald et al. v. Vapor Canada Ltd.|link=MacDonald v. Vapor Canada Ltd.|year=1976|court=scc|num=181|format=canlii|pinpoint=pp. 172{{endash}}173|parallelcite=[1977] 2 SCR 134|date=1976-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the regulation of trade secrets as a civil matter falls under provincial jurisdiction.

==Civil Legal Framework==

=== Uniform Trade Secrets Act ===
The ''Uniform Trade Secrets Act'', adopted by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada in 1989, would provide civil remedies for the breach of trade secrets.  That Uniform Act defines "trade secrets" as follows:

{{quotation|
1(1) In this Act...

"trade secret" means any information that
:(a) is, or may be, used in a trade or business,
:(b) is not generally known in that trade or business,
:(c) has economic value because it is not generally known, and
:(d) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to prevent it from becoming generally known.

(2) For the purposes of the definition trade secret "information" includes information set out, contained or embodied in, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, plan, compilation, computer program, method, technique, process, product, device or mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Uniform Trade Secrets Act|date = 1989|url = http://www.ulcc.ca/en/uniform-acts-new-order/older-uniform-acts/537-josetta-1-en-gb/uniform-actsa/trade-secrets-act/730-uniform-trade-secrets-act-1989|publisher = Uniform Law Conference of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

To date, the Uniform Act has not been enacted into law by any of the Legislatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Table III: Uniform Acts Adopted before 2000, Showing the Jurisdictions that Have Enacted Them in Whole or in Part, with or without Modifications, or in Which Provisions Similar in Effect Are in Force|url = http://www.ulcc.ca/en/general-info-status/other-implementation-tables/2129-table-iii-pre-2000-uniform-acts-enacted-by-statute|at=p. 11|publisher = Uniform Law Conference of Canada|date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the definition has been incorporated in the federal ''[[Security of Information Act]]''.&lt;ref name = "SIA19"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =Security of Information Act|abbr =RSC|year =1985|chapter =O-5|section =19|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-5/section-19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Remedial Relief - Common Law Provinces===

In all the provinces but Quebec, trade secrets are governed by the common law, ultimately derived from the English common law as interpreted and applied in Canada. The Canadian definition of trade secret is based on Canadian case law and doctrine, and also draws on American and English case law.{{sfn|Thorburn|Fairbairn|1998|loc = para. 3:1200 and 3:2100}} In ''[[Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that a breach of confidence action is ''[[sui generis]]'' and the courts may rely on all three traditional jurisdictional bases for action (contract, equity and property) to enforce the policy of the law that confidences are to be respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.|link=Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.|year=1989|court=scc|num=34|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1989] 2 SCR 574|date=1989-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law, there are essentially five types of [[civil action]] that a [[trade secret]] holder can rely on to seek protection of its trade secrets before a court of justice:

#breach of contract (expressed or implied provision),
#breach of confidence,
#breach of fiduciary duty,
#unjust enrichment and
#wrongful interference with the contractual relations of others.{{sfn|Thorburn|Fairbairn|1998|loc = para. 5:1100}}

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] stated in ''Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.'' that all these types of actions coexist in the Canadian judicial system and remain available to the trade secret holder.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadbury Schweppes'', at pp. 40{{endash}}48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Remedial Relief - Quebec ===
In Quebec, trade secrets are governed by provisions under the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''.  An action for breach of [[trade secrets]] or confidential business information generally arises either from a contractual liability action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the absence of a contract, from a civil liability action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Code'' deals specifically with [[trade secrets]] in one article that provides for a defense where disclosing the secret is in the public interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1472}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in one that describes how a loss resulting from disclosure is to be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1612}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of its provisions define the concept of trade secret.

The [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] has ruled in ''Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company'' that those who own [[trade secrets]] (''secrets de commerce'') are entitled to seek protection and that [[Quebec]] courts are competent to grant remedies in the case the plaintiff can evidence its ownership of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Continental Casualty Company v. Combined Insurance Company'' (1967) B.R. 814 at p.819.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contractual Sanctions ===
Two important forms of contract used by employers in Canada to protect their [[trade secrets]] and confidential information are [[non-disclosure agreements]] and [[non-competition agreements]], which are also known as [[confidentiality agreements]] and [[restrictive covenants]].{{sfn|Belmore|Sartorio|2000|p=10}}

According to ''Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Fowler'', ex-employees, post-termination, may use their general skills and knowledge anywhere but they may not use or divulge their former employer’s trade secrets. Exceptionally, ex-employers may also be able to enjoin a former employee’s use of non-trade secret information where that information has been obtained from records which qualify as trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;''Faccenda Chicken Ltd. v. Flower'', [1986] 1 All E.R. 617 (CA).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''International Tools Ltd. v. Kollar'', in Canada the length of a [[permanent injunction]] to force a defendant to cease using the plaintiff’s information should not normally extend beyond the time that the plaintiff’s trade secrets remains a secret which is exclusively known to the plaintiff and its confidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=International Tools Ltd. v. Kollar et al.|link=|year=1968|court=onca|num=224|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 393|parallelcite=67 DLR (2d) 386|date=1968-01-29|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.]]'' Justice Binnie concluded that the form of relief for breach of confidence was “dictated by the facts of the case rather than strict jurisdictional or doctrinal considerations”.&lt;ref name = "Cadbury"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.|link=Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.|year=1999|court=scc|num=705|format=canlii|pinpoint=pp. 160{{endash}}161|parallelcite=[1999] 1 SCR 142|date=1999-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that “whether a breach of contract in a particular case has a contractual, tortuous, proprietary or trust flavour goes to the appropriateness of particular equitable remedy but does not limit the court’s jurisdiction to grant it”.&lt;ref name = "Cadbury"/&gt;

== Criminal Sanctions ==
In ''R. v. Stewart'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. v. Stewart|link=|year=1988|court=scc|num=86|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1988] 1 SCR 963|date=1988-05-26|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that the taking of confidential information cannot form the basis of a charge of theft&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c C‑34, s 283 (now found at [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-322.html#h-95 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 322]).&lt;/ref&gt; under the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'', but it could in certain circumstances form one for [[fraud]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c C-34, s 338;  now found at [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-380.html#h-105 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1984, c C-46, s 380].&lt;/ref&gt;

:* while theft encompasses the taking or conversion of "anything whether animate or inanimate," the Court held that "anything" must still be property of some sort, capable of being "taken or converted in a way that deprives the owner of his proprietary interest in some way." Confidential information, by its very nature, "cannot be converted, not because it is an intangible, but because, save very exceptional far‑fetched circumstances, the owner would never be deprived of it."&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Stewart'', par. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
:* on the other hand, the concept of "defraud" is established under current jurisprudence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. v. Olan et al.|link=|year=1978|court=scc|num=9|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1978] 2 SCR 1175|date=1978-05-30|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by proving a dishonest deprivation "of any property, money or valuable security or any service." This is satisfied upon proof of a risk of prejudice to the victim's economic interests; actual economic loss is not essential. Accordingly, deprivation of confidential information falls within the definition of fraud where it is in the nature of a [[trade secret]] or copyrighted material that has commercial value.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Stewart'', par. 45{{endash}}48&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament has since amended the ''[[Security of Information Act]]'' to provide that it is an offence to:

:* communicate a trade secret to another person, group or organization; or
:* obtain, retain, alter or destroy a trade secret,

for the benefit of a foreign economic entity, and to the detriment of Canada’s economic interests, international relations or national defence or national security.&lt;ref name = "SIA19"/&gt;

'''İlhan Cavcav''' (4 October 1935 – 22 January 2017) was the chairman of Turkish club [[Gençlerbirliği S.K.|Gençlerbirliği]] in Ankara, Turkey for almost 40 years until his death. He was known for his hard negotiation tactics with the big clubs in Turkey and scouting abilities especially for discovering talent from [[Africa]].

==Personal life==
Cavcav was a [[Kosovo Albanian]] from [[Pristina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.telegrafi.com/sport/lojtaret-turq-pa-mjekra-ose-do-te-denohen-5-0-59109.html&lt;/ref&gt; His father Haşim had 2 wives and 17 children. He owned a flour mill in [[Mamak, Ankara|Mamak]] and a small [[bakery]] shop. İlhan left school at the age of 14 in order to help support the family and started to work with his father as a cashier in the mill. In 1960, he formed his own business and in 1969 he opened his own more modern flour mill in Ankara (Ankara Un Sanayii).

==Early years playing football==
At 16, he started to play football with a local team Mamak Maske Spor. When he was 19 he was transferred to another Ankara team PTT Spor (now [[Türk Telekomspor]]). Cavcav has stated that PTT expected him to play professionally and he was unable due to his work at the flour mill with his father. Still 19, he briefly joined another local team Bahçelievler Gençlik Spor before ending this period. It was to be years later that he returned to football as a Chairman.

==Career as Chairman==
His first trial as a chairman was with the local Ankara team Hacettepe Kulübü in 1976. After Hacettepe relegated in the same season, he resigned from his position. In 1977, he served under Hasan Şengel as a board member in his current club [[Gençlerbirliği S.K.|Gençlerbirliği]]. In 1978's election he became the Chairman for [[Gençlerbirliği S.K.|Gençlerbirliği]] when the team was in Turkish Second League. Gençlerbirliği relegated to Third League in 1979. The Turkish Football federation merged the second and third Leagues in 1980. This was an automatic promotion to second league. In 1983 Cavcav's Gençlerbirliği promoted to Turkish First League. Gençlerbirliği played in 1st League except 1988–89 season when played in 2nd league.

In recent years, Gençlerbirliği fans have been highly critical of Cavcav stating that the club turned into a company seeking for the maximum profit and ignoring the target of success in the Turkish League and in European competitions. Fans are not happy with the situation about the instability of the squad because Cavcav never rejects the transfer offers coming from the big teams in Turkey for the best players of the team.

On the other hand, anti-democratic attitudes in the elections of  club management also are used as a means of criticizing Cavcav. Allegations were; in last club elections, nearly 1200 new members were added to the club who were not even Genclerbirligi fan. Opposition group went to court However, the Turkish court did not approve the case. &lt;!--needs rewrite and citation--&gt;

In November 2014. Cavcav announced that he would be fining bearded players, claiming that they were a bad influence for the youth. Cavcav said that he would fine players that kept their beards 25,000 Turkish Liras and also attacked [[UEFA]] for not banning beards in all of its completions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.us/turkish-super-lig/story/2148947/president-of-turkish-club-genclerbirligi-to-fine-bearded-players |title=President of Turkish club Genclerbirligi to fine bearded players |publisher=[[ESPN]].com |date=16 November 2014 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Cavcav was taken to hospital after falling and hitting his head, which caused a brain hemorrhage. He was kept in intensive care unit. One day later, on January 22, 2017, he was pronounced dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/legendary-ankara-football-club-chair-ilhan-cavcav-dies-at-81.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=108817&amp;NewsCatID=361 Legendary Ankara football club chair İlhan Cavcav dies at 81]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, he was buried at [[Cebeci Asri Cemetery]] in Ankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{tr}} [http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ilhan-cavcav-topraga-verildi-genclerbirligi-2383306-skorerhaber/ İlhan Cavcav Toprağa Verildi]&lt;/ref&gt;
