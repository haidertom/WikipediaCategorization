Research institute '''AMOLF''' is part of the institutes organization of [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwo.nl/en|title=Welcome to NWO|website=www.nwo.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. AMOLF carries out fundamental research on the physics and design principles of natural and man-made complex matter. AMOLF uses these insights to create novel functional materials and find new solutions to societal challenges in renewable energy, green ICT and healthcare. AMOLF is located at the [[Amsterdam Science Park]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/|title=Amsterdam Science Park Science and Business {{!}} Amsterdam Science Park|website=www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

AMOLF used to be part of the Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM). On 31 December, 2016 FOM integrated in NWO &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwo-i.nl/en/nwo-institutes-organisation/nwo-transition/|title=NWO Transition - NWO-I|work=NWO-I|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The institute was established in 1949 by the government as the FOM Laboratory for Mass Spectrography. In 1960, it was renamed to Laboratory for Mass Separation, and in 1966 it was reorganized into a research institute and renamed FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amolf.nl/about/history-of-amolf|title=History of AMOLF|publisher=AMOLF|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original research goal was to demonstrate the separation of uranium isotopes by electromagnetic separation methods, a topic of great strategic importance after World War II. To reach this goal, a number of novelanalytical instrumentation were developed, starting with the development of mass-spectrometric tools. In 1953 AMOLF was the first European institute to successfully enrich Uranium. Soon after, research on thermal diffusion in gases followed, as did [[ultracentrifuge]] concepts, cathode dispersion, excitation of gases by using energetic ions and research on molecular beams. The gas-[[ultracentrifuge]] developed at AMOLF (under [[:nl:Jacob_Kistemaker|Jacob Kistemaker]]) provided a base for the commercial enrichment of Uranium at the today well-known company of [[URENCO]] in [[Almelo]].

==Structure and organization ==

AMOLF functions as an incubator for Dutch science, both in terms of launching new research themes and in terms of training talented scientists. AMOLF is headed by its director [[Huib Bakker]], who succeeded [[:nl:Vinod_Subramaniam|Vinod Subramaniam]] on 1 February, 2016. The organization has 19 research groups headed by tenured or tenure-track group leaders. AMOLF employs about 130 researchers and 70 employees for technical and administrative support.

==Research==

AMOLF’s research program consists of four intertwined themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amolf.nl/research|title=Research - AMOLF|work=AMOLF|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is a bacterial process occurring in the presence of oxygen. Bacteria rapidly consume organic matter and convert it into [[carbon dioxide]], water and a range of lower molecular weight organic compounds. As there is no new supply of organic material from sewage, the [[activated sludge]] biota begin to die and are used as food by [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] bacteria. This stage of the process is known as ''endogenous respiration'' and it is process that reduces the solid concentration in the sludge.

==Process==
Aerobic digestion is typically used in an activated sludge treatment plant. Waste activated sludge and primary sludge are combined, where appropriate, and passed to a thickener where the solids content is increased. This substantially reduces the volume that is required to be treated in the digester.The process is usually run as a batch process with more than one digester tank in operation at any one time.&lt;ref name="creek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/solids-treatment/aerobic-digestion-of-sludge|title=Aerobic digestion of sludge|publisher=Johns Creek Environmental Campus|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Air is pumped through the tank and the contents are stirred to keep the contents fully mixed. Carbon dioxide, waste air and small quantities of other gases including [[hydrogen sulfide]] are given off. These waste gases require treatment to reduce odours in works close to housing or capable of generating public nuisance.&lt;ref name="creek"/&gt; The digestion is continued until the percentage of degradable solids is reduced to between 20% and 10% depending on local conditions&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; 
Where non sewage waste is being processed, organic waste such as food, cardboard and horticultural waste can be significantly reduced in volume leaving an output that can be used as soil improver or biomass fuel.

==Advantages==
Because the aerobic digestion occurs much faster than [[anaerobic digestion]], the capital costs of aerobic digestion are lower.

The process is usually run at ambient temperature and the process is much less complex than anaerobic digestion and is easier to manage.

==Disadvantages==
The operating costs are typically much greater for aerobic digestion than for anaerobic digestion because of energy used by the blowers, pumps and motors needed to add oxygen to the process. However, recent technological advances include non-electrically aerated filter systems that use natural air currents for the aeration instead of electrically operated machinery.

The digested sludge is relatively low in residual energy and although it can be dried and incinerated to produce heat, the energy yield is very much lower than that produced by anaerobic digestion

==ATADs==
Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD) is a [[Sewage sludge treatment|faecal sludge treatment]] design concept that uses the nutrients in the sludge and the metabolic heat of the bacteria to create high temperatures in the aerobic digester. This gradually shifts the microbial community towards [[Thermophile|termophilic]] at temperatures typically at 55 degree Celsius or above. While the higher aeration requirements of ATADs further increase energy use and potential smell nuisance, the increased temperature makes the resulting [[biosolids]] much safer for re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layden|first1=Noreen M.|title=Autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) — Part I: Review of origins, design, and process operation|journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering and Science|date=November 2007|volume= 6|issue= 6|doi=10.1139/S07-015|url=http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1139/S07-015|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vitis labrusca BB-1913.png|thumb|''[[Vitis labrusca]]'']]

'''Ampelography'''  ([[Ampelos|ἄμπελος]], "vine" + γράφος, "writing") is the field of [[botany]] concerned with the identification and classification of grapevines, [[Vitis|''Vitis'' spp.]] Traditionally this has been done by comparing the shape and colour of the vine leaves and grape berries; more recently the study of vines has been revolutionised by DNA fingerprinting.

==Early history==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2016}}The grape vine is an extremely variable [[species]] and some [[:Category:Grape varieties|varieties]], such as [[Pinot noir|Pinot]], [[mutate]] particularly frequently. At the same time, the wine and table grape industries have been important since ancient times, so large sums of money can depend on the correct identification of different varieties and clones of grapevines.

The science of ampelography began seriously in the 19th century, when it became important to understand more about the different species of vine, as they had very different resistance to disease and pests such as [[phylloxera]].

Many vine identification books were published at this time, one of which is Victor Rendu's ''Ampélographie française'' of 1857, featuring hand-colored lithographs by Eugene Grobon.

==Pierre Galet==
Until the Second World War, ampelography had been an art. Then [[Pierre Galet]] of the ''École nationale supérieure agronomique de [[Montpellier]]'' made a systematic assembly of criteria for the identification of vines. The Galet system was based on the shape and contours of the leaves, the characteristics of growing shoots, shoot tips, petioles, the sex of the flowers, the shape of the grape clusters and the colour, size and pips of the grapes themselves. The grapes are less affected by environmental factors than the leaves and the shoots, but are obviously not around for as long. He even included grape flavour as a criterion, but this is rather subjective.

Galet then published the definitive book, ''Ampélographie pratique'', in 1952, featuring 9,600 types of vine. ''Ampélographie pratique'' was translated into English by Lucie Morton, published in 1979 and updated in 2000.

==''Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography''==
In 2012, Italian publisher L'Artistica Editrice published ''Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography'', a three volume set which contains the most important books edited in France and Italy between 1800 and 1900: the ''Ampélographie'' of Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel, the grapes section of ''Pomona Italiana'' by Count Giorgio Gallesio and the ''Ampelografia Italiana'' of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The book collects 551 color plates of grapes from all over the world, with texts in Italian and English, which describe the morphological and agricultural characteristics of each vine variety, as well as their synonyms and historical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infowine.com/default.asp?scheda=11209 Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography] InfoWine. Retrieved: 2012-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA==
[[Carole Meredith]] at the [[University of California, Davis]], pioneered the use of [[genetic fingerprinting]] for vine identification.  Famous successes with the technique include proving the identity of [[Zinfandel]], Primitivo, and Crljenak Kaštelanski, and identifying the parents of [[Sangiovese]] as Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. Such exercises are giving valuable insight into historical patterns of trade and migration.

DNA fingerprinting uses segments of DNA that do not affect the look or taste of the grapes.  More recent work has identified the [[gene]]s responsible for the differences between grape varieties, such as the ''VvMYBA1'' and ''VvMYBA2'' genes that control grape colour, or the ''VvGAI1'' gene that is [[mutation|mutated]] in some cells of [[Pinot Meunier]] compared to [[Pinot noir]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas.

'''Antioch University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[non-profit]] [[university system]] in the United States with five campuses located in four states, as well as an online campus and the Graduate School of Leadership and Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/gslc/|title=Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All campuses of the university are regionally accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antioch.edu/our-accreditation/ Antioch University - Our Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt; Campuses are located in [[Los Angeles, California]]; [[Santa Barbara, California]]; [[Keene, New Hampshire]]; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. Antioch University uses the system of [[narrative evaluation]] as a substitute to the conventional grading system of A-F letter grades. Additionally, Antioch University houses two institution-wide programs, the PhD in Leadership and Change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antioch.edu/gslc/degrees-programs/business-management-leadership/phd-leadership-change/|title=PhD in Leadership &amp; Change {{!}} Antioch University {{!}} Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antioch Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/auonline/|title=Antioch University Online {{!}} A University in Pursuit of a Better World|website=www.antioch.edu/auonline|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it originated from the historic college, Antioch University should not be confused with [[Antioch College]] in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which gained its independence from the University in 2009, and has since had no affiliation with the University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/01/antioch Jaschik, Scott (July 1, 2009) "A Deal to Revive Antioch" Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Antioch University serves more than 4,000 adult students around the world and across the country, online and from its five campuses in four states. The [[Los Angeles]] campus offers an MFA in creative writing; the [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] campus offers an MA in education with an emphasis in social justice; the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] campus offers a program in conflict analysis; the [[Seattle]] campus offers integrative drama and art therapy programs; and the online campus offers a BA in Human Services Administration as well as a BA in [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] with various concentrations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
Antioch University grew out of Antioch College.  Antioch College was founded in 1852 as the result of American educator [[Horace Mann]]'s dream to establish a college comparable to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] but with some notable differences. Antioch College was to be completely nonsectarian and [[co-educational]], and with a curriculum that would include the traditional treatment of the classics, but would emphasize science and the scientific method, history, and modern literature. Students would not compete for grades but would be encouraged to pursue issues of interest to them, read what they considered worthwhile and present papers on topics of their own choosing. Horace Mann became the first president in 1853.

Antioch College began a period of rapid expansion in 1964 with the acquisition of the Putney School of Education in Vermont.  That campus has evolved and moved several times to become Antioch University New England now situated in Keene, NH. By 1972, another 23 centers had been opened, and the College By-Laws were revised to define Antioch as a "network", not a college. Even as centers began to close, new centers continued to open; 38 centers would be opened by the end of 1979, including the ABA-accredited Antioch School of Law located in Washington, D.C. In 1977, the Antioch College Board of Trustees voted to change its name to Antioch University, and in 1978, Antioch University Corporation replaced Antioch College Corporation as owner of all institutional assets, tangible and intangible.

In 1986, the University decided to close 32 of its units around the country, including the School of Law. The law school now operates as the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law. By 1989, the University consolidated to 6 campuses including 1) its original campus, Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio; 2) Antioch University New England in Keene New Hampshire; 3) Antioch University Los Angeles; 4) Antioch University Santa Barbara; 5) Antioch University Seattle; and 6) Antioch University McGregor, an adult, graduate degree program in Yellow Springs, Ohio, now known as Antioch University Midwest.

In 2008, citing financial exigency, Antioch University closed the Antioch College campus in Yellow Springs.  Antioch College alumni came together to found the Antioch College Continuation Corporation and purchased the College name and campus back from the University. The newly independent Antioch College reopened in 2011 and purchased its remaining assets back from the University in 2012.  Since then, Antioch University and Antioch College have operated as wholly separate, non-affiliated institutions, although the University continues to retain the transcripts of all College alumni who entered prior to the 2008 closure.

From its inception, racial and gender equality, independent study and independent thinking were integral parts of Antioch College. Six students were accepted for the first quarter: four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the U.S. The notion of [[gender equality]] extended also to the faculty. Antioch College was the first U.S. college to designate a woman as full professor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/02/nation/na-hometown-antioch2|title=Antioch College alumni plan to save their school|author=P.J. Huffstutter | work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original faculty included seven men and two women. Then, in 1863, the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race.

In the early 1850s, [[Rebecca Pennell]] offered a course on teaching methods which was the first of its kind, while [[John Burns Weston]], class of 1857, established a long-standing precedent by being both student and faculty simultaneously. He taught Greek language and literature for 20 years and remained a lifelong student.

While Antioch College never diverged from the philosophy of Horace Mann, the final form of an Antioch education traced its roots from the election of [[Arthur Ernest Morgan|Arthur Morgan]] as President of the college in 1920. Morgan, like Mann, believed in the development of the individual as a whole. Having seen the difficulty encountered by [[ivory-tower]] academicians attempting to participate in the business world, he resolved to change the cloistered educational experience by providing students with work experience in their field. He wrote “The Plan for the New Antioch” which was his vision for the future of the school. This was the beginning of Antioch's unique program of work and study, what Morgan termed, “industrial education.”

Morgan initiated the practice of [[student government]]. He also changed the nature of the admissions procedure. Rather than relying on [[entrance examination]]s, Morgan opted for more personal information on prospective students. In addition, senior exams were graded "honors" or "pass", and students who failed could retake the exam. Morgan remained at Antioch until 1933, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] requested that he assume directorship of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Project.

==College expansion and university founding==
In 1964, Antioch College took over the Putney School of Education in [[Vermont]] (now [[Antioch University New England]] in Keene, New Hampshire). During the next decade, other adult learning programs were instituted: among them, Antioch Seattle; Antioch Southern California with campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; and the Antioch Education Abroad Program (with centers in [[London]], Germany and other locations).

In 1978, Antioch College became a university system. From 1978 to 1994 the President of Antioch College also served as the Chancellor of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;http://antiochiana.edu/PresidentsList.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Antioch University's Ph.D. in Leadership and Change Program was founded. The program is designed to educate professionals from a wide range of fields to understand and lead organizational change. The program's low-residency model offers students interdisciplinary study with a practitioner focus that teaches and encourages applied research.

In 2009 Antioch College became entirely independent of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ysnews.com/news/2009/09/antioch-college-alive-and-independent-again|title=Antioch College alive and independent again|author=Diane Chiddister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Antioch University New England===
Founded in 1964, [[Antioch University New England]] is located in Keene, New Hampshire, a small city with a strong tradition of civic, cultural, and environmental activism, in the heart of the state's [[Monadnock Region]]. It is Antioch University's largest branch, with over 1,200 graduate-level students.  Master's degrees are awarded in areas of [[Mental Health Counselor|Clinical Mental Health Counseling]] (with specializations in Addictions Counseling &amp; Dance/Movement Therapy), [[Family Therapy|Marriage and Family Therapy]], [[Environmental Studies]], Organization &amp; Management ("Green MBA"), and Education.  Doctoral degrees are awarded in the areas of [[Clinical Psychology]] ([[Psy.D]]), Marriage and Family Therapy (Ph. D), and Environmental Studies (Ph. D).  Antioch-New England is one of only three schools in the United States to offer [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] teacher training and has gained critical acclaim for its annually published environmental literary journal ''[[Whole Terrain]]''.

===Antioch University Los Angeles===
{{advert|date=August 2018}}
Established in 1972 and with more than 8,000 alumni, [[Antioch University Los Angeles]] serves the diverse communities of the greater [[Los Angeles]] area. The core values of [[social justice]], service to community, and [[lifelong learning]] comprise the heart of the BA degree completion program and master's degree programs in organizational management, education and teacher credentialing, psychology, and creative writing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.antioch.edu/los-angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with community organizations provide students with unique experiential learning opportunities. The low-residency MFA in creative writing was named among the top five programs in the nation by ''[[The Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/08/the-best-of-the-best/6049/&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduate clinical psychology specialization in [[LGBT]] studies is the first of its kind.  The MA in [[urban sustainability]] was developed in response to the growing awareness of the interconnections among environmental, economic, and social issues. The interdisciplinary program prepares well-trained, well-informed scholars, community leaders, and activists to advocate for sustainable urban policy and social change in the face of the growing global environmental crisis. The current student body consists of approximately 1000 learners, and supports a collection of faculty who are arguably in the top echelon of their fields. The school also offers a B.A. in Liberal Studies as well as Masters of Arts in Psychology, Organizational Management, and Urban Sustainability.

===Antioch University Midwest===
Founded in 1988, [[Antioch University Midwest]] (AUM) is located in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Antioch University Midwest offers bachelor's degrees in Humanities, Management, Human Development, Liberal Arts, Health and Wellness, and Human Service Administration through an academically intensive cohort model of on-campus classes offered in the evenings and on Saturdays. They also offer two online Certificates in Education, as well as an MBA with concentrations in healthcare leadership and change management. The MA in Individualized Liberal and Professional Studies provides a self-designed major where students work with Antioch University faculty as well as specialized academic professionals who agree to mentor the student through their studies. Many of the graduate programs are available with limited residency in an online format. Antioch University Midwest was previously known as Antioch University McGregor and was founded in 1988 as the School of Adult and Experiential Learning at Antioch College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/antioch-university-mcgregor-changes-its-name-759064.html|title=Antioch University McGregor changes its name}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antioch University Midwest]] (name changed June 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antioch University Santa Barbara===
Founded in 1977, [[Antioch University Santa Barbara]] enrolls approximately 270 adult students from Santa Barbara and surrounding counties, as well as assorted students from other regions of the United States and some foreign countries. The campus offers a BA in liberal studies with seven possible concentrations, MA in clinical psychology with two possible concentrations, a [[PsyD]] in clinical psychology, an MA in education and teaching credential program, and an MBA program, and a Women and Leadership Certificate program.

===Antioch University Seattle===
[[Antioch University Seattle]] (AUS), founded in 1975 in [[Seattle, Washington]], offers master's degrees, a BA completion program, and a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (PsyD). Between 800 and 1000 students attend AUS, with an average age of 35. The School of Applied Psychology, Counseling and Family Therapy is the largest and longest running program with close to 3,000 graduates since 1976. The School offers master's degrees in mental health counseling, integrative studies, child, couple and family therapy, art therapy and drama therapy in addition to the PsyD program. The Center for Programs in Education offers teacher preparation at the graduate level, plus a master's in education for experienced educators. The Center for Creative Change features a low-residency, interdisciplinary approach to learning and offers master's degrees in environment and community, management and leadership, organizational development, and whole systems design. The BA in Liberal Studies program attracts students who like an individualized approach to completing their undergraduate degree. Students can receive credit for life experience and may pursue subjects of particular interest to them.

==University-wide programs==

===Graduate School of Leadership and Change===
A low-residency, cross-sector PhD dedicated to engaging working professionals in the interdisciplinary study, research and practice of leading positive change in workplaces, schools, organizations, and communities, across the country and world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/gslc/|title=Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antioch University Online===
Antioch University Online is a 100% online learning environment offering bachelor's completion degrees and graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/auonline/|title=Antioch University Online {{!}} A University in Pursuit of a Better World|website=www.antioch.edu/auonline|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antioch College separation and reorganization==
In June 2007, the Antioch University Board of Trustees announced that they would suspend operations of [[Antioch College]] the following year and that they intended to re-open the college in four years. It was their belief that four years would give the university the necessary time to develop and execute a plan for re-building Antioch College in a manner that would both honor its legacy and secure its future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232943/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |archive-date=2010-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable controversy among members of the Antioch College alumni group and the administration, suggesting that the university should not close the college. During this time – 2007-2009 – two different organizations (the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] [NCA] and the [[American Association of University Professors]] [AAUP]) conducted audits and investigations into the university's actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916125129/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |archive-date=2009-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a response from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antioch.edu/AAUP.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917070006/http://antioch.edu/AAUP.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a group of Antioch College alumni, headed by the Antioch College Alumni Board, expressed interest in purchasing the college from the university and re-opening the college as an independent institution. The alumni group formed the Antioch College Continuation Corporation as the vehicle for negotiating and owning the college. After two years of negotiations, the parties agreed to terms and, on September 4, 2009, the parties conducted a signing ceremony that ratified their agreement. [[Mark Roosevelt]], a well-known senior education administrator, previously the superintendent of [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]], was appointed President. A reopened and separate Antioch College welcomed its first class of students in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/reopening-antioch-college-would-set-historic-precedent-1074650.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basic precipitation''' or '''Alkaline precipitation''' occurs when either [[calcium oxide]] or [[sodium hydroxide]] is emitted into the [[atmosphere]], absorbed by water droplets in [[cloud]]s, and then falls as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rain, snow, or sleet]]. Precipitation containing these compounds can increase the [[pH]] of [[soil]] or bodies of water and lead to increased [[fungus|fungal growth]].

The principal cause of basic rain is emissions from factories and waste deposits. Mineral dust containing large amounts of alkaline compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] can also increase the pH of precipitation and contribute to basic rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özsoy|first=Türkan|last2=Cemal Saydam|first2=A|date=2000-05-15|title=Acidic and alkaline precipitation in the Cilician Basin, north-eastern Mediterranean Sea|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969700003806|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=253|issue=1–3|pages=93–109|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00380-6|bibcode=2000ScTEn.253...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic rain can be viewed as opposite to [[acid rain]].
Acid rain has posed a serious threat to numerous ecosystems surrounding rivers, lakes and forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acid Rain|url=http://www3.epa.gov/acidrain/|website=U.S Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=[[EPA]]|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruno Latour''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|ʊər}}; {{IPA-fr|latuʁ|lang}}; born 22 June 1947) is a French  [[philosopher of science|philosopher]], [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is especially known for his work in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies|science and technology studies]] (STS).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], "Science and Technology Studies", in ''The Knowledge book. Key concepts in philosophy, science and culture'', Acumen (UK) and McGill-Queens University Press (NA), 2007, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching at the [[École des Mines de Paris]] ([[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]]) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris|Sciences Po Paris]] (2006–2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;See Latour's "Biography" [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography Bruno Latour's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a Centennial Professor at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/instructor/brunolatour|title=Bruno Latour, Instructor - Coursera|website=Coursera|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.nd.edu/events/2016/11/03/bruno-latour/|title=Bruno Latour // Events // Department of English // University of Notre Dame|first=ENR/PAZ // Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|last=Dame|website=english.nd.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour is best known for his books ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' (1991; English translation, 1993), ''[[Laboratory Life]]'' (with [[Steve Woolgar]], 1979) and ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"&gt;Heather Vidmar-McEwen,[http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour"], "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour", Indiana University Anthropology Department&lt;/ref&gt; Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with [[social constructionist]]&lt;ref name="Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt; approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour has diverged significantly from such approaches. He is best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"/&gt; Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with [[Michel Callon]] and [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], Latour is one of the primary developers of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the [[ethnomethodology]] of [[Harold Garfinkel]], the generative [[semiotics]] of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and (more recently) the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]]'s rival [[Gabriel Tarde]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

Latour's [[monograph]]s earned him a 10th place among most-cited book authors in the humanities and social sciences for the year 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Latour is related to a well-known family of winemakers from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], but is not associated with the similarly named estate in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A. &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. ''Bruno Latour: hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world''. London: Routledge, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student, Latour originally focused on philosophy and was deeply influenced by [[Michel Serres]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Latour received his Ph.D. in [[theology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|title=Bruno Latour’s anthropology of the moderns|url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/bruno-latours-anthropology-of-the-moderns|website=Radicalphilosophy.com|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[François Rabelais University|Université de Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm|title="Bruno Latour" by Heather Vidmar-McEwen|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly developed an interest in [[anthropology]], and undertook fieldwork in [[Ivory Coast]] which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization, race, and industrial relations.&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt;

After spending more than twenty years at the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]] at the [[École des Mines]] in [[Paris]], Latour moved in 2006 to [[Sciences Po]], where he was the first occupant of a chair named for [[Gabriel Tarde]].  In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie]] in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]], including "Iconoclash" (2002) and "Making Things Public" (2005). In 2005 he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html|title=The Spinoza Chair - Philosophy - University of Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|last=Amsterdam|website=www.uva.nl|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
On 22 May 2008, Latour was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Université de Montréal]] on the occasion of an [[organizational communication]] conference held in honor of the work of [[James R. Taylor]], on whom Latour has had an important influence. He holds several other honorary doctorates, as well as France's [[Légion d'Honneur]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography|title=Biography - bruno-latour.fr|website=www.bruno-latour.fr|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2013, he was announced as the winner of the 2013 [[Holberg Prize]].&lt;ref name="holberg1"&gt;[http://www.holbergprisen.no/en/holberg-prize-2013.html Bruno Latour wins the 2013 Holberg Prize], ''Holberg Prize''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/03/13/l-anthropologue-francais-bruno-latour-distingue-en-norvege_1847284_3224.html|title=L'anthropologue français Bruno Latour reçoit le prix Holberg en Norvège|website=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Holbergprisen-til-Bruno-Latour-7146138.html|title=Holbergprisen til Bruno Latour|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize committee stated that "Bruno Latour has undertaken an ambitious analysis and reinterpretation of modernity, and has challenged fundamental concepts such as the distinction between modern and pre-modern, nature and society, human and non-human." The committee states that "the impact of Latour's work is evident internationally and far beyond studies of the history of science, art history, history, philosophy, anthropology, geography, theology, literature and law."&lt;ref name="holberg1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbergprisen.no/en/bruno-latour Holberg International Memorial Prize 2013: Bruno Latour.

A 2013 article in [[Aftenposten]] by [[Jon Elster]] criticised the conferment to Latour, by saying "The question is, does he deserve the prize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den uforståelige Latour|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/Den-uforstaelige-Latour-7183458.html#.UXsG0Uqg1t0|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|date=24 April 2013|page=7 Debatt|quote=Spørsmålet er om han fortjener prisen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; …"If the statutes [of the award] had used new knowledge as a main criteria, instead of one of several, then he would be completely unqualified in my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den uforståelige Latour|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/Den-uforstaelige-Latour-7183458.html#.UXsG0Uqg1t0|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|date=24 April 2013|page=7 Debatt|quote=Hvis statuttene hadde brukt ny kunnskap som hovedkriterium, i stedet for ett av flere kriterier, ville han etter min mening ha vært fullstendig ukvalifisert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main works ==

===''Laboratory Life''===
After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists.  Latour rose in importance{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} following the 1979 publication of ''Laboratory Life:  the Social Construction of Scientific Facts'' with co-author [[Steve Woolgar]]. In the book, the authors undertake an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] study of a [[neuroendocrinology]] research laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]].&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt; This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the [[scientific method]], in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.

In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.

Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences.  Drawing on the work of [[Gaston Bachelard]], they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are ''socially constructed'' within the laboratory—that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them.  They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices— in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book ''Science in Action:  How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society'' is one of the key texts of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: "Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor."

Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Paul R. and Levitt, Norman (1997). ''[[Higher Superstition]]: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science.'' Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, philosopher [[John Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (2009) "Why Should You Believe It?" ''The New York Review of Books'', 24 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Latour's "extreme social constructivist" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently "comical results."

===''The Pasteurization of France''===
After a research project examining the sociology of [[primatology|primatologists]], Latour followed up the themes in ''Laboratory Life'' with ''Les Microbes: guerre et paix'' (published in English as ''The Pasteurization of France'' in 1988).  In it, he reviews the life and career of one of France's most famous scientists [[Louis Pasteur]] and his discovery of microbes, in the fashion of a political biography.  Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteur's career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted.  By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteur's work more easily in some quarters than in others, he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily, or even usually, a matter of experiment, evidence or reason.  Another work, [[Aramis, or the Love of Technology|''Aramis, or, The Love of Technology'']] focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project.

===''We Have Never Been Modern''===
Latour's work ''Nous n’avons jamais été modernes : Essais d’anthropologie symétrique'' was first published in French in 1991, and then in English in 1993 as ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''.

Latour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape.  He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the [[scientific method]] to knowledge and work, blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;	

Latour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism (or amodernism) over [[postmodernism]], [[modernism]], or antimodernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 134}} His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 114}} Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=69}} He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit, rationality, liberty, society, God, or even the past.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47}} Postmoderns, according to Latour, also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} In contrast, the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=138}} Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=140}}

Latour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old object/subject and Nature/Society compacts of modernity, which can be traced back to Plato.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"/&gt;{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=79}} He refused the concept of "out there" versus "in here".&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; He rendered the object/subject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge, work, and circulating reference.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"/&gt; Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field, one vastly different than that of post-moderns.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical, a creation of an unknown territory, which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}}

In 1998, historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latour's politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is "a fanciful escape from modern Western history".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Margaret C (1998). "Latour's Version of the Seventeenth Century," pp. 240-254 in ''A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths About Science'', [[Noretta Koertge]] (editor), NY: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195117255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pandora's Hope''===

''Pandora's Hope'' (1999) marks a return to the themes Latour explored in ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' and ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''. It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative, anecdotal approach in a number of the essays, describing his work with [[pedology (soil study)|pedologists]] in the Amazon rainforest, the development of the pasteurization process, and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific, anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline: "The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best, that is, paying close attention to the details of scientific practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;24). Some authors have criticized Latour's methodology, including Katherine Pandora, a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of ''Pandora's Hope'', Katherine Pandora states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Latour's] writing can be stimulating, fresh and at times genuinely moving, but it can also display a distractingly mannered style in which a rococo zeal for compounding metaphors, examples, definitions and abstractions can frustrate even readers who approach his work with the best of intentions (notwithstanding the inclusion of a nine-page glossary of terms and liberal use of diagrams in an attempt to achieve the utmost clarity)".&lt;ref name="Pandora"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515142825/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to his epistemological concerns, Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in ''Pandora's Hope''. Two of the chapters draw on Plato's ''Gorgias'' as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is hard not to be caught up in the author's obvious delight in deploying a classic work from antiquity to bring current concerns into sharper focus, following along as he manages to leave the reader with the impression that the protagonists Socrates and Callicles are not only in dialogue with each other but with Latour as well."&lt;ref name="Pandora" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Latour frames his discussion with a classical model, his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance: global warming, the spread of mad cow disease, and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in ''Pandora's Hope''. In Felix Stalder's article "Beyond constructivism: towards a realistic realism", he summarizes Latour's position on the political dimension of science studies as follows: "These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them".&lt;ref name="Stalder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/pandora.html|title=Felix Stalder: Latour's Pandora's Hope (Review)|website=felix.openflows.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"===
In a 2004 article,&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (2004) [http://winteranthology.com/?vol=5&amp;author=latour&amp;title=critique "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern"]. ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 30, No. 2, Winter 2004, pp. 225-248&lt;/ref&gt; Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career, asking, "Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?" He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and, more generally, of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique, as currently practiced, is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality, Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal: "our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget." (p.&amp;nbsp;231) To regain focus and credibility, Latour argues that social critiques must embrace [[empiricism]], to insist on the "cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude -- to speak like [[William James]]". (p.&amp;nbsp;233)

Latour suggests that about 90% of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms "the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&amp;nbsp;237) The fairy position is [[fetishism|anti-fetishist]], arguing that "objects of belief" (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the "naive believer"; the "fact position" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender). (p.&amp;nbsp;238) "Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?” asks Latour: no matter which position you take, "You’re always right!” (p.&amp;nbsp;238-239) Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use "an unrepentant positivist" approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as "a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish." (p.&amp;nbsp;241) These inconsistencies and [[double standards]] go largely unrecognized in social critique because "there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&amp;nbsp;241)

The practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential "critical barbarity" that has—like a malign virus created by a "[[mad scientist]]"—thus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling, Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as [[conspiracy theorists]], including [[global warming skepticism|global warming skeptics]] and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: "Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique." (p.&amp;nbsp;230)

The conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique, to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined: "The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya, but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution."

===''Reassembling the Social''&lt;!--linked from 'Actor–network theory'--&gt;===
In ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005),&lt;ref name = "Primary"&gt;Latour, Bruno. '''Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network Theory''.  Oxford, UK: Oxford UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Latour continues a reappraisal of his work, developing what he calls a "practical [[metaphysics]]", which calls "real" anything that an actor (one whom we are studying) claims as a source of motivation for action.  So if someone says, "I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors" we are obliged to recognize the "[[ontological]] weight" of their claim, rather than attempting to replace their belief in God's presence with "social stuff", like class, gender, [[imperialism]], etc. Latour’s nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds, and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework, but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides: "Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected, their recalcitrance recognized, their objections deployed, their multiplicity accepted."&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt;

For Latour, to talk about [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]]–what really is–means paying close empirical attention to the various, contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latour's description of metaphysics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we call metaphysics the discipline . . . that purports to define the basic structure of the world, then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and, as ceaselessly, contest the existence of others.  The question then becomes how to explore the actors' own metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more traditional metaphysicist might object, arguing that this means there are multiple, contradictory realities, since there are "controversies over agencies" – since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action (God, nature, the state, sexual drives, personal ambition, and so on). This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latour's nuance: for Latour, there is no "basic structure of reality" or a single, self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities, or "worlds" in his terms, exists–one for each actor’s sources of [[agency (sociology)|agency]], inspirations for action. Actors bring "the real" (metaphysics) into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one "basic structure" that explains agency, but to recognize "the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors".&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt; Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to [[relativism]], Latour argues. The relativist researcher "learns the actors' language," records what they say about what they do, and does not appeal to a higher "structure" to "explain" the actor's motivations. The relativist "takes seriously what [actors] are obstinately saying" and "follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what 'makes them act'". The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being, and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation.

'''CASCI''', or '''The Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information''', is a multi-disciplinary research center located at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], United States. The center's goal is to increase understanding of community interactions and to harness the power of novel technologies to support the needs of real and virtual communities. The Center was inaugurated on November 13, 2008. 	The director is Derek Hansen, an assistant professor in the iSchool at the University of Maryland.

== Projects ==

Ongoing projects include:

*Improving Mass Vaccination Clinic Operations
*External Knowledge Management and Climate Change
* Libraries, Technology, and Older Adult Communities
*How and Why Physicists and Chemists Use Blogs

== Funding ==

At the inaugural ceremony, Dr. [[Marc Smith (American sociologist)|Marc Smith]], Chief Social Scientist for [[Telligent Systems]] and founder of the Community Technologies Group at [[Microsoft Research]], presented the CASCI Director with a $2,000 gift to support the Center's activities.

==Activities==

Each Tuesday morning there is a roundtable discussion; some of these feature speakers from funding agencies interested in community-related projects, while others are more informal discussions. Skill-building workshops are also held, in which professors or students with particular expertise present their ideas to the group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">'''Construction Operations Building Information Exchange''' ('''COBie''') is an international standard relating to managed asset information including space and equipment. It is closely associated with [[building information modeling]] (BIM) approaches to design, construction and management of built assets, and was devised by Bill East of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], who authored a pilot standard in June 2007.&lt;ref name=East2007&gt;{{cite web |last=East|first=E. William|title=Construction Operation Building Information Exchange|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA491932|publisher=USACE ERDC|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBie helps capture and record important project data at the point of origin, including equipment lists, product data sheets, warranties, spare parts lists, and preventive maintenance schedules. This information is essential to support operations, maintenance and asset management once the built asset is in service.&lt;ref name=NIBSe-news&gt;{{cite web |last=East|first=William|title=Corps of Engineers Pilots COBie|url=http://www.nibs.org/page/0612_COE_COBie/|work=Building Sciences Monthly e-Newsletter|publisher=NIBS|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2011, it was approved by the US-based [[National Institute of Building Sciences]] as part of its National Building Information Model (NBIMS-US) standard.&lt;ref name=ERDC&gt;{{cite web|title=CERL’s COBie is National Institute of Building Sciences Approved|url=http://erdc.usace.army.mil/news-2011/cerls-cobie-is-national-institute-of-building-sciences-approved/|work=Engineer Research &amp; Development Center|publisher=ERDC|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212025312/http://erdc.usace.army.mil/news-2011/cerls-cobie-is-national-institute-of-building-sciences-approved/#|archive-date=2012-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBie has been incorporated into software for planning, design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, and asset management. COBie may take several approved formats include spreadsheet, STEP-Part 21 (also called [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] file format), and ifcXML.  In early 2013 [[BuildingSMART]] was working on a lightweight XML format for COBie, COBieLite, which became available for review in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=East|first=Bill|title=COBieLite: A lightweight XML format for COBie data|url=http://buildingsmartalliance.org/index.php/projects/cobielite/|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a code of practice regarding COBie was issued as a British Standard: "[[BS 1192]]-4:2014 Collaborative production of information Part 4: Fulfilling employer’s information exchange requirements using COBie – Code of practice".&lt;ref name=1192-4&gt;{{cite web|title=BS 1192-4:2014 Collaborative production of information.

'''Chaetognatha''', meaning ''bristle-jaws'', and commonly known as '''arrow worms''', is a phylum of predatory [[marine worm]]s that are a major component of [[plankton]] worldwide. About 20% of the known species are [[benthic zone|benthic]], and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from {{convert|2|to|120|mm|in|1}}.

There are more than 120 modern species assigned to over 20 genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Register of Marine Species|url=http://www.marinespecies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the limited diversity of species, the number of individuals is large.&lt;ref name="Bone"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bone |editor1-first=Q. |editor2-last=Kapp |editor2-first=H. |editor3-last=Pierrot-Bults |editor3-first=A. C. |year=1991 |title=The Biology of Chaetognaths |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |place=London |isbn=978-0-19-857715-7 |ref=Bone, Kapp &amp; Pierrot-Bults}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrow worms are usually considered a type of [[protostome]] that do not belong to either [[Ecdysozoa]] or [[Lophotrochozoa]].

==Anatomy==
[[File:MEB back.png|thumb|left|180px|The jaw organ of a Chaetognath of the genus ''[[Sagitta (genus)|Sagitta]]]]''
Chaetognaths are transparent or translucent dart-shaped animals covered by a [[cuticle]]. The body is divided into a distinct head, trunk, and tail. There are between four and fourteen hooked, grasping spines on each side of their head, flanking a hollow vestibule containing the mouth. The spines are used in hunting, and covered with a flexible hood arising from the neck region when the animal is swimming. All chaetognaths are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], preying on other planktonic animals.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1046–1050|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trunk bears one or two pairs of lateral fins incorporating structures superficially similar to the [[fin ray]]s of fish, with which they are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]], however: unlike those of vertebrates, these are composed of a thickened [[basement membrane]] extending from the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. An additional caudal fin covers the post-anal tail.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Two chaetognath species, ''Caecosagitta macrocephala'' and ''Eukrohnia fowleri'', have [[bioluminescent]] organs on their fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haddock, S. H. D.  |author2=J. F. Case |date=20 January 1994 |title=A bioluminescent chaetognath |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=367 |issue=6460 |pages=225–226 |doi=10.1038/367225a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thuesen, E. V. |author2=F. E. Goetz |author3=S. H. D. Haddock |author3link=Steven Haddock |last-author-amp=yes |date=October 2010 |title=Bioluminescent organs of two deep-sea arrow worms, ''Eukrohnia fowleri'' and ''Caecosagitta macrocephala'', with further observations on bioluminescence in chaetognaths |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=219 |pages=100–111 |pmid=20972255 |issue=2|doi=10.1086/BBLv219n2p100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaetognaths swim in short bursts using a dorso-ventral undulating body motion, where their tail fin assists with propulsion and the body fins with stabilization and steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jordan, C. E. |year=1992 |title=A model of rapid-start swimming at intermediate Reynolds number: undulatory locomotion in the chaetognath ''Sagitta elegans'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=119–137 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/163/1/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are known to use the [[neurotoxin]] [[tetrodotoxin]] to subdue prey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bone, Kapp &amp; Pierrot-Bults|Thuesen, E. V. 1991]], "The Tetrodotoxin Venom of Chaetognaths," pp. 55–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The body cavity is lined by [[peritoneum]], and therefore represents a true [[coelom]], and is divided into one compartment on each side of the trunk, and additional compartments inside the head and tail, all separated completely by septa.  Although they have a mouth with one or two rows of tiny teeth, compound eyes, and a nervous system, they have no respiratory or circulatory systems.

The mouth opens into a muscular [[pharynx]], which contains glands to lubricate the passage of food. From here, a straight intestine runs the length of the trunk to an [[anus]] just forward of the tail. The intestine is the primary site of digestion and includes a pair of [[diverticulum|diverticula]] near the anterior end.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Materials are moved about the body cavity by [[cilia]]. Waste materials are simply excreted through the skin and anus.

The nervous system is reasonably simple, consisting of a [[ganglion]]ated nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. The dorsal ganglion is the largest, but nerves extend from all the ganglia along the length of the body. Chaetognaths have two compound eyes, each consisting of a number of pigment-cup [[ocelli]] fused together. In addition, there are a number of sensory bristles arranged in rows along the side of the body, where they probably perform a function similar to that of the [[lateral line]] in fish. An additional, curved, band of sensory bristles lies over the head and neck.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The arrow worm [[rhabdomere]]s are derived from [[microtubule]]s 20&amp;nbsp;nm long and 50&amp;nbsp;nm wide, which in turn form conical bodies that contain granules and thread structures. The cone body is derived from a [[cilium]].&lt;ref&gt;"Photoreception". Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] . 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
All species are [[hermaphroditic]], carrying both [[ovum|eggs]] and [[spermatozoon|sperm]].&lt;ref name="Bone" /&gt; Each animal possesses a pair of [[testis|testes]] within the tail, and a pair of [[ovary|ovaries]] in the posterior region of the main body cavity. Immature sperm are released from the testes to mature inside the cavity of the tail, and then swim through a short duct to a [[seminal vesicle]] where they are packaged into a [[spermatophore]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;(Sexually and Asexually)

During mating, each individual places a spermatophore onto the neck of its partner after rupture of the seminal vesicle. The sperm rapidly escape from the spermatophore and swim along the midline of the animal until they reach a pair of small pores just in front of the tail. These pores connect to the [[oviduct]]s, into which the developed eggs have already passed from the ovaries, and it is here that fertilisation takes place.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The eggs are planktonic, or attached to [[alga]]e, and hatch into miniature versions of the adult, without a well-defined [[larva]]l stage.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

== Classification ==
Chaetognaths are traditionally classed as [[deuterostomes]] by [[embryologist]]s. [[Lynn Margulis]] and K. V. Schwartz place chaetognaths in the deuterostomes in their ''Five Kingdom'' classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Phylum Chaetognatha per Margulis and Schwartz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127153818/http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 |date=November 27, 2005 }} (select Margulis &amp; Schwartz in 'Classification by')—last retrieved November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular [[phylogeny|phylogenist]]s, however, consider them to be [[protostomes]]. [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] places them in the protostomes in his ''Six Kingdom'' classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Phylum Chaetognatha per Cavalier-Smith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127153818/http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 |date=November 27, 2005 }} (select Cavalier-Smith in 'Classification by')—last retrieved November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities between chaetognaths and nematodes mentioned above may support the protostome thesis—in fact, chaetognaths are sometimes regarded as a basal [[ecdysozoa]]n or [[lophotrochozoa]]n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matus, D. Q.|date=8 August 2006|title=Broad taxon and gene sampling indicate that chaetognaths are protostomes|journal =[[Current Biology]]|volume=16|issue=15|pages=R575–R576|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.017|pmid=16890509|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaetognatha appears close to the base of the protostome tree in most studies of their molecular phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marletaz, F. |date=8 August 2006|title=Chaetognath phylogenomics: a protostome with deuterostome-like development|journal=[[Current Biology]]|volume=16 |issue=15 |pages=R577–R578 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.016 |pmid=16890510|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain their deuterostome embryonic characters. If chaetognaths branched off from the protostomes before they evolved their distinctive protostome embryonic characters, they might have retained deuterostome characters inherited from early [[bilateria]]n ancestors.

== Fossil record ==
Due to their soft bodies, chaetognaths fossilize poorly. Even so, several fossil chaetognath species have been described.&lt;ref name="Vannier2007" /&gt; Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the [[Cambrian]] Period. Complete body fossils have been formally described from the Lower [[Cambrian]] [[Maotianshan shales]] of [[Yunnan, China]] (''Eognathacantha ercainella'' Chen &amp; Huang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=J.-Y. |last2=Huang |first2=D.-Y. |date=4 October 2002 |title=A possible Lower Cambrian chaetognath (arrow worm) |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=298 |issue =5591 |page=187|pmid=12364798|doi=10.1126/science.1075059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Protosagitta spinosa'' Hu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=S.-X. |year=2005 |title=Taphonomy and palaeoecology of the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Biota from Eastern Yunnan, China |journal=Berliner Paläobiologische Abhandlungen |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Middle Cambrian [[Burgess Shale]] of British Columbia (''[[Oesia|Oesia disjuncta]]'' Walcott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szaniawski |first1=H. |year=2005 |title=Cambrian chaetognaths recognized in Burgess Shale fossils |journal=[[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]] |volume=50 |issue =1 |pages=1–8 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-001.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a view challenged by Conway Morris (2009). A more recent chaetognath, ''Paucijaculum samamithion'' Schram, has been described from the Mazon Creek biota from the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] of Illinois. Chaetognaths were thought possibly to be related to some of the animals grouped with the [[conodont]]s. The conodonts themselves, however, are thought to be related to the [[vertebrates]]. It is now thought that [[protoconodont]] elements (e.g., ''[[Protohertzina]] anabarica'' Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than teeth of conodonts. Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements, but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szaniawski |first1=H. |year=2002 |title=New evidence for the protoconodont origin of chaetognaths |journal=[[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]] |volume=47 |issue=3 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app47/app47-405.pdf |format=PDF| pages=405–419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J. R.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

'''Communal roosting''' is an animal behavior where a group of individuals, typically of the same species, congregate in an area for a few hours based on an external signal and will return to the same site with the reappearance of the signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communal life: Honest signaling and the recruitment center hypothesis|last = Richner|first = Heinz|date = March 1996|journal = Behavioral Ecology|doi = 10.1093/beheco/7.1.115|pmid = |last2 = Heeb|first2 = Phillip |volume=7 |pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental signals are often responsible for this grouping, including nightfall, high tide, or rainfall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The distinction between communal roosting and [[cooperative breeding]] is the absence of chicks in communal roosts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While communal roosting is generally observed in birds, the behavior has also been seen in bats, primates, and insects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The evolution of communal roosting in birds: origin and secondary losses|last = Beauchamp|first = Guy|date = 1999|journal = Behavioral Ecology|doi = 10.1093/beheco/10.6.675|pmid = |volume=10|issue = 6|pages=675–687}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of these roosts can measure in the thousands to millions of individuals, especially among avian species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ornitologia.org/mm/file/queoferim/divulgacio/publicacions/rco/28_28_33.pdf|title = The use of digital photography in censuses of large concentrations of passerines: the case of a winter starling roost-site|last = Pérez-García|first = Juan|date = 2012|journal = Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many benefits associated with communal roosting including: increased [[foraging]] ability, decreased [[Endotherm|thermoregulatory demands]], decreased [[predation]], and increased [[Biological specificity#Conspecific|conspecific]] interactions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Year-round used large communal roosts of Black-billed Magpie Pica pica in an urban habitat|last = Ientile|first = Renzo|date = 2014|journal = Avocetta|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many proposed evolutionary concepts for how communal roosting evolved, no specific hypothesis is currently supported by the scientific community as a whole.

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Information centre hypothesis}}
One of the adaptive explanations for communal roosting is the hypothesis that individuals are benefited by the exchange of information at communal roosts. This idea is known as the  [[information center hypothesis]] (ICH)  and proposed by Peter Ward and [[Amotz Zahavi]] in 1973 states that bird assemblages such as communal roosts act as information hubs for distributing knowledge about food source location. When food patch knowledge is unevenly distributed amongst certain flock members, the other "clueless" flock members can follow and join these knowledgeable members to find good feeding locations. To quote Ward and Zahavi on the evolutionary reasons as to how communal roosts came about, "...communal roosts, breeding  colonies and certain other bird assemblages have been evolved primarily for the efficient exploitation of  unevenly-distributed  food sources by  serving as ' information-centres.' "&lt;ref name="WZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Peter|last2=Zahavi|first2=Amotz|year=1973|title=The importance of certain assemblages of birds as "Information -Centres" for food finding|url=|journal=Ibis|volume=115|issue=4|pages=517–534|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919x.1973.tb01990.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The two strategies hypothesis ===
[[File:Communal Roosting Under the Two Strategies Hypothesis.png|thumb|A stylized example of a communal roost under the two strategies hypothesis, with the more dominant individuals occupying the higher and safer roosts.]]The two strategies hypothesis was put forth by Patrick Weatherhead in 1983 as an alternative to the then popular information center hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that different individuals join and participate in communal roosts for different reasons that are based primarily on their social status. Unlike the ICH, not all individuals will join a roost in order to increase their foraging capabilities. This hypothesis explains that while roosts initially evolved due to information sharing among older and more experienced foragers, this evolution was aided by the benefits that more experienced foragers gained due to the fact that as better forages they acquired a status of high rank within the roost. As dominant individuals, they are able to obtain the safest roosts, typically those highest in the tree or closest to the center of the roost. In these roosts, the less dominant and unsuccessful foragers act as a physical predation buffer for the dominant individuals. This is similar to the [[selfish herd theory]], which states that individuals within herds will utilize conspecifics as physical barriers from predation. The younger and less dominant individuals will still join the roost because they gain some safety from predation through the [[Anti-predator adaptation|dilution effect]], as well as the ability to learn from the more experienced foragers that are already in the roost.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2461125|title = Two Principal Strategies in Avian Communal Roosts|last = Weatherhead|first = Patrick|date = February 1983|journal = The American Naturalist|doi = 10.1086/284053|pmid = |pages =237–247|volume=121|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the two strategies hypothesis has been shown in studies of roosting rooks (''[[Rook (bird)|Corvus frugilegus]]''). A 1977 study of roosting rooks by Ian Swingland showed that an inherent hierarchy exists within rook communal roosts. In this hierarchy, the most dominant individuals have been shown to routinely occupy the roosts highest in the tree, and while they pay a cost (increased energy use to keep warm) they are safer from terrestrial predators.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social and spatial organization of winter communal roosting in Rooks (Corvus frugilegus)|last = Swingland|first = Ian R.|date = August 1977|journal = Journal of Zoology|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04167.x|pmid = |pages =509–528|volume=182|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this enforced hierarchy, lower ranking rooks remained with the roost, indicating that they still received some benefit from their participation in the roost.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt; When weather conditions worsened, the more dominant rooks forced the younger and less dominant out of their roosts. Swingland proposed that the risk of predation at lower roosts was outweighed by the gains in reduced thermal demands.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Similar support for the two strategies hypothesis has also been found in red-winged blackbird roosts. In this species the more dominant males will regularly inhabit roosts in thicker brush, where they are better hidden from predators than the less dominant individuals, that are forced to roost at the edge of the brush.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherhead, Patrick J., and Drew J. Hoysak. "Dominance structuring of a red-winged blackbird roost." ''The Auk'' (1984): 551-555.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TSH makes several assumptions that must be met in order for the theory to work. The first major assumption is that within communal roosts there are certain roosts that possess safer or more beneficial qualities than other roosts. The second assumption is that the more dominant individuals will be capable of securing these roosts, and finally dominance rank must be a reliable indicator of foraging ability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The recruitment center hypothesis (RCH) ===
Proposed by Heinz Richner and Phillip Heeb in 1996, the recruitment center hypothesis (RCH) explains the evolution of communal roosting as a result of [[Foraging|group foraging]]. The RCH also explains behaviors seen at communal roosts such as: the passing of information, aerial displays, and the presence or lack of calls by leaders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This hypothesis assumes:
* Patchy feeding area: Food is not evenly distributed across an area but grouped into patches
* Short-lasting: Patches are not present for an extended period of time
* Relatively abundant: There are many patches with relatively equal amounts of food present in each&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
These factors decrease relative food competition since control over a food source by an individual is not correlated to the duration or richness of said source.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The passing of information acts to create a foraging group. Group foraging decreases predation and increases relative feeding time at the cost of sharing a food source. The decrease in predation is due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation|dilution factor]] and an early warning system created by having multiple animals alert. Increases in relative feeding are explained by decreasing time spent watching for predators and social learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recruiting new members to food patches benefits successful foragers by increasing relative numbers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the addition of new members to a group the benefits of group foraging increase until the group size is larger than the food source is able to support. Less successful foragers benefit by gaining knowledge of where food sources are located.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aerial displays are used to recruit individuals to participate in group foraging. However, not all birds display since not all birds are members in a group or are part of a group that is seeking participants. In the presence of patchy resources, Richner and Heeb propose the simplest manner would be to form a communal roost and recruit participants there.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, recruitment to foraging groups explains the presence of these communal roosts.

Support for the RCH has been shown in ravens (''[[Raven|Covus corax]]''). Reviewing a previous study by [[John Marzluff]], Bernd Heinrich, and Colleen Marzluff, Etienne Danchin and Heinz Richner demonstrate that the collected data proves the RCH instead of the Information Center Hypothesis supported by Marzluff, et al. Both knowledgeable and naïve ("clueless") birds are shown to make up the roosts and leave them at the same time, with the naïve birds being led to the food sources. Aerial demonstrations were shown to peak around the same time as the discovery of a new food source.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237135235|title = Viable and unviable hypotheses for the evolution of raven roosts|last = Danchin|first = Etienne|date = 2001|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Richner|first2 = Heinz|volume = 61|pages=F7–F11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities were made up of non-breeders which forage in patchily distributed food environments, following the assumptions made by Richner and Heeb.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At this point in time there has been no additional scientific evidence excluding RCH or any evidence of overwhelming support. What is overlooked by RCH is that information may also be passed within the communal roost which increases and solidifies the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can information sharing explain recruitment to food from communal roosts?|url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/42|journal = Behavioral Ecology|date = 2002-01-01|issn = 1045-2249|pages = 42–51|volume = 13|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/beheco/13.1.42|first = Sasha R. X.|last = Dall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==

Birds in a communal roost can reduce the impact of wind and cold weather by sharing body heat through huddling, which reduces the overall energy demand of thermoregulation. A study by Guy Beauchamp explained that black-billed magpies (''[[Black-billed magpie|Pica hudsonia]]'') often formed the largest roosts during the winter. The magpies tend to react very slowly at low body temperatures, leaving them vulnerable to predators. Communal roosting in this case would improve their reactivity by sharing body heat, allowing them to detect and respond to predators much more quickly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A large roost with many members can visually detect predators easier, allowing individuals to respond and alert others quicker to threats.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individual risk is also lowered due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation#Dilution effect|dilution effect]], which states that an individual in a large group will have a low probability of being preyed upon. Similar to the [[Selfish herd theory|selfish-herd theory]], communal roosts have demonstrated a hierarchy of sorts where older members and better foragers nest in the interior of the group, decreasing their exposure to predators. Younger birds and less able foragers located on the outskirts still demonstrate some safety from predation due to the dilution effect.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

According to the ICH, successful foragers share knowledge of favorable foraging sites with unsuccessful foragers at a communal roost, making it energetically advantageous for individuals to communally roost and forage more easily. Additionally with a greater number of individuals at a roost, the searching range of a roost will increase and improve the probability of finding favorable foraging sites.&lt;ref name="WZ" /&gt;

There are also potentially improved mating opportunities, as demonstrated by red-billed choughs (''[[Red-billed chough|Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax]])'', which have a portion of a communal roost dedicated to individuals that lack mates and territories.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;

== Potential costs ==

It is costly for territorial species to physically travel to and from roosts, and in leaving their territories they open themselves up to takeovers. Communal roosts may draw the attention of potential predators, as the roost becomes audibly and visibly more conspicuous due to the number of members. There is also a decrease in the local food supply as a greater number of members results in competition for food.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A large number of roost members can also increases the exposure to droppings, causing plumage to deteriorate and leaving birds vulnerable to dying from exposure as droppings reduce the ability of feathers to shed water.&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

=== Birds ===
[[File:Corvus frugilegus sundown.JPG|thumb|203x203px|Rooks forming a nocturnal roost in Hungary]]
[[File:Djocoe oujheas ås vatches ciprès did lon.jpg|thumb|Western Cattle Egret night roosting in Morocco]]Communal roosting has been observed in numerous avian species. As previously mentioned, rooks (''[[Rook (bird)|Corvus frugilegus]]'') are known to form large nocturnal roosts, these roosts can contain anywhere from a few hundred to over a thousand individuals.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coombs | first1 = C.

Studies have shown that communal roosting behavior is mediated by light intensity, which is correlated with sunset, where rooks will return to the roost when the ambient light has sufficiently dimmed.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swingland | first1 = Ian R | year = 1976 | title = The influence of light intensity on the roosting times of the Rook (Corvus frugilegus) | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(76)80109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acorn woodpeckers (''[[Acorn woodpecker|Melanerpes formicivorus]]'') are known to form communal roosts during the winter months. In these roosts two to three individuals will share a cavity during the winter. Within these tree cavities woodpeckers share their body heat with each other and therefore decrease the thermoregulatory demands on the individuals within the roost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plessis | last2 = Morné | first2 = A. | last3 = Weathers | first3 = Wesley W. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = Walter D. | year = 1994| title = Energetic benefits of communal roosting by acorn woodpeckers during the nonbreeding season | url = | journal = Condor | volume = 1994 | issue = 3| pages = 631–637 | doi=10.2307/1369466| jstor = 1369466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small scale communal roosting during the winter months has also been observed in Green Woodhoopoes ([[Green wood hoopoe|Phoeniculus purpureus]]). Winter communal roosts in these species typically contain around five individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Du Plessis | first1 = Morné A. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Joseph B. | year = 1994| title = Communal cavity roosting in green woodhoopoes: consequences for energy expenditure and the seasonal pattern of mortality | url = | journal = The Auk | volume = 1994 | issue = 2| pages = 292–299 | doi=10.2307/4088594| jstor = 4088594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree swallows ([[Tree swallow|''Tachycineta bicolor'']]) located in southeastern Louisiana are known to form nocturnal communal roosts and have been shown to exhibit high roost fidelity, with individuals often returning to the same roost they had occupied on the previous night. Research has shown that swallows form communal roosts due to the combined factors of conspecific attraction, where individual swallows are likely to aggregate around other swallows of the same species, and roost fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laughlin | first1 = A.

Red-billed choughs ([[Red-billed chough|''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'']]) roost in what has been classified as either a main roost or a sub roost. Main roosts are constantly in use, whereas the sub roosts are used irregularly by individuals lacking both a mate and territory. These sub roosts are believed to help improve the ability of non-breeding choughs to find a mate and increase their territory ranges.&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Guillermo | last2 = Tella | first2 = Jose L. | year = 1999 | title = Temporal, spatial and social segregation of red-billed choughs between two types of communal roost: a role for mating and territory acquisition | url = | journal = The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 1219–1227 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1103| pmid = 10373254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspecies roosts have been observed between different bird species. In San Blas, Mexico, the great egret (''[[Great egret|Ardea alba]]''), the little blue heron (''[[Little blue heron|Egretta caerulea]]''), the tricolored heron (''[[Tricolored heron|Egretta tricolor]]''), and the snowy egret (''[[Snowy egret|Egretta thula]]'') are known to form large communal roosts. It has been shown that the snowy egret determines the general location of the roost due to the fact that the other three species rely on it for its abilities to find food sources. In these roosts there is often a hierarchical system, where the more dominant species (in this case the snowy egret) will typically occupy the more desirable higher perches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burger | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Intraspecific and interspecific interactions at a mixed species roost of ciconiiformes in San Blas, Mexico | url = | journal = Biology of Behaviour | volume = 1977 | issue = | pages = 309–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interspecies roosts have also been observed among other avian species.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Joanna. "A model for the evolution of mixed-species colonies of Ciconiiformes." ''Quarterly Review of Biology'' (1981): 143-167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munn | first1 = Charles A. | last2 = Terborgh | first2 = John W. | year = 1979| title = Multi-species territoriality in Neotropical foraging flocks | url = | journal = Condor | volume = 1979 | issue = 4| pages = 338–347 | doi=10.2307/1366956| jstor = 1366956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ===
[[File:Zebra Butterflies 14.jpg|thumb|Zebra Longwing butterflies (''[[Heliconius charithonia|Heliconius charitonius]]'') sleeping in a nocturnal communal roost. |197x197px]]Communal roosting has also been well documented among insects, particularly butterflies. The passion-vine butterfly (''[[Heliconius erato]])'' is known to form nocturnal roosts, typically comprising four individuals. It is believed that these roosts deter potential predators due to the fact that predators attack roosts less often than they do individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finkbeiner, Susan D., Adriana D. Briscoe, and Robert D. Reed. "The benefit of being a social butterfly: communal roosting deters predation." ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences'' 2012; 279(1739): 2769–2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal roosting behavior has also been observed in the neotropical zebra longwing butterfly (''[[Heliconius charithonia|Heliconius charitonius]]'') in the La Cinchona region of Costa Rica. A study of this roost showed that individuals vary in their roost fidelity, and that they tend to form smaller sub roosts. The same study observed that in this region communal roosting can be mediated by heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Young, Allen M., and Mary Ellen Carolan. "Daily instability of communal roosting in the neotropical butterfly Heliconius charitonius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae)." ''Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society''(1976): 346-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal roosting has also been observed in south Peruvian tiger beetles of the subfamily ''[[Tiger beetle|Cicindelidae]]''. These species of tiger beetle have been observed to form communal roosts comprising anywhere from two to nine individuals at night and disbanding during the day. It is hypothesized that these beetles roost high in the treetops in order to avoid ground-based predators.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, David L., and Joseph J. Anderson. "Perching heights and nocturnal communal roosts of some tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) in southeastern Peru." ''Biotropica'' (1985): 126-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammals ===
While there are few observations of communal roosting mammals, the trait has been seen in several species of bats. The little brown bat (''[[Little brown bat|Myotis lucifugus]]'') is known to participate in communal roosts of up to thirty seven during cold nights in order to decrease thermoregulatory demands, with the roost disbanding at daybreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barclay | first1 = Robert MR | year = 1982 | title = Night roosting behavior of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus | url = | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 464–474 | doi=10.2307/1380444| jstor = 1380444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other species of bats, including the hoary bat (''[[Hoary bat|Lasiurus cinereu]]s'') and the big brown bat (''[[Big brown bat|Eptesicus fuscus]]'') have also been observed to roost communally in maternal colonies in order to reduce the thermoregulatory demands on both the lactating mothers and juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klug | first1 = Brandon J. | last2 = Barclay | first2 = Robert MR | year = 2013 | title = Thermoregulation during reproduction in the solitary, foliage-roosting hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) | url = | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 94 | issue = 2| pages = 477–487 | doi=10.1644/12-mamm-a-178.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agosta | first1 = Salvatore J | year = 2002 | title = Habitat use, diet and roost selection by the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in North America: a case for conserving an abundant species | url = | journal = Mammal Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 179–198 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2002.00103.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Domain Based Security", abbreviated to "DBSy", is a model-based approach to help analyse [[information security]] risks in a business context and provide a clear and direct mapping between the risks and the [[security controls]] needed to manage them. A variant of the approach is used by the UK government's [[HMG Infosec Standard No.1]] technical risk-assessment method.&lt;ref&gt;HMG IA Standard No. 1 "Technical Risk Assessment", Issue 3.51, October 2009,  {{cite web |url=http://www.cesg.gov.uk/publications/Documents/is1_risk_assessment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526213309/http://www.cesg.gov.uk/publications/Documents/is1_risk_assessment.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2012 |df= }}  accessed 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; DBSy is a registered trade mark of [[QinetiQ]] Ltd.

DBSy was developed in the late 1990s by the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA). It is a model-based approach to [[information assurance]] that describes the requirements for security in an organisation, taking account of the business that needs to be supported. The model is based around the concept of a security domain, which represents a logical place where people work with information using a computer system, and which has connections with other security domains where this is necessary to support business activity. Hence the focus is on the information that needs protection, the people that work with it and the people they exchange information with. The model can also describe the physical environments where people work and the system boundaries where major system security measures are placed. A systematic method is then applied to the model to identify and describe the risks to which valuable information assets are exposed and specify security measures that are effective in managing the risks.

==History==
DBSy has its origins in the late 1990s, having been developed by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) for the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Initially called the Domain Based Approach, it was developed alongside [[Purple Penelope]] to support the MOD's increasing need for interconnections between systems operating at different security levels 
,&lt;ref&gt;B. Pomeroy and S. Wiseman, "Private desktops and shared store," Proc. of 14th Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 190–200, Phoenix, AZ, December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald R, "Purple Penelope and UK MOD's Emerging Strategy for Information Security", September 1997 http://www.opengroup.org/security/meetings/sep97/Group.pdf Accessed 27 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
It was recognised that the risks associated with such connections were directly related to the nature of the information exchange that was needed and that an effective model for understanding and managing the risks would need to take account of the business needs for information sharing. It was also recognised that the controlled release of information from a system handling secret information (sometimes referred to at the time as 'down grading' or '[[Sanitization (classified information)|sanitisation]]') was not adequately described by any of the existing models of Information security (notably [[Bell-LaPadula]], [[Biba Model|Biba]] and the associated [[Information flow (information theory)|information flow]] models).

Information flow models were found to be unhelpful in understanding the risks when information has to be shared with people and systems that are not entirely trusted.  An effective model for understanding and managing the risks would need to take account of the business needs for exchanging information both within and outside an organisation 
.&lt;ref&gt;Chiew Pheng Goh, "A Security Model for a Defence-Related Organization" University of Wales, Aberystwyth 30 November 2003 http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/MSc_dissertations/2003/Goh_Chiew_Pheng.pdf Accessed 26 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The modelling technique was applied to some major projects for the MOD and as a result of this experience the graphical modelling techniques were revised and a rigorous risk assessment method, based on the concepts of compromise paths was developed. An approach to IT security documentation through a project lifecycle was also created 
.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson C, Hughes K, “What are security documents for?- Objectives of MOD’s Accreditation Documents” Presented at the Annual Sunningdale Accreditor’s Conference, 23–24 September 2002 https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8e3e/c2654849e19be55571dfbab09899fef94674.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Domain Based Security conferences were held at [[QinetiQ]] Malvern in June 2005 and June 2006, promoting discussion of how it could be more widely used, both for defence

and commercial systems

A variant of the DBSy method was subsequently developed and incorporated into the UK government's [[HMG Infosec Standard No.1]] Technical Risk Assessment method, the standard method to be used for security risk assessments for all government Information Technology [[system]]s.

==The DBSy model==
The DBSy approach uses simple models to represent the requirements for security in an organisation using two different but related viewpoints: the Infosec Business Model represents the security aspects of the business, while the Infosec Infrastructure Model represents the logical provision of strong boundaries that enforce separation. When combined, they make up an Infosec Architecture Model
.&lt;ref&gt;Ashenden D,  Warrener K, "Understanding Risk Dependencies in Information Systems", Proceedings of the 4th Australian Information Warfare and IT Security Conference, Adelaide, Nov 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This model forms the basis for conducting a systematic and rigorous risk assessment.

The Infosec business model defines security domains and the connections between them. The model specifies the limits of what information can be processed and exchanged between security domains and so forms the set of security requirements for the business. In particular, connections that are not explicitly modelled are not permitted and are required not to occur. A security domain is characterised by a set of information assets, which may be valuable to the organisation, as well as the people that work with the information and the applications and services that act on their behalf.   Connections between domains are characterised by the nature of the interaction that is required (such as interpersonal messages, or shared access to a database) and the sensitivity and integrity requirements of the information exchange. The model can also represent the kinds of physical environment from which a domain can be accessed.

The Infosec infrastructure model defines islands of computing infrastructure that are required to be logically separate, so that information cannot be exchanged between them except at identifiable and manageable points of connection, referred to as causeways. An island is characterised by the strength of separation between it and any other islands and by the people who manage its computing infrastructure.

An Infosec architecture model combines the business and infrastructure views, by showing which security domains are supported by which islands of infrastructure. Where there are connections between security domains that are hosted on different islands, the connections must be supported by an appropriate causeway.

==Risk assessment method==
The DBSy method uses a rational risk framework for describing the risks to which some information assets are exposed. Similar kinds of assets are grouped together as a focus of interest, and the risk assessment process is applied to each focus of interest in turn.

The key factors determining the risk to a particular focus of interest are:
* business Impact of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the focus of interest;
* sets of people who might wish to inflict damage (threat sources) and their motivation for doing so;
* groups of people with different opportunities to inflict damage (threat actors) and their capability to do so, who may also be threat sources or could be influenced by others;
* the means by which each threat actor might cause damage (causes of compromise);
* the defences in place (or planned) to protect the focus of interest.

This risk framework is applied in a systematic fashion to an organisation-specific Infosec architecture model, representing the security-relevant features of an organisation's business and IT systems. Through this process a set of Compromise Paths can be systematically described and the relative effectiveness of different countermeasures can be assessed 
.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes K, Wiseman S, "Analysis of Information Security Risks: Policy for Protection through to Implementation", Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Information Warfare and Security,  Academic Conferences Ltd.  {{ISBN|1-905305-02-8}}, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other IA risk methods==
DBSy differs from other [[IT risk management]] methods in that its primary focus is on people, the business drivers of an organisation and the way the business works, rather than on technical security measures. The analyst is required to systematically define the groups of people that pose a threat and the ways they might cause harm, providing a rigorous, business-oriented framework for the concepts of [[Threat (computer)|threat]] and [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]]. The aim is to understand and analyse information security risks faced by an organisation, especially where the risks appear to conflict with needs for business efficiency across the organisation or in dealings with customers and business partners.

'''Energy economics''' is a broad [[science|scientific]] subject area which includes topics related to [[energy supply|supply]] and [[energy demand|use]] of [[energy]] in [[society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sickles, Robin (2008). "energy economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000082&amp;q=energy%20&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of [[academic discipline]]s, energy economics does not present itself as a self-contained academic discipline, but it is an applied subdiscipline of [[economics]]. From the list of [[Scientific discipline#Economics|main topics of economics]], some relate strongly to energy economics:
* [[Computable general equilibrium]]
* [[Econometrics]]
* [[Environmental economics]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Industrial organization]]
* [[Input–output model]]
* [[Microeconomics]]
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* [[Operations research]]
* [[Resource economics]]
Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy [[engineering]], [[geology]], [[political sciences]], [[ecology]] etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:
* [[Climate change]] and [[climate policy]]
* [[Demand response]]
* [[Elasticity (economics)|Elasticity]] of [[supply and demand]] in [[energy market]]
* Energy and [[economic growth]]
* [[Energy derivative]]s
* [[Energy elasticity]]
* [[Energy forecasting]]
* [[Energy market]]s and [[electricity market]]s  - [[liberalisation]], (de- or re-) [[regulation]]
* Economics of [[energy infrastructure]]
* [[Energy policy]]
* [[Environmental policy]]
* [[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] and [[security of supply]]
* [[Sustainability]]

Some institutions of higher education ([[universities]]) recognise energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a [[curriculum]]. The [[University of Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit| Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] are the top three research universities, and [[Resources for the Future]] the top research institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.ene.html IDEAS/RePEc]&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other research departments, companies and professionals offering energy economics studies and consultations.

==History==
[[File:World energy prices 1991-2010.png|thumb|World prices for energy, 1991-2010. 2000=100.]]
Energy related issues have been actively present in economic literature since the [[1973 oil crisis]], but have their roots much further back in the history. As early as 1865, [[William Stanley Jevons|W.S. Jevons]] expressed his concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book ''The Coal Question''. One of the best known early attempts to work on the economics of exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by [[Harold Hotelling|H. Hotelling]], who derived a price path for [[non-renewable resources]], known as [[Hotelling's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hotelling |first=H. |title=The Economics of Exhaustible Resources |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |year=1931 |pages=137–175 |jstor=1822328 |doi=10.1086/254195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental engineering''' is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments, both local and global, from  potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and improvement of environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaees.org/ The American Academy of Environmental Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental engineering system can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation, protection of assets and control of waste from human and animal activities. Furthermore, it is concerned with finding plausible solutions in the field of public health, such as [[waterborne diseases]], implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. It involves [[Water pollution|waste water management]], [[air pollution]] control, recycling, [[waste disposal]], radiation protection, industrial hygiene, animal agriculture, environmental sustainability, [[public health]] and [[environmental engineering law]]. It also includes studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.

Environmental engineers system study the effect of technological advances on the environment. To do so, they conduct studies on hazardous-[[waste management]] to evaluate the significance of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. Environmental engineers design [[water purification|municipal water supply]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | id= [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tchobanoglous, G. |author2=Burton, F.L. |author3= Stensel, H.D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Wastewater Engineering (Treatment Disposal Reuse) / Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=2003|isbn=0-07-041878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They address local and worldwide environmental issues such as the effects of [[acid rain]], [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]], water pollution and air pollution from [[Automobile emissions control|automobile exhausts]] and [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|industrial sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor.U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm |title=Architecture and Engineering Occupations : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Career Information Center.

Many universities offer environmental engineering programs at either the department of [[civil engineering]] or the department of [[chemical engineering]] at engineering faculties. Environmental "civil" engineers focus on hydrology, water resources management, [[bioremediation]], and water treatment plant design. Environmental "chemical" engineers, on the other hand, focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies and separation processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some subdivision of environmental engineering include [[natural resources engineering]] and agricultural engineering.

More engineers are obtaining specialized training in law ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) and are utilizing their technical expertise in the practices of [[environmental engineering law]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Most jurisdictions also impose licensing and registration requirements.

==Development==
Ever since people first recognized that their health is related to the [[Environmental quality|quality of their environment]], they have applied principles to attempt to improve the quality of their environment. The ancient Indian [[Harappan civilization]] utilized early sewers in some cities more than 5000 years ago. More specifically, the Indus Valley Civilization (also called the Harappan civilization) had advanced control over the water in their society. The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early version of a canal irrigation system that was needed for their large scale agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution of Sanitation and Wastewater Technologies through the Centuries|last=Angelakis|first=Andreas N.|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781780404851|location=|pages=25-40|chapter=Chapter 2: "Sanitation and wastewater technologies in Harappa/Indus valley civilization (ca. 2600-1900 BC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman aqueduct|Romans constructed aqueducts]] to prevent drought and to create a clean, healthful water supply for the [[Metropolitan area|metropolis]] of [[Rome]]. In the 15th century, [[Bavaria]] created laws restricting the development and degradation of alpine country that constituted the region's water supply.

The field emerged as a separate environmental discipline during the middle third of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and pollution and increasingly extensive environmental quality degradation. However, its roots extend back to early efforts in public health engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation.(Dec. 3, 2009).Environmental Engineering"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501029 |title=Funding - Environmental Engineering - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern environmental engineering began in [[London]] in the mid-19th century when [[Joseph Bazalgette]] designed the first major [[sewage collection and disposal|sewerage]] system that reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases such as [[cholera]]. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities.&lt;ref name="Water industry from The Oxford Companion to British History online"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Waterborne_infections.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, as societies grew, actions that were intended to achieve benefits for those societies had longer-term impacts which reduced other environmental qualities. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide [[DDT]] to control agricultural pests in the years following [[World War II]]. While the [[agriculture|agricultural]] benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically thus reducing world hunger substantially, and [[malaria]] was controlled better than it ever had been, numerous species were brought to the verge of extinction due to the impact of the DDT on their reproductive cycles. The story of DDT as vividly told in [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement and of the modern field of "environmental engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Sustainable Development (n.d.) Environmental Science|publisher=Detroit|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation movement]]s and [[law]]s restricting public actions that would harm the environment have been developed by various societies for millennia. Notable examples are the laws decreeing the construction of [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]]s in [[London sewerage system|London]] and [[Paris Sewer Museum|Paris]] in the 19th century and the creation of the U.S. national park system in the early 20th century.

===Environmental impact assessment and mitigation===
{{Main article|Environmental impact assessment}}

Scientists have air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes.
They apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] quality, [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], agricultural capacity, [[traffic]] impacts, social impacts, ecological impacts, noise impacts, visual (landscape) impacts, etc. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of [[wetland]]s in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road.

In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|title= McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Environmental Science and Engineering |edition=3rd|publisher= McGraw-Hill, Inc|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and treatment===
[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]]]]
Engineers evaluate the water balance within a [[drainage basin|watershed]] and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses. Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a [[potable water]] supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of [[infectious disease]] transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and [[irrigation]].

===Wastewater treatment===
[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|Water pollution]]

There are numerous wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an [[aeration]] basin followed by [[flocculation]] and [[settling|sedimentation]] or an [[activated sludge]] system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological [[nitrogen]] removal system, and a final [[disinfection]] process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge).  The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and [[phosphorus]] and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sims, J.|title= Activated sludge, Environmental Encyclopedia |publisher=Detroit|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution management===

Scientists have developed [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]] to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] and industrial [[flue gas stack]] emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from combustion processes.

==Environmental Protection Agency==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve key issues. An important component of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.

==Ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid West African regions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. Masse|author2=JL. Chotte|author3=E. Scopel|title=Ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid West African regions|journal=Fiche thématique du CSFD|date=2015|issue=11|page=2|url=http://www.csf-desertification.eu/combating-desertification/item/ecological-engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Ecological engineering offers new alternatives for the management of agricultural systems that are more tailored to the ever-changing social and environmental necessities in these regions. This requires managing the complexity of agrosystems, while striving to mimic the functioning of natural ecosystems of West African drylands and taking advantage of traditional practices and local know-how resulting from a long process of adaptation to environmental constraints.
# Acting on biodiversity. Biodiversity is essential to the productivity of ecosystems and their temporal stability under the impact of external disturbances. Several ecological processes related to biodiversity may be intensified for the benefit of agrosilvopastoral systems: promoting diversity and soil microorganism activity to benefit&amp;nbsp;plants, associating and utilizing the mutual benefits of plants
# Utilizing organic matter and nutrient cycles. The productivity of agrosystems with low chemical input use in dryland regions is primarily based on efficient organic resource management, and in turn on the nutrient and energy flows they induce. It is thus possible to intervene at several levels: enhancing crop-livestock farming integration to preserve natural resources, restoring the biological activity of soils via specific organic&amp;nbsp;inputs, supplying nutrients to plants locally.
# Enhancing available water use. Water supplies are limited and irregular in dryland areas. Current management of these supplies—which involves capturing rainwater and surface runoff—could be improved in several ways: adapting to erratic rainfall or drought risks by focusing on: (i) the organization of the farm and community (farm plot patterns in association with the random rainfall distribution, etc.), and on (ii) cropping techniques to reduce crop water needs (plant choices, weeding, etc.), preserving water in crop fields by hampering runoff, accounting for the essential role of trees regarding soil and water in drylands.
# Managing landscapes and associated ecological processes. Ecological crop pest regulation by their natural enemies is one ecosystem service provided by biodiversity. Better pest management could be considered in association with promoting biodiversity at different scales, e.g. from the plant to the landscape.

==Education==
Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into broad classes:
*''[[Mechanical engineering]]'' courses oriented towards designing machines and mechanical systems for environmental use such as water treatment facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants and other mechanical facilities;
*''Environmental engineering or environmental systems'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment;
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental [[Chemical engineer|chemical]] engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects (good and bad) of chemicals in the environment.  Focus on mining processes, pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes;
*''[[Environmental technology]]'' courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources.

'''Ergosterol''' (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a [[sterol]] found in [[cell membrane]]s of [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]], serving many of the same functions that [[cholesterol]] serves in [[animal]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.  Because many fungi and protozoa cannot survive without ergosterol, the [[enzymes]] that synthesize it have become important targets for [[drug discovery]]. Ergosterol is a [[provitamin]] form of [[Ergocalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]; exposure to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light causes a chemical reaction that produces vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Role in fungi==
Ergosterol (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a [[sterol]] found in fungi, and named for [[ergot]], the common name of members of the fungal genus ''[[Claviceps]]'' from which ergosterol was first isolated.  Ergosterol is a component of [[yeast]] and other [[fungus|fungal]] [[cell membrane]]s, serving many of the same functions that [[cholesterol]] serves in [[animal]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weete JD, Abril M, Blackwell M.
Phylogenetic distribution of fungal sterols. PLoS One. 2010 May 28;5(5):e10899. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010899. {{PMID|20526375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its specificity in higher fungi is thought to be related to the climatic instabilities (highly varying humidity and moisture conditions) encountered by these organisms in their typical ecological niches (plant and animal surfaces, soil). Thus, despite the added energy requirements of ergosterol synthesis (if compared to cholesterol), ergosterol is thought to have evolved as a nearly ubiquitous, evolutionarily advantageous fungal alternative to cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dupont S. |author2=Lemetais G. |author3=Ferreira T. |author4=Cayot P. |author5=Gervais P. |author6=Beney L. | year = 2012 | title = Ergosterol biosynthesis: a fungal pathway for life on land? | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01667.x/full | journal = Evolution | volume = 66 | issue = 9| pages = 2961–2968 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01667.x | pmid=22946816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Target for antifungal drugs ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Because ergosterol is present in cell membranes of fungi, yet absent in those of animals, it is a useful target for [[antifungal drug]]s.  Ergosterol is also present in the cell membranes of some protists, such as [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts CW, McLeod R, Rice DW, Ginger M, Chance ML, Goad LJ |title=Fatty acid and sterol metabolism: potential antimicrobial targets in apicomplexan and trypanosomatid parasitic protozoa |journal=Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. |volume=126 |issue=2 |pages=129–42 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12615312 |doi=10.1016/S0166-6851(02)00280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the basis for the use of some antifungals against West African [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]].

[[Amphotericin B]], an antifungal drug, targets ergosterol. It binds physically to ergosterol within the membrane, thus creating a polar pore in fungal membranes. This causes ions (predominantly [[potassium]] and [[protons]]) and other molecules to leak out, which will kill the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis D |title=Amphotericin B: spectrum and resistance |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=49 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=7–10 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11801575 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11801575 |doi=10.1093/jac/49.suppl_1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphotericin B has been replaced by safer agents in most circumstances, but is still used, despite its side effects, for life-threatening fungal or protozoan infections.

[[Fluconazole]], [[miconazole]], [[itraconazole]], and [[clotrimazole]] work in a different way, inhibiting synthesis of ergosterol from [[lanosterol]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by interfering with [[Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase|14α-demethylase]].&lt;ref name="lv"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The synthesis, regulation, and functions of sterols in Candida albicans: Well-known but still lots to learn |journal=Virulence|volume=7|issue=6|pages=649–659|doi=10.1080/21505594.2016.1188236|pmid=27221657|pmc=4991322|year=2016 |last1=Lv |first1=Quan-Zhen |last2=Yan|first2=Lan|last3=Jiang|first3=Yuan-Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ergosterol is a smaller molecule than lanosterol; it is synthesized by combining two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a 15-carbon-long terpenoid, into lanosterol, which has 30 carbons. Then, two methyl groups are removed, making ergosterol. The "azole" class of antifungal agents [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] the enzyme that performs these [[demethylation]] steps in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and ergosterol.&lt;ref name=lv/&gt;

== Target for antiprotozoal drugs ==
Some protozoa, including ''[[Trichomonas]]'' and ''[[Leishmania]]'' are inhibited by drugs that target ergosterol synthesis and function&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrillo-Muñoz|first1=AJ|last2=Tur-Tur|first2=C|last3=Giusiano|first3=G|last4=Marcos-Arias|first4=C|last5=Eraso|first5=E|last6=Jauregizar|first6=N|last7=Quindós|first7=G|title=Sertaconazole: an antifungal agent for the topical treatment of superficial candidiasis.|journal=Expert review of anti-infective therapy|date=Apr 2013|volume=11|issue=4|pages=347–58|pmid=23566144|doi=10.1586/eri.13.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor ==

Ergosterol is a [[provitamin|biological precursor]] of [[Ergocalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the chemical name of which is [[ergocalciferol]].  Exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] causes a [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reaction that converts ergosterol to ergocalciferol.&lt;ref&gt;Haytowitz, DB [http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Articles/AICR09_Mushroom_VitD.pdf Vitamin D in Mushrooms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;Arnold Lippert Hirsch.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=w7hMAFmsM84C&amp;pg=PA79 Industrial Aspects of Vitamin D]. Chapter 6 in Vitamin D: Two-Volume Set.  Edited by David Feldman, J. Wesley Pike, John S. Adam. Academic Press, May 12, 2011  {{ISBN|978-0123819789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This happens naturally to a certain extent, and many mushrooms are irradiated after harvest to increase their Vitamin D content.   Fungi are also grown industrially so that ergosterol can be extracted and converted to Vitamin D for sale as a [[dietary supplement]] and [[food additive]].&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;

Preparations of irradiated ergosterol containing a mixture of previtamin and vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were called Viosterol in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Science Service (1930) [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed007p166 Viosterol official name for irradiated ergosterol], J. Chem. Educ. 7(1) 166, DOI: 10.1021/ed007p166 Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicity ==
Ergosterol powder is an irritant to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Ingestion of large amounts can cause [[hypercalcemia]], which (if prolonged) can lead to calcium salt deposits in the soft tissues and, in particular, the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/28224.htm Material Safety Data Sheet], Fisher Scientific&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
Systems biology attempts to study biological systems in a holistic manner by integrating data at all levels of the biological information hierarchy, from global down to the individual organism, and below down to the molecular level. The vision of ISB has been to integrate these concepts using a cross-disciplinary approach combining the efforts of biologists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and physicians.&lt;ref name=Hood2008/&gt;

On its website, ISB has defined four areas of focus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Systems Biology - Research|url=http://www.systemsbiology.org/research|publisher=Institute for Systems Biology|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* P4 Medicine - This acronym refers to predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory medicine, which focuses on wellness rather than the mere treatment of disease.
* Global Health - Use of the systems approach towards the study of infectious diseases, vaccine development, emergence of chronic diseases, and maternal and child health.
* Sustainable Environment - Applying systems biology for a better understanding of the role of microbes in the environment and their relation to human health.
* Education &amp; Outreach - Knowledge transfer to society through a variety of educational programs and partnerships, including the spinout of new companies.

==Early history==
[[File:Leroy Hood podium PITT2008.JPG|thumb|right|Leroy Hood, 2008]]
[[File:Aderem 00044.jpg|thumb|right | Alan Aderem, 2012]]
[[File:Ruedi Aebersold 2012.JPG|thumb|right| Ruedi Aebersold, 2012]]

[[Leroy Hood]] co-founded the Institute with [[Alan Aderem]] and [[Ruedi Aebersold]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=ISB/&gt;

However, the story of how ISB got started actually begins in 1990.&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Bill|title=Future Perfect -- Thanks To Bill Gates' $12-Million Endowment, Scientist Leroy Hood Continues His Search For A New Genetic Destiny|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920209&amp;slug=1474735|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=9 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Hood was the director of a large molecular biotechnology lab at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena, and was a key advisor in the [[Human Genome Project]], having overseen development of machines that were instrumental to its later success. The [[University of Washington]] (UW), like many other universities, was eager to recruit Hood, but had neither the space nor the money to accommodate Hood's large laboratory.&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992/&gt;

Lee Huntsman, director of UW's Center for Bioengineering, was attending a UW football game, sharing a luxury box with [[Bill Gates]], the former CEO and current chairman of [[Microsoft]]. Huntsman took the opportunity to tell Gates about Hood. Bill Gates already had a considerable interest in biotechnology, both as a philanthropist and as an investor, and after meeting Hood, donated $12 million to UW to enable him to head a new department of molecular biotechnology,&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992/&gt; where Hood continues to hold a faculty position as the Gates Professor of Molecular Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=UWBiotechnology&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Molecular Biotechnology|url=http://nick-lab.gs.washington.edu/mbt-web/|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB represents a spin-off of Hood's labs at UW.&lt;ref name=ISEPP_Hood&gt;{{cite web|title=Revolutionary New Science|url=http://www.isepp.org/Pages/01-02%20Pages/Hood.html|publisher=Institute for Science, Engineering and Public Policy|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
ISB is in the top ranks of scientific institutions worldwide. In 2012, the  SCImago Research Group, based in Spain, ranked ISB 4th worldwide on its Excellence Rate scale.&lt;ref name=SCImago&gt;{{cite web|title=SCImago Research Group|url=http://www.scimago.es/index.php|publisher=SCImago Research Group|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB currently hosts 10 research groups with expertise ranging across [[genetics]], [[microbial genetics]], complex molecular machines, macromolecular complexes, [[gene regulatory networks]], [[immunology]], molecular and cell biology, cancer biology, [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], protein chemistry, [[computational biology]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=ISB/&gt; The ISB web site lists 985 peer-reviewed publications for the years 2000 through early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Systems Biology - Publications|url=http://www.systemsbiology.org/publications|publisher=Institute for Systems Biology|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In late 2005, the ISB began to emphasize the application of systems biology to P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory), ''i.e.'' the development of techniques for predicting and preventing disease, possibly before patients even know they are sick. The ''P4 Medicine institute'' was co-founded in 2010 by ISB and [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name=P4&gt;{{cite web|title=P4 Medicine Institute|url=http://p4mi.org/|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education and Outreach efforts of ISB include creating the Logan Center for Education whose mission is to enable educators to produce [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] literate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Logan Center for Education |url=http://logancenter.systemsbiology.net |publisher=Institute for Systems Biology |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISB offers paid research internships for high school and undergraduate students, and offers advanced systems science courses throughout the year.

ISB has partnered in several high-profile research projects, the most significant one thus far being with the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] to create the ''Center for Systems Biology Luxembourg''&lt;ref name=Seattlepi2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Tartakoff|first=Joseph|title=Seattle, Luxembourg research projects set|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Seattle-Luxembourg-research-projects-set-1275714.php|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Seattlepi.com (Seattle Post-Intelligencer)|date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Seattle Proteome Center''.&lt;ref name=SPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle Proteome Center |url=http://www.proteomecenter.org/ |publisher=Seattle Proteome Center|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Experimental Medicine and Biology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental}}, IByME) is a [[research and development]] centre affiliated to the [[University of Buenos Aires]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

==History==
The institute was privately founded on March 14, 1944 by Dr. [[Bernardo A. Houssay]], [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] and [[Medicine]] (1947) for his work in [[diabetes]] and the control of the [[carbohydrate]] [[metabolism]]. Drs. [[Eduardo Braun-Menéndez]], [[Oscar Orías]], [[Juan T. Lewis]] and [[Virgilio G. Foglia]] were co-founders. The founding of the Institute was motivated by the dismissal of Dr. Houssay, together with 150 other professors from the [[University of Buenos Aires]], by the military government. Dr. Houssay became its director and brought to work with him several colleagues and students. The initiative was made possible by the support of Dr. [[Miguel F. Laphitzondo]] and others who granted financial contributions in memory of [[Juan B. Sauberán]].

The institute was the first organization devoted to [[scientific research]] in Argentina.  Its initial structure resembled that of the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] (now [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States) and of the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France. In 1949, the Institute was established as a [[charter]]ed [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] recognized by the National Bureau of Non-Profit Entitites (''Registro Nacional de Entidades de Bien Público'').

Later on, several Houssay’s disciples left the Institute to settle research groups in many Argentine and other [[Latin American]] universities. Many research laboratories were founded following the model of Houssay’s Institute. For example, Dr. [[Miguel Rolando Covian]] chaired the Department of Physiology of the [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto|Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto]] of the [[University of São Paulo]] from 1952 to 1986, giving origin to a large scientific group in [[Brazil]].

On January 16, 1959, Eduardo Braun Menéndez, who played an outstanding role in the life of the Institute, died. His vacancy in the Board of Directors was filled by Dr. [[Luis F. Leloir]] who would later receive the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] (1970).

After Dr. Houssay and others were reintegrated into the University of Buenos Aires, in 1959, the Institute was affiliated to this University, remaining so until today. Dr. Bernardo Houssay was the director of the Institute until his death in 1971. Thereupon, an Administrative Commission led by Prof. Dr. Virgilio Foglia, assisted by Dr. Julia V. Uranga and Dr. Luis F. Leloir, undertook the Institute's affairs. The Institute established legal associations with the [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council]].

The death of Prof. Dr. Luis F. Leloir, in December 1987, and the growth of the Institute prompted the need of increasing the number of members in the Administrative Commission. Accordingly, the necessary changes in the Institute Bylaws were submitted to the National Bureau of Legal Entitites (''Dirección General de Personas Jurídicas'') for approval. While the new Bylaws were under consideration, Drs. Alberto Baldi, Jorge Blaquier, Ricardo Calandra, Eduardo Charreau, Alejandro De Nicola, Enrique Segura, Alicia Roldán, Enrique del Castillo, Carlos Libertun, and Marta Tesone collaborated with Dr. Virgilio G. Foglia and Dr. Uranga in the administration of the Institute.

On July 12, 1993, the Institute was given the status of a Unit of Technological Transfer by the Argentinian Secretary of Science and Technology. This enabled the participation of technological and scientific sectors as consultants to productive sectors, public or private, both in the selection and adaptation of available technology and in the transfer of results derived from research.

==Activities==

The interests of the Institute can be grouped into three categories: 
* Basic and applied investigations in [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]];
* Training of students and pre- and postdoctoral fellows; and
* Organization of courses at pre- and post-graduate levels.

The Institute is the site for the Argentine Committee of the Postdoctoral Program of selection of postdoctoral research fellowships in the area of Biomedical Sciences granted by [[John E. Fogarty International Center]] from the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]]; such Committee being chaired by Dr. Eduardo Charreau.

Historically, the main discoveries were in the fields of [[endocrinology]] and physiology.  The current research areas are wider and include [[Neurosciences]], [[Biology of Reproduction]], Experimental [[Oncology]] and [[Immunology]].  Results are published in journals of international recognition, thus demonstrating the level of excellence reached by the different research groups.

In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''Krivine machine''' is an ''[[abstract machine]]'' (sometimes called ''[[virtual machine]]'').  As an abstract machine, it shares features with [[Turing machine]]s and the [[SECD machine]]. The Krivine machine explains how to compute a recursive function.  More specifically it aims to define rigorously [[head normal form]] reduction of a [[Lambda calculus|lambda term]] using [[call-by-name]] reduction.  Thanks to its formalism, it tells in details how a kind of reduction works and sets the theoretical foundation of the [[operational semantics]] of [[functional programming language]]s.  On the other hand, Krivine machine implements call-by-name because it evaluates the body of a β-[[reducible expression|redex]] before it evaluates its parameter. In other words, in an expression (''λ'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u'' it evaluates first ''λ'' ''x''. ''t'' before evaluating ''u''. In [[functional programming]], this would mean that in order to evaluate a function applied to a parameter, it evaluates first the function before evaluating the parameter.

The Krivine machine has been designed by the French logician [[:fr:Jean-Louis Krivine|Jean-Louis Krivine]] at the beginning of the 1980s.

== Call by name and head normal form reduction ==
{{more|lambda-calculus}}

The Krivine machine is based on two concepts related to [[lambda calculus]], namely head reduction and call by name.

=== Head normal form reduction ===

&lt;/ref&gt; (one says also β-redex) is a term of the lambda calculus of the form (''λ'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u''.   If a term has the shape (''λ'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; it is said to be a ''head redex''.  A ''[[Beta normal form|head normal form]]''  is a term of the lambda calculus which is not a  head redex{{efn|If one deals only with closed terms, that terms has the form ''λ'' ''x''. ''t''.}}  A ''head reduction'' is a (non empty) sequence of contractions of a term which contracts head redexes.  A head reduction of a term ''t'' (which is supposed not to be in head normal form) is a head reduction which starts from  a term ''t'' and ends on a head normal form.  From an abstract point of view, head reduction is the way a program computes when it evaluates a recursive sub-program. To understand how such a reduction can be implemented is important.  One of the aims of the Krivine machine is to propose a process to reduct a term in head normal form and to describe formally this process.  Like [[Alan Turing|Turing]] used an abstract machine to describe formally the notion of algorithm, [[:fr: Jean-Louis Krivine|Krivine]] used  an abstract machine to describe formally the notion of head normal form reduction.

==== An example ====
The term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0) (which corresponds, if one uses explicit variables, to the term (''λx''.''x'') (''λy''.''y'') (''λz''.''z''))  is not in head normal form because (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0) contracts in (''λ'' 0) yielding the head redex (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0) which contracts in (''λ'' 0) and which is therefore the head normal form of ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0). Said otherwise the head normal form contraction is:
: ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0) ➝ (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0) ➝ ''λ'' 0,
which corresponds to :
: (''λx''.''x'') (''λy''.''y'') (''λz''.''z'') ➝ (''λy''.''y'') (''λz''.''z'') ➝ ''λz''.''z''.
We will see further how the Krivine machine reduces the term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0).

=== [[Call-by-name|Call by name]] ===
To implement the head reduction of a term ''u v'' which is an application, but which is not a redex, one must reduce the body ''u'' to exhibit an abstraction and therefore create a redex with ''v''. When a redex appears, one reduces it.  To reduce always the body of an application first is called ''[[Call-by-name|call by name]]''.{{efn|This ancient terminology refers to concepts of the 60's and hardly justified in 2017.}} The Krivine machine implements ''call by name''.

== Description ==

The presentation of the Krivine machine given here is based on notations of lambda terms that use [[de Bruijn indices]] and assumes that the terms of which it computes the head normal forms are [[Lambda calculus definition#Free and bound variables|closed]].&lt;ref name="Curien"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Pierre-Louis 
| last1 = Curien
| title = Categorical Combinators, Sequential Algorithms and Functional
| publisher = Birkhaüser
| year = 1993
| edition =  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It modifies the current '''state''' until it cannot do it anymore, in which case it  obtains a head normal form.   This head normal form represents the result of the computation or yields an error, meaning that the term it started from is not correct.  However, it can enter an infinite sequence of transitions, which means that the term it attempts reducing has no head normal form and corresponds to a non terminating computation.

It has been proved that the Krivine machine implements correctly the call by name head normal form reduction in the lambda-calculus.  Moreover, the Krivine machine is [[Deterministic compilation|deterministic]], since each pattern of the state corresponds to at most one machine transition.

=== The state  ===
The state has three components&lt;ref name="Curien" /&gt;
:# a '''term''',
:# a '''stack''', 
:# an '''environment'''.

The term is a  λ-term with de Bruijn indices.  The stack and the environment belong to the same recursive data structure. More precisely, the environment and the  stack are lists of pairs ''&lt;term,&amp;nbsp;environment&gt;'', that are called ''closures''.  In what follows, the insertion as the head of a list ℓ (stack or environment) of an element ''a'' is written ''a:ℓ'', whereas the empty list is written □. The stack is the location where the machine stores the closures that must be evaluated furthermore, whereas the environment is the association between the indices and the closures at a given time during the evaluation. The first element of the environment is the closure associated with the index ''0'', the second element corresponds to the closure associated with index ''1'' etc. If the machine has to evaluate an index, it fetches there the pair ''&lt;term, environment&gt;'' the closure that yields the term to be evaluated and the environment in which this term must be evaluated.{{efn|Using the concept of closure, one may replace the triple ''&lt;term,stack, environment&gt;, which defines the state, by a couple ''&lt;closure,stack&gt;'', but this change is cosmetic.}} This intuitive explanations allow understanding the operating rules of the machine.  If one writes ''t'' for term, p for stack,{{efn|p is for ''pile'', the French word for stack, which we do not want to mix up with ''s'', for state.}} and e for environment, the states associated with these three entities will be written ''t'', p, e.  The rules explain how the machine transforms a state into another state, after identifying the patterns among the states.

The ''initial state'' aims to evaluate a term ''t'', it is the state  ''t'',□,□,  in which the term is ''t'' and the stack and the environment are empty. The ''final state'' (in absence of error) is of the form ''λ&amp;nbsp;t'',&amp;nbsp;□,&amp;nbsp;e, in other words, the resulting terms is an abstraction together with its environment and an empty stack.

=== The transitions ===
The Krivine machine&lt;ref name="Curien" /&gt; has four transitions : '''''App''''', '''''Abs''''', '''''Zero''''', '''''Succ'''''.
{| class="wikitable center" style = "width:50%"
|+ Transitions of the Krivine machine
|-
! scope=col | Name
! scope=col | Before
! scope=col | After
|-
| width="20%" |
'''''App''''' 
| width="40%" |
''t u'', p, e
| width="40%" |
''t'', &lt;''u'',e&gt;:p, e
|-
|
'''''Abs'''''
|
''λ t'', &lt;''u'',e'&gt;:p, e
| 
''t'', p, &lt;''u'',e'&gt;:e
|-
|
'''''Zero'''''
|
''0'', p, &lt;''t'', e'&gt;:e
|
''t'', p, e'
|-
|
'''''Succ'''''
|
''n+1'', p, &lt;''t,e'&gt;:e
|
n, p, e
|}

The transition '''''App''''' removes the parameter of an application and put it on the stack for  further evaluation.  The transition '''''Abs''''' removes the λ of the term and pop up the closure from the top of the stack and put it on the top of the environment.  This closure corresponds to the de Bruijn index ''0'' in the new environment.  The transition '''''Zero''''' takes the first closure of the environment. The term of this closure becomes the current term and the environment of this closure becomes the current environment. The transition '''''Succ''''' removes the first closure of the environment list and decreases the value of the index.

=== Two examples ===
Let us evaluate the term (''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0) which corresponds to the term (''λ'' ''x''. ''x'' ''x'') (''λ'' ''x''. ''x''). Let us start with the state (''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0), □, □.

{|class="wikitable center" style= "width:30%"
|+ Evaluation of the  term ''(λ 0 0) (λ 0)''
|-
|
(''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0), □, □
|-
|
''λ'' 0 0, [&lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;], □
|-
|
0 0, □, [&lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;]
|-
|
0, [&lt;0, &lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;&gt;], [&lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;]
|-
|
''λ'' 0, [&lt;0, &lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;&gt;], □
|-
|
0, □, [&lt;0, &lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;&gt;]
|-
|
0, □, [&lt;''λ'' 0, □&gt;]
|-
|
''λ'' 0'', □, □
|-
|}

The conclusion is that the head normal form of the term  (''λ'' 0 0) (''λ'' 0) is ''λ'' 0. This translates with variables in: the head normal form of the term (''λ'' ''x''. ''x'' ''x'') (''λ'' ''x''. ''x'') is ''λ'' ''x''. ''x''.

Let us evaluate the term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0)

{|class="wikitable center" style="width:35%"
|+ Evaluation of ((λ 0) (λ 0)) (λ 0)
|-
| ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0), □, □
|-
| (''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0), [&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;], □
|-
| (''λ'' 0), [&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;,&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;], □
|-
| 0, [&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;], [&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;]
|-
| ''λ'' 0, [&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;],  □
|-
| 0, □, [&lt;(''λ'' 0), □&gt;]
|-
| (''λ'' 0), □, □
|-
|}
This confirms the above fact that the normal form of the term ((''λ'' 0) (''λ'' 0)) (''λ'' 0) is (''λ'' 0).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">{{mergeto|Integrated landscape management|discuss=Talk:DESTINATIONPAGE#Merger proposal|date=September 2017}}

'''Landscape-scale conservation''' is a holistic approach to conservation, concerned with [[biodiversity]] and local economies, agriculture, [[eco-tourism]], [[geodiversity]] and the health and social benefits of the environment. Landscape-scale conservation has arisen in response to the challenges of [[climate change]] and a perceived excessive focus on [[site based conservation]].

==Island biogeography==
From an ecological perspective the principles of the approach owe much to the application of [[island biogeography]]. Key reservoirs of biodiversity in the landscape are identified (including designated sites). Opportunities to link, complement or expand these sites are sought with the emphasis on the role of natural processes in their management.

Among the leading exponents of UK landscape scale conservation are the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). There are 49 AONB in the UK. They have championed the "Protected Landscape Approach" that is a standard for all category 5 protected areas in the international hierarchy of protected areas as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).&lt;ref&gt;"Protected Areas in the United Kingdom" by Phillips, A. and Partington, R. in "The Protected Landscape Approach: Linking Nature, Culture and Community" Brown, J, Mitchell, N &amp; Beresford, M (Eds) (2005) IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. pp 119 - 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for all landscape scale conservation schemes must be an understanding of the character of the landscape. Landscape character goes far beyond an appreciation of an area's visual attractiveness. It involves a deep understanding of how the landscape functions to support internal and external communities, cultural heritage and development, local and macro economies as well as the wildlife and natural resources of the area. Landscape character requires careful assessment according to accepted methodologies. Landscape character assessment will contribute to the determination of what scale is appropriate in which landscape. "Landscape scale" does not mean merely making things bigger, or acting at a bigger scale than previously: it has to mean that conservation is carried out at the correct scale and that it takes into account the human elements of the landscape, both past and present.

==Natural sites==
A key inspiration for this approach was the [[Oostvaardersplassen]] near [[Amsterdam]], a huge wetland landscape that is managed largely through natural processes. These principles have been applied in the UK, such as on the Essex Coast at [[Abbot's Hall]] where managed retreat has been used to create new salt-marshes and coastal wetland.

==Existing woodland==
In recent years studies have been carried out across the UK looking at much wider range of habitats. In [[Wales]] the Pumlumon Large Area Conservation Project focusses on upland conservation in areas of marginal agriculture and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montwt.co.uk/pumlumon.html&lt;/ref&gt; The North Somerset Levels and Moors Project addresses wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/level1/level2/project_nslm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428170209/http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/level1/level2/project_nslm.htm |archivedate=2007-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several woodland based initiatives, often focusing on increasing linkages between existing woodland. An unusual approach is being taken in the [[Black Country]] where [[Black Country Living Landscape]] is applying these principals to an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;http://countdown2010.net/news/update/newsletter0604.html#focus {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730094310/http://countdown2010.net/news/update/newsletter0604.html |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tool for adaptation==
Landscape scale conservation is seen by some as an essential tool for [[adaptation]] to climate change, particularly in ensuring diverse and viable biodiversity in a changing landscape. To others in the UK it is more visionary, an opportunity to plan for a landscape which answers the needs of both people and wildlife in a crowded island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-nature.org.uk/pubs/publication/PDF/urbio7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Institute of Law''' ({{lang-lt|Teisės institutas}}) is a law research establishment, founded in 1991 by the [[Government of the Republic of Lithuania]] seeking to coordinate the reform of the [[legal system]] and law institutions, to combine it with the economic and social reorganization carried in the country. The founder of the Institute is the [[Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Lithuania]]. The main areas of research interests of the Law Institute are as follows: [[public law]] (paying most attention to the problems of [[criminal law]], [[constitutional law]] and [[criminal justice]]) and [[criminology]]. 

== Functions ==
The Institute performs the following functions while trying to achieve its aims:
* Carries the applied scientific researches of the legal system;
*Collects, analyses, systematizes and provides the state institutions with the legal and criminological information;
* Carries the legal and [[criminology|criminological]] expertise of laws and other legal acts as well as draft legal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teise.org/next.php?nr=76 About Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509181916/http://www.teise.org/next.php?nr=76 |date=2012-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7461">The '''MIRIAM Registry''', a by-product of the [[MIRIAM]] Guidelines, is a database of namespaces and associated information that is used in the creation of [[URI|uniform resource identifiers]]. It contains the set of community-approved namespaces for databases and resources serving, primarily, the biological sciences domain. These shared namespaces, when combined with 'data collection' identifiers, can be used to create globally unique identifiers for knowledge held in data repositories. For more information on the use of URIs to annotate models, see the specification of [http://sbml.org/wiki/ SBML Level 2 Version 2] (and above).

A 'data collection' is defined as a set of data which is generated by a provider. A 'resource' is defined as a distributor of that data. Such a description allows numerous resources to be associated with a single collection, allowing accurate representation of how biological information is available on the World Wide Web; often the same information, from a single data collection, may be mirrored by different resources, or the core information may be supplemented with other data.

The MIRIAM Registry is a curated resource, which is freely available and open to all. Submissions for new collections can be made through the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/mdb?section=submit |title=New Collection Submission page |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifiers using the MIRIAM system ==

The MIRIAM Guidelines require the use of uniform resource identifiers in the annotation of model components. These are created using the shared list of namespaces defined in the MIRIAM Registry.

===MIRIAM URIs===

Using the namespaces defined in the MIRIAM Registry, it is possible to create identifiers in both a URN and a URL forms. This requires a unique collection-specific identifier, as well as a namespace to globally constrain the information space. Both the namespace and the root of each URI form are given for each data collection in the Registry. It should be noted that both forms are derived from the same namespace. For example:

* urn form: &lt;code&gt;urn:miriam:pubmed:16333295&lt;/code&gt;
* url form: &lt;code&gt;http://identifiers.org/pubmed/16333295&lt;/code&gt;

In this example, the collection-specific identifier is 16333295, and the namespace is pubmed.

The URN form of identifiers requires the use of Web Services or programmatic means to access the referenced record. This means that one cannot simply put the URN form into a browser window and arrive at the referenced information. The URL form is directly resolvable, and relies on a resolving layer provided by [[Identifiers.org]].

===Supporting features and availability===

To enable efficient use of the MIRIAM Registry and the rapid adoption of the annotation scheme, a number of supporting features are provided.&lt;ref name="pmid18078503"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1752-0509-1-58 |title=MIRIAM Resources: Tools to generate and resolve robust cross-references in Systems Biology |year=2007 |last1=Laibe |first1=Camille |last2=Le Novère |first2=Nicolas |journal=BMC Systems Biology |volume=1 |page=58 |pmid=18078503 |pmc=2259379}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Web Services]], a website interface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/ |title=MIRIAM Resources Website |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to access the Registry itself, and a Java library&lt;ref name="pmid19939940"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bib/bbp056 |title=BioModels.net Web Services, a free and integrated toolkit for computational modelling software |year=2009 |last1=Li |first1=C. |last2=Courtot |first2=M. |last3=Le Novere |first3=N. |last4=Laibe |first4=C. |journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=270–7 |pmid=19939940 |pmc=2913671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology''' is a [[Germany|German]] institute for [[evolutionary biology]]. It is located in [[Plön]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany.

== History ==
The Institute was founded by German zoologist [[Otto Zacharias]] as ''Hydrobiologische Station zu Plön''. Working in Italy in the 1880s, Zacharias was inspired by the highly recognised [[Stazione Zoologica]] in [[Naples]], founded in 1870 by [[Anton Dohrn]], to set up the first "Biological Station" for freshwater research in Germany. He secured financial support from the [[Prussia]]n government and several private individuals to establish it on [[Großer Plöner See]] in 1891, as a private research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel, N. / Nöthlich, R.: Vom „Homo literatus“ zum „Self made man“ – Der Werdegang des Emil Otto Zacharias. In: Mauritiana, 19 (2006), No. 3, p. 463-477. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the director, Zacharias published research reports from 1893 on the Station's activities, which were recorded from 1905 in the Archives of Hydrobiology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Vol 20, Leipzig, 1909, p. 831. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so-called "summer schools" Zacharias trained teachers and laity interested in working with the [[microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacharias, O.: Ferienkurse in Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde an der Biologischen Station zu Plön, in: Archiv für Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde 4 (1909), p. 267-272. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became part of the [[Max Planck Society]] in 1948, and was renamed in 1966 as the '''Max Planck Institute of Limnology'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/instUeberInstitut/instGeschichte/index.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511173229/http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/instUeberInstitut/instGeschichte/index.html |date=2011-05-11 }} on official website&lt;/ref&gt;

It was renamed again as Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in 2007, marking a change of the research focus towards [[evolutionary biology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26077">In music, a '''''method''''' is a kind of [[textbook]] for a specified [[musical instrument]] or a selected problem of playing a certain instrument.

A ''method'' usually contains [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] charts or [[tablature]]s, etc., [[musical scale|scales]] and numerous different [[exercise]]s, sometimes also simple [[etude]]s, in different [[key (music)|key]]s, in ascending order as to difficulty (= in methodical ''progression'') or with a focus on isolated aspects like fluency, [[rhythm]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[articulation (music)|articulation]] and the like. Sometimes there are even [[recital]] pieces, also with accompaniment. Such methods differ from etude books in that they are meant as a linear course for a student to follow, with consistent guidance, whereas volumes of etudes are not as comprehensive.

As typical instrumental methods are meant to function as textbooks supporting an instrumental teacher (rather than to facilitate self-teaching), usually no basic or special playing techniques are covered in any depth. Detailed instructions in this respect are only found in special, [[Autodidacticism|autodidactical]] methods.

Some methods are especially tailored for students on certain [[skill]] levels or [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]]. In contrast, a 'complete' method (sometimes in multiple volumes) is meant to accompany the student until he or she becomes an advanced player.

Methods of certain authors or editors have achieved the status of standard works (reflecting regional and cultural differences) and are published or reissued by different [[publishing]] companies and in divers (new) [[arrangement]]s. The [[Suzuki Method]] is probably the most well known example of this.

The following is a list of various methods of historical interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15781">In [[Planetary Sciences|planetary sciences]], the '''moment of inertia factor''' or '''normalized polar moment of inertia''' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] quantity that characterizes the radial distribution of [[mass]] inside a [[planet]] or [[Natural satellite|satellite]].  Since a [[moment of inertia]] must have dimensions of mass times length squared, the moment of inertia factor is the dimensionless coefficient that multiplies these.{{refn |For example, for a [[List of moments of inertia#Moments of inertia|uniform long thin rod rotating about its end]], the moment of inertia is &lt;math&gt;(1/3)ML^2&lt;/math&gt;, so its moment of inertia factor is 1/3.| group = note}}

==Definition==
For a planetary body with [[principal moments of inertia]] ''A&lt;B&lt;C'', the moment of inertia factor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{MR^2}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''C'' is the polar moment of inertia of the body, ''M'' is the [[mass]] of the body, and ''R'' is the mean [[radius]] of the body.&lt;ref name="Hubbard84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PS15" /&gt; For a [[List of moments of inertia#Moments of inertia|sphere with uniform density]], &lt;math&gt;C/MR^2=0.4&lt;/math&gt;.  For a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] planet or satellite, where there is an increase of density with depth, &lt;math&gt;C/MR^2&lt;0.4&lt;/math&gt;.  The quantity is a useful indicator of the presence and extent of a [[planetary core]], because a greater departure from the uniform-density value of 0.4 conveys a greater degree of concentration of dense materials towards the center.

==Solar System values==
The [[Sun]] has by far the lowest moment of inertia factor value among [[Solar System]] bodies; it has by far the highest central density ({{val|162|u=g/cm3}},&lt;ref name="WilliamsDR" /&gt;{{refn |A star's central density tends to increase over the [[stellar evolution|course of its lifetime]].| group = note}} compared to ~13 for [[Earth]]&lt;ref name=robertson2001&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robertson |first1=Eugene C. |date=26 July 2001 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/interior/ |title=The Interior of the Earth |publisher=[[USGS]] |accessdate=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hazlett, James S. |author2=Monroe, Reed |author3=Wicander, Richard |title=Physical geology : exploring the earth|year= 2006|publisher= Thomson|location= Belmont|isbn= 9780495011484|page= 346|edition= 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a relatively low average density (1.41&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; versus 5.5 for Earth).

==Measurement==
The polar moment of inertia is traditionally determined by combining measurements of spin quantities ([[precession|spin precession]] rate and/or [[obliquity]]) with [[gravity]] quantities (coefficients of a [[spherical harmonic]] representation of the gravity field). These [[geodesy|geodetic]] data usually require an orbiting [[spacecraft]] to collect.

==Approximation==
For bodies in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], the [[Darwin–Radau equation|Darwin–Radau relation]] can provide estimates of the moment of inertia factor on the basis of shape, spin, and gravity quantities.&lt;ref name=MurrayDermott2000 /&gt;

==Role in interior models==
The moment of inertia factor provides an important constraint for models representing the interior structure of a planet or satellite.  At a minimum, acceptable models of the density profile must match the [[Mass density|volumetric mass density]] and moment of inertia factor of the body.

Research in [[artificial intelligence (AI)]] is known to have impacted [[medical diagnosis]], [[Algorithmic trading|stock trading]], [[robot control]], and several other fields. Perhaps less popular is the contribution of AI in the field of [[music]]. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence and music (AIM) has, for a long time, been a common subject in several conferences and workshops, including the [[International Computer Music Conference]], the Computing Society Conference &lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html INFORMS Computing Society Conference: Annapolis: Music, Computation and AI] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630221600/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html |date=2012-06-30 }}. Rcf.usc.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]]. In fact, the first International Computer Music Conference was the ICMC 1974, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computermusic.org/page/23/ International Computer Music Association - ICMC]. Computermusic.org (2010-11-15). Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
Current research includes the application of AI in [[Musical composition|music composition]], [[performance]], theory and digital [[Audio signal processing|sound processing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a714908257?words=artificial*|intelligence*|music* Research in Music and Artificial Intelligence - Ergonomics Abstracts]. Informaworld.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Several music [[software]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have been developed that use AI to produce music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

A prominent feature is the capability of the A.I. algorithm to learn based on information obtained such as the computer accompaniment technology, which is capable of listening to and following a human performer so it can perform in synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf|title=Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Music Understanding|last=Dannenberg|first=Roger|date=|website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence also drives the so-called interactive composition technology, wherein a computer composes music in response to the performance of a live musician. There are several other A.I. applications to music that covers not only music composition, production, and performance but also the way it is marketed and consumed. Companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Spotify]] rely on user data to augment their engagement metrics to power their ability to get consumers to listen more to music or push the right songs to users according to their preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinwestcottgrant/2017/12/10/how-to-think-about-artificial-intelligence-in-the-music-industry/#55a5c0eb7d4a|title=How To Think About Artificial Intelligence In The Music Industry|last=Grant|first=Kristin Westcott|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1960, Russian researcher R.Kh.Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the "[[Ural (computer)|Ural-1]]" computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaripov|first=R.Kh.|title=Об алгоритмическом описании процесса сочинения музыки (On algorithmic description of process of music composition)|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|year=1960|volume=132|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, inventor Ray Kurzweil premiered a piano piece created by a computer that was capable of pattern recognition in various compositions. The computer was then able to analyze and use these patterns to create novel melodies. The computer was debuted on Steve Allen's I've Got a Secret program, and stumped the hosts until film star Henry Morgan guessed Ray's secret.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweiltech.com/raybio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software applications==

===Interactive scores===
Multimedia Scenarios in interactive scores are represented by
temporal objects,
temporal relations and
interactive objects. Examples of temporal objects are sounds, videos and light controls.
Temporal objects can be triggered by interactive objects (usually launched by the user) and
several temporal objects can be executed simultaneously.  A temporal object may contain
other temporal objects:  this hierarchy allows us to control the start or end of a temporal
object by controlling the start or end of its parent.  Hierarchy is ever-present in all kinds
of music:  Music pieces are often hierarchized by movements, parts, motives, measures,
among other segmentations. &lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Toro, Myriam Desainte-Catherine, Camilo Rueda. Formal semantics for interactive music scores: a framework to design, specify properties and execute interactive scenarios.

===[https://www.orb-composer.com/ Orb Composer]===
A program developed by Hexachords and directed by Richard Portelli, mainly focused on orchestral music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jallet|first1=Fabrice|title=Hexachords a créé une IA pour les compositeurs de musique / Actualités / Irma : centre d'information et de ressources pour les musiques actuelles|url=http://www.irma.asso.fr/Hexachords-a-cree-une-IA-pour-les|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=Hexachords a créé une IA pour les compositeurs de musique / Actualités / Irma : centre d'information et de ressources pour les musiques actuelles|date=13 January 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richard|first1=Portelli|title=Orb Composer Software - Music Artificial Intelligence Engine|url=http://www.hexachords.com/orb-composer|website=Hexachords|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The IA called "Orb" help the user in the composition process. The software is commercialized on their official website since march 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.orb-composer.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===EMI===
A program developed by David Cope which composes classical music. See [[Experiments in Musical Intelligence]]. [[Emily Howell]] is an interactive augmentation of EMI. (As a popular example, the background music of the [[viral video]] [[Humans Need Not Apply]] was created by "her", as revealed in the video to illustrate the likely fate of creative jobs.)

===OrchExtra===

This program was designed to provide small-budget productions with instrumentation for all instruments usually present in the full-fledged orchestra. If there is a small orchestra playing, the program can play the part for missing instruments. High school and community theaters wanting to produce a musical can now benefit from the virtual orchestra and realize a full Broadway score. This software is able to follow the fluctuations in tempo and musical expression. Musicians enjoy the thrill of playing with a full orchestra, while the audience enjoys the rich sound that comes from the combination of the virtual orchestra with the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rms.biz/index.cfm?page=OrchEXTRA Realtime Music Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060910191858/http://www.rms.biz/index.cfm?page=OrchEXTRA |date=2006-09-10 }}.

===Computer Accompaniment (Carnegie Mellon University)===
The Computer Music Project at CMU develops computer music and interactive performance technology to enhance human musical experience and creativity. This interdisciplinary effort draws on [[Music Theory]], [[Cognitive Science]], [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Machine Learning]], [[Human Computer Interaction]], [[Real-Time Systems]], [[Computer Graphics]] and Animation, [[Multimedia]], [[Programming Languages]], and [[Signal Processing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~music/ Computer Music Group]. 2.cs.cmu.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; One of their project is similar to SmartMusic. It provides accompaniment for the chosen piece follows the soloist (user) despite tempo changes and/or mistakes.

Demo:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~music/examples/RBDACCMP.MOV Video demo of computer accompaniment]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SmartMusic ===
SmartMusic is an interactive, computer-based practice tool for musicians. It offers exercises, instant feedback tools, and accompaniments meant to aid musicians. The product is targeted at teachers and students alike and offers five categories of accompaniments: solo, skill development, method books, jazz, and ensemble. Teachers can give students pre-defined assignments via email and scan in sheet music that is not yet in the SmartMusic catalog. Students can choose the difficulty level they want to play at, slow down or speed up the tempo, or change the key in which to play the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartmusic.com/| title=Discover SmartMusic|website=smartmusic.com|publisher = MakeMusic, Inc.|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SmartMusic also compares students' playing with digital template, which allows it to detect mistakes and mark them on a score. It also simulates the rapport between musicians by sensing and reacting to tempo changes.

===StarPlayIt===

StarPlay is also a music education software that allows the user to practice by performing with professional musicians, bands and orchestras. They can choose their spot and watch the video from that spot. They can hear the other musicians playing. Again, the program listens to the user's performance and helps them improve their performance by providing constructive feedback as they rehearse. StarPlay was developed by StarPlayIt (formerly In The Chair), a music technology company that has won many awards for its platforms for online musical performance and participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthechair.com/index.php (BROKEN LINK) StarPlayit music learning and video game technology platform].

===REAPER's TabEditor===
MIDI to string instrument (guitar, violin, dombra, etc.) tablature conversion is a nontrivial task, as the same note can reside on different strings of the instrument. And the creation of good fingering is sometimes a challenge even for real musicians, especially when translating a two handed piano composition on a string instrument.
So in TabEditor&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/TabEditor TabEditor]&lt;/ref&gt; (the tiny plugin for [[REAPER]] DAW), an AI was used that solves this puzzle the same way as a musician would: trying to keep all the notes close to each other (to be possible to play) while trying to fit all the piano notes into a range that can be played simultaneously on the instrument. When direct translation is impossible (piano part has more notes than are possible on the guitar) the AI tries to find an acceptable solution, removing as few notes as possible from the original composition.
The Prolog programming language was used to create this AI.

===Ludwig===
Ludwig&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.write-music.com The automatic composition software Ludwig]. www.write-music.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; is an automated composition software based on tree search algorithms. Ludwig generates melodies according to principles of classical music theory. The software arranges its melodies with pop-automation patterns or in four-part choral writing. Ludwig can react in real-time on an eight-bar theme played on a keyboard. The theme will be analysed for key, harmonic content and rhythm while it is being performed  by a human. The program then without delay repeats the theme arranged e.g. for orchestra. It subsequently varies the melody to create a little piece as interactive answer to the human input.

===OMax===
OMax&lt;ref&gt;[http://omax.ircam.fr/ The OMax Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a software environment which  learns in real-time typical features of a musician's style and  plays along with him interactively, giving the flavor of a machine co-improvisation. OMax uses OpenMusic and Max. It is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by G. Assayag, M. Chemillier and G. Bloch (Aka the OMax Brothers) in the [[Ircam]] Music Representations group.

===Melomics===
Melomics is a proprietary computational system for the automatic (without human intervention) composition of music, based on bioinspired methods and produced by Melomics Media.  Composing a wide variety of genres, all music composed by Melomics algorithms are available in MP3, MIDI, MusicXML, and PDF (of sheet music), after purchase. Music composed by this algorithm was organized into an album named [[Iamus (album)]], which was hailed by New Scientist as "The first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite   journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MorpheuS===
MorpheuS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = MorpheuS: Automatic music generation with recurrent pattern constraints and tension profiles

The system uses an optimization approach based on a variable neighborhood search algorithm to morph existing template pieces into novel pieces with a set level of tonal tension that changes dynamically throughout the piece. This optimization approach allows for the integration of a pattern detection technique in order to enforce long term structure and recurring themes in the generated music. Pieces composed by MorpheuS have been performed at concerts in both Stanford and London.

===MXX===
Founded in 2015, MXX (Mashtraxx Ltd) is a creative AI technology company, which has developed the world’s first AI engine that atomises and edits music to video instantly.
 
The MXX technology is the only artificially intelligent music editor that can work on the stereo file alone, without the need for stems, and can adapt the narrative to fit a brief just like a music editor would.
 
With the MXX products, music can be adapted to perfectly wrap around certain experiences such as UGC of different lengths and forms; users workouts and runs; computer game dynamic narratives; and object-based media viewing of dynamic lengths. This presents a new future for music in itself, as music is one of the few remaining static artefacts in a world where all media needs to be more dynamic and flexible.
 
The first MXX product, Audition Pro, enables anyone to edit music against video with intensity rises, fades, dropouts and climax points, load any track, and immediately listen to the edited track, and makes responding to the demands of today’s media fast and simple.

===Flow Machines===
Flow Machines is a research project funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and led by [[François Pachet]]. Flow Machines aims at transforming musical style into a computational object to apply to AI-generated melodies and harmonies. Flow Machines has composed two fully-fledged pop songs, issued from a collaboration between the AI software and pop composer Benoît Carré: Daddy's Car &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o]. Daddy's Car&lt;/ref&gt; and Mister Shadow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcGYEXJqun8]. Mister Shadow&lt;/ref&gt;
Flow Machines also produced DeepBach, a neural network system which produces harmonisation in Bach style indiscernible from original Bach's harmonisations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01010.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[AIVA]]===
Created in February 2016, in [[Luxembourg]], [[AIVA]] is an Artificial Intelligence that specializes in the composition of personalized soundtracks for any type of media. AIVA became the world’s first virtual composer to be recognized by a music society ([[SACEM]]). By reading 30,000 scores of history's greatest composers (such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart) AIVA is capable of understanding concepts of music theory and compose on its own. The algorithms behind AIVA are based on deep learning architectures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiva.ai]. AIVA 2016&lt;/ref&gt; AIVA has also been used to compose a Rock track called ''On the Edge''&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@aivatech/the-making-of-ai-generated-rock-music-with-aiva-9ae0257e6d5c] AI-generated Rock Music: the Making Of&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as a pop tune ''Love Sick''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSPjAYTlx8] Love Sick | Composed with Artificial Intelligence - Official Video with Lyrics | Taryn Southern&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with singer [[Taryn Southern]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/ai-is-the-future-of-rhythm-nation/] Algo-Rhythms: the future of album collaboration&lt;/ref&gt;, for the creation of her 2018 album "I am AI".

'''Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution''' is a term used to describe pollution resulting from many diffuse sources, in direct contrast to [[point source pollution]] which results from a single source. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult.&lt;ref name="epa-nps-overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/what-nonpoint-source |title=What is Nonpoint Source? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-02 |website=Polluted Runoff |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-point source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[agricultural]] areas draining into a river, or wind-borne [[debris]] blowing out to sea. Non-point source air pollution affects air quality from sources such as [[smokestack]]s or car [[tailpipe]]s. Although these pollutants have originated from a point source, the long-range transport ability and multiple sources of the pollutant make it a non-point source of pollution. Non-point source pollution can be contrasted with [[point source (pollution)|point source pollution]], where discharges occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location.

NPS may derive from many different sources with no specific solution may change to rectify the problem, making it difficult to regulate. Non point source water pollution is difficult to control because it comes from the everyday activities of many different people, such as lawn [[fertilizer|fertilization]], applying [[pesticide]]s, [[road construction]] or [[building construction]].&lt;ref name="tceq-nps"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/waterquality/nonpoint-source/mgmt-plan/index.html |title=Management Program for Nonpoint Source Water Pollution |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-22 |publisher=Texas Commission on Environmental Quality |location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States today, with polluted runoff from agriculture and [[hydromodification]] the primary sources.&lt;ref name="EPA-2004-wq-report"&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress; 2004 Reporting Cycle |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-08-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} &lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2003 |title=National Management Measures to Control Non-point Source Pollution from Agriculture |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-agriculture |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-03-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant sources of runoff include [[habitat destruction|habitat modification]] and [[silviculture]] (forestry).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2005 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-forestry |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-05-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminated stormwater washed off parking lots, roads and highways, and lawns (often containing [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s) is called [[urban runoff]]. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution. Some people may also consider it a point source because many times it is channeled into municipal storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to nearby [[surface water]]s. However, not all urban runoff flows through [[storm drain]] systems before entering water bodies. Some may flow directly into water bodies, especially in developing and suburban areas. Also, unlike other types of point sources, such as industrial discharges, [[sewage treatment]] plants and other operations, pollution in urban runoff cannot be attributed to one activity or even group of activities. Therefore, because it is not caused by an easily identified and regulated activity, urban runoff pollution sources are also often treated as true non-point sources as municipalities work to abate them.

==Principal types==
[[Image:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] of [[soil]] and [[fertilizer]] during a rain storm]]

===Sediment===
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) includes [[silt]] (fine particles) and [[suspended solids]] (larger particles). Sediment may enter surface waters from eroding stream banks, and from [[surface runoff]] due to improper plant cover on urban and rural land.&lt;ref name="IAfact"&gt;Iowa State University. University Extension. Ames, IA. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/EDC232A.pdf "Iowa Fact Sheet: Agriculture and Water Quality."] October 2001. Document No. EDC232a.&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment creates [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) in water bodies, reducing the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |last1=Stevenson |first1=J. Court |last2=Piper |first2=Catherine B. |last3=Confer |first3=Nedra |date=1979 |title=Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay |url=https://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Annapolis, MD |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; High turbidity levels also inhibit drinking [[water purification]] systems.

Sediment can also be discharged from multiple different sources.  Sources include [[construction]] sites (although these are point sources, which can be managed with [[erosion control]]s and [[sediment control]]s), agricultural fields, stream banks, and highly disturbed areas.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"&gt;Penn State University. Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO. [http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727035540/http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===
[[File:Nonpoint Source Pollution.svg|thumb|Nonpoint source pollution is caused when precipitation (1) carries pollutants from the ground such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants which come from fertilizers used on farm lands (2) or urban areas (3). These nutrients can cause [[eutrophication]] (4).]]
Nutrients mainly refers to inorganic matter from runoff, [[landfill]]s, [[livestock]] operations and crop lands. The two primary nutrients of concern are phosphorus and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;Rob Leeds, Larry C. Brown, Nathan L. Watermeier. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020223144636/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0465.html "Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering."] Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phosphorus]] is a nutrient that occurs in many forms that are [[bioavailable]]. It is notoriously over-abundant in human sewage [[sludge]]. It is a main ingredient in many fertilizers used for agriculture as well as on residential and commercial properties, and may become a [[limiting nutrient]] in freshwater systems and some [[estuaries]]. Phosphorus is most often transported to water bodies via [[soil erosion]] because many forms of phosphorus tend to be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on to soil particles. Excess amounts of phosphorus in aquatic systems (particularly freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) leads to proliferation of microscopic algae called [[phytoplankton]]. The increase of organic matter supply due to the excessive growth of the phytoplankton is called [[eutrophication]]. A common symptom of eutrophication is [[algae]] blooms that can produce unsightly surface scums, shade out beneficial types of plants, produce taste-and-odor-causing compounds, and poison the water due to toxins produced by the algae. These toxins are a particular problem in systems used for drinking water because some toxins can cause human illness and removal of the toxins is difficult and expensive. Bacterial decomposition of algal blooms consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, generating [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] with detrimental consequences for fish and aquatic invertebrates.

[[Nitrogen]] is the other key ingredient in fertilizers, and it generally becomes a pollutant in saltwater or brackish estuarine systems where nitrogen is a limiting nutrient. Similar to phosphorus in fresh-waters, excess amounts of bioavailable nitrogen in marine systems lead to eutrophication and algae blooms. Hypoxia is an increasingly common result of eutrophication in marine systems and can impact large areas of estuaries, bays, and near shore coastal waters. Each summer, hypoxic conditions form in [[bottom water]]s where the [[Mississippi River]] enters the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. During recent summers, the aereal extent of this "dead zone" is comparable to the area of [[New Jersey]] and has major detrimental consequences for fisheries in the region.

Nitrogen is most often transported by water as [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The nitrogen is usually added to a watershed as organic-N or [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), so nitrogen stays attached to the soil until [[oxidation]] converts it into nitrate. Since the nitrate is generally already incorporated into the soil, the water traveling through the soil (i.e., [[interflow]] and [[tile drainage]]) is the most likely to transport it, rather than surface runoff.

===Toxic contaminants and chemicals===
Compounds including heavy metals like [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[cadmium]], organics like [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), fire retardants, and other substances are resistant to breakdown.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These contaminants can come from a variety of sources including human sewage sludge, [[mining]] operations, vehicle emissions, [[fossil fuel]] combustion, urban runoff, industrial operations and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Toxic chemicals mainly include [[organic compounds]] and [[inorganic compounds]]. These compounds include pesticides like [[DDT]], acids, and salts that have severe effects to the ecosystem and water-bodies. These compounds can threaten the health of both humans and aquatic species while being resistant to environmental breakdown, thus allowing them to persist in the environment.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These toxic chemicals could come from croplands, nurseries, orchards, building sites, gardens, lawns and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Acids and salts mainly are inorganic pollutants from irrigated lands, mining operations, urban runoff, industrial sites and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

===Pathogens===
[[Pathogens]] are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; Typically, pathogens cause disease when they are present in public drinking water supplies. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include:
* ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]''
* ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''
* ''[[Salmonella]]''
* ''[[Novovirus|Norovirus]]'' and other [[virus]]es
* [[Parasitic worm]]s (helminths).
[[Coliform bacteria]] and [[fecal matter]] may also be detected in runoff.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;  These [[bacteria]] are a commonly used [[indicator bacteria|indicator]] of water pollution, but not an actual cause of disease.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. Reston, VA. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-027-01/ "A Primer on Water Quality."] FS-027-01. March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens may contaminate runoff due to poorly managed livestock operations, faulty [[septic system]]s, improper handling of pet waste, the over application of human sewage [[sludge]], contaminated storm sewers, and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s.&lt;ref name="IAfact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;

==Principal sources==

===Urban and suburban areas===
[[Urban Area|Urban]] and [[Suburban|suburban areas]] are a main sources of nonpoint source pollution due to the amount of runoff that is produced due to the large amount of paved surfaces. Paved surfaces, such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] are impervious to water penetrating them. Any water that is on contact with these surfaces will run off and be absorbed by the surrounding environment. These surfaces make it easier for stormwater to carry pollutants into the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Washington D.C. [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_pollution/lessons/pollution_tutorial.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution"] September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction sites tend to have disturbed soil that is easily eroded by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] like [[rain]], [[snow]], and [[hail]]. Additionally, discarded debris on the site can be carried away by runoff waters and enter the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Typically, in suburban areas, chemicals are used for lawn care. These chemicals can end up in runoff and enter the surrounding environment via storm drains in the city. Since the water in storm drains is not treated before flowing into surrounding water bodies, the chemicals enter the water directly.

===Agricultural operations===
Agricultural operations account for a large percentage of all nonpoint source pollution in the United States. When large tracts of land are [[plow]]ed to grow [[crops]], it exposes and loosens soil that was once buried. This makes the exposed soil more vulnerable to [[erosion]] during [[rainstorm]]s. It also can increase the amount of fertilizer and pesticides carried into nearby bodies of water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Atmospheric inputs===
{{Cite check|section|date=July 2016}}
Atmospheric inputs of pollution into the air can come from multiple sources. Typically, industrial facilities, like [[factory|factories]], emit air pollution via a [[smokestack]]. Although this is a point source, due to the distributional nature, long-range transport, and multiple sources of the pollution, it is considered a nonpoint source. Additionally, atmospheric pollution can become water pollution, by being washed out of the atmosphere in the form of rain or snow.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}

===Highway runoff===
Highway runoff accounts for a small but widespread percentage of all nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M.K., Agnew, R.W., Gruber, D., and Kreutzberger, W.A., 1981, Constituents of highway runoff, in v. IV, Characteristics of runoff from operating highways—Research report: [https://archive.org/details/constituentsofhi00gupt_1 "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA/RD–81/045"], 171 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, E.D., Shelley, P.E., and Strecker, E.W., 1990, Pollutant loadings and impacts from highway stormwater runoff, v. III—Analytical investigation and research report: [https://newengland.water.usgs.gov/dev/g1/DOT/90Model/ "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA–RD–88–008"], 160 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, G.K., Stein, Stuart, Cole, Pamela, Kammer, Traci, Graziano, Frank, and Bank, F.G., 1996, Evaluation and management of highway runoff water quality: Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA–PD–96–032, 480 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., Bank, F.G., and Cazenas, P.A., 2003, Data quality objectives and criteria for basic information, acceptable uncertainty, and quality-assurance and quality-control documentation, in Granato, G.E., Zenone, Chester, and Cazenas, P.A., eds., National highway runoff water-quality data and methodology synthesis, v. I—Technical issues for monitoring highway runoff and urban stormwater: [https://newengland.water.usgs.gov/dev/g1/Reports/FHWA-EP03-054.pdf "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA–EP–03–054"], p. 3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., and Cazenas, P.A., 2009, Highway-runoff database (HRDB version 1.0)—A data warehouse and preprocessor for the [[Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model]]: [https://newengland.water.usgs.gov/dev/g1/DOT/FHWA-HEP-09-004/FHWA-HEP-09-004.pdf "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA–HEP–09–004"] 57 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.P., and Granato, G.E., 2010, Quality of stormwater runoff discharged from Massachusetts highways, 2005–07: [http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5269/ U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2009–5269], 198 p., with CD–ROM.&lt;/ref&gt; Harned (1988) estimated that runoff loads were composed of atmospheric fallout (9%), vehicle deposition (25%) and [[Road#Maintenance|highway maintenance]] materials (67%) he also estimated that about 9 percent of these loads were reentrained in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Harned, D.A., 1988, Effects of Highway Runoff on Streamflow and Water Quality in the Sevenmile Creek Basin, a Rural Area in the Piedmont Province of North Carolina, July 1981 to July 1982: [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2329 "U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2329"] 105 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry and mining operations===
[[Forestry]] and [[environmental impact of mining|mining]] operations can have significant inputs to non-point source pollution.

====Forestry====
Forestry operations reduce the number of trees in a given area, thus reducing the oxygen levels in that area as well. This action, coupled with the heavy machinery (harvesters, etc.) rolling over the soil increases the risk of [[erosion]].

====Mining====
Active [[mining]] operations are considered point sources, however runoff from abandoned mining operations contribute to nonpoint source pollution. In [[strip mining]] operations, the top of the mountain is removed to expose the desired [[ore]]. If this area is not properly reclaimed once the mining has finished, [[soil erosion]] can occur. Additionally, there can be chemical reactions with the air and newly exposed rock to create acidic runoff. Water that seeps out of abandoned [[underground mining|subsurface mines]] can also be highly acidic. This can seep into the nearest body of water and change the pH in the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas and boating activities===
Chemicals used for boat maintenance, like [[paint]], [[solvent]]s, and [[oil]]s find their way into water through runoff. Additionally, spilling fuels or leaking fuels directly into the water from boats contribute to nonpoint source pollution. Nutrient and bacteria levels are increased by poorly maintained sanitary waste receptacles on the boat and pump-out stations.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

==Control==
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment|Erosion control}}
[[Image:Contour buffer strips NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Contour [[buffer strip]]s used to retain soil and reduce [[erosion]]]]

===Urban and suburban areas===
To control non-point source pollution, many different approaches can be undertaken in both urban and suburban areas. [[Buffer strip]]s provide a barrier of grass in between impervious paving material like parking lots and roads, and the closest body of water.  This allows the soil to absorb any pollution before it enters the local aquatic system. [[Retention pond]]s can be built in drainage areas to create an aquatic buffer between runoff pollution and the aquatic environment. Runoff and storm water drain into the retention pond allowing for the contaminants to settle out and become trapped in the pond. The use of [[permeable paving|porous pavement]] allows for rain and storm water to drain into the ground beneath the pavement, reducing the amount of runoff that drains directly into the water body. Restoration methods such as [[Constructed wetland|constructing wetlands]] are also used to slow runoff as well as absorb contamination.

Construction sites typically implement simple measures to reduce pollution and runoff. Firstly, sediment or [[silt fence]]s are erected around construction sites to reduce the amount of sediment and large material draining into the nearby water body.  Secondly, laying grass or straw along the border of construction sites also work to reduce nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

In areas served by single-home septic systems, local government regulations can force septic system maintenance to ensure compliance with water quality standards. In [[Washington (state)]], a novel approach was developed through a creation of a "shellfish protection district" when either a commercial or recreational shellfish bed is downgraded because of ongoing nonpoint source pollution. The shellfish protection district is a geographic area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources, and provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control nonpoint sources of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psparchives.com/restore-habs/|title=Restore Habitat|author=|date=10 April 2018|website=Marine|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two shellfish protection districts in south [[Puget Sound]] have instituted septic system operation and maintenance requirements with program fees tied directly to property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.thurston.wa.us/health/ehrp/nisqually.html |title=PHSS HomeA-Z TopicsPrograms/Serv |publisher=Co.thurston.wa.us |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural operations===
To control sediment and runoff, farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops or installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-95–4-96}}&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Fort Worth, TX. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/330.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Contour Farming."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 330. June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/484.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Mulching."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 484. September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Conservation tillage]]'' is a concept used to reduce runoff while planting a new crop. The farmer leaves some crop reside from the previous planting in the ground to help prevent runoff during the planting process.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer; animal [[manure]]; or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p. 2–9}} Farmers can develop and implement [[nutrient management]] plans to reduce excess application of nutrients.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-37–4-38}}&lt;ref&gt;NRCS.

August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/595.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 595. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/ipm.htm "Integrated Pest Management Principles."] March 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry operations===
With a well-planned placement of both logging trails, also called skid trails, can reduce the amount of sediment generated. By planning the trails location as far away from the logging activity as possible as well as contouring the trails with the land, it can reduce the amount of loose sediment in the runoff. Additionally, by replanting trees on the land after logging, it provides a structure for the soil to regain stability as well as replaces the logged environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas===
Installing shut off valves on fuel pumps at a marina dock can help reduce the amount of spillover into the water. Additionally, pump-out stations that are easily accessible to boaters in a marina can provide a clean place in which to dispose of sanitary waste without dumping it directly into the water. Finally, something as simple as having trash containers around a marina can prevent larger objects entering the water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

'''Omnibenevolence''' (from [[Latin]] ''omni-'' meaning "all", ''bene-'' meaning "good" and ''volens'' meaning "willing") is defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as "unlimited or infinite [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]". Some philosophers have argued that it is impossible, or at least improbable, for a deity to exhibit such a property alongside [[omniscience]] and [[omnipotence]], as a result of the [[problem of evil]]. However, some philosophers, such as [[Alvin Plantinga]], argue the plausibility of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|co-existence]]. The word is primarily used as a technical term within academic literature on the [[philosophy of religion]], mainly in context of the [[problem of evil]] and [[theodicy|theodical]] responses to such. Although even in said contexts the phrases "perfect goodness" or "moral perfection" are often preferred because of the difficulties in defining what exactly constitutes "infinite benevolence".

==Etymology==
"Omnibenevolence" appears to have a very casual usage among some Protestant Christian commentators. The earliest record for its use in English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is in 1679. The [[Catholic Church]] does not appear to use the term "omnibenevolent" in the [[liturgy]] or [[Catechism]].

Modern users of the term include [[George H. Smith]] in his book ''Atheism: The Case Against God'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Smith | first=George H. | year = 1980 | title=Atheism: The Case Against God | publisher=Prometheus Books | isbn=0-87975-124-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that divine qualities are inconsistent.  However, the term is also used by authors who defend the coherence of divine attributes, including but not limited to, Jonathan Kvanvig in ''The Problem of Hell'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kvanvig | first=Jonathan L. | year=1993 | title=The Problem of Hell | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=4 | isbn=0-19-508487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz in ''The Divine Attributes'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hoffman | first=Joshua |author2=Gary Rosenkrantz | year=2002 | title=The Divine Attributes | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | isbn=0-631-21154-3}} Used throughout the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology has been used by some prominent [[Roman Catholic]] figures, examples being Father [[Robert Barron (priest)|Robert Barron]], [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] in his 2011 book ''Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Barron (priest)|Robert Barron]]|title=Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith|date=2011|ISBN=0307720519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical perspectives==
The term is patterned on, and often accompanied by, the terms ''[[omniscience]]'' and ''[[omnipotence]]'', typically to refer to conceptions of an "all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful" deity. Philosophers and theologians more commonly use phrases like "perfectly good",&lt;ref&gt;This phrase is used in many notable encyclopedia and dictionary entries, such as:
* {{Cite encyclopedia |first=Michael |last=Tooley |title=The Problem of Evil |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia |first=Simon |last=Blackburn|title=Evil, the Problem of |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the term "benevolence". The word "omnibenevolence" may be interpreted to mean perfectly just, all-loving, fully merciful, or any number of other qualities, depending on precisely how "good" is understood. As such, there is little agreement over how an "omnibenevolent" being would behave.

The notion of an omnibenevolent, infinitely compassionate deity, has raised certain [[atheist]]ic objections, such as the [[problem of evil]] and the [[problem of hell]]. Responses to such problems are called [[theodicy|theodicies]] and can be general, arguing for the coherence of the divine, such as [[Swinburne]]'s ''Providence and the Problem of Evil'', or they can address a specific problem, such as Charles Seymour's ''A Theodicy of Hell''.

Proponents of [[Pandeism]] contend that benevolence (much less omnibenevolence) is simply not required to account for any property of our Universe, as a morally neutral deity which was powerful enough to have created our Universe as we experience it would be, by definition, able to have created our Universe as we experience it. William C. Lane contended that Pandeism thereby offered an escape from the [[evidential argument from evil]]:&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 | doi = | accessdate = 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, author William C. Lane contended that:

{{quote|In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. Instead God ''bears'' all suffering, whether the fawn's&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Rowe|William Rowe]] used, as an example of needless suffering, a fawn horribly burned in a forest fire and unable to move, yet suffering for additional days before its death.&lt;/ref&gt; or anyone else's.

Even so, a skeptic might ask, "Why must there be ''so'' much suffering,? Why could not the world's design omit or modify the events that cause it?" In pandeism, the reason is clear: to remain unified, a world must convey information through transactions. Reliable conveyance requires relatively simple, uniform laws. Laws designed to skip around suffering-causing events or to alter their natural consequences (i.e., their consequences under simple laws) would need to be vastly complicated or (equivalently) to contain numerous exceptions.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;{{rp|76–77}}}}

==Religious perspectives==
Belief in [[God]]'s omnibenevolence is an essential foundation in traditional Christianity; this can be seen in Scriptures such as [[Psalms]] 18:30: "As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him," and Ps.19:7: "The law of the Lord is good, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."  This understanding is evident in the following statement by the [[First Vatican Council]]{{original research inline|date=November 2011}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church believes and acknowledges that there is one true and living God, Creator and Lord of Heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, infinite in will, understanding and every perfection. Since He is one, singular, completely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, He must be declared to be in reality and in essence, distinct from the world, supremely happy in Himself and from Himself, and inexpressibly loftier than anything besides Himself which either exists or can be imagined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/20ecume1.htm|title=First Vatican Council|work=dailycatholic.org|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosophical justification stems from God's [[aseity]]: the non-contingent, independent and self-sustained mode of existence that theologians ascribe to God. For if he was not morally perfect, that is, if God was merely a great being but nevertheless of finite benevolence, then his existence would involve an element of contingency, because one could always conceive of a being of greater benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08004a.htm|title=The infinity of God|work=Catholic Encyclopaedia|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, omnibenevolence is a requisite of perfect being theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfect Being Theology|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/perfect-being-theology|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians in the Wesleyan Christian tradition (see [[Thomas Jay Oord]]) argue that omnibenevolence is God's primary [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute]].  As such, God's other attributes should be understood in light of omnibenevolence. Christians believe in the idea of unconditional love.
: ''But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.'' (Romans 5:8 NIV)

Some [[Hyper-Calvinism#Hyper-Calvinism doctrine|Hyper-Calvinist]] interpretations reject omnibenevolence. For example, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] is infamous for its expression of this stance.

Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] argues that Islam does not hold to the idea of omnibenevolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-islamic-conception-of-god-morally-inadequate|title=Is the Islamic Concept of God Morally Inadequate?|publisher=Reasonable Faith|author=[[William Lane Craig]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Poetics of Cinema''''' is a book series of [[film theory]] by Chilean filmmaker [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] (1941-2011) consisting principally of lectures he gave in diverse locations between 1990 and 2009.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artbook.com/2906571385.html |title=Poetics of Cinema |accessdate=2012-05-11|work=artbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In ''Poetics of Cinema 1: Miscellanies'' (1995), Ruiz outlines his rejection of [[John Howard Lawson]]'s central conflict theory and makes a case for unique, enigmatic boredom in film. In ''Poetics of Cinema 2'' (2006), he addresses the notions of fascination and detachment with respect to the film-image. In the third volume (published posthumously in Spanish in 2013) he takes on [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s writings and describes his own work on ''[[La Recta Provincia]]'' and ''[[Nucingen House]]''.

'''Problem analysis''' or the '''problem frames approach''' is an approach to software [[requirements analysis]]. It was developed by British software consultant [[Michael A. Jackson]] in the 1990s.

== History ==
The problem frames approach was first sketched by Jackson in his book ''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'' (1995) and in a number of articles in various journals devoted to software engineering.  It has received its fullest description in his ''Problem Frames: Analysing and Structuring Software Development Problems'' (2001).

A session on problem frames was part of the 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050126191532/http://www.sse.uni-essen.de/refsq/downloads/summary-refsq03.pdf 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~karlc/ProblemFramesWorkshop.htm First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames]&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE’04 held in Edinburgh, Scotland.  One outcome of that workshop was a 2005 special issue on problem frames in the ''International Journal of Information and Software Technology''.

The Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/jon_hall/Academic/IWAAPF06/index.html Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819174609/http://homepage.mac.com/jon_hall/Academic/IWAAPF06/index.html |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE 2006 in Shanghai, China. The Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames (IWAAPF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://icse08.upb.de/program/workshops.html Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames]&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE 2008 in Leipzig, Germany.  In 2010, the IWAAPF workshops were replaced by the International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation (IWAAPO).  IWAAPO broadens the focus of the workshops to include alternative and complementary approaches to software development that share an emphasis on problem analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaapo.org/ International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111084248/http://www.iwaapo.org/ |date=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IWAAPO-2010 was held as part of ICSE 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.co.za/ICSE2010/3-EVENTS/WORKSHOPS/W23.html IWAAPO-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today research on the problem frames approach is being conducted at a number of universities, most notably at the [[Open University]] in the United Kingdom  as part of its ''Relating Problem &amp; Solution Structures'' research theme&lt;ref&gt;[http://computing-research.open.ac.uk/read/index.php?page=topic&amp;group=RPSS&amp;theme=READ ''Relating Problem &amp; Solution Structures'' research theme]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: "Relating software requirements and architectures using problem frames" by Hall, J.G.; Jackson, M.; Laney, R.C.; Nuseibeh, B.; Rapanotti, L., in ''Proceedings of the IEEE Joint International Conference on Requirements Engineering'' (2002), pp. 137–144&lt;/ref&gt; Interesting work is being done by Professors Lavazza and del Bianco on using problem frames with UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaria.org/conferences2007/filesICSEA07/UMLreqs.pdf |title=Using problem frames with UML |author1=Lavazza, Luigi |author2=Del Bianco, Vieri }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas in the problem frames approach have been generalized into the concepts of [[problem-oriented development]] (POD) and problem-oriented engineering (POE), of which [[problem-oriented software engineering]] (POSE) is a particular sub-category.  The first [http://poc-workshop.eu International Workshop on Problem-Oriented Development] was held in June 2009.

== Overview ==

=== Fundamental philosophy ===
''Problem analysis'' or the ''problem frames approach'' is an approach — a set of concepts — to be used when gathering requirements and creating specifications for computer software. Its basic philosophy is strikingly different from other software requirements methods in insisting that:

* The best way to approach requirements analysis is through a process of parallel — not hierarchical — decomposition of user requirements.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
  |last=Jackson 
  |first=Michael   
  |title=Problem Decomposition for Reuse
  |year=1995  
  |pages=1, 2
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* User requirements are about relationships in the real world—the ''application domain'' – not about the software system or even the interface with the software system.

{{quote|
It is more helpful ... to recognize that the solution is located in the computer and
its software, and the problem is in the world outside.
... The computers can provide solutions to these problems because they
are connected to the world outside.

The moral is clear:
to study and analyse a problem you must focus on studying and analysing the problem world
in some depth,
and in your investigations you must be willing to
travel some distance away from the computer. ... ''[In a call forwarding problem...]'' You need to describe what's there – people and offices and holidays
and moving office and delegating responsibility – and what effects ''[in the problem world]''
you would like the system to achieve – 
calls to A's number must reach A, and 
''[when B is on vacation, and C is temporarily working at D's desk]'' 
calls to B's or C's number must reach C.

The approach uses three sets of conceptual tools.

=== Tools for describing specific problems ===

Concepts used for describing specific problems include: 
''phenomena'' (of various kinds, including ''events''), 
''problem context'', 
''problem domain'',
''solution domain'' (aka the ''machine''), 
''shared phenomena'' (which exist in ''domain interfaces''), 
''domain requirements'' (which exist in the problem domains) and 
''specifications'' (which exist at the problem domain:machine interface).

The graphical tools for describing problems are the ''context diagram'' and the 
''problem diagram''.

=== Tools for describing classes of problems (problem frames) ===

The Problem Frames Approach includes concepts for describing classes of problems.  A recognized class of problems is called a ''problem frame'' (roughly analogous to a '''design pattern''').

In a problem frame, domains are given general names and described in terms of their important characteristics. A domain, for example, may be classified as ''causal'' (reacts in a deterministic, predictable way to events) or ''biddable'' (can be bid, or asked, to respond to events, but cannot be expected always to react to events in any predictable, deterministic way).  (A biddable domain usually consists of people.)

The graphical tool for representing a problem frame is a ''frame diagram''.  A frame diagram looks generally like a problem diagram except for a few minor differences—domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.

=== A list of recognized classes of problems (problem frames) ===

The first group of problem frames identified by Jackson included:
# required behavior
# commanded behavior
# information display
# simple workpieces
# transformation

Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.

== Describing problems ==

=== The problem context ===
Problem analysis considers a software application to be a kind of software ''machine''. A software development project aims to change the problem context by creating a software machine and adding it to the problem context, where it will bring about certain desired effects.

The particular portion of the problem context that is of interest in connection with a particular problem — the particular portion of the problem context that forms the context of the problem — is called the ''application domain''.

After the software development project has been finished, and the software machine has been inserted into the problem context, the problem context will contain both the application domain and the machine. At that point, the situation will look like this:

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemContext1.svg|220px|center]]

The problem context contains the machine and the application domain. The ''machine interface'' is where the Machine and the application domain meet and interact.

The same situation can be shown in a different kind of diagram, a ''context diagram'', this way:

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemContext2.png|center|]]

=== The context diagram ===
The problem analyst's first task is to truly understand the problem.  That means understanding the context in which the problem is set.  And that means drawing a ''context diagram.''

Here is Jackson's description of examining the problem context, in this case the context for a bridge to be built:

: You're an engineer planning to build a bridge across a river. So you visit the site. Standing on one bank of the river, you look at the surrounding land, and at the river traffic. You feel how exposed the place is, and how hard the wind is blowing and how fast the river is running. You look at the bank and wonder what faults a geological survey will show up in the rocky terrain. You picture to yourself the bridge that you are going to build. (''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'': "The Problem Context")

An analyst trying to understand a software development problem must go through the same process as the bridge engineer. He starts by examining the various problem domains in the application domain. These domains form the context into which the planned Machine must fit. Then he imagines how the Machine will fit into this context. And then he constructs a context diagram showing his vision of the problem context with the Machine installed in it.

The context diagram shows the various ''problem domains'' in the application domain, their connections, and the Machine and its connections to (some of) the problem domains. Here is what a context diagram looks like.

[[Image:ProblemFramesContextDiagram1.svg|center|]]

This diagram shows:

* the ''machine'' to be built. The dark border helps to identify the box that represents the Machine.
* the ''problem domains'' that are relevant to the problem.
* the solid lines represent ''domain interfaces'' — areas where domains overlap and share phenomena in common.

A domain is simply a part of the world that we are interested in.  It consists of ''phenomena'' — individuals, events, states of affairs, relationships, and behaviors.

A domain interface is an area where domains connect and communicate.  Domain interfaces are not data flows or messages.  An interface is a place where domains partially overlap, so that the phenomena in the interface are ''shared phenomena'' — they exist in both of the overlapping domains.

You can imagine domains as being like primitive one-celled organisms (like amoebas).  They are able to extend parts of themselves into pseudopods. Imagine that two such organisms extend pseudopods toward each other in a sort of handshake, and that the cellular material in the area where they are shaking hands is mixing, so that it belongs to both of them.  That's an interface.

In the following diagram, X is the interface between domains A and B.  Individuals that exist or events that occur in X, exist or occur in both A and B.  
 
[[Image:ProblemFramesInterfaces.svg|center|]]

Shared individuals, states and events may look differently to the domains that share them.  Consider for example an interface between a computer and a keyboard. When the keyboard domain sees an event ''Keyboard operator presses the spacebar'' the computer will see the same event as ''Byte hex("20") appears in the input buffer.''

=== Problem diagrams ===
The problem analyst's basic tool for describing a problem is a ''problem diagram''. Here is a generic problem diagram.

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemDiagram1.svg|center|]]

In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows:

* a dotted oval representing the ''requirement'' to bring about certain effects in the problem domains.
* dotted lines representing ''requirement references'' — references in the requirement to phenomena in the problem domains.

An interface that connects a problem domain to the machine is called a ''specification interface'' and the phenomena in the specification interface are called ''specification phenomena''. The  goal of the requirements analyst is to develop a specification for the behavior that the Machine must exhibit at the Machine interface in order to satisfy the requirement.

Here is an example of a real, if simple, problem diagram.

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemDiagram2.png|center|]]

This problem might be part of a computer system in a hospital. In the hospital, patients are connected to sensors that can detect and measure their temperature and blood pressure. The requirement is to construct a Machine that can display information about patient conditions on a panel in the nurses station.

The name of the requirement is "Display ~ Patient Condition".  The tilde (~) indicates that the requirement is about a relationship or correspondence between the panel display and patient conditions. The arrowhead indicates that the requirement reference connected to the Panel Display domain is also a requirement constraint. That means that the requirement contains some kind of stipulation that the Panel display must meet. In short, the requirement is that ''The panel display must display information that matches and accurately reports the condition of the patients.''

== Describing classes of problems ==

=== Problem frames ===
A ''problem frame'' is a description of a recognizable class of problems, where the class of problems has a known solution.  In a sense, problem frames are problem patterns.

Each problem frame has its own ''frame diagram''.  A frame diagram looks essentially like a problem diagram, but instead of showing specific domains and requirements, it shows types of domains and types of requirements; domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.

=== Variant frames ===
In ''Problem Frames'' Jackson discussed variants of the five basic problem
frames that he had identified.  A variant typically adds a domain to the problem context.

* a ''description variant'' introduces a description lexical domain 
* an ''operator variant'' introduces an operator
* a ''connection variant'' introduces a connection domain between the machine and the central domain with which it interfaces
* a ''control variant'' introduces no new domain; it changes the control characteristics of interface phenomena

=== Problem concerns ===
Jackson also discusses certain kinds of concerns that arise when working with problem frames.

Particular concerns 
* overrun
* initialization
* reliability
* identities
* completeness

Composition concerns 
* commensurable descriptions  
* consistency  
* precedence  
* interference  
* synchronization

== Recognized problem frames ==

The first problem frames identified by Jackson included:
# required behavior
# commanded behavior
# information display
# simple workpieces
# transformation

Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.

=== Required-behavior problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled so that it satisfies certain conditions.  The problem is to build a machine that will impose that control.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesRequiredBehaviorFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Commanded-behavior problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled in accordance with commands issued by an operator.  The problem is to build a machine that will accept the operator's commands and impose the control accordingly.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesCommandedBehaviorFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Information display problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world about whose states and behavior certain information is continually needed.  The problem is to build a machine that will obtain this information from the world and present it at the required place in the required form.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesInformationDisplayFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Simple workpieces problem frame ===

The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''A tool is needed to allow a user to create and edit a certain class of computer-processible text or graphic objects, or similar structures, so that they can be subsequently copied, printed, analyzed or used in other ways.  The problem is to build a machine that can act as this tool.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesSimpleWorkpiecesFrame.svg|center|]]

=== Transformation problem frame ===

The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There are some given computer-readable input files whose data must be transformed to give certain required output files.  The output data must be in a particular format, and it must be derived from the input data according to certain rules.  The problem is to build a machine that will produce the required outputs from the inputs.''
[[Image:ProblemFramesTransformationFrame.svg|center|]]

== Problem analysis and the software development process ==
When problem analysis is incorporated into the [[software development process]], the software development lifecycle starts with the problem analyst, who studies the situation and:
* creates a context diagram
* gathers a list of requirements and adds a requirements oval to the context diagram, creating a grand "all-in-one" problem diagram.  (However, in many cases actually creating an all-in-one problem diagram may be impractical or unhelpful: there will be too many requirements references criss-crossing the diagram to make it very useful.)
* decomposes the all-in-one problem and problem diagram into simpler problems and simpler problem diagrams.  These problems are ''projections'', not subsets, of the all-in-one diagram.
* continues to decompose problems until each problem is simple enough that it can be seen to be an instance of a recognized problem frame.  Each subproblem description includes a description of the specification interfaces for the machine to be built.

At this point, problem analysis — ''problem decomposition'' — is complete.  The next step is to reverse the process and to build the desired software system though a process of ''solution composition''.

The solution composition process is not yet well understood, and is still very much a research topic. Extrapolating from hints in ''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'', we can guess that the software development process would continue with the developers, who would:

* compose the multiple subproblem machine specifications into the specification for a single all-in-one machine: a specification for a software machine that satisfies all of the customer's requirements.  This is a non-trivial activity — the composition process may very well raise ''composition problems'' that need to be solved.
* implement the all-in-one machine by going through the traditional code/test/deploy process.

== Similar approaches ==
There are a few other software development ideas that are similar in some ways to problem analysis.

* The notion of a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] is similar to Jackson's notion of a problem frame.  It differs in that a design pattern is used for recognizing and handling design issues (often design issues in specific object-oriented programming languages such as C++ or Java) rather than for recognizing and handling requirements issues. Furthermore, one difference is that design patterns cover ''solutions'' while in problem frames ''problems'' are represented. However, the design patterns also tend to account for semantic outcomes that are not native to the programming language they are to be implemented in.  So, another difference is that problem frames is a native meta-notation for the domain of problems, whereas design patterns are a catalogue of technical debt left behind by the language implementers.
* ''Aspect-oriented programming'', AOP (also known as [[aspect-oriented software development]], AOSD) is similarly interested in parallel decomposition, which addresses what AOP proponents call ''cross-cutting concerns'' or ''aspects''. AOP addresses concerns that are much closer to the design and code-generation phase than to the requirements analysis phase. 
* AOP has moved into requirement engineering notations such as ITU-T Z.151 User Requirements Notation (URN).  In URN the AOP is over the all the intentional elements. AOP can also be applied over requirement modelling that uses problem frames as a heuristic.  URN models driven with problem frame thinking, and interleaved with aspects, allows for inclusion of architectural tactics into the requirement model.
* Martin Fowler's book '''Analysis Patterns''' is very similar to problem analysis in its search for patterns.  It doesn't really present a new requirements analysis method, however.  And the notion of parallel decomposition — which is so important for problem analysis — is not a part of Fowler's analysis patterns.
* Jon G. Hall, Lucia Rapanotti, together with Jackson, have developed the Problem Oriented Software Engineering (POSE) framework&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Hall, L. Rapanotti, and M. Jackson. Problem-oriented software engineering: solving the package router control problem. IEEE Trans. Software Eng., 2008. {{doi|10.1109/TSE.2007.70769}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which shares the problem frames foundations. Since, 2005, Hall and Rapanotti have extended POSE to Problem Oriented Engineering (POE), which provides a framework for engineering design, including a development process model and assurance-driven design,&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Hall and L. Rapanotti. Assurance-driven design. In Proceedings of the third International Conference on Software Engineering Advances. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and may be scalable to projects that include many stake-holders and that combine diverse engineering disciplines such as software and education provision.&lt;ref&gt;L. Rapanotti and J. G. Hall. Designing an online part-time master of philosophy. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services. IEEE Press, May 24–28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychophysics'''  quantitatively investigates the relationship between physical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and the [[sensation (psychology)|sensations]] and [[perception]]s they produce. Psychophysics has been described as "the scientific study of the relation between stimulus and sensation"&lt;ref name=GescheiderpIX&gt;{{Cite book |author=Gescheider G |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals |journal=Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=181–8 | edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-8058-2281-6 |pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more completely, as "the analysis of perceptual processes by studying the effect on a subject's experience or behaviour of systematically varying the properties of a stimulus along one or more physical dimensions".&lt;ref name=Bruce1996&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Bruce V, Green PR, Georgeson MA |year=1996 |title=Visual perception | edition=3rd |publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psychophysics'' also refers to a general class of methods that can be applied to study a [[perceptual system]]. Modern applications rely heavily on threshold measurement,&lt;ref name=Boff_Kaufman_Thomas&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Boff KR|editor2=Kaufman L|editor3=Thomas JP|title=Handbook of perception and human performance: Vol. I. Sensory processes and perception|place=New York|publisher=John Wiley|pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ideal observer analysis]], and [[Detection theory|signal detection theory]].&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap5&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider G |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals | edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | chapter=Chapter 5: The Theory of Signal Detection |isbn=978-0-8058-2281-6 |pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychophysics has widespread and important practical applications. For example, in the study of [[digital signal processing]], psychophysics has informed the development of models and methods of [[lossy compression]]. These models explain why humans perceive very little loss of signal quality when audio and video signals are formatted using lossy compression.

==History==
Many of the classical techniques and theories of psychophysics were formulated in 1860 when [[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in Leipzig published ''Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics)''.&lt;ref name="Fechner"&gt;{{cite book | author=Gustav Theodor Fechner | year=1860 | title=Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He coined the term "psychophysics", describing research intended to relate physical stimuli to the contents of consciousness such as sensations ''(Empfindungen)''.  As a physicist and philosopher, Fechner aimed at developing a method that relates matter to the mind, connecting the publicly observable world and a person's privately experienced impression of it.  His ideas were inspired by experimental results on the sense of touch and light obtained in the early 1830s by the German physiologist [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] in Leipzig,&lt;ref name="Snodgrass"&gt;Snodgrass JG. 1975. Psychophysics. In: ''Experimental Sensory Psychology''. B Scharf. (Ed.) pp. 17–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GescheiderChap1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider G |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals | edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | chapter=Chapter 1: Psychophysical Measurement of Thresholds: Differential Sensitivity |isbn=978-0-8058-2281-6 |pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably those on the minimum discernible difference in intensity of stimuli of moderate strength (just noticeable difference; jnd) which Weber had shown to be a constant fraction of the reference intensity, and which Fechner referred to as Weber's law. From this, Fechner derived his well-known logarithmic scale, now known as Fechner scale. Weber's and Fechner's work formed one of the bases of psychology as a [[science]], with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founding the first laboratory for psychological research in Leipzig (Institut für experimentelle Psychologie). Fechner's work systematised the introspectionist approach (psychology as the science of consciousness), that had to contend with the Behaviorist approach in which even verbal responses are as physical as the stimuli.  During the 1930s, when psychological research in [[Nazi Germany]] essentially came to a halt, both approaches eventually began to be replaced by use of [[stimulus-response]] relationships as evidence for conscious or unconscious processing in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent DE. 1964. Behaviour; Neisser U. 1970. Cognitive psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Fechner's work was studied and extended by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]], who was aided by his student [[Joseph Jastrow]], who soon became a distinguished experimental psychologist in his own right. Peirce and Jastrow largely confirmed Fechner's empirical findings, but not all. In particular, a classic experiment of Peirce and Jastrow rejected Fechner's estimation of a threshold of perception of weights, as being far too high. In their experiment, Peirce and Jastrow in fact invented randomized experiments: They randomly assigned volunteers to a [[Blind experiment|blinded]], [[repeated measures design|repeated-measures design]] to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights.&lt;ref name="smalldiff"&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Joseph Jastrow]]|year=1885|title=On Small Differences in Sensation|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm| journal=Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=3|pages=73–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telepathy"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/354775|first=Ian |last=Hacking|  authorlink=Ian Hacking | title=Telepathy: Origins of Randomization in Experimental Design|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|issue=3, "A Special Issue on Artifact and Experiment"|volume=79|date=September 1988 |pages=427–451|jstor=234674 | mr = 1013489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stigler"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/444032|author=[[Stephen M.

The Peirce–Jastrow experiments were conducted as part of Peirce's application of his [[pragmaticism]] program to [[human perception]]; other studies considered the perception of light, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Joseph Jastrow]]|title=Charles S. Peirce as a Teacher|journal=The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods|date=21 December 1916|volume=13|issue=26|pages=723–726|doi=10.2307/2012322|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rWzhSTaKgwYC|jstor=2012322}}and [http://www.google.com/search?q=Peirce+Jastrow+%22to+record+an+impression%22 text-string search]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jastrow wrote the following summary: "Mr. Peirce’s courses in logic gave me my first real experience of intellectual muscle. Though I promptly took to the laboratory of psychology when that was established by [[G. Stanley Hall|Stanley Hall]], it was Peirce who gave me my first training in the handling of a psychological problem, and at the same time stimulated my self-esteem by entrusting me, then fairly innocent of any laboratory habits, with a real bit of research. He borrowed the apparatus for me, which I took to my room, installed at my window, and with which, when conditions of illumination were right, I took the observations. The results were published over our joint names in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences''. The demonstration that traces of sensory effect too slight to make any registry in consciousness could none the less influence judgment, may itself have been a persistent motive that induced me years later to undertake a book on ''The Subconscious''."  This work clearly distinguishes observable cognitive performance from the expression of consciousness.

Modern approaches to sensory perception, such as research on vision, hearing, or touch, measure what the perceiver's judgment extracts from the stimulus, often putting aside the question what sensations are being experienced. One leading method is based on [[Detection theory|signal detection theory]], developed for cases of very weak stimuli.  However, the subjectivist approach persists among those in the tradition of [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1906&amp;ndash;1973). Stevens revived the idea of a [[power law]] suggested by 19th century researchers, in contrast with Fechner's log-linear function (cf. [[Stevens' power law]]). He also advocated the assignment of numbers in ratio to the strengths of stimuli, called magnitude estimation. Stevens added techniques such as magnitude production and cross-modality matching.  He opposed the assignment of stimulus strengths to points on a line that are labeled in
order of strength.  Nevertheless, that sort of response has remained popular in applied psychophysics.  Such multiple-category layouts are often misnamed [[Likert scale|Likert scaling]] after the question items used by Likert to create multi-item psychometric scales, e.g., seven phrases from "strongly agree" through "strongly disagree".

Omar Khaleefa&lt;ref name=Khaleefa&gt;{{cite journal |author=Omar Khaleefa |year=1999 |title=Who Is the Founder of Psychophysics and Experimental Psychology? |journal=American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences |volume=16 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that the medieval scientist [[Alhazen]] should be considered the founder of psychophysics. Although al-Haytham made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and such claims have been rebuffed.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aaen-Stockdale, C.R. |year=2008 |title=Ibn al-Haytham and psychophysics |journal=Perception |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=636–638 |doi=10.1068/p5940 |pmid=18546671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thresholds==
Psychophysicists usually employ experimental stimuli that can be objectively measured, such as pure tones varying in intensity, or lights varying in luminance. All the [[sense]]s have been studied: [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[Somatosensory system|touch]] (including [[skin]] and [[Barostat|enteric perception]]), [[taste]], [[Olfaction|smell]] and the [[sense of time]]. Regardless of the sensory domain, there are three main areas of investigation: absolute thresholds, discrimination thresholds and scaling.

A threshold (or limen) is the point of intensity at which the participant can just detect the presence of a stimulus (absolute threshold&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap2&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider G |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals | edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | chapter=Chapter 2: Psychophysical Measurement of Thresholds: Absolute Sensitivity |isbn=978-0-8058-2281-6 |pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or the presence of a difference between two stimuli (difference threshold&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap1/&gt;). Stimuli with intensities below the threshold are considered not detectable (hence: sub-liminal). Stimuli at values close enough to a threshold will often be detectable some proportion of occasions; therefore, a threshold is considered to be the point at which a stimulus, or change in a stimulus, is detected some proportion '' p'' of occasions.

===Detection===
An absolute threshold is the level of intensity of a stimulus at which the subject is able to detect the presence of the stimulus some proportion of the time (a ''p'' level of 50% is often used).&lt;ref&gt;John Krantz. [http://www.saylor.org/content/krantz_sensation/Experiencing_Sensation_and_Perception.pdf "Experiencing Sensation and Perception"]. pp. 2.3–2.4. Retrieved May 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an absolute threshold is the number of hairs on the back of one's hand that must be touched before it can be felt – a participant may be unable to feel a single hair being touched, but may be able to feel two or three as this exceeds the threshold. Absolute threshold is also often referred to as ''detection threshold.'' Several different methods are used for measuring absolute thresholds (as with discrimination thresholds; see below).

===Discrimination===
A difference threshold (or [[just-noticeable difference]], JND) is the magnitude of the smallest difference between two stimuli of differing intensities that the participant is able to detect some proportion of the time (the percentage depending on the kind of task). To test this threshold, several different methods are used. The subject may be asked to adjust one stimulus until it is perceived as the same as the other (method of adjustment), may be asked to describe the direction and magnitude of the difference between two stimuli, or may be asked to decide whether intensities in a pair of stimuli are the same or not (forced choice). The just-noticeable difference (JND) is not a fixed quantity; rather, it depends on how intense the stimuli being measured are and the particular sense being measured.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L.; Gilbert, Daniel t.; Wegner, Daniel M. (2010). Psychology (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's Law]] states that the just-noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion despite variation in intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Theodor Fechner (1860). Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of Psychophysics), Kap. IX: Das Weber’sche Gesetz.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discrimination experiments, the experimenter seeks to determine at what point the difference between two stimuli, such as two weights or two sounds, is detectable. The subject is presented with one stimulus, for example a weight, and is asked to say whether another weight is heavier or lighter (in some experiments, the subject may also say the two weights are the same). At the point of subjective equality (PSE), the subject perceives the two weights to be the same. The just-noticeable difference,&lt;ref&gt;''Psychology: the Science of Behaviour''. 4th ED. Neil R. Carlson, C. Donald Heth&lt;/ref&gt; or difference limen (DL), is the magnitude of the difference in stimuli that the subject notices some proportion ''p'' of the time (50% is usually used for ''p'' in the comparison task). In addition, a [[two-alternative forced choice]] (2-afc) paradigm can be used to assess the point at which performance reduces to chance on a discrimination between two alternatives (''p'' will then typically be 75% since ''p''=50% corresponds to chance in the 2-afc task).

Absolute and difference thresholds are sometimes considered similar  in principle because there is always background noise interfering with our ability to detect stimuli.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass/&gt;&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap4&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider G |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals | edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | chapter=Chapter 4: Classical Psychophysical Theory |isbn=978-0-8058-2281-6 |pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimentation==
In psychophysics, experiments seek to determine whether the subject can detect a stimulus, identify it, differentiate between it and another stimulus, or describe the magnitude or nature of this difference.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass/&gt;&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap1/&gt; Software for psychophysical experimentation is overviewed by Strasburger.&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger H (1995–2014). Software for visual psychophysics: an overview. [http://www.visionscience.com/documents/strasburger/strasburger.html VisionScience.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical psychophysical methods===
Psychophysical experiments have traditionally used three methods for testing subjects' perception in stimulus detection and difference detection experiments: the method of limits, the method of constant stimuli and the method of adjustment.&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap3&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider G |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals | edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | chapter=Chapter 3: The Classical Psychophysical Methods |isbn=978-0-8058-2281-6 |pmid=9402648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Method of limits====
In the ascending method of limits, some property of the stimulus starts out at a level so low that the stimulus could not be detected, then this level is gradually increased until the participant reports that they are aware of it. For example, if the experiment is testing the minimum amplitude of sound that can be detected, the sound begins too quietly to be perceived, and is made gradually louder. In the descending method of limits, this is reversed. In each case, the threshold is considered to be the level of the stimulus property at which the stimuli are just detected.&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap3/&gt;

In experiments, the ascending and descending methods are used alternately and the thresholds are averaged. A possible disadvantage of these methods is that the subject may become accustomed to reporting that they perceive a stimulus and may continue reporting the same way even beyond the threshold (the error of [[habituation]]). Conversely, the subject may also anticipate that the stimulus is about to become detectable or undetectable and may make a premature judgment (the error of anticipation).

To avoid these potential pitfalls, [[Georg von Békésy]] introduced the [[Psychophysics#Staircase procedures|staircase procedure]] in 1960 in his study of auditory perception. In this method, the sound starts out audible and gets quieter after each of the subject's responses, until the subject does not report hearing it. At that point, the sound is made louder at each step, until the subject reports hearing it, at which point it is made quieter in steps again. This way the experimenter is able to "zero in" on the threshold.&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap3/&gt;

====Method of constant stimuli====
Instead of being presented in ascending or descending order, in the method of constant stimuli the levels of a certain property of the stimulus are not related from one trial to the next, but presented randomly. This prevents the subject from being able to predict the level of the next stimulus, and therefore reduces errors of habituation and expectation. For 'absolute thresholds' again the subject reports whether he or she is able to detect the stimulus.&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap3/&gt; For 'difference thresholds' there has to be a constant comparison stimulus with each of the varied levels.
Friedrich Hegelmaier described the method of constant stimuli in an 1852 paper.&lt;ref name=LamingLaming1992&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method allows for full sampling of the [[psychometric function]], but can result in a lot of trials when several conditions are interleaved.

====Method of adjustment====
The method of adjustment asks the subject to control the level of the stimulus, instructs them to alter it until it is just barely detectable against the background noise, or is the same as the level of another stimulus. This is repeated many times. This is also called the method of average error.&lt;ref name=GescheiderChap3/&gt;
In this method the observer himself controls the magnitude of the variable stimulus beginning with a variable that is distinctly greater or lesser than a standard one and he varies it until he is satisfied by the subjectivity of two. The difference between the variable stimuli and the standard one is recorded after each adjustment and the error is tabulated for a considerable series. At the end mean is calculated giving the average error which can be taken as the measure of sensitivity.

===Adaptive psychophysical methods===
The classic methods of experimentation are often argued to be inefficient. This is because, in advance of testing, the psychometric threshold is usually unknown and much data is collected at points on the [[psychometric function]] that provide little information about the parameter of interest, usually the threshold. Adaptive staircase procedures (or the classical method of adjustment) can be used such that the points sampled are clustered around the psychometric threshold. However, the cost of this efficiency is that there is less information regarding the psychometric function's shape. Adaptive methods can be optimized for estimating the threshold only, or threshold ''and'' slope. Adaptive methods are classified into staircase procedures (see below) and Bayesian or maximum-likelihood methods. Staircase methods rely on the previous response only and are easier to implement. Bayesian methods take the whole set of previous stimulus-response pairs into account and are believed to be more robust against lapses in attention.&lt;ref name="Treutwein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treutwein|first1=Bernhard|title=Adaptive psychophysical procedures|journal=Vision Research|date=September 1995|volume=35|issue=17|pages=2503–2522|doi=10.1016/0042-6989(95)00016-X|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004269899500016X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Staircase procedures====
[[File:Staircase Transformed Up Down English.png|thumb|Diagram showing a specific staircase procedure: Transformed Up/Down Method (1 up/ 2 down rule). Until the first reversal (which is neglected) the simple up/down rule and a larger step size is used.]]

Staircases usually begin with a high intensity stimulus, which is easy to detect. The intensity is then reduced until the observer makes a mistake, at which point the staircase 'reverses' and intensity is increased until the observer responds correctly, triggering another reversal. The values for the last of these 'reversals' are then averaged. There are many different types of staircase procedures, using different decision and termination rules. Step-size, up/down rules and the spread of the underlying psychometric function dictate where on the psychometric function they converge.&lt;ref name="Treutwein" /&gt; Threshold values obtained from staircases can fluctuate wildly, so care must be taken in their design. Many different staircase algorithms have been modeled and some practical recommendations suggested by Garcia-Perez.&lt;ref name=GarciaPerez&gt;{{cite journal |title=Forced-choice staircases with fixed step sizes: asymptotic and small-sample properties |author=Garcia-Perez, MA |journal=Vision Res |year=1998 |volume=38 |pages=1861–81 |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(97)00340-4 |pmid=9797963 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more common staircase designs (with fixed-step sizes) is the 1-up-N-down staircase. If the participant makes the correct response N times in a row, the stimulus intensity is reduced by one step size. If the participant makes an incorrect response the stimulus intensity is increased by the one size. A threshold is estimated from the mean midpoint of all runs. This estimate approaches, asymptotically, the correct threshold.

====Bayesian and maximum-likelihood procedures====

Bayesian and maximum-likelihood adaptive procedures behave, from the observer's perspective, similar to the staircase procedures. The choice of the next intensity level works differently, however: After each observer response, from the set of this and all previous stimulus/response pairs the likelihood is calculated of where the threshold lies. The point of maximum likelihood is then chosen as the best estimate for the threshold, and the next stimulus is presented at that level (since a decision at that level will add the most information). In a Bayesian procedure, a prior likelihood is further included in the calculation.&lt;ref name="Treutwein" /&gt; Compared to staircase procedures, Bayesian and ML procedures are more time-consuming to implement but are considered to be more robust. Well-known procedures of this kind are Quest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Andrew B.|last2=Pelli|first2=Denis G.|title=Quest: A Bayesian adaptive psychometric method|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=March 1983|volume=33|issue=2|pages=113–120|doi=10.3758/BF03202828}}&lt;/ref&gt; ML-PEST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Lewis O.|title=Efficient estimation of sensory thresholds|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers|date=November 1986|volume=18|issue=6|pages=623–632|doi=10.3758/BF03201438}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kontsevich &amp; Tyler’s method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kontsevich|first1=Leonid L.|last2=Tyler|first2=Christopher W.|title=Bayesian adaptive estimation of psychometric slope and threshold|journal=Vision Research|date=August 1999|volume=39|issue=16|pages=2729–2737|doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00285-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnitude estimation====
In the prototypical case, people are asked to assign numbers in proportion to the magnitude of the stimulus. This psychometric function of the geometric means of their numbers is often a [[Stevens' power law|power law]] with stable, replicable exponent. Although contexts can change the law &amp; exponent, that change too is stable and replicable. Instead of numbers, other sensory or cognitive dimensions can be used to match a stimulus and the method then becomes "magnitude production" or "cross-modality matching". The exponents of those dimensions found in numerical magnitude estimation predict the exponents found in magnitude production. Magnitude estimation generally finds lower exponents for the psychophysical function than multiple-category responses, because of the restricted range of the categorical anchors, such as those used by [[Rensis Likert|Likert]] as items in attitude scales.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=S.

A '''racetrack problem''' is a specific instance of a type of [[race condition]]. A racetrack problem is a flaw in a system or process whereby the output and/or result of the process is unexpectedly and critically dependent on the sequence or timing of other events that run in a circular pattern. Note that this problem is semantically different from a race condition because of the circular nature of the problem.

The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other in a circular motion to influence the output first.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Racetrack problems can occur in electronics systems, especially logic circuits, and in computer software, especially multithreaded or distributed programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">'''Redux ''' is the generic name of a family of [[phenol]]&amp;ndash;[[formaldehyde]]/[[polyvinyl]]&amp;ndash;formal [[adhesives]] developed by [[Aero Research Limited]] (ARL) at [[Duxford]], UK, in the 1940s, subsequently produced by [[Ciba-Geigy|Ciba (ARL)]]. The brand name is now also used for a range of [[epoxy]] and bismaleimide adhesives manufactured by [[Hexcel]]. The name is a contraction of '''''RE'''search at '''DUX'''ford''.

==History==
Devised at ARL by Dr. [[Norman de Bruyne]] and George Newell in 1941 for use in the aircraft industry, the adhesive is used for the [[chemical bonding|bonding]] of metal-to-metal and metal-to-wood structures. The adhesive system comprises a liquid phenolic resin and a PVF (PolyVinylFormal) thermoplastic powder.

The first formulation available was '''Redux Liquid E/Formvar''', comprising a phenolic liquid ('''Redux Liquid E''') and a PVF powder ('''[[Formvar]]'''), and after its initial non-aviation related application of bonding [[clutch]] plates on [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] and [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] [[tanks]], it was used by [[de Havilland]] from [[1943 in aviation|1943]] to the early 1960s, on, among other aircraft, the [[de Havilland Hornet|Hornet]], the [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]] and the derived [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]], and the [[de Havilland Dove|Dove]], [[de Havilland Heron|Heron]] and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident]]. It was also used by [[Vickers Armstrong|Vickers]] on the [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Viking]] and by [[Vought|Chance Vought]] on the [[F7U Cutlass]].

Typically, Redux would be used to affix stiffening [[Longeron|stringer]]s and doublers to [[wing]] and [[fuselage]] panels, the resulting panel being both stronger and lighter than a [[rivet]]ed structure. In the case of the Hornet it was used to join the [[aluminium]] lower-wing skin to the wooden upper wing structure, and in the fabrication of the aluminium/wood main wing [[Spar (aviation)|spar]], both forms of [[Composite material|composite]] construction made possible by the advent of Redux.

After initially supplying de Havilland only, ARL subsequently produced a refined form of ''Redux Liquid E/Formvar'' using a new liquid component known as '''Redux Liquid K6''', and a finer-grade (smaller [[Granular material|particle]]-size) PVF powder, and this was later made generally available to the wider aircraft industry as '''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775''', so-named because it was sold for aircraft use to specification DTD 775&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Available for general non-[[aerospace]] use it was called '''Redux Liquid K6/Powder C'''.

''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775'' was joined in [[1954 in aviation|1954]] by the subsequent '''Redux Film 775''' system, used from [[1962 in aviation|1962]] by de Havilland (later [[Hawker Siddeley]] and subsequently [[British Aerospace]]) on the [[British Aerospace BAe 125|DH.125]] and [[BAe 146|DH.146]]. Other users included [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] (on the [[Bristol Britannia|Britannia]]), [[Saab Group|SAAB]] (on the [[Saab Lansen|Lansen]] &amp; [[Saab Draken|Draken]]), [[Fokker]] (on the [[Fokker F27|F.27]]), [[Sud Aviation]] (on the [[Aérospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II/III]]), [[Société Anonyme des Ateliers d'Aviation Louis Breguet|Breguet]] and [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild]], the film-form having the advantage of greater gap-filling ability with no loss of strength over ''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775'', allowing for wider tolerances in component-fit, as well as easier handling and use and controlled ratios of the liquid/powder components.   
Other Redux adhesives available included "Redux 64", a solution of the phenolic liquid and PVF powder, used worldwide for bonding linings to brake shoes, pads and clutches.
The Redux range was subsequently expanded to include the current range of adhesives, both in single and two part paste systems and film forms, for both aerospace and industrial uses.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; DTD = ''Directorate of Technical Development''

==Usage==

To use Redux in its liquid/powder form, a thin film of the phenolic liquid is applied to both mating surfaces and then dusted with or dipped in the PVF powder to give an approximate ratio by weight of 1 part liquid to 2 parts powder. The coated joints are then allowed to stand for not less than 30 minutes and not more than 72 hours before the components are brought together under elevated pressure and temperature. The [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] process is by [[condensation]] and a typical figure for ''Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775'' is 30 minutes at 145&amp;nbsp;°C (293&amp;nbsp;°F) under a pressure of 100 [[Pound-force per square inch|lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (690 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). This is not critical and variations in curing-time and/or temperature may be used to increase [[Shear strength|shear]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] strength at temperatures above 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F). Extending the curing cycle gives benefits in [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] strength at some cost in the room-temperature peel strength, the practical limit for [[aluminium alloy]]s being approx 170&amp;nbsp;°C (338&amp;nbsp;°F) for one hour, due to the possibility of affecting the alloy's mechanical properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''Russian Archaeological Institute of Constantinople''' ({{lang-ru|Русский археологический институт в Константинополе}}) was founded in 1895 and led by two distinguished Russian Byzantinists, [[Fyodor Uspensky]] and [[Nikodim Kondakov]]. The institute carried out excavations and studies across the entire [[Ottoman Empire]], carrying off large numbers of relics, manuscripts and other finds to Russia. Aside from its research role, the institute was from the outset intended as a statement of foreign policy, following the [[Russian Empire]]'s claim to be the inheritor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] as the "[[Third Rome]]", and its long-standing ambition to conquer [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] from the Ottoman Empire. The institute continued to function until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10175">Many types of '''sense loss''' occur due to a dysfunctional sensation process, whether it be ineffective [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], [[nerve damage]], or cerebral impairment. Unlike [[agnosia]], these impairments are due to damages prior to the [[perception]] process.

==Vision loss==
{{Main|Vision loss}}

Degrees of vision loss vary dramatically, although the [[ICD-9]] released in 1979 categorized them into three tiers: [[normal vision]], [[low vision]], and [[blindness]].  Two significant causes of vision loss due to sensory failures include media opacity and [[optic nerve]] diseases, although [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[retinal disease]] can also lead to blindness.  Most causes of vision loss can cause varying degrees of damage, from total blindness to a negligible effect. Media opacity occurs in the presence of [[opacity (optics)|opacities]] in the eye tissues or fluid, distorting and/or blocking the [[image]] prior to contact with the [[photoreceptor cells]].  Vision loss often results despite correctly functioning retinal receptors. Optic nerve diseases such as [[optic neuritis]] or [[retrobulbar neuritis]] lead to dysfunction in the afferent nerve pathway once the signal has been correctly transmitted from retinal photoreceptors.

Partial or total vision loss may affect every single area of a person's life. Though loss of eyesight may occur naturally as we age, trauma to the eye or exposure to hazardous conditions may also cause this serious condition. Workers in virtually any field may be at risk of sustaining eye injuries through trauma or exposure. A traumatic eye injury occurs when the eye itself sustains some form of trauma, whether a [[penetrating injury]] such as a laceration or a non-penetrating injury such as an impact. Because the eye is a delicate and complex organ, even a slight injury may have a temporary or permanent effect on eyesight.

==Hearing loss==
{{Main|Hearing loss}}
Similarly to vision loss, [[hearing loss]] can vary from full or partial inability to detect some or all [[frequency|frequencies]] of sound which can typically be heard by members of their [[species]].  For [[humans]], this range is approximately 20 [[hertz|Hz]] to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz at ~6.5 [[decibel|dB]], although a 10&amp;nbsp;dB correction is often allowed for the [[elderly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Phonological features, auditory objects, and illusions | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 60–89 | doi = 10.1016/j.wocn.2009.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary causes of hearing loss due to an impaired sensory system include long-term exposure to [[environmental noise]], which can damage the [[mechanoreceptors]] responsible for receiving [[sound|sound vibrations]], as well as multiple diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[meningitis]], which damage the [[cochlea]] and [[auditory nerve]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bizley | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Walker | first2 = K. M. M. | year = 2010 | title = Sensitivity and Selectivity of Neurons in Auditory Cortex to the Pitch, Timbre, and Location of Sounds | url = | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 453–469 | doi = 10.1177/1073858410371009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss may be gradual or sudden. Hearing loss may be very mild, resulting in minor difficulties with conversation, or as severe as complete deafness. The speed with which hearing loss occurs may give clues as to the cause. If hearing loss is sudden, it may be from [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or a problem with [[blood circulation]]. A gradual onset is suggestive of other causes such as [[aging]] or a [[tumor]]. If you also have other associated neurological problems, such as [[tinnitus]] or [[vertigo]], it may indicate a problem with the nerves in the ear or brain. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral hearing loss is most often associated with conductive causes, trauma, and acoustic neuromas. Pain in the ear is associated with ear infections, trauma, and obstruction in the canal.

==Anosmia==
{{Main|Anosmia}}
Anosmia  is the inability to perceive [[odor]], or in other words a lack of functioning [[olfaction]]. Many patients may experience unilateral or bilateral anosmia.

A temporary loss of smell can be caused by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell. The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as congenital anosmia.

The diagnosis of anosmia as well as the degree of impairment can now be tested much more efficiently and effectively than ever before thanks to "smell testing kits" that have been made available as well as screening tests which use materials that most clinics would readily have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig JC |title=Grating orientation as a measure of tactile spatial acuity |journal=[[Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–206 |year=1999 |pmid=10527368 |doi= 10.1080/08990229970456|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cases of congenital anosmia remain unreported and undiagnosed. Since the disorder is present from birth the individual may have little or no understanding of the sense of smell, hence are unaware of the deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08990220310001622997 |title=Decline of tactile acuity in aging: a study of body site, blood flow, and lifetime habits of smoking and physical activity, Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research, Informa Healthcare |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somatosensory loss==
The [[somatosensory system]] is a complex sensory system made up of a number of different receptors, including thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. It also comprises essential processing centres, or sensory modalities, such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception. The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.

While touch (also called tactile or tactual perception) is considered one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with "somatic senses" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.

Insensitivity to [[somatosensory]] stimuli, such as [[heat]], [[cold]], [[touch]], and [[pain]], are most commonly a result of a more general physical impairment associated with [[paralysis]]. Damage to the [[spinal cord]] or other major [[nerve fiber]] may lead to a termination of both [[afferent nerve|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve|efferent]] signals to varying areas of the body, causing both a loss of touch and a loss of [[motor coordination]]. Other types of somatosensory loss include [[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]], which consists of ineffective afferent neurons with fully functioning efferent neurons; essentially, motor movement without somatosensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | year = 1976 | title = Acute Central Cord Syndrome Injury Mechanisms and Stress Features | doi = 10.1097/brs.0b013e3181c94cb8 | journal = Spine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = E955–E964 | pmid=20543769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing. In most cases it often leads to issues with touch. Sometimes people cannot feel touch at all while other times a light finger tap feels like someone has punched them. There are medications and therapies{{such as?}} that can help control the symptoms of sensory loss and deprivation.

==Ageusia==
{{main|Ageusia}}

Ageusia is the loss of taste, particularly the inability to detect [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]], [[saltiness]], and [[umami]] (meaning "pleasant/savory taste"). It is sometimes confused with anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell). Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True ageusia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia (a partial loss of taste) and dysgeusia (a distortion or alteration of taste).

Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the [[lingual nerve]] and the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]. The lingual nerve passes taste for the front two-thirds of the tongue and the glossopharyngeal nerve passes taste for the back third of the tongue. The lingual nerve can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.

Taste loss can vary from true [[ageusia]], a complete loss of taste, to [[hypogeusia]], a partial loss of taste, to [[dysgeusia]], a distortion or alteration of taste.  The primary cause of ageusia involves damage to the [[lingual nerve]], which receives the stimuli from [[taste buds]] for the front two-thirds of the [[tongue]], or the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], which acts similarly for the back third. Damage may be due to neurological disorders, such as [[Bell’s palsy]] or [[multiple sclerosis]], as well as [[infectious diseases]] such as meningoencephalopathy.  Other causes include a [[vitamin B]] deficiency, as well as taste bud death due to acidic/spicy foods, [[radiation]], and/or [[tobacco]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macaluso | first1 = E. | year = 2010 | title = Orienting of spatial attention and the interplay between the senses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">The concept of '''smart environments''' evolves from the definition of [[ubiquitous computing]] that, according to [[Mark Weiser]], promotes the ideas of "a physical world that is richly and invisibly interwoven with sensors, actuators, displays, and computational elements, embedded seamlessly in the everyday objects of our lives, and connected through a continuous network."&lt;ref name="Weiser-99"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Smart environments are envisioned as the byproduct of [[pervasive computing]] and the availability of cheap computing power, making human interaction with the system a pleasant experience.

==Definition==
Cook and Das&lt;ref name="Cook-Sajal"&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Cook

&lt;/ref&gt; define smart environment as "a small world where different kinds of [[smart device]] are continuously working to make inhabitants' lives more comfortable." Smart environments aim to satisfy the experience of individuals from every environment, by replacing the hazardous work, physical labor, and repetitive tasks with automated agents.

&lt;/ref&gt;
differentiates three different kinds of smart environments for systems, services and devices: virtual (or distributed) computing environments, physical environments and human environments, or a hybrid combination of these:
* ''Virtual computing environments'' enable smart devices to access pertinent services anywhere and anytime.
* ''Physical environments'' may be embedded with a variety of smart devices of different types including tags, sensors and controllers and have different form factors ranging from nano- to micro- to macro-sized.
* ''Human environments'': humans, either individually or collectively, inherently form a smart environment for devices. However, humans may themselves be accompanied by smart devices such as mobile phones, use surface-mounted devices (wearable computing) and contain embedded devices (e.g., pacemakers to maintain a healthy heart operation or [[Augmented reality|AR]] contact lenses).

==Features==
Smart environments are broadly classified to have the following features
# ''Remote control of devices'', like power line communication systems to control devices.
# ''Device Communication'',  using middleware, and Wireless communication to form a picture of connected environments.
# ''Information Acquisition/Dissemination from sensor networks''
# ''Enhanced Services by Intelligent Devices''
# ''Predictive and Decision-Making capabilities''

==Technologies==
To build a smart environment, involves technologies of
# Wireless communication
# Algorithm design, signal prediction &amp; classification, information theory
# Multilayered software architecture, [[CORBA|Corba]], middleware
# [[Speech recognition]]
# Image processing, image recognition
# Sensors design, calibration, [[motion detection]], temperature, pressure sensors, accelerometers
# [[Semantic Web]] and [[knowledge graph]]s
# Adaptive control, [[Kalman filter]]s
# Computer networking
# Parallel processing
# Operating systems

==Existing projects==
The [[Aware Home Research Initiative]] at Georgia Tech "is devoted to the multidisciplinary exploration of emerging technologies and services based in the home" and was launched in 1998 as one of the first "living laboratories."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[MavHome]] (Managing an Adaptive Versatile Home) project, at [[University of Texas at Arlington|UT Arlington]], is a smart environment-lab with state-of-the-art algorithms and protocols used to provide a customized, personal environment to the users of this space. The MavHome project, in addition to providing a safe environment, wants to reduce the energy consumption of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3577">'''Stellar chemistry''' is the study of the [[chemical composition]] of astronomical objects; stars in particular, hence the name stellar chemistry. The significance of stellar chemical composition is an open ended question at this point.  Some research asserts that a greater abundance of certain elements (such as carbon, sodium, silicon, and magnesium) in the stellar mass are necessary for a star's inner solar system to be habitable over long periods of time.&lt;ref name ="scienceshot"&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/07/scienceshot-for-lifes-evolution-.html ScienceShot: For Life's Evolution, Stellar Chemistry Matters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="stellarabun"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4755 The Impact of Stellar Abundance Variations on Stellar Habitable Zone Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;  The hypothesis being that the "abundance of these elements make the star cooler and cause it to evolve more slowly, thereby giving planets in its habitable zone more time to develop life as we know it."&lt;ref name = "scienceshot" /&gt; Stellar abundance of oxygen also appears to be critical to the length of time newly developed planets exist in a habitable zone around their host star.&lt;ref name="stellarabun" /&gt;  Researchers postulate that if our own sun had a lower abundance of oxygen, the Earth would have ceased to "live" in a habitable zone a billion years ago, long before complex organisms had the opportunity to evolve.&lt;ref name = "scienceshot" /&gt;

Other research is being or has been done in numerous areas relating to the chemical nature of stars.  The formation of stars is of particular interest.  Research published in 2009 presents spectroscopic observations of so-called "young stellar objects" viewed in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].  This research suggests that water, or, more specifically, ice, plays a large role in the formation of these eventual stars&lt;ref name = "icechem"&gt;Oliveira, J. M.; van Loon, J. T.; Chen, C. H. R.; Tielens, A.; Sloan, G. C.; Woods, P. M.; Kemper, F.; Indebetouw, R.; Gordon, K. D.; Boyer, M. L.; Shiao, B.; Madden, S.; Speck, A. K.; Meixner, M.; Marengo, M., ICE CHEMISTRY IN EMBEDDED YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS IN THE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD. Astrophysical Journal 2009, 707 (2), 1269–1295.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others are researching much more tangible ideas relating to stars and chemistry.  Research published in 2010 studied the effects of a strong stellar flare on the atmospheric chemistry of an Earth-like planet orbiting an [[M-type star|M]] [[dwarf star]], specifically, the M dwarf [[AD Leonis]].  This research simulated the effects an observed flare produced by AD Leonis on April 12, 1985 would have on a hypothetical Earth-like planet.  After simulating the effects of both [[UV radiation]] and protons on the hypothetical planet's atmosphere, the researchers concluded that "flares may not present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable planet. Given that AD Leo[nis] is one of the most magnetically active M dwarfs known, this conclusion should apply to planets around other [[M-type star|M dwarfs]] with lower levels of chromospheric activity."&lt;ref name = "stellarflare"&gt;Segura, A.; Walkowicz, L. M.; Meadows, V.; Kasting, J.; Hawley, S., The Effect of a Strong Stellar Flare on the Atmospheric Chemistry of an Earth-like Planet Orbiting an M Dwarf. Astrobiology 2010, 10  (7), 751–771.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''System appreciation''' is an activity often included in the maintenance phase of [[software engineering]] projects.  Key deliverables from this phase include [[Software documentation|documentation]] that describes what the system does in terms of its functional features, and how it achieves those features in terms of its [[Software architecture|architecture]] and [[Software design|design]].  [[Software architecture recovery]] is often the first step within System appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author1=Patel, Sandipkumar |author2=Yogesh Dandawate, John Kuriakose |url=http://softeng.polito.it/events/WESRE2006/03Dandawate.pdf |format=PDF |title=Architecture Recovery as first step in System Appreciation |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">The '''teach-back method''', also called the '''"show-me" method''', is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to "teach-back" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve [[health literacy]].

There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.&lt;ref name="In Focus"&gt;Teach Back: A tool for improving provider-patient communication. The Ethics Center. 2006. Retrieved from http://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/infocus/InFocus_20060401_Teach_Back.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Case studies led by the [[National Quality Forum]] on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency.&lt;ref name="NQF"&gt;Implementing a National Voluntary Consensus Standard for Informed Consent: A User's Guide for Healthcare Professionals. National Quality Forum. 2005. Retrieved from http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2005/09/Implementing_a_National_Voluntary_Consensus_Standard_for_Informed_Consent__A_User’s_Guide_for_Healthcare_Professionals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==
The [[National Quality Forum]] describes the practice as follows:&lt;ref name="NQF"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Who''' should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals&lt;br /&gt;
'''What''' should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
'''When''' to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process&lt;br /&gt;
'''Why''' is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information.&lt;br /&gt;
'''How'''→When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding.&lt;ref name="Heiges"&gt;The Teach Back Method. SurroundHealth. 2012. Retrieved from www.surroundhealth.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge retention ==
The cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients.&lt;ref name="White, Garbez, Carroll, Brinker &amp; Howie-Esquivel"&gt;Is "teach back" associated with knowledge retention and [[Hospital Readmission|hospital readmission]] in hospitalized heart failure patients? The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. 2013 Mar-Apr;28(2):137-46. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e31824987bd&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create [[feedback loops]]  in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching  where students explain what they just learned to other students. Retention is also most positively impacted in [[participatory learning]] environments, when students participate in group discussions, practice by doing, and teaching others.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Teaching Methods and Retention. 2002. Retrieved from http://www.simulations.co.uk/pyramid.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">"'''Unified Science'''" can refer to any of three related strands in contemporary thought.
* Belief in the [[unity of science]] was a central tenet of [[logical positivism]]. Different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways, e.g. as a [[reductionism|reductionist]] thesis, that the objects investigated by the [[special sciences]] reduce to the objects of a common, putatively more basic domain of science, usually thought to be physics; as the thesis that all of the theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or "universal slang"; or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common [[scientific method|method]].
* The writings of [[Edward Haskell]] and a few associates, seeking to rework science into a single discipline employing a common artificial language. This work culminated in the 1972 publication of ''[[Full Circle (Haskell)|Full Circle: The Moral Force of Unified Science]]''.  The vast part of the work of Haskell and his contemporaries remains unpublished, however. Timothy Wilken and [[Anthony Judge]] have recently revived and extended the insights of Haskell and his coworkers.
* Unified Science has been a consistent thread since the 1940s in [[Howard T. Odum]]'s [[systems ecology]] and the associated [[Emergy Synthesis]], modeling the "[[ecosystem]]": the geochemical, biochemical, and thermodynamic processes of the [[lithosphere]] and [[biosphere]]. Modeling such earthly processes in this manner requires a science uniting geology, physics, biology, and chemistry (H.T.Odum 1995). With this in mind, Odum developed a [[Energy Systems Language | common language of science]] based on electronic schematics, with applications to ecology economic systems in mind (H.T.Odum 1994).

'''Victorian architecture''' is a series of [[architectural style|architectural revival styles]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. ''Victorian'' refers to the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] (1837–1901), called the [[Victorian era]], during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed "Victorian" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign. The styles often included interpretations and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] revivals of historic styles. The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed [[Georgian architecture]] and later [[Regency architecture]], and was succeeded by [[Edwardian architecture]].

==Victorian architecture in the United Kingdom==

During the early 19th century, the romantic [[medieval]] [[Gothic revival]] style was developed as a reaction to the [[symmetry]] of [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], and such buildings as [[Fonthill Abbey]] were built. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new [[technology]], construction was able to incorporate [[steel]] as a building component; one of the greatest exponents of this was [[Joseph Paxton]], architect of [[the Crystal Palace]]. Paxton also continued to build such houses as [[Mentmore Towers]], in the still popular [[English Renaissance]] styles. New methods of construction were developed in this era of prosperity, but ironically the architectural styles, as developed by such architects as [[Augustus Pugin]], were typically retrospective.

In [[Scotland]], the architect [[Alexander Thomson]] who practiced in [[Glasgow]] was a pioneer of the use of [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] for commercial buildings, blending neo-classical conventionality with Egyptian and oriental themes to produce many truly original structures. Other notable Scottish architects of this period are [[Archibald Simpson]] and [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] whose stylistically varied work can be seen in the [[architecture of Aberdeen]].

While Scottish architects pioneered this style it soon spread right across the United Kingdom and remained popular for another 40 years. Its architectural value in preserving and reinventing the past is significant. Its influences were diverse but the Scottish architects who practiced it were inspired by unique ways to blend architecture, purpose, and everyday life in a meaningful way.

===Other styles popularised during the period===

While not uniquely Victorian, and part of revivals that began before the era, these styles are strongly associated with the 19th century owing to the large number of examples that were erected during that period. Victorian architecture usually has many intricate window frames inspired by the famous architect Elliot Rae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howoldismyhouse.co.uk/windows.html|title=Old Windows|website=howoldismyhouse.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522151729/http://howoldismyhouse.co.uk/windows.html|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International spread of Victorian styles==
[[File:China Merchants Bank Building, Shanghai.JPG|thumb|The [[China Merchants Bank Building, Shanghai|China Merchants Bank Building]] is an example of Victorian architecture found in Shanghai, China]]
During the 18th century, a few English architects emigrated to the colonies, but as the [[British Empire]] became firmly established during the 19th century, many architects emigrated at the start of their careers. Some chose the United States, and others went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Normally, they applied architectural styles that were fashionable when they left England. By the latter half of the century, however, improving transport and communications meant that even remote parts of the Empire had access to publications such as the magazine ''[[The Builder]]'', which helped colonial architects keep informed about current fashion. Thus, the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several prominent architects produced English-derived designs around the world, including [[William Butterfield]] ([[St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide]]) and [[Jacob Wrey Mould]] (Chief Architect of Public Works in [[New York City]]).

The Victorian period flourished in Australia and is generally recognised as being from 1840 to 1890, which saw a [[gold rush]] and population boom during the 1880s in the state of Victoria. There were fifteen styles that predominated:{{sfn|Apperly|Irving|Reynolds|1994|pp=40-97}}

* Mannerist
* Second Empire
* Italianate
|
* Romanesque
* Tudor
* Academic Gothic
|
* Free Gothic
* Rustic Gothic
* Carpenter Gothic

The Arts and Crafts style and Queen Anne style are considered to be part of the [[Federation architecture|Federation]] Period, from 1890 to 1915.{{sfn|Apperly|Irving|Reynolds|1994|pp=132-143}}

In the United States, 'Victorian' architecture generally describes styles that were most popular between 1860 and 1900. A list of these styles most commonly includes [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1855–85), [[Stick-Eastlake]] (1860–ca. 1890), [[Folk Victorian]] (1870-1910), [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] (1880–1910), [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] (1880–1900), and [[Shingle Style architecture|Shingle]] (1880–1900). As in the United Kingdom, examples of Gothic Revival and Italianate continued to be constructed during this period, and are therefore sometimes called Victorian. Some historians classify the later years of Gothic Revival as a distinctive Victorian style named High Victorian Gothic. [[Stick-Eastlake]], a manner of geometric, machine-cut decorating derived from Stick and Queen Anne, is sometimes considered a distinct style. On the other hand, terms such as "[[Painted Ladies]]" or "gingerbread" may be used to describe certain Victorian buildings, but do not constitute a specific style. The names of architectural styles (as well as their adaptations) varied between countries. Many homes combined the elements of several different styles and are not easily distinguishable as one particular style or another.

In the United States of America, notable cities which developed or were rebuilt largely during this era include [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], the [[Brooklyn Heights]] and [[Victorian Flatbush]] sections of New York City, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Chicago]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Detroit]], [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Jersey City]]/[[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Atlanta]], [[Milwaukee]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Midtown Sacramento|Midtown]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles|Angelino Heights]] and [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. San Francisco is well known for its extensive Victorian architecture, particularly in the [[Haight-Ashbury]], [[Lower Haight]], [[Alamo Square]], [[Noe Valley]], [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro]], [[Nob Hill]], and [[Pacific Heights]] neighborhoods.

The extent to which any one is the "largest surviving example" is debated, with numerous qualifications.

==Preservation==
Efforts to preserve landmarks of Victorian architecture are ongoing and are often led by the [[Victorian Society]]. A recent campaign the group has taken on is the preservation of Victorian [[Gas holder|gasometers]] after utility companies announced plans to demolish nearly 200 of the now-outdated structures.&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Hagan, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/14/gasometers-gas-holders-hold-on-for-a-new-life-repurposing Gasworks wonders…] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923084931/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/14/gasometers-gas-holders-hold-on-for-a-new-life-repurposing |date=2016-09-23 }}, The Guardian, 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The [[archaeological site]] was located on the northeastern escarpment of a sand pit near Wulfsen. In summer of 1974 a [[fossil]] collector observed a discoloration of the soil, which he considered of archaeological interest. He reported his observation to the Museum of the Principality of Lüneburg, which forwarded the message to the Helms-Museum in Hamburg-Harburg being the archaeological authority for the region. An [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was conducted on the already disturbed burial site, which unearthed 35 human burials and the horse burial, containing the three horses. Due to the sandy soil, preservation of the burials was relatively poor. In total 26 older burials, oriented in north-south direction and nine younger burials oriented in east-west direction were excavated. Except for two [[arrowhead]]s in a young person's [[grave]], no other [[grave goods]] were observed.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ahrens | first = Claus | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  Ein neues spätsächsisches Gräberfeld mit Dreifach-Pferdebestattung bei Wulfsen, Kreis Harburg | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 119–124 | publisher = | location = | year = 1975 | language = German | url = | jstor = | issn = 0173-0886  | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Horse burial ==
The three horses were buried in a steep-walled pit of {{Convert|230|cm|in}} by {{Convert|240|cm|in}}. The bodies of the animals were fully decomposed, only [[bone]]s and [[teeth]] remaining, but the bones were very brittle and fragile. Offerings or grave goods such as [[bridle]]s were not detected. All the horses were lying on their left side, orientated in south–north direction. Their heads were placed in an upright posture on an elevated part of the pit. The middle horse was lying with its [[abdomen]] in a [[ventral]] position. The [[leg]]s of the middle and eastern animal were sharply [[Flexion|flexed]]. The legs of the western horse were lying in a half-[[Extension (kinesiology)|extended]] position; it occupied about half of the pit's space. By use of a working platform, the bones were carefully exposed and soaked with cold [[glue]], the pit was then laminated with [[lacquer]] and [[crêpe paper]]. The single bones were further secured with wires and pins. Then the pit was filled with a construction [[foam]], secured in a wooden crate and recovered as a block. The entire object consists of a prepared sand layer of about {{Convert|3|mm|in}} to {{Convert|4|mm|in}} millimeters thickness with the embedded bone.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt; The poor preservation of the bones complicated [[Zoology|zoological]] investigations. The western horse was likely a [[mare]], the others [[stallion]]s. Their [[withers]] has been between {{Convert|130|cm|in}} and {{Convert|140|cm|in}}, which is relatively small compared to today's standards, but was average for those days. The ages of the animals have been determined between five and seven years.&lt;ref name="Reichenstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichenstein | first = Hans | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Bemerkungen zu der Pferdebestattung von Wulfsen aus zoologisch-haustierkundlicher Sicht | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 125–126 | publisher = | location = | year = 1975 | language = German | url = | jstor = | issn = 0173-0886  | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
[[Image:Lego Wulfsen horse burial.jpg|thumb|The excavation of the Wulfsen horse burial as a [[LEGO]] miniature]]
Based on evidence such as mortuary practice, the geographical orientation of remains and their grave goods, the burial was dated to 700–800&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt; The younger burials especially are dated to a period shortly before the wide [[Christianization]] of the region, which resulted in fundamental changes of burial practices. The [[horse burial]] could not be clearly assigned to one of the warrior's graves, therefore it is unclear whether was an individual burial of the animals or it was an addition to one of the human interments. Funerals of animals, especially of individual horses are well known from many grave fields of the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt; Similar burial sites have been found in [[Suffolk]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.angelcynnreenactmentsociety.org.uk/home/anglo-saxon-horseman-s-grave-in-suffolk| title = Anglo Saxon Horseman's Grave in Suffolk| work = Angelcynn Re-Enactment Society  | accessdate = 2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple horse burials, for example, were discovered near [[Griefstedt]] ([[Sömmerda (district)]]) in [[Thuringia]] and [[Beckum, Germany|Beckum]] ([[Warendorf (district)]]) in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], but for north-eastern Lower-Saxony it is unprecedented.&lt;ref name="Ahrens"/&gt;

A [[LEGO]] miniature of the excavation of Wulfsen horse burial was built in 2013 for the special exhibition ''LEGO Zeitreise'' (LEGO time travel) of Archäologische Museum Hamburg.
