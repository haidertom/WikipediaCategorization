[[File:Adastral Park.jpg|thumb|The main complex at Adastral Park.]]
'''Adastral Park''' is a science campus based on part of the old [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Royal Air Force Station]] at [[Martlesham Heath]] near [[Ipswich]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Suffolk]].

When the site opened it was known as the [[Post Office Research Station]], but it was subsequently renamed '''BT Research Laboratories''' or '''BT Labs''' and later '''Adastral Park''' to reflect an expansion in the organisations and activities co-located with [[BT Labs]] at the campus.

==History==
The original laboratories (when BT was part of the [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]]) were first opened by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1975.  Prior to this the [[Post Office Research Station]] was located at [[Dollis Hill]]. 

Martlesham Heath was originally chosen as the location for a research facility because the surrounding countryside was relatively flat and therefore ideal for testing the radio-based communication systems in vogue at the time.

Initially research was carried out into postal sorting and delivery technology and telecommunications. After the Post Office was split apart and prior to British Telecom's privatisation in the early 1980s, the research concentrated on telecommunications.

In keeping with the stellar theme of the site name, buildings on site are named after stars or constellations (an example being the Main Laboratory Block now named the Orion building). The Orion building is easily recognisable from the nearby [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12 road]] with its {{convert|200|ft|m}} radio  tower, now named Pegasus tower, dominating the skyline.

The change to the current name occurred in the late 1990s with the aim of turning the site into a high technology business park no longer exclusively for the use of BT. The name was created by Stewart Davies, the CEO of the BT business (BT Exact Technologies) headquartered at the site at that time. It is derived from the motto of the [[Royal Air Force]]—''per ardua ad astra'' ("through adversity to the stars"). The Royal Air Force were prior residents of the site, as [[RAF Martlesham Heath]]. Experimental aircraft test flights flew from the airfield and the name was meant to reflect this. In March 2001, [[University College London]], Faculty of Engineering Sciences, chose Adastral Park to set up the first-ever postgraduate research and teaching centre on an industrial campus which existed until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/ucl_set_to_leave_suffolk_research_park_1_202294|title=UCL set to leave Suffolk research park}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the transformation of the business park many of the old buildings were removed and during the landscaping, car parks were moved to the perimeter of the site with the centre being transformed with open park land and a water feature to provide a 'park' feel to the complex. The site accommodates approximately 4000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BT Celebrates 40 years of innovation at Adastral Park|url=https://atadastral.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/bt-celebrates-40-years-of-innovation-at-adastral-park.pdf|website=www.atadastral.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Use==

Companies based at Adastral Park besides [[British Telecom]] ([[BT Research]]) include:

*[[Juniper_Networks]]
*[[Alcatel-Lucent]]
*[[GENBAND]]
*[[Cisco]]
*[[Fujitsu]]
*[[Huawei]]
*[[O2 plc]]
*[[Arqiva]]
*[[Centre for Integrated Photonics (CIP)|CIP]]
* Milner Strategic Marketing Ltd

There is also a satellite earth station (operated by Arqiva)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqiva.com/products-and-services/satellite-solutions/contact-us-489 Contact Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217130210/http://www.arqiva.com/products-and-services/satellite-solutions/contact-us-489 |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; - the location was chosen for the visibility of satellites on the eastern horizon.  In total there are currently 98 high-tech companies based at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atadastral.co.uk/|title=Home - BT Adastral Park|author=|date=|website=atadastral.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adastral New Town==
Over many years BT has put forward various proposals and plans to expand the business park activities. In June 2001, a framework for expanding the business park was created, but it was not linked to building any residential housing on the site. At the time BT forecast 3000–3500 additional jobs by about 2010. As recently as 2007, BT said that they could develop the business park without the need for the income from selling land for housing.

In 2006, [[Suffolk Coastal|Suffolk Coastal District Council]] (SCDC) rejected a planning application for 120 log cabins on a site next to Waldringfield Road. The rejection was on the grounds that it was too near the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] amongst other reasons, and would result in an unacceptable increase in visitor numbers to a sensitive areas. BT initially objected on the grounds that it would interfere with their radio test area, although BT subsequently withdrew their objection provided the developer created a protective earth bund, rejected by SCDC.

BT subsequently lodged a planning application for 2000 houses to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redevelopment of Adastral Park|url=http://www.suffolkcoastal.gov.uk/yourdistrict/planning/devcontrol/adastralpark/default.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its closest the site comes within {{convert|88|m}} of an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adastral Park Redevelopment Project: Greenfields under threat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/18/7|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 November 2010 &lt;!-- 15.54 GMT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are several sites of special status close by, such as Newbourne Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suffolk Wildlife Trust " Reserves &amp; Visitor Centres " Newbourne Springs |url=http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/reserves-and-visitor-centres/newbourne-springs/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327085344/http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/reserves-and-visitor-centres/newbourne-springs |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">In 1865, at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a society for the study of social questions was organized and given the name  '''American Social Science Association'''. The group grew to where its membership totaled about 1,000 persons. About 30 corresponding members were located in [[Europe]].  It published annually the  ''[[Journal of Social Science]]''.  

Members of the group worked in five departments:  
* Education and art
* Health
* Trade and finance
* Social economy
* Jurisprudence

In 1898, the society founded the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] which developed into the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Anecdotal cognitivism''' is a psychological methodology that attributes mental states to animals on the basis of anecdotes and on the observation of particular cases, other than those observations made during controlled experiments. It is opposed to [[behaviorism]]; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. 

==Animal cognition==
Anecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of [[Clever Hans]], to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing [[animal cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf|title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons|last=Keeley|first=Brian L.|date=2004|publisher=York University|pages=527|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Clever Hans, a [[horse]] was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding [[European politics]], but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the [[horse]], and that when he was removed from the room, the [[horse]] would not respond.

Anecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that [[behaviorism]] would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.

== ArchiLab 2001 ==

More than 90 [[architect]]s were invited to present their projects during the third International meeting on [[Architecture]] held in [[Orléans]] in 2001. This meeting brings together the architects of the world for whom lodging together is a chance for thinking about new conceptual strategies.  Faced with an increasing standardization in the [[construction industry]] and the fashion of dwellings in constant change, the challenge of the innovator is to adapt to these times of constant change.  
Modern communications have introduced us to a greater cultural diversity but, on the other hand, increasing industrialization has led to uniformity in the construction process.

The projects are grouped in a way to represent various attitudes towards the question of housing.
*Individual or collective habitation
*Flexibility
*Effects on landscape
*New life styles
*Subversion 
*Form and process of creation

'''Beam and block''' is a [[construction]] method to support [[flooring]], especially for ground floors as well as multi storey buildings. It is made of cast [[concrete]], one piece of which is a [[prestressed concrete]] Beam which can be inverted T-shape [[beam (structure)|beam]], or lintel, the other piece being a simple rectangular block. The blocks are placed at regular intervals and the beams placed between them to form a connection between each block section. They form a support for the next layer of flooring materials.

Beam and Block is also referred to as Rib and block and lintel and block is some countries. Certain countries incorporate the use of temporary propping for 21 days while other rib and block systems use propless systems. Systems where props are used incorporate lighter [[beams]] while the prop line allows for structural cross support. Propless systems used heavier inverted T beams to compensate for the exclusion of props.

The lintels and blocks are packed above load bearing walls under supervision and design by a structural engineer. This system is extremely versatile in achieving complex designs and using unskilled labour. It is cost efficient as well as easily understood by all contractors.

The use of polystyrene blocks to replace concrete hollow blocks are used for lightweight insulated slabs. This keeps buildings warmer in winter and cooler in summer. From a structural viewpoint a lighter slab assists by allowing load bearing walls and foundations taking less strain.

This '''bibliography of anthropology''' lists some notable publications in the field of [[anthropology]], including its various subfields. It is not comprehensive and continues to be developed. It also includes a number of works that are not by anthropologists but are relevant to the field, such as literary theory, sociology, psychology, and philosophical anthropology.

Anthropology is the study of [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Mission|url=http://www.therai.org.uk/about-the-rai/|publisher=[[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Anthropologie |url=http://www.afa.msh-paris.fr/discipline.html |publisher=Association Française des Anthropologues |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109101912/http://www.afa.msh-paris.fr/discipline.html |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "the most humanistic of sciences and the most scientific of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.discoveranthropology.org.uk/about-anthropology/what-is-anthropology.html|work=Discover Anthropology|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered to bridge the [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Creating consilience: integrating the sciences and the humanities|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-979439-3|pages=140–158|editor=Edward Slingerland and Mark Collard|chapter=Unconsilience: Rethinking the Two-Cultures Conundrum in Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and draws upon a wide range of related fields.

== Biological anthropology ==
[[Biological anthropology]] is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. In some universities, however, the subject has repositioned itself as ''human evolutionary biology''. In Europe, it is sometimes taught as an individual subject at college level or as part of the discipline of biology. Its methods are informed by evolutionary biology, hence the adjunct ''biological''. Since 1993, the Biological Anthropology Section of the [[American Anthropological Association]] has awarded the W.W. Howells Book Award in Biological Anthropology.&lt;ref name=Howells&gt;{{cite web|title=W. W.

== Archaeology ==
Archaeological anthropology is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. With the four-field approach being questioned for its orthodoxy, the subject has gained considerable independence in recent years and some archaeologists have rejected the label ''anthropology''. In Europe, the subject maintains closer connections to history and is simply conceived of as ''archaeology'' with a distinct research focus and methodology.

== Some points of reference in related disciplines ==
Anthropological research has exerted considerable influence on other disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[literary theory]], and [[philosophy]]. Conversely, contemporary anthropological discourse has become receptive to a wide variety of theoretical currents which in turn help to shape the cognitive identity of the subject(s). Among the key publications from related disciplines that have advanced anthropological scholarship are:

==Truncated antenna==
The [[chlorophyll]] (Chl) antenna size in green algae is minimized, or truncated, to maximize photobiological solar conversion efficiency and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The truncated Chl antenna size minimizes absorption and wasteful dissipation of sunlight by individual cells, resulting in better light utilization efficiency and greater photosynthetic productivity by the green alga mass culture.&lt;ref name="KirstGarcia-Cerdan2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirst|first1=H.|last2=Garcia-Cerdan|first2=J.

==History==
In 1939  [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the algae he was studying, ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html Algae: Power Plant of the Future?]&lt;/ref&gt; He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that if the algae culture medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlamydomonas moewusii]]'' is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="YangGuarnieri2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Shihui|last2=Guarnieri|first2=Michael T|last3=Smolinski|first3=Sharon|last4=Ghirardi|first4=Maria|last5=Pienkos|first5=Philip T|title=De novo transcriptomic analysis of hydrogen production in the green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii through RNA-Seq|journal=Biotechnology for Biofuels|volume=6|issue=1|year=2013|pages=118|issn=1754-6834|doi=10.1186/1754-6834-6-118|pmid=23971877|pmc=3846465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
It would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone.  This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/energy-fuels/mg18925401.600-growing-hydrogen-for-the-cars-of-tomorrow.html Growing hydrogen for the cars of tomorrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioreactor design issues==
* Restriction of photosynthetic hydrogen production by accumulation of a [[proton gradient]].
* Competitive inhibition of photosynthetic hydrogen production by carbon dioxide.
* Requirement for bicarbonate binding at [[photosystem II]] (PSII) for [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficient photosynthetic activity]].
* Competitive drainage of electrons by oxygen in algal hydrogen production.
* Economics must reach competitive price to other sources of energy and the economics are dependent on several parameters.
* A major technical obstacle is the efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in molecular hydrogen.

Attempts are in progress to solve these problems via [[bioengineering]].

==Solution techniques==
Majority of existing codes for calculation of electromagnetic scattering by a single sphere is based on [[Mie theory]] which is an analytical solution of Maxwell's equations in terms of infinite series. Other approximations to scattering by a single sphere include: [[Debye series]], [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] ([[geometrical optics]]), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, [[Airy theory]], [[Rayleigh scattering]], diffraction approximation. There are many phenomena related to light scattering by spherical particles such as resonances, surface waves, plasmons, near-field scattering. Even though Mie theory offers convenient and fast way of solving light scattering problem by homogeneous spherical particles, there are other techniques, such as [[discrete dipole approximation]], FDTD, T-matrix, which can also be used for such tasks.

| MiePlot offers the following mathematical models for the scattering of light by a sphere: Mie solutions, Debye series, ray tracing (based on geometrical optics), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, Airy theory, Rayleigh scattering, diffraction, surface waves.  In addition to single-wavelength calculations, MiePlot can also perform calculations for a number of wavelengths, thus approximating a continuous spectrum (such as sunlight) to produce simulations of atmospheric optical effects such as rainbows, coronas and glories.

| The Sub-Department of Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics in the University of Oxford maintains an archive of Mie scattering routines for both single spheres and populations of particles in which sizes follow a [[log-normal]] distribution. Code is also available for calculating the analytical derivatives of Mie scattering (i.e. the derivative of the extinction and scattering coefficients, and the intensity functions with respect to size parameter and complex refractive index). The routines are written in [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], but a Fortran-based DLM version (which substantially reduces runtime) of the single-sphere code is also available.

A '''colicin''' is a type of [[bacteriocin]] produced by and toxic to some strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*  {{cite journal | vauthors = Feldgarden M, Riley MA | year = 1999 | title = The phenotypic and fitness effects of colicin resistance in Escherichia coli K-12 | journal = Evolution | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 1019–27 | jstor=2640807 | doi=10.2307/2640807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colicins are released into the environment to reduce competition from other [[bacterial strain]]s. Colicins bind to [[TonB-dependent receptors|outer membrane receptor]]s, using them to [[Translocase of the outer membrane|translocate]] to the cytoplasm or cytoplasmic membrane, where they exert their cytotoxic effect, including depolarisation of the cytoplasmic membrane, [[DNase]] activity, [[RNase]] activity, or inhibition of [[murein]] synthesis.

==Structure==
Channel-forming colicins (colicins A, B, E1, Ia, Ib, and N) are [[transmembrane protein]]s that depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to dissipation of cellular energy.&lt;ref name="PUB00030669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kang C, Postle K, Chen G, Park H, Youn B, Hilsenbeck JL |title=Crystal structure of the cytotoxic bacterial protein colicin B at 2.5 A resolution |journal=Mol.

Biophys. Acta |volume=1666 |issue=1 |pages= 239–49|year=2004 |pmid=15519318 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cascales et al. (2007). ''Colicin Biology''. Microbio. and Mol. Bio. Rev. 71(1), 158-229. [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/1/158 Abstract][http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/71/1/158 pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  One domain regulates the target and binds to the receptor on the sensitive cell.  The second is involved with translocation, co-opting the machinery of the target cell.  The third is the 'killing' domain and may produce a pore in the target [[cell membrane]], or act as a [[nuclease]] to chop up the [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] of the target cell.

==Translocation==
Most colicins are able to translocate the outer membrane by a two-receptor system, where one receptor is used for the initial binding and the second for translocation. The initial binding is to [[TonB-dependent receptors|cell surface receptors]] such as the outer membrane proteins OmpF, FepA, BtuB, Cir and FhuA; colicins have been classified according to which receptors they bind to. The presence of specific periplasmic proteins, such as [[Outer membrane efflux proteins|TolA, TolB, TolC]], or TonB, are required for translocation across the membrane.&lt;ref name="PUB00014773"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao Z, Klebba PE |title=Mechanisms of colicin binding and transport through outer membrane porins |journal=Biochimie |volume=84 |issue=5-6 |pages=399–412 |year=2002 |pmid=12423783 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(02)01455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloacin DF13 is a bacteriocin that inactivates ribosomes by hydrolysing 16S RNA in 30S ribosomes at a specific site.&lt;ref name="PUB00006229"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van den Elzen PJ, Veltkamp E, Nijkamp HJ, Walters HH |title=Molecular structure and function of the bacteriocin gene and bacteriocin protein of plasmid Clo DF13 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2465–2477 |year=1983 |pmid=6344017 |doi=10.1093/nar/11.8.2465 |pmc=325896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
Because they target specific receptors and use specific translocation machinery, cells can make themselves resistant to the colicin by repressing or deleting the genes for these proteins.  Such resistant cells may suffer the lack of a key nutrient (such as [[iron]] or a [[vitamin B|B vitamin]]), but benefit by not being killed.  Colicins exhibit a '1-hit killing kinetic' which does not necessarily mean a single molecule is sufficient to kill, but certainly that it only takes a small number.  In his 1969 Nobel Laureate speech, [[Salvador E. Luria]] speculated that colicins could only be this toxic by causing a [[domino effect]] that destabilized the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/luria-lecture.html Luria, S. E. (1969)  Nobel Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not entirely correct, but pore-forming colicins do depolarize the membrane and thus eliminate the energy source for the cell.  The colicins are highly effective [[toxin]]s.

==Genetic organisation==
Virtually all colicins are carried on [[plasmid]]s.  The two general classes of colicinogenic plasmids are large, low-copy-number plasmids, and small, high-copy-number plasmids.  The larger plasmids carry other genes, as well as the colicin operon.  The colicin operons are generally organized with several major [[gene]]s.  These include an immunity gene, a colicin structural gene, and a [[bacteriocin release protein]] (BRP), or [[lysis]], gene.  The immunity gene is often produced constitutively, while the BRP is generally produced only as a read-through of the [[stop codon]] on the colicin structural gene.  The colicin itself is repressed by the [[SOS response]] and may be regulated in other ways, as well.

Retaining the colicin plasmid is very important for cells that live with their relatives, because if a cell loses the immunity gene, it quickly becomes subject to destruction by circulating colicin.  At the same time, colicin is only released from a producing cell by the use of the lysis protein, which results in that cell's death.  This suicidal production mechanism would appear to be very costly, except for the fact that it is regulated by the [[SOS response]], which responds to significant [[DNA]] damage.  In short, colicin production may only occur in terminally ill cells.  The Professor Kleanthous Research Group at the [[University of Oxford]] study colicins extensively as a model system for characterising and investigating protein-protein interactions and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kleanthous Research Group|url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=910|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creolistics''', or '''Creology''', is the [[scientific]] study of [[creole language]]s and, as such, is a subfield of [[linguistics]]. Someone who engages in this study is called a '''creolist'''.

==Controversy==
Creolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls "the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness."  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.

==="Creole", a sociohistoric concept===
''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as "the most creole of creoles."{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.

==="Creole", a genuine linguistic concept===
On the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.

To the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on "defining creole", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.

===Proposed synthesis===
The answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}

The answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.

Though the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Givón|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:

:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''
:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''
:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''
:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''

The authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into separate chapters outside this scheme whether or not relexification come into the picture.

[[Image:Air damper.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Opposed blade dampers in a mixing duct.]]
A '''damper''' is a valve or plate that stops or regulates the [[airflow|flow of air]] inside a [[Duct (HVAC)|duct]], [[chimney]], [[Variable air volume|VAV box]], [[air handler]], or other air-handling equipment. A damper may be used to cut off central [[air conditioning]] (heating or cooling) to an unused room, or to regulate it for room-by-room [[temperature]] and [[climate control]].  Its operation can be manual or automatic. Manual dampers are turned by a handle on the outside of a duct.  Automatic dampers are used to regulate airflow constantly and are operated by [[Electric motor|electric]] or [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]] motors, in turn controlled by a [[thermostat]] or [[building automation]] system. Automatic or motorized dampers may also be controlled by a [[solenoid]], and the degree of air-flow calibrated, perhaps according to signals from the thermostat going to the actuator of the damper in order to modulate the flow of air-conditioned air in order to effect climate control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emwhouston.com/industrial-dampers.htm What are Dampers?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208120010/http://www.emwhouston.com/industrial-dampers.htm |date=2012-02-08 }}, EMW.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a chimney [[flue]], a damper closes off the flue to keep the [[weather]] (and [[bird]]s and other animals) out and warm or cool air in.  This is usually done in the summer, but also sometimes in the winter between uses.  In some cases, the damper may also be partly closed to help control the rate of combustion.  The damper may be accessible only by reaching up into the [[fireplace]] by hand or with a woodpoker, or sometimes by a lever or knob that sticks down or out.  On a [[wood-burning stove]] or similar device, it is usually a handle on the vent duct as in an air conditioning system.  Forgetting to open a damper before beginning a [[fire]] can cause serious [[smoke]] damage to the interior of a home, if not a house fire.

[[Image:Zone Damper 2.jpg|thumb|225px|Close-up of the motor connections. This damper can switch the electrical power to control additional "slave" dampers, minimizing the electrical load on the damper's control circuitry and power transformer]]
A zone damper (also known as a '''Volume Control Damper''' or '''VCD''') is a specific type of damper used to control the flow of air in an [[HVAC]] heating or cooling system. In order to improve efficiency and occupant comfort, HVAC systems are commonly divided up into multiple zones. For example, in a house, the main floor may be served by one heating zone while the upstairs bedrooms are served by another. In this way, the heat can be directed principally to the main floor during the day and principally to the bedrooms at night, allowing the unoccupied areas to cool down.

Zone dampers as used in home HVAC systems are usually electrically powered. In large commercial installations, [[vacuum]] or [[compressed air]] may be used instead. In either case, the motor is usually connected to the damper via a mechanical coupling.

For electrical zone dampers, there are two principal designs.

In one design, the motor is often a small [[shaded-pole synchronous motor]] combined with a rotary switch that can disconnect the motor at either of the two stopping points ("damper open" or "damper closed"). In this way, applying power to the "open damper" terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is open while applying power at the "close damper" terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is closed. The motor is commonly powered from the same 24 [[volt]] [[Alternating current|AC]] power source that is used for the rest of the control system. This allows the zone dampers to be directly controlled by low-voltage [[thermostat]]s and wired with low-voltage wiring. Because simultaneous closure of all dampers might harm the furnace or air handler, this style of damper is often designed to only obstruct a portion of the air duct, for example, 75%.

Another style of electrically powered damper uses a [[Spring (device)|spring]]-return mechanism and a shaded-pole synchronous motor. In this case, the damper is normally opened by the force of the spring but can be closed by the force of the motor. Removal of electrical power re-opens the damper. This style of damper is advantageous because it is "fail safe"; if the control to the damper fails, the damper opens and allows air to flow. However, in most applications "fail safe" indicates the damper will close upon loss of power thus preventing the spread of smoke and fire to other areas.  These dampers also may allow adjustment of the "closed" position so that they only obstruct, for example, 75% of the air flow when closed.

For vacuum-operated or pneumatically operated zone dampers, the thermostat usually switches the pressure or vacuum on or off, causing a [[Spring (device)|spring-loaded]] rubber diaphragm to move and actuate the damper. As with the second style of electrical zone dampers, these dampers automatically return to the default position without the application of any power, and the default position is usually "open", allowing air to flow. Like the second style of electrical zone damper, these dampers may allow adjustment of the "closed" position.

Highly sophisticated systems may use some form of [[building automation]] such as [[BACnet]] or [[LonWorks]] to control the zone dampers. The dampers may also support positions other than fully open or fully closed and are usually capable of reporting their current position and, often, the temperature and volume of the air flowing past the smart damper.

Regardless of the style of damper employed, the systems are often designed so that when no thermostat is calling for air, all dampers in the system are opened. This allows air to continue to flow while the heat exchanger in a furnace cools down after a heating period completes.

=== Comparison to multiple furnaces/air handlers ===

Multiple zones can be implemented using either multiple, individually controlled furnaces/air handlers or a single furnace/air handler and multiple zone dampers. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.

=== Multiple furnaces/air handlers ===
Advantages:
* Simple mechanical and control design ("SPST [[thermostats]]")
* Redundancy: If one zone furnace fails, the others can remain working

Disadvantages:
* Cost. Furnaces cost much more than zone dampers
* Power consumption. Operating furnaces draw power whereas a zone damper only draws power while in motion from one state to the other (or, in some cases, a very small amount of power while holding closed)

=== Zone dampers ===
Advantages:
* Cost.
* Power consumption.

Disadvantages:
* New US residential building codes require permanent access to dampers through ceiling access panels.
* Zone dampers are not 100% reliable. Most styles of motor-to-open/motor-to-closed electrically operated zone dampers aren't "fail safe" (that is, they do not fail to the open condition).  However, zone dampers that are of the "Normally Open" type are fail-safe, in that they will fail to the open condition.
* No inherent redundancy for the furnace. A system with zone dampers is dependent upon a single furnace. If it fails, the system becomes completely inoperable.
* Low total flow when only some dampers are open can cause inefficient operation.
* Supply and return ducts need dampers to avoid pressurization of portions of the building.
* The system can be harder to a design, requiring both "SPDT" thermostats (or [[relay]]s) and the ability of the system to withstand the fault condition whereby all zone dampers are closed simultaneously.
[[Pneumatic]] actuation is preferred for these dampers. It is easier to provide zone-classified solenoid valves for pneumatic actuation, as compared to electrical actuation. The physical size of such solenoid valves have come down very considerably over the years.

==Fire dampers==
Fire dampers are fitted where ductwork passes through fire compartment walls / fire curtains as part of a fire control strategy. In normal circumstances, these dampers are held open by means of fusible links. When subjected to heat, these links fracture and allow the damper to close under the influence of the integral closing spring. The links are attached to the damper such that the dampers can be released manually for testing purposes. The damper is provided with an access door in the adjacent ductworks for the purpose of inspection and resetting in the event of closure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6733">'''Ecological literacy''' (also referred to as ''ecoliteracy'') is the ability to understand the [[systems ecology|natural systems]] that make [[life]] on [[earth]] possible. To be ecoliterate means understanding the principles of organization of ecological communities (i.e. [[ecosystem]]s) and using those principles for creating [[sustainable]] human communities. The term was [[neologism|coined]] by American educator [[David W. Orr]] and physicist [[Fritjof Capra]] in the 1990s&lt;ref name=orr&gt;{{cite book| last = Orr| first = David|authorlink=David W. Orr|title = Ecological Literacy: Education and the Transition to a Postmodern World| publisher = S.U.N.Y. Press, NY| year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], The Web of Life, Harper Collins (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;- thereby a new value entered education; the “well-being of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Sterling]], Whole Systems Thinking as a Basis for Paradigm Change in Education, PhD paper, University of Bath. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

An ecologically literate society would be a [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[society]] which did not destroy the [[natural environment]] on which they depend. Ecological literacy is a powerful concept as it creates a foundation for an integrated approach to environmental problems. Advocates champion eco-literacy as a new educational paradigm emerging around the poles of [[holism]], [[systems thinking]], [[sustainability]], and [[complexity]]. 

== Overview ==
Ecoliteracy concerns understanding the principles of organisation of ecosystems and their potential application to understanding how to build a sustainable [[human society]].&lt;ref&gt;(Capra, 1997: 89).&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the sciences of systems and ecology in drawing together elements required to foster learning processes toward a deep appreciation of nature and our role in it. Systems thinking is the recognition of the world as an integrated whole rather than a collection of individual elements. Within systems thinking, basic principles of organization become more important than the analysis of various components of the system in isolation. Ecological literacy and systems thinking implies a recognition of the manner in which all phenomenon are part of networks that define the way that element functions. Systems thinking is necessary to understand complex [[interdependence]] of [[ecological systems]], [[social system]]s and other systems on all levels.

According to [[Fritjof Capra]], “In the coming decades, the survival of humanity will depend on our ecological literacy – our ability to understand the basic principles of ecology and to live accordingly. This means that ecoliteracy must become a critical skill for [[politician]]s, business leaders, and professionals in all spheres, and should be the most important part of education at all levels – from primary and secondary schools to colleges, universities, and the continuing education and training of professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], "The New Facts of Life," 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051039/http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David W. Orr]] has stated that the goal of ecological literacy is “built on the recognition that the disorder of ecosystems reflects a prior disorder of mind, making it a central concern to those institutions that purport to improve minds. In other words, the ecological crisis is in every way a crisis of education.... All education is environmental education… by what is included or excluded we teach the young that they are part of or apart from the natural world.” He also emphasizes that ecoliteracy does not only require mastery of subject matter, but the creation of meaningful connections between head, hands, and heart as well.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone and [[Zenobia Barlow]], eds., Ecological Literacy: Educating Our Children for a Sustainable World, Sierra Club Books (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others have reiterated the urgent importance of ecological literacy in today's world, where young people are faced with escalating environmental challenges, including climate change, depletion of resources, and environmentally linked illnesses. {{quote|This generation will require leaders and citizens who can think ecologically, understand the interconnectedness of human and natural systems, and have the will, ability, and courage to act|Michael K. Stone&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone/[[Center for Ecoliteracy]], Smart by Nature: Schooling for Sustainability, Watershed Media (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With an understanding of ecological literacy, [[perceptions]] naturally shift. The need to protect the ecosystems is not simply a belief held by [[environmentalist]]s; it is a biological imperative for survival over the time. This [[Value (ethics)|value]] will become a basic principle for prioritizing thought and action in a sustainable society. In the face of the increasing capacity of industrial systems to destroy habitats and the [[climate system]], the explicit declaration of the principles of ecological literacy – and the resulting awareness of the importance of living within the ecological [[carrying capacity]] of the earth, is increasingly necessary. Whether ecoliteracy can address the infamous [[value-action gap]] is unclear.

Ecosystem Functional Types &lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt; are defined as groups of [[ecosystems]] or patches of the land surface that share similar dynamics of matter and energy exchanges between the [[Environment (biophysical)|biota and the physical environment]]. The EFT concept is analogous to the [[Plant functional type|Plant Functional Types]] (PFTs) concept, but defined at a higher level of the [[biological organization]]. As plant species can be grouped according to common functional characteristics, ecosystems can be grouped according to their common functional behavior.

One of the most used approaches to implement this concept has been the identification of EFTs from the satellite-derived dynamics of [[primary production]],&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt; an essential and integrative descriptor of ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Virginia|title=Principles of ecosystem function.

== History ==

In 1992, Soriano and Paruelo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Soriano|author2=Paruelo|last-author-amp=yes|title=Biozones: vegetation units defined by functional characters identifiable with the aid of satellite sensor images.|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters|date=1992|pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the concept of Biozones to identify vegetation units that share ecosystem functional characteristics using [[time-series]] of satellite images of spectral vegetation indices. Biozones were later renamed to EFTs by Paruelo et al. (2001),&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt; using an equivalent definition and methodology.

Shugart (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shugart|first1=H.H.|title=Plant and ecosystem functional types. Plant functional types: their relevance to ecosystem properties and global change (ed. by T.M. Smith, H.H. Shugart and F.I. Woodward),|journal=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=20–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first authors that used the term EFT as “aggregated components of ecosystems whose interactions with one another and with the environment produce differences in patterns of ecosystem structure and dynamics”. Walker (1997) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=B.H.|title=Functional types in non-equilibrium ecosystems. Plant functional types: their relevance to ecosystem properties and global change (ed. by T.M. Smith, H.H. Shugart and F.I. Woodward)|journal=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=91–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the use of a similar term, vegetation functional types, for groups of PFTs in sets that constitute the different states of [[ecological succession|vegetation succession]] in non-equilibrium ecosystems. The same term was applied by Scholes et al. (1997) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scholes|title=Plant functional types in African savannas and grasslands.

== EFTs identification ==

The functional classification of EFTs developed by Paruelo et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt; and Alcaraz-Segura et al. (2006, 2013)  &lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2013"/&gt; uses time series of spectral vegetation indexes to capture the carbon gains dynamics, the most integrative indicator of ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; To build EFTs, these authors derive three descriptors or metrics from the seasonal dynamics (annual curve) of spectral vegetation indexes (VI) that capture most of the variance in the time series (Fig.2):&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2013"/&gt; [[File:AnualDynamics EVI 3vars.png|Fig.2: Annual curve of spectral vegetation indexes (VI: Enhanced Vegetation Index (MODIS-EVI)|thumbnail|350px]]

* Annual mean of VI (VI_Mean): estimator of annual [[primary production]], one of the most essential and integrative descriptors of ecosystem functioning. 
* Intra-annual coefficient of variation of VI (VI_sCV): descriptor of [[seasonality]] or differences in carbon gains between the growing and non growing seasons.
* Date of maximum VI value (VI_DMAX): [[Phenology|phenological]] indicator of when in the year does the growing season take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pettorelli|title=Using the satellite-derived NDVI to assess ecological responses to environmental change.|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=2005|volume=20|pages=503–510|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alcaraz-Segura|title=Baseline characterization of major Iberian vegetation types based on the NDVI dynamics.|journal=Plant Ecology|date=2009|volume=202|pages=13–29|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1007/s11258-008-9555-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of values of each VI metric is divided into four intervals, giving the potential number of 4x4x4=64 EFTs. Each EFT is assigned a code of two letters and a number (three characters). The first letter of the code (capital) corresponds to the VI_Mean level, ranging from A to D for low to high (increasing) VI_Mean or productivity. The second letter (small) shows the seasonal CV, ranging from a to d for high (decreasing) to low VI_sCV or seasonality. The numbers refer to DMAX or phenology and indicate the season of maximum VI (1–4: spring, summer, autumn and winter).

'''Energetics''' (also called '''energy economics''') is the study of energy under [[energy transformation|transformation]]. Because energy flows at all scales, from the [[quantum physics|quantum]] level to the [[biosphere]] and [[cosmos]], energetics is a very broad discipline, encompassing for example [[thermodynamics]], [[chemistry]], [[Biological thermodynamics|biological energetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[ecological energetics]]. Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a topic of constant debate. For example, Lehninger (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;21) contended that when the science of thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges of all types, it can be called energetics.

==Aims==
In general, energetics is concerned with defining relationships to describe the tendencies of [[energy transfer|energy flows]] and [[energy storage|storages]] under transformation, defined here as phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations. When some critical number of people have observed such invariance, such a principle is usually then given the status of a '[[Physical law|fundamental law]]' of science. As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition. The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental [[laws of thermodynamics]] can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p.&amp;nbsp;432). By continuing to more accurately describe these laws, energetics aims to produce reliable predictions about energy flow and storage transformations at any scale.

==History==
Energetics has a controversial history. Some authors maintain that the its origins may be found in the work of the ancient Greeks, but that the mathematical formalisation began with the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. [[Richard de Villamil]] (1928) said that [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] formulated the science of energetics in his paper ''Outlines of the Science of Energetics'' published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1855. W. Ostwald and E. Mach subsequently developed the study, and by the late 1800s energetics was understood to be incompatible with the atomic view of the atom forwarded by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s gas theory. Proof of the atom settled the dispute but not without significant damage. In the 1920s [[Lotka]] attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of [[Howard T. Odum]].

De Villamil attempted to clarify the scope of energetics with respect to other branches of physics by positing a system that divides [[mechanics]] into two branches; energetics (the science of [[energy]]), and "pure", "abstract" or "rigid" [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the science of [[momentum]]). According to Villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised by scalar equations, and rigid dynamics by vector equations. In this division the dimensions for dynamics are ''space'', time and mass, and for energetics, ''length'', time and mass (Villamil 1928, p.&amp;nbsp;9). This division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of bodies, e.g.:

# Are the particles comprising the system rigidly fixed together?
# Is there any machinery for stopping moving bodies?

In Villamil's classification system, dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2, whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2. Therefore, in Villamil's system, dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate, and consequently must all be at zero kelvin. The [[conservation of momentum]] is a consequence of this view, however it is considered valid only in logic and not to be a true representation of the facts (Villamil, p.&amp;nbsp;96). In contrast energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together, and thus are free to vibrate, and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures.

==Theories==
[[Image:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ecological analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an [[ecosystem]]]]
As a general statement of energy flows under transformation, the principles of energetics include the first four [[laws of thermodynamics]] which seek a rigorous description. However the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate. If the ecologist [[Howard T. Odum]] was right, the principles of energetics take into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms, which aims to account for the concept of [[energy quality]], and the evolution of the universe. [[Albert Lehninger]] (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;2) called these hierarchical orderings the

{{quote|... successive stages in the flow of energy through the biological macrocosm}}

Odum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take [[Energy quality#Ranking_energy_quality|energy hierarchy]] into account. The first four principles of energetics are related to the same numbered laws of [[thermodynamics]], and are expanded upon in that article.

An '''entitlement''' is a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] made in accordance with a [[law|legal framework]] of a society. Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of [[principle]] ("[[rights]]") which are themselves based in concepts of [[social equality]] or [[enfranchisement]]. In recent decades the meaning of the word has been extended to encompass informal expectations of social relationships, social conventions and [[social norms]] which are considered unreasonable or unduly prescriptive upon others{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Psychology ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg, ''Advances in Self-Psychology'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ronningstam, ''Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or [[narcissistic injury]]; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy]] distinguished in adult life between (ethically) ''earning'' entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The gambler may feel ''entitled'' to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis''. (London 1946) p. 372 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflated sense of what is sometimes called ''psychological entitlement''&lt;ref&gt;L. Ashner, ''When is Enough, Enough?'' (1997) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; - unrealistic, [[exaggerated]], or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists.  According to the [[DSM-5]], individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) are likely to have a "sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)|location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–672|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=18 Nov 2014|accessdate=29 Apr 2016|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/con-20025568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], the [[narcissistic]] personality attempts to protect the [[vulnerable self]] by building layers of [[grandiosity]] and a huge sense of entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Farrell, ''Acts of Trust'' (2010) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5563">'''Estampage''' or stamping, is a term commonly used in [[epigraphy]] to obtain the exact replica of an inscription that cannot be transported.

According to Jayanti Madhukar,&lt;ref name="jayanti_hindu_blr_2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/society/what-do-the-inscription-stones-of-bengaluru-say/article21670654.ece|title=What do the inscription stones of Bengaluru say?|last=Madhukar|first=Jayanthi|date=2017-12-16|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is defined as: {{Quote

}}

== Etymology ==
According to T.S. Ravishankar, former director of the Epigraphy branch of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI), Estampage is a purely Indian term used by [[Epigraphist]]s.&lt;ref name="jayanti_hindu_blr_2017"/&gt;
However, a more linguistically correct explanation would be that it originated from the French word [[:wikt:fr:estampage|estampage]] (by itself of Proto-Germanic etymology) that literally means 'stamping' and in practice, can mean either of the two processes, namely industrial stamping of steel ([[forging]]) or the artistic stamping of various materials. The latter meaning seems to be have been adopted into epigraphy.

== Process of estampage ==
Estampage is typically obtained by pressing wet paper on to the rock face, over which any ink material (usually, coal or [[India ink|Indian ink]]) is wiped.&lt;ref name="Springer_ACCV14_process"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aswatha|first=Shashaank M.|last2=Talla|first2=Ananth Nath|last3=Mukhopadhyay|first3=Jayanta|last4=Bhowmick|first4=Partha|date=2014-11-01|title=A Method for Extracting Text from Stone Inscriptions Using Character Spotting|journal=Computer Vision - ACCV 2014 Workshops|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=598–611|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16631-5_44|isbn=9783319166308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An representative procedure&lt;ref name="Springer_ACCV14_process"/&gt; is listed below: 
* Soak a brush in water
* Clean the surface of the stone (that holds the inscription) using the brush.
* Carpet the stone surface using a large piece of wet paper (or layers of paper)
* Pat the wet paper(s) gently, using a [[dabber]] made of soft material. 
* Use Indian ink (usually black-colored) to smear the paper with the dabber, in order to get the impression of the surface. 
* Allow the paper to dry on the stone surface. 
* When the paper becomes dry, take it off slowly.
* Observe and verify the ink impression (estampage) emerging as white-colored letters (grooves of the characters) against the dark (black) background.

Epigraphers usually take a long time (days to weeks) to post-process the generated estampages, as they try to decipher, analyze, transliterate and translate the inscribed text.

== Usage ==
Within India, estampages have been made for numerous items and inscriptions of archaeological significance.&lt;ref name="book_indian_epigraphy"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy : a Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages.|last=1948-|first=Salomon, Richard|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195356663|location=New York|oclc=466425560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnarch.gov.in/epi.htm|title=EPIGRAPHY - ARCHAEOLOGY|website=www.tnarch.gov.in|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of them include:
* [[Edicts of Ashoka]] and [[Edicts of Ashoka#Estampages of Girnar Edicts|Estampages of Girnar Edicts]] in particular
* [[Madho Sarup Vats]]
* Works by [[Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department]]

== Museums and displays ==
In 2016, the epigraphy branch of the ASI Southern Zone opened a new, permanent museum and exhibition of estampages  named ''Eugen Julius Theodor Hultzsch Memorial Museum and Epigraphical Photo Exhibition'' at the historic [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] at [[Chennai]], South India. This museum is named after [[E. Hultzsch]], a German epigraphist and [[Indology|Indologist]], renowned for understanding and deciphering the ancient inscriptions of Ashoka as part of his 159th birthday celebrations.&lt;ref name="thehindu_museum_chennai"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/asi-opens-museum-of-estampages-from-across-india/article8407198.ece|title=ASI opens museum of estampages from across India|last=Swaminathan|first=T. s Atul|date=2016-03-29|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eureka!''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[educational]] [[television series]] which was produced and broadcast by [[TVOntario]] in 1980 and 1981. The series was narrated by [[Billy Van]], and featured a series of [[animated]] vignettes which taught [[physics]] lessons to children. It is currently available online.

==Synopsis==

Eureka! is a series of animated shorts that illustrate concepts in physics. Each program takes a simple and direct approach to the subject matter; while the basic concepts are explained in a voice-over, cartoon characters and a variety of animated objects demonstrate the principles on the screen. Constant review and reinforcement make the message clear; as a result, the study of physics becomes easy and accessible - even to viewers without a solid background in the subject. Basic formulae and concepts are introduced with a recap of what was learnt in the previous episode to build knowledge on a topic and create connections.

The '''Federal Desktop Core Configuration''' is a list of [[Computer security|security]] settings recommended by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] for general-purpose [[microcomputers]] that are connected directly to the network of a [[List of United States federal agencies|United States government agency]].

The FDCC is a list of agreed upon Microsoft Windows operating system common core system functions, applications, files, and services that are changed in their configuration around which a framework for a more secure, and security-reliable MS Windows operating system was created. The standards were then made mandatory for every federal government computer effective Feb 1, 2008. If you wanted to connect to a federal office computer network your system had to meet or exceed the FDCC standard or you were denied access.

FDCC applied only to [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista|Vista]] desktop and laptop computers and was replaced by the [[United States Government Configuration Baseline]] (USGCB), which included settings for Windows 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

For Windows 7, the NIST changed the naming convention to the US Government Computer Baseline (USGCB ver 2.0). In addition to un-classifying a general Windows settings guide, the NIST also publishes guides specifically for Windows Firewall, Internet Explorer, and a guide (Vista-Energy, for example) created to capture settings that adhere to energy conservation policies.

==History==
On 20 March 2007 the [[Office of Management and Budget]] issued a memorandum instructing United States government agencies to develop plans for using the Microsoft Windows XP and Vista security configurations.&lt;ref name="faq13"&gt;{{Cite web

The FDCC baseline was developed (and is maintained) by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in collaboration with [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]], [[United States Department of the Interior|DOI]], [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]], [[National Security Agency|NSA]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref name="EvansMemo" /&gt; with input from [[Notice of proposed rulemaking|public comment]].&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; It applies to Windows XP Professional and Vista  systems only&amp;mdash;these security policies are not tested (and according to the NIST, will not work) on Windows 9''x''/ME/NT/2000 or Windows Server 2003.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt;

Major Version 1.1 (released 31 October 2008) had no new or changed settings, but expanded SCAP reporting options.&lt;ref name="download" /&gt; As with all previous versions, the standard is applicable to general-purpose workstations and laptops for [[End-user (computer science)|end user]]s. Windows XP and Vista systems in use as servers are exempt from this standard. Also exempt are [[Embedded system|embedded computer]]s and "special purpose" systems (defined as specialized [[Computational science|scientific]], [[Health informatics|medical]], [[Programmable logic controller|process control]], and experimental systems), though {{abbr|NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology}} still recommends that FDCC security configuration be considered "where feasible and appropriate".&lt;ref name="faq1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/fdcc_faqs_20080128.cfm#q1|title=F D C C Additional NIST Frequently Asked Questions &amp;ndash; Is FDCC applicable to special purpose (e.g., scientific, medical, process control, and experimental systems) computers?|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|work=National Vulnerability Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDCC settings, generally speaking, block open connections in operating systems, disables functions, disables rarely used applications in the SOHO environment, disables unnecessary services, changes permissions on items, changes the way log files are collected and recorded, affects Group Policy Object (GPO) settings, and alters entries in the Windows system registry.

InfoWeek introduced the FDCC to mostly administrators and engineers with the article titled ‘The Feds Don’t Allow It. Should You?’ written by Kelly Jackson Higgins of DarkReading.com and published on February 4, 2008.

Due to the complexity of the guidelines response initially was slow. Implementation took time while the settings were internally researched by both government and enterprise implementation techs. The NIST and the NSA published guidelines in hundreds-of-page texts and introduced what they called SCAP files for applications. (See Wikipedia SCAP page)

The Windows platform was built for easy interoperability and networking and therefore left opportunities within the operating systems for all types of auto- and semi-automatic connections to other computers.  These weren’t flaws or programming mistakes, it was purposefully built that way. An example of this can be found by looking at the Windows Remote Connection program which is ''enabled by default'' after a typical Windows operating system installation.  The FDCC/USGCB configuration, for instance, reverses that setting so that you have to manually re-enable to allow remote connections.

==Requirements==
Organizations required to document FDCC [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] can do so by using [[Security Content Automation Protocol|SCAP]] tools.

There are 600+ settings in the average FDCC/USGCB document – but not all of them are usable for the average small or home office (SOHO) computer. For instance, released on 20 June 2008, FDCC Major Version 1.0 specifies 674 settings.&lt;ref name="download"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=F D C C download page
 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/download_fdcc.cfm
 |work=National Vulnerability Database
 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "all wireless interfaces should be disabled".&lt;ref name="faq10"&gt;{{Cite web
 |title=F D C C Additional NIST Frequently Asked Questions &amp;ndash; Are there any conditions under which wireless is allowed?
 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/fdcc_faqs_20080128.cfm#q10
 |work=National Vulnerability Database
 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition that not all recommended settings will be practical for every system, exceptions (such as "authorized enterprise wireless networks") can be made if documented in an FDCC deviation report.&lt;ref name="EvansMemo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="faq10" /&gt;

Strict implementation of all of the recommended settings has been known to cause usability issues. The NIST publishes a list of known issues and it can be found here (&lt;nowiki&gt;https://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/microsoft_content.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  There are a few third-party software vendors that have emerged that claim to have tested settings in a SOHO environment however, at this time, the general public still remains relatively unaware of the FDCC and USGCB security settings developed and put forward by the NIST.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6111">'''Gene trapping''' is a [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput]] approach that is used to introduce insertional [[mutations]] across the [[mammalian]] genome.

== Method ==
Trapping is performed with gene trap vectors whose principal element is a gene trapping cassette consisting of a promoterless reporter gene and/or selectable [[genetic marker]], flanked by an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor; SA) and a downstream [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al termination sequence ([[polyadenylation]] sequence; polyA).

When inserted into an [[intron]] of an expressed gene, the gene trap cassette is transcribed from the endogenous promoter of that gene in the form of a fusion transcript in which the exon(s) upstream of the insertion site is spliced in frame to the reporter/selectable marker gene. Since transcription is terminated prematurely at the inserted polyadenylation site, the processed fusion transcript encodes a truncated and nonfunctional version of the cellular [[protein]] and the reporter/selectable marker. Thus, gene traps simultaneously inactivate and report the expression of the trapped gene at the insertion site, and provide a [[DNA]] tag (gene trap sequence tag, GTST) for the rapid identification of the disrupted [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S|last1=De-Zolt|first2=F|last2= Schnutgen|display-authors=etal|date=2006|title=High-throughput trapping of secretory pathway genes in mouse embryonic stem cells|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=34|issue=3|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
The International Gene Trap Consortium is centralizing the data and supplies modified cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genetrap.org/|title=IGTC, International Gene Trap Consortium|website=www.genetrap.org|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within Africa and India this effect can be seen, as the nations farthest from the equator are wealthier.  In Africa, the wealthiest nations are the three on the southern tip of the continent, [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], and [[Namibia]], and the countries of [[North Africa]].  Similarly, in South America, [[Argentina]], [[Southern Brazil]], [[Chile]], and [[Uruguay]] have long been the wealthiest.

Within prosperous nations, wealth often increases with distance from the equator; for example, the [[Northeast United States]] has long been wealthier than its southern counterpart and northern [[Italy]] wealthier than southern regions of the country.
[[Image:GDP per capita (nominal) 2015.png|thumb|right|[[Gross domestic product]] ([[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] per capita) in 2015]]

Researchers at [[Harvard]]'s Center for International Development found in 2001 that only three tropical economies — [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and part of [[Taiwan]] — were classified as high-income by the [[World Bank]], while all countries within regions zoned as [[temperate]] had either middle- or high-income economies .&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/Location/  Location, Location, Location]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions. For example, [[Russia]] is not as well off as the United States or even [[Australia]]; the latter is wealthier than Southern Europe. Also, within Russia, [[Moscow]] and especially [[St. Petersburg]] are wealthier than, for example, [[Siberia]]. Similarly, [[Germany]]'s poorest regions are situated in the North East. The wealthiest nations of Central America are generally those closest to the equator, namely Panama and Costa Rica, and Mongolia is poorer than China. Also, mainland United States is richer than Alaska and Canada. In Canada, the poorest region is in the North. In China, the poorest regions are in the West and the North East. And in southeast Asia, the richest nations are [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], straddling the equator.

==Measurement==

Most of the recent studies use national [[gross domestic product]] per person, as measured by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], as the unit of comparison. Intra-national comparisons use their own data, and political divisions such as states or provinces then delineate the study areas.

==Explanations==

===Historic===
One of the first to describe and assess the phenomenon was the [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], who asserted in the 18th century that "cold air constringes (''sic'') the extremities of the external fibres of the body; this increases their elasticity, and favours the return of the blood from the extreme parts to the heart. It contracts those very fibres; consequently it also increases their force. On the contrary, warm air relaxes and lengthens the extremes of the fibres; of course it diminishes their force and elasticity. People are therefore more vigorous in cold climates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_14.htm Montesquieu "Of Laws in Relation to the Nature of the Climate"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century historian [[Henry Thomas Buckle]] wrote that "climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary causes of intellectual progress--the first three indirectly, through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth, and the last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of thought, the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are small and feeble."

===Cultural innovation===

Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] was inspired to write his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning work ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' by a question posed by [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[New Guinea]]n politician: why were Europeans so much wealthier than his people? In this book, Diamond argues that the [[Europe]]-[[Asia]] land mass is particularly favorable for the transition of societies from [[hunter-gatherer]] to farming communities. This continent stretches much further along the same lines of latitude than any of the other continents. Since it is much easier to transfer a domesticated species along the same latitude than it is to move it to a warmer or colder climate, any species developed at a particular latitude will be transferred across the continent in a relatively short amount of time. Thus the inhabitants of the Eurasian continent have had a built-in advantage in terms of earlier development of farming, and a greater range of plants and animals from which to choose.

Diamond notes that modern technologies and institutions were designed primarily in a small area of northwestern Europe. After the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe in the 16th century, the quality of life increased and wealth began to spread to the middle class. This included agricultural techniques, machines, and medicines.  These technologies and models readily spread to areas colonized by Europe which happened to be of similar climate, such as North America and Australia.  As these areas also became centres of innovation, this bias was further enhanced. Technologies from automobiles to power lines are more often designed for colder and drier regions, since most of their customers are from these regions.

The book goes on to document a [[feedback]] effect of technologies being designed for the wealthy, which makes them more wealthy and thus more able to fund technological development.  He notes that the far north has not always been the wealthiest latitude; until only a few centuries ago, the wealthiest belt stretched from Southern Europe through the [[Middle East]], northern [[India]] and southern [[China]].  A dramatic shift in technologies, beginning with ocean-going ships and culminating in the [[Industrial Revolution]], saw the most developed belt move north into northern Europe, China, and the Americas.  Northern Russia became a [[superpower]], while southern [[India]] became impoverished and colonized.  Diamond argues that such dramatic changes demonstrate that the current distribution of wealth is not due to immutable factors such as climate or [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], citing the early emergence of [[agriculture]] in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] as evidence.

Diamond also notes the feedback effect in the growth of medical technology, stating that more research money goes into curing the ailments of northerners.

===Disease===

[[Tick]]s, [[mosquito]]s, and [[rat]]s, which continue to be important disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], benefit from warmer temperatures and higher humidities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/372219.stm Sci/Tech:Global warming disease warning]&lt;/ref&gt; There has long been a [[malaria|malarial belt]] spanning the equatorial portions of the [[globe]]; the disease is especially deadly to children under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/impact/statistics.htm Centers for Disease Control: Statistics and Malaria's Public Health Impact]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably it has been almost impossible for most forms of northern [[livestock]] to thrive due to the [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] presence of the [[tsetse fly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/Fulldocs/Inagura/Impact.htm The Impact and Implementation of Theileriosis and Trypanosomyasis on Livestock Production in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jared Diamond has linked domestication of animals in Europe and Asia to the development of diseases that enabled these countries to conquer the inhabitants of other continents. The close association of people in Eurasia with their domesticated animals provided a vector for the rapid transmission of diseases. Inhabitants of lands with few domesticated species were never exposed to the same range of diseases, and so, at least on the American continents, succumbed to diseases introduced from Eurasia. These effects were exhaustively discussed in [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill's]] book ''Plagues and Peoples''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldhistoryconnected.press.uiuc.edu/3.1/br_whelchel.html World History Connected: Review of ''Plagues and Peoples'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 Harvard study mentions high [[infant mortality]] as another factor; since birth rates usually increase in compensation, women may delay their entry into the workforce to care for their younger children. The education of the surviving children then becomes difficult, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.

*In "Climate and Scale in Economic Growth," William A. Masters and Margaret S. McMillan of [[Purdue University]] and [[Tufts University]] hypothesize that the disparity is partially due to the effects of frost in increasing soil [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/CID/cidwp/048.pdf Climate and Scale in Economic Growth]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hernando Zuleta, of the [[Universidad del Rosario]], has proposed that where output fluctuations are more profound, i.e. areas that experience winter, saving is more pronounced, which leads to the adoption or creation of capital-intensive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=901794 Seasons, Savings, and Gdp]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A.

==Impact of global warming on wealth==

In a 2006 paper discussing the potential impact of [[global warming]] on wealth, John K.

The '''history of geography''' includes many [[history|histories]] of [[geography]] which have differed over time and between different cultural and political groups.  In more recent developments, geography has become a distinct academic discipline. 'Geography' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|γεωγραφία}} – ''geographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=geography |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a literal translation of which would be "''to describe or write about the Earth''". The first person to use the word "geography" was [[Eratosthenes]] (276–194 BC). However, there is evidence for recognizable practices of geography, such as [[cartography]] (or map-making) prior to the use of the term geography.

==Egypt==

The known world of Ancient Egypt saw the Nile as the centre, and the world as based upon "the" river.  Various oases were known to the east and west, and were considered locations of various gods (e.g. [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]], for Amon)12 .  To the South lay the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]itic region, known as far as the 4th cataract.  [[Land of Punt|Punt]] was a region south along the shores of the Red Sea.  Various Asiatic peoples were known as Retenu, Kanaan, Que, Harranu, or Khatti ([[Hittites]]).  At various times especially in the Late Bronze Age Egyptians had diplomatic and trade relationships with [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]].  The Mediterranean was called "the Great Green" and was believed to be part of a world encircling ocean.  Europe was unknown although may have become part of the Egyptian world view in Phoenician times.  To the west of Asia lay the realms of [[Keftiu]], possibly [[Crete]], and Mycenae (thought to be part of a chain of islands, that joined Cyprus, Crete, Southern Italy, Sicily and later perhaps [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]] and the Balarics to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Montet, Pierre (2000), "Eternal Egypt" (Phoenix Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Babylon==

The oldest known world maps date back to ancient [[Babylon]] from the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A. Talbert 2009 147"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geography and Ethnography: Perceptions of the World in Pre-Modern Societies|author=Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A.

The accompanying text mentions seven outer regions beyond the encircling ocean. The descriptions of five of them have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Irving|last=Finel|title=A join to the map of the world: A notable discover|year=1995|pages=26–27|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the ''Imago Mundi'', an earlier Babylonian [[world map]] dating back to the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further north from the center of the world, though it is not certain what that center was supposed to represent.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A. Talbert 2009 147"/&gt;

==Greco-Roman world==
{{See also|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] saw the poet [[Homer]] as the founder of geography. His works the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' are works of literature, but both contain a great deal of geographical information. Homer describes a circular world ringed by a single massive ocean. The works show that the [[Greeks]] by the 8th century BC had considerable knowledge of the geography of the eastern Mediterranean. The poems contain a large number of place names and descriptions, but for many of these it is uncertain what real location, if any, is actually being referred to.

[[Thales]] of Miletus is one of the first known philosophers known to have wondered about the shape of the world. He proposed that the world was based on water, and that all things grew out of it. He also laid down many of the astronomical and mathematical rules that would allow geography to be studied scientifically. His successor [[Anaximander]] is the first person known to have attempted to create a scale map of the known world and to have introduced the [[gnomon]] to Ancient Greece.

[[File:Hecataeus world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Reconstruction of the map of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].]]
[[Hecataeus of Miletus]] initiated a different form of geography, avoiding the mathematical calculations of Thales and Anaximander he learnt about the world by gathering previous works and speaking to the sailors who came through the busy port of Miletus. From these accounts he wrote a detailed prose account of what was known of the world. A similar work, and one that mostly survives today, is [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''. While primarily a work of history, the book contains a wealth of geographic descriptions covering much of the known world. Egypt, Scythia, Persia, and Asia Minor are all described,&lt;ref&gt;James Rennell. The geographical system of Herodotus, examined and explained, by a comparison with those of other ancient authors and with modern geography. Bulmer, 1800. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LZIAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA672 p672]&lt;/ref&gt; including a mention of India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sfHsgNIZum0C The Ancient History of Herodotus] By Herodotus. p200. (cf., Asia is well inhabited; but from India eastward the whole country is one vast desert, unknown and unexplored).&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Africa as a whole are contentious,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of the British Empire. CUP Archive, 1963. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ISg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 p56]&lt;/ref&gt; with Herodotus describing the land surrounded by a sea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/dieumsegelungafr00ml Die Umsegelung Afrikas] durch phönizische Schiffer ums Jahr 600 v. Chr. Geb (1800)&lt;/ref&gt; Though, historically the Indian sea was thought of an inland sea which was that round of the southern part of Africa is surrounded by the eastern part of Asia by connecting land, which inference only after the circumnavigation of Africa by [[Vasco da Gama]] was abandoned by the western cartographers of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Die umsegelung Asiens und Europas auf der Vega. Volume 2. By Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-SfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA148 p148]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, though, hold that the descriptions of areas such as India are mostly imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical thought. By Lalita Rana. Concept Publishing Company, 2008. p6&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Herodotus made important observations about geography. He is the first to have noted the process by which large rivers, such as the Nile, build up [[River delta|deltas]], and is also the first recorded as observing that winds tend to blow from colder regions to warmer ones.

[[Pythagoras]] was perhaps the first to propose a spherical world, arguing that the sphere was the most perfect form. This idea was embraced by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] presented empirical evidence to verify this. He noted that the Earth's shadow during an eclipse is curved, and also that stars increase in height as one moves north. [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] used the idea of a sphere to explain how the sun created differing climatic zones based on latitude. This led the Greeks to believe in a division of the world into five regions. At each of the poles was an uncharitably cold region. While extrapolating from the heat of the Sahara it was deduced that the area around the equator was unbearably hot. Between these extreme regions both the northern and southern hemispheres had a temperate belt suitable for human habitation.

===Hellenistic period===
These theories clashed with the evidence of explorers, however, [[Hanno the Navigator]] had traveled as far south as [[Sierra Leone]], and it is possible other Phoenicians had circumnavigated Africa{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. In the 4th century BC the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] traveled through northeast Europe, and circled the British Isles. He found that the region was considerably more habitable than theory expected, but his discoveries were largely dismissed by his contemporaries because of this. Conquerors also carried out exploration, for example, [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]] and [[Gallic Wars|Germany]], expeditions/invasions sent by [[Augustus]] to [[Arabia Felix]] and [[Axum|Ethiopia]] ([[Res Gestae]] 26), and perhaps the greatest Ancient Greek explorer of all, [[Alexander the Great]], who deliberately set out to learn more about the east through his military expeditions and so took a large number of geographers and writers with his army who recorded their observations as they moved east.

The ancient Greeks divided the world into three continents, Europe, Asia, and [[Libya]] (Africa). The [[Hellespont]] formed the border between Europe and Asia. The border between Asia and Libya was generally considered to be the Nile river, but some geographers, such as Herodotus objected to this. Herodotus argued that there was no difference between the people on the east and west sides of the Nile, and that the [[Red Sea]] was a better border. The relatively narrow habitable band was considered to run from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to an unknown sea somewhere east of India in the east. The southern portion of Africa was unknown, as was the northern portion of Europe and Asia, so it was believed that they were circled by a sea. These areas were generally considered uninhabitable.

The size of the Earth was an important question to the Ancient Greeks. [[Eratosthenes]] attempted to calculate its circumference by measuring the angle of the sun at two different locations. While his numbers were problematic, most of the errors cancelled themselves out and he got quite an accurate figure. Since the distance from the Atlantic to India was roughly known, this raised the important question of what was in the vast region east of Asia and to the west of Europe. [[Crates of Mallus]] proposed that there were in fact four inhabitable land masses, two in each hemisphere. In Rome a large globe was created depicting this world. That some of the figures Eratosthenes had used in his calculation were considerably in error became known, and [[Posidonius]] set out to get a more accurate measurement. This number actually was considerably smaller than the real one, but it became accepted that the eastern part of Asia was not a huge distance from Europe.

===Roman period===

[[File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|300px|A 15th-century depiction of the [[Ptolemy world map]], reconstituted from Ptolemy's ''Geographia'' (c. 150)]]

While the works of almost all earlier geographers have been lost, many of them are partially known through quotations found in [[Strabo]] (64/63 BC – ca. AD 24). Strabo's seventeen volume work of geography is almost completely extant, and is one of the most important sources of information on classical geography. Strabo accepted the narrow band of habitation theory, and rejected the accounts of Hanno and Pytheas as fables. None of Strabo's maps survive, but his detailed descriptions give a clear picture of the status of geographical knowledge of the time. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s (AD 23 – 79) [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] also has sections on geography. A century after Strabo [[Ptolemy]] (AD 90 – 168) launched a similar undertaking. By this time the Roman Empire had expanded through much of Europe, and previously unknown areas such as the British Isles had been explored. The [[Silk Road]] was also in operation, and for the first time knowledge of the far east began to be known. Ptolemy's ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' opens with a theoretical discussion about the nature and techniques of geographical inquiry, and then moves to detailed descriptions of much the known world. Ptolemy lists a huge number of cities, tribes, and sites and places them in the world. It is uncertain what Ptolemy's names correspond to in the modern world, and a vast amount of scholarship has gone into trying to link Ptolemaic descriptions to known locations.

It was the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] who made far more extensive practical use of geography and maps. The [[Roman roads|Roman transportation system]], consisting of 55,000 miles of roads, could not have been designed without the use of geographical systems of measurement and [[triangulation]]. The ''[[cursus publicus]]'', a department of the Roman government devoted to transportation, employed full-time ''[[gromatici]]'' ([[Construction surveying|surveyors]]). The surveyors’ job was to gather topographical information and then to determine the straightest possible route where a road might be built.

* Land surveyors determined the exact dimensions of a particular area such as a field, dividing the land into plots for distribution, or laying out the streets in a town.
* Cartographical surveyors made maps, involving finding latitudes, longitudes and elevations.
* Military surveyors were called upon to determine such information as the width of a river an army would need to cross.
* Engineering surveyors investigated terrain in order to prepare the way for roads, canals, aqueducts, tunnels and mines.

Around AD 400 a scroll map called the [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Peutinger Table]] was made of the known world, featuring the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] network. Besides the [[Roman Empire]] which at that time spanned from Britain to the Middle East and Africa, the map includes India, Sri Lanka and China. Cities are demarcated using hundreds of symbols. It measures 1.12&amp;nbsp;ft high and 22.15&amp;nbsp;ft long.
The tools and principles of geography used by the Romans would be closely followed with little practical improvement for the next 700 years.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Roman Roads&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==

A vast corpus of Indian texts embraced the study of geography. The [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]] contain elaborate descriptions of rivers and mountains and treat the relationship between physical and human elements.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Geography: Voice of Concern|author=Anu Kapur|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious scholar [[Diana Eck]], a notable feature of geography in India is its interweaving with Hindu mythology,&lt;ref name="eck2012india"&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: A Sacred Geography|author=Diana L. Eck|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;No matter where one goes in India, one will find a landscape in which mountains, rivers, forests, and villages are elaborately linked to the stories and gods of Indian culture. Every place in this vast country has its story; and conversely, every story of Hindu myth and legend has its place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ancient period===

The geographers of ancient India put forward theories regarding the origin of the earth. They theorized that the earth was formed by the solidification of gaseous matter and that the earth's crust is composed of hard rocks (sila), clay (bhumih) and sand (asma).&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geographical thought|author=Lalita Rana|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories were also propounded to explain earthquakes (bhukamp) and it was assumed that earth, air and water combined to cause earthquakes.&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical" /&gt; The [[Arthashastra]], a compendium by [[Kautilya]] (also known as [[Chanakya]]) contains a range of geographical and statistical information about the various regions of India.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; The composers of the [[Puranas]] divided the known world into seven continents of dwipas, Jambu Dwipa, Krauncha Dwipa, Kusha Dwipa, Plaksha Dwipa, Pushkara Dwipa, Shaka Dwipa and Shalmali Dwipa. Descriptions were provided for the climate and geography of each of the dwipas.&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical" /&gt;

===Early Medieval period===

The Vishnudharmottara Purana (compiled between 300-350 AD) contains six chapters on physical and human geography. The locational attributes of peoples and places, and various seasons are the topics of these chapters.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; [[Varahamihira]]'s Brihat-Samhita gave a thorough treatment of planetary movements, rainfall, clouds and the formation of water.&lt;ref name="rana2008geographical" /&gt;  The mathematician-astronomer [[Aryabhata]] gave a precise estimate of the earth's circumference in his treatise [[Āryabhaṭīya]].&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; Aryabhata accurately calculated the Earth's circumference as 24,835 miles, which was only 0.2% smaller than the actual value of 24,902 miles.

===Late Medieval period===
The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicles Tuzuk-i-Jehangiri, Ain-i-Akbari and Dastur-ul-aml contain detailed geographical narratives.&lt;ref name="kapur2002indian"/&gt; These were based on the earlier geographical works of India and the advances made by medieval [[Muslim]] geographers, particularly the work of [[Alberuni]].

This {{convert|3|ft}} squared map features a graduated scale of 100 [[Li (unit)|li]] for each rectangular grid. China's coastline and river systems are clearly defined and precisely pinpointed on the map. "Yu" refers to [[Yu the Great]], a Chinese deity and the author of the ''[[Yu Gong]]'', the geographic chapter of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', dating to the 5th century BC from whence this map is derived.]]
In China, the earliest known geographical Chinese writing dates back to the 5th century BC, during the beginning of the [[Warring States]] period (481 BC – 221 BC).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"/&gt; This work was the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' ('Tribute of Yu') chapter of the ''Shu Jing'' or ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which describes the traditional [[Nine Provinces (China)|nine provinces]] of ancient China, their kinds of soil, their characteristic products and economic goods, their tributary goods, their trades and vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and lakes listed and placed accordingly.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 500.&lt;/ref&gt; The nine provinces at the time of this geographical work were relatively small in size compared to those of modern China with the book's descriptions pertaining to areas of the [[Yellow River]], the lower valleys of the [[Yangtze]] and the plain between them as well as the Shandong peninsula and to the west the most northern parts of the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]]s along with the southern parts of modern-day [[Shanxi]] province.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"/&gt;

In this ancient geographical treatise, which would greatly influence later Chinese geographers and cartographers, the Chinese used the mythological figure of Yu the Great to describe the known earth (of the Chinese). Apart from the appearance of Yu, however, the work was devoid of magic, fantasy, Chinese folklore, or legend.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 501"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 501.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chinese geographical writing in the time of [[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] were of lesser quality and contained less systematic approach, this would change from the 3rd century onwards, as Chinese methods of documenting geography became more complex than those found in Europe, a state of affairs that would persist until the 13th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant maps found in archeological sites of China date to the 4th century BC and were made in the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]].&lt;ref name="hsu 90 93"&gt;Hsu, 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known reference to the application of a geometric grid and mathematically graduated scale to a map was contained in the writings of the cartographer [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 538–540.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1st century AD onwards, official Chinese historical texts contained a geographical section, which was often an enormous compilation of changes in place-names and local administrative divisions controlled by the ruling dynasty, descriptions of mountain ranges, river systems, taxable products, etc.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 508"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Chinese historian [[Ban Gu]] (32–92) most likely started the trend of the [[gazetteer]] in China, which became prominent in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period and [[Sui dynasty]].&lt;ref name="hsu 98"&gt;Hsu, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Local gazetteers would feature a wealth of geographic information, although its cartographic aspects were not as highly professional as the maps created by professional cartographers.&lt;ref name="hsu 98"/&gt;

From the time of the 5th century BC ''Shu Jing'' forward, Chinese geographical writing provided more concrete information and less legendary element. This example can be seen in the 4th chapter of the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (Book of the Master of Huainan), compiled under the editorship of Prince [[Liu An]] in 139 BC during the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC – 202 AD). The chapter gave general descriptions of [[topography]] in a systematic fashion, given visual aids by the use of maps (di tu) due to the efforts of Liu An and his associate Zuo Wu.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 507–508"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 507–508.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chang Chu]]'s ''Hua Yang Guo Chi'' (''Historical Geography of [[Szechuan]]'') of 347, not only rivers, trade routes, and various tribes were described, but it also wrote of a 'Ba Jun Tu Jing' ('Map of Szechuan'), which had been made much earlier in 150.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 517"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 517.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shui Jing'' (''Waterways Classic'') was written anonymously in the 3rd century during the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (attributed often to [[Guo Pu]]), and gave a description of some 137 rivers found throughout China.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 514"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 514.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, the book was expanded to forty times its original size by the geographers [[Li Daoyuan]], given the new title of ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' (''The Waterways Classic Commented'').&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 514"/&gt;

In later periods of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) and [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), there were much more systematic and professional approaches to geographic literature. The Song dynasty poet, scholar, and government official [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) wrote the geographical treatise known as the ''Gui Hai Yu Heng Chi''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 510.&lt;/ref&gt; It focused primarily on the [[topography]] of the land, along with the agricultural, economic and commercial products of each region in China's southern provinces.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 510"/&gt; The [[polymath]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) devoted a significant amount of his written work to geography, as well as a hypothesis of land formation ([[geomorphology]]) due to the evidence of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]]s found far inland, along with [[bamboo]] fossils found underground in a region far from where bamboo was suitable to grow. The 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty]] geographer [[Na-xin]] wrote a treatise of archeological topography of all the regions north of the Yellow River, in his book ''He Shuo Fang Gu Ji''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"/&gt; The Ming dynasty geographer [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) traveled throughout the provinces of China (often on foot) to write his enormous geographical and topographical treatise, documenting various details of his travels, such as the locations of small gorges, or [[mineral]] beds such as [[mica]] schists.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Xu's work was largely systematic, providing accurate details of measurement, and his work (translated later by Ding Wenjiang) read more like a 20th-century field surveyor than an early 17th-century scholar.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 524"/&gt;

The Chinese were also concerned with documenting geographical information of foreign regions far outside of China. Although Chinese had been writing of civilizations of the Middle East, India, and Central Asia since the traveler [[Zhang Qian]] (2nd century BC), later Chinese would provide more concrete and valid information on the topography and geographical aspects of foreign regions. The [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) Chinese diplomat [[Wang Xuance]] traveled to [[Magadha]] (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book ''Zhang Tian-zhu Guo Tu'' (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese geographers such as [[Jia Dan]] (730–805) wrote accurate descriptions of places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, he described the sea route going into the mouth of the [[Persian Gulf]], and that the medieval [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]s (whom he called the people of the Luo-He-Yi country, i.e. [[Persia]]) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as [[lighthouse]] beacons for ships that might go astray.&lt;ref name="Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 661"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 661.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as [[al-Mas'udi]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]]. The later Song dynasty ambassador Xu Jing wrote his accounts of voyage and travel throughout [[Korea]] in his work of 1124, the ''Xuan-He Feng Shi Gao Li Tu Jing'' (''Illustrated Record of an Embassy to Korea in the Xuan-He Reign Period'').&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"/&gt; The geography of medieval [[Cambodia]] (the [[Khmer Empire]]) was documented in the book ''Zhen-La Feng Tu Ji'' of 1297, written by [[Zhou Daguan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 511"/&gt;

==Middle Ages==

===Byzantine Empire and Syria===
After the fall of the western [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], ruled from [[Constantinople]] and known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], continued to thrive and produced several noteworthy geographers. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (6th century) was a grammarian at [[Constantinople]] and authored the important [[Gazetteer|geographical dictionary]] ''Ethnica''.  This work is of enormous value, providing well-referenced geographical and other information about [[ancient Greece]].

The geographer [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] (6th century) authored the ''[[Synecdemus]]''  (prior to AD 535) in which he provides a table of administrative divisions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and lists the cities in each. The ''Synecdemus'' and the ''Ethnica'' were the principal sources of [[Constantine VII]]'s work on the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Themes]] or divisions of [[Byzantium]], and are the primary sources we have today on [[political geography]] of the sixth-century East.

George of Cyprus is known for his ''Descriptio orbis Romani'' ''(Description of the Roman world)'', written in the decade 600–610.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DonnerEgypt.html |title=Article: The Representation of Lower Egypt (by Herbert Donner)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929012106/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/DonnerEgypt.html |archive-date=2013-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with Italy and progressing counterclockwise including [[Africa]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Diocese of the East|western Middle East]], George lists cities, towns, fortresses and administrative divisions of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire]].

===Islamic world===
{{Main article|Geography and cartography in medieval Islam}}

In the latter 7th century, adherents of the new religion of [[Islam]] surged northward out of [[Arabia]] taking over lands in which [[Jews]], [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[Christian]]s and [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] had been established for centuries. There, carefully preserved in the monasteries and libraries, they discovered the [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek classics]] which included great works of geography by Egyptian [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' and ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', along with the geographical wisdom of the [[China|Chinese]] and the [[Roman Architecture|great accomplishments]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]], who spoke only [[Arabic language|Arabic]], employed [[Christians]] and [[Jews]] to [[Translation Movement|translate]] these and many other manuscripts into Arabic.

The primary geographical scholarship of this era occurred in [[Iran|Persia]], today’s [[Iran]], in the great learning center the [[House of Wisdom]] at [[Baghdad]], today's [[Iraq]]. Early caliphs did not follow orthodoxy and so they encouraged scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Young, M. J. L., J. D. Latham and R. B.

[[Persian people|Persians]] who wrote on geography or created maps during the Middle Ages included:
	
* [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber or Jabir) (721– c. 815) Wrote extensively on many subjects, expanded on the wisdom of the Greek classics and engaged in experimentation in natural science. It is unclear whether he was Persian or Syrian.&lt;ref&gt;S.N. Nasr, "Life Sciences, Alchemy and Medicine", The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge, Volume 4, 1975, p. 412: "Jabir is entitled in the traditional sources as al-Azdi, al-Kufi, al-Tusi, al-Sufi. There is a debate as to whether he was a Persian from Khorasan who later went to Kufa or whether he was, as some have suggested, of Syrian origin and later lived in Iran".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]] (780–850) wrote ''The Image of the Earth'' (''Kitab surat al-ard''), in which he used the [[Geography (Ptolemy)]] of [[Ptolemy]] but improved upon his values for the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].
* [[Ibn Khurdadhbih]] (820–912) authored a book of administrative geography ''Book of the Routes and Provinces'' (''Kitab al-masalik wa’l-mamalik''), which is the earliest surviving Arabic work of its kind. He made the first quadratic scheme map of four sectors.
* Sohrab or Sorkhab&lt;ref&gt;[[Alhazen#Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; (died 930) wrote ''Marvels of the Seven Climes to the End of Habitation'' describing and illustrating a rectangular grid of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] to produce a world map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6XPcfjA1pIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=suhrab+rectangular+map+geography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N54sIUb431&amp;sig=XWqWGeMY8VaomZIM07Lja8x5_6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q54GUtajOYbR2wXL44HwBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=suhrab%20rectangular%20map%20geography&amp;f=false Cartography in Antiquity and the Middle Ages: Fresh Perspectives, New Methods] p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brentjes, S.

*  [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi|Al-Balkhi]] (850–934)  founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]].
* [[Estakhri|Al-Istakhri]] (died 957) compiled the ''Book of the Routes of States,'' (''Kitab Masalik al-Mamalik'') from personal observations and literary sources
* [[Al-Biruni]] (973–1052) described polar equi-[[azimuthal equidistant projection]] of the [[celestial sphere]].
* [[Abu Nasr Mansur]] (960–1036) known for his work with the spherical [[Law of sines|sine law]]. Wrote ''Book of Azimuths'' which is no longer extant.
* [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) wrote on earth sciences in his ''Book of Healing''.
*  [[Ibn al-Faqih]] (10th century) wrote ''Concise Book of Lands'' (''Mukhtasar Kitab al-Buldan'').
* [[Ibn Rustah]] (10th century) wrote a geographical compendium known as ''Book of Precious Records''.

Further details about some of these are given below:

In the early 10th century, [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Abū Zayd al-Balkhī]], a [[Persian people|Persian]] originally from [[Balkh]], founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]]. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.&lt;ref name = E61-3&gt;E. Edson and Emilie Savage-Smith, ''Medieval Views of the Cosmos'', pp. 61–3, Bodleian Library, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrāb, a late 10th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer, accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with [[equirectangular projection]] or cylindrical equidistant projection.&lt;ref name = E61-3/&gt; In the early 11th century, [[Avicenna]] hypothesized on the [[Geology|geological]] causes of [[mountain]]s in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027).

In mathematical geography, [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], around 1025, was the first to describe a polar equi-[[azimuthal equidistant projection]] of the [[celestial sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. King (1996), "Astronomy and Islamic society: Qibla, gnomics and timekeeping", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 1, pp. 128–184 [153]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping [[City|cities]] and measuring the distances between them, which he did for many cities in the [[Middle East]] and western [[Indian subcontinent]]. He combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations to record degrees of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] and to measure the heights of [[mountain]]s and depths of [[valley]]s, recorded in ''The Chronology of the Ancient Nations''. He discussed [[human geography]] and the [[planetary habitability]] of the [[Earth]], suggesting that roughly a quarter of the Earth's surface is habitable by [[human]]s. He solved a complex [[Geodesy|geodesic]] equation in order to accurately compute the [[Earth]]'s [[circumference]].&lt;ref&gt;James S. Aber (2003). Alberuni calculated the Earth's circumference at a small town of Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan.[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm Abu Rayhan al-Biruni], [[Emporia State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.9&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 16.8&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern value of 6,356.7&amp;nbsp;km.

By the early 12th century the [[Normans]] had overthrown the Arabs in [[Sicily]]. [[Palermo]] had become a crossroads for travelers and traders from many nations and the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] [[Roger II of Sicily|King Roger II]], having great interest in geography,  commissioned the creation of a book and map that would compile all this wealth of geographical information. Researchers were sent out and the collection of data took 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bagrow, Leo [https://books.google.com/books?id=OBeB4tDmJv8C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Tabula+Rogeriana+origins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uM0BUtHrBaWgyAHr94DwBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Tabula%20Rogeriana%20origins&amp;f=false History of Cartography] Original publication: Precedent Publications, Chicago, 1985, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Al-Idrisi]], one of few Arabs who had ever been to France and England as well as Spain, Central Asia and Constantinople, was employed to create the book from this mass of data. Utilizing the information inherited from the classical geographers, he created one of the most accurate maps of the world to date, the [[Tabula Rogeriana]] (1154). The map, written in Arabic, shows the [[Eurasia]]n continent in its entirety and the northern part of Africa.

An adherent of [[environmental determinism]] was the medieval [[Afro-Arab]] writer [[al-Jahiz]] (776–869), who explained how the environment can determine the physical characteristics of the inhabitants of a certain community. He used his early theory of [[evolution]] to explain the origins of different [[human skin color]]s, particularly [[Black people|black skin]], which he believed to be the result of the environment. He cited a stony region of black [[basalt]] in the northern [[Najd]] as evidence for his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Lawrence I. | year = 1982 | title = Taun and Waba: Conceptions of Plague and Pestilence in Early Islam | url = | journal = Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 268–307 [278] | doi=10.2307/3632188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Exploration of Asia}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], geographical knowledge in Europe regressed (though it is a popular misconception that they thought the world was flat), and the simple [[T and O map]] became the standard depiction of the world.

The trips of [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Marco Polo]] throughout Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Christian [[Crusade]]s of the 12th and 13th centuries, and the Portuguese and Spanish voyages of exploration during the 15th and 16th centuries opened up new horizons and stimulated geographic writings.
The [[Mongols]] also had wide-ranging knowledge of the geography of Europe and Asia, based in their governance and ruling of much of this area and used this information for the undertaking of large military expeditions. The evidence for this is found in historical resources such as The Secret History of Mongols and other Persian chronicles written in 13th and 14th centuries. For example, during the rule of the Great Yuan Dynasty a world map was created and is currently kept in South Korea. See also: [[Chinese geography#Maps of the Yuan Dynasty|Maps of the Yuan Dynasty]]

During the 15th century, [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal supported explorations of the African coast and became a leader in the promotion of geographic studies. Among the most notable accounts of voyages and discoveries published during the 16th century were those by [[Giambattista Ramusio]] in Venice, by [[Richard Hakluyt]] in England, and by [[Theodore de Bry]] in what is now Belgium.

Following the journeys of [[Marco Polo]], interest in geography spread throughout Europe. From around c. 1400, the writings of [[Ptolemy]] and his successors provided a systematic framework to tie together and portray geographical information. This framework was used by academics for centuries to come, the positives being the lead-up to the geographical enlightenment, however, women and indigenous writings were largely excluded from the discourse.
The European global conquests started in the early 15th century with the first Portuguese expeditions to Africa and India, as well as the conquest of America by Spain in 1492 and continued with a series of European naval expeditions across the Atlantic and later the Pacific and Russian expeditions to Siberia  until the 18th century.
European overseas expansion led to the rise of [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the "Old" and "New World"s producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]: a wide transfer of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the continents.
These  colonialist endeavours in 16th and 17th centuries revived a desire for both "accurate" geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations. The ''Geographia Generalis'' by [[Bernhardus Varenius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s world map are prime examples of the new breed of scientific geography.

The [[Waldseemüller map]] ''Universalis Cosmographia'', created by German cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in April 1507, is the first map of the Americas in which the name "America" is mentioned. Before this, the Native Americans referred to their land depending on their location, with one of the more commonly used terms being "Abya Yala", meaning "land of vital blood". These indigenous geographical discourses were largely ignored or appropriated by the European colonialists to make way for European thought. 

The Eurocentric map was patterned after a modification of Ptolemy's second projection but expanded to include the Americas.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;Snyder, John P. (1993). ''Flattening the Earth: 2000 Years of Map Projections'', p. 33. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Waldseemuller Map has been called "America's birth certificate"&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, John R. [https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0309/maps.html The Map That Named America] Library of Congress Information Bulletin, September 2003, Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Waldseemuller|Waldseemüller]] also created printed maps called globe gores, that could be cut out and glued to spheres resulting in a globe.

This has been debated widely as being dismissive of the extensive Native American history that predated the 16th-century invasion, in the sense that the implication of a "birth certificate" implies a blank history prior.

=== 16th~18th centuries in the West ===
{{Unreferenced section|date= November 2017}}
Geography as a science experiences excitement and exerts influence during the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] and [[Reformation|Religion Reformation]]. In the Victorian period, the oversea exploration gave it institutional identity and geography was "the science of imperialism par excellence." Imperialism is a crucial concept for the Europeans, as the institution become involved in geographical exploration and colonial project. Authority was questioned, and utility gained its importance. In the era of Enlightenment, geography generated knowledge and made it intellectually and practically possible as a university discipline. The natural theology required geography to investigate the world as a grand machine from the Divine. Scientific voyages and travels constructed geopolitical power from geographical knowledge, partly sponsored by [[Royal Society]]. [[John Pinkerton]] appraised the eighteenth century had "the gigantic progress of every science, and in particular of geographical information" and "alteration has taken place in states and boundaries."

The discourse of geographical history gave way to many new thoughts and theories, but the hegemony of the European male academia led to the exclusion of non-western theories, observations and knowledges. 
One such example is the interaction between humans and nature, with Marxist thought critiquing nature as a commodity within Capitalism, European thought seeing nature as either a romanticised or objective concept differing to human society, and Native American discourse, which saw nature and humans as within one category.
The implied hierarchy of knowledge that perpetuated throughout these institutions has only been recently challenged, with the Royal Geographical Society enabling women to join as members in the 20th century.  

After [[English Civil War]], [[Samuel Hartlib]] and his Baconian community promoted scientific application, which showed the popularity of utility. For [[William Petty]], the administrators should be "skilled in the best rules of judicial astrology" to "calculate the events of diseases and prognosticate the weather." Institutionally, [[Gresham College]] propagated scientific advancement to a larger audience like tradesmen, and later this institute grew into Royal Society. [[William Cuningham]] illustrated the utilitarian function of cosmography by the military implement of maps. [[John Dee]] used mathematics to study location—his primary interest in geography and encouraged exploiting resource with findings collected during voyages. Religion Reformation stimulated geographical exploration and investigation. [[Philip Melanchthon|Philipp Melanchthon]] shifted geographical knowledge production from "pages of scripture" to "experience in the world." [[Bartholomäus Keckermann]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;separated geography from theology because the "general workings of providence" required empirical investigation. His follower, [[Bernhardus Varenius]] made geography a science in the 17th century and published ''Geographia Generalis'', which was used in [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s teaching of geography at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

Science develops along with [[empiricism]]. Empiricism gains its central place while reflection on it also grew. Practitioners of magic and astrology first embraced and expanded geographical knowledge. Reformation Theology focused more on the providence than the creation as previously. Realistic experience, instead of translated from scripture, emerged as a scientific procedure. Geographical knowledge and method play roles in economic education and administrative application, as part of the Puritan social program. Foreign travels provided content for geographic research and formed theories, such as environmentalism. Visual representation, map-making or [[cartography]], showed its practical, theoretical, and artistic value.

The concepts of "Space" and "Place" attract attention in geography. Why things are there and not elsewhere is an important topic in Geography, together with debates on space and place. Such insights could date back in 16th and 17th centuries, identified by M. Curry as "Natural Space", "Absolute Space", "Relational Space" (''On Space and Spatial Practice''). After [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s ''Principles of Philosophy'', [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] considered space as relative, which has long-term influence on the modern view of space. For Descartes, [[Pierre Gassendi|Grassendi]] and Newton, place is a portion of "absolution space", which are neural and given. However, according to John Locke, "Our Idea of Place is nothing else, but such a relative Position of any thing" (in ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''). "Distance" is the pivot modification of space, because "Space considered barely in length between any two Beings, without considering any thing else between them". Also, the place is "made by Men, for their common use, that by it they might be able to design the particular Position of Things". In the ''Fifth Paper in Reply to Clarke,'' Leibniz stated: "Men fancy places, traces, and space, though these things consist only in the truth of relations and not at all in any absolute reality". Space, as an "order of coexistence", "can only be an ideal thing, containing a certain order, wherein the mind conceives the application of relation". Leibniz moved further for the term "distance" as he discussed it together with "interval" and "situation", not just a measurable character. Leibniz bridged place and space to quality and quantity, by saying "Quantity or magnitude is that in things which can be known only through their simultaneous compresence--or by their simultaneous perception... Quality, on the other hand, is what can be known in things when they are observed singly, without requiring any [[compresence]]." In ''Modern Space as Relative'', place and what is in place are integrated. "The Supremacy of Space" is observed by E. Casey when the place is resolved as "position and even point" by Leibniz's rationalism and Locke's empiricism.

During [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], advancements in science mean widening human knowledge and enable further exploiting nature, along with industrialization and empire expansion in Europe. [[David Hume]], "the real father of positivist philosophy" according to [[Leszek Kołakowski|Leszek Kolakowski]], implied the "doctrine of facts", emphasizing the importance of scientific observations. The "fact" is related with sensationalism that object cannot be isolated from its "sense-perceptions", an opinion of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], Descartes, later [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and Newton advocated scientific [[materialism]], viewing the universe—the entire world and even human mind—as a machine. The mechanist world view is also found in the work of [[Adam Smith]] based on historical and statistics methods. In chemistry, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] proposed the "exact science model" and stressed quantitative methods from experiment and mathematics. [[Carl Linnaeus|Karl Linnaeus]] classified plants and organisms based on an assumption of fixed species. Later, the idea of [[evolution]] emerged not only for species but also for society and human intellect. In ''General Natural History and Theory of the Heavens'', [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] laid out his hypothesis of cosmic evolution, and made him "the great founder of the modern scientific conception of Evolution" according to [[William Hastie|Hastie]].

[[Francis Bacon]] and his followers believed progress of science and technology drive betterment of man. This belief was attached by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who defended human emotions and morals. His discussion on geography education piloted local regional studies. Leibniz and Kant formed the major challenge to the mechanical materialism. Leibniz conceptualized the world as a changing whole, rather than "sum of its parts" as a machine. Nevertheless, he acknowledged experience requires rational interpretation—the power of human reason.

Kant tried to reconcile the division of sense and reason by stressing moral rationalism grounded on aesthetic experience of nature as "order, harmony, and unity". For knowledge, Kant distinguished [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] (''sensible'' world) and [[Noumenon|noumena]] (''intelligible'' world), and he asserted "all phenomena are perceived in the relations of space and time." Drawing a line between "rational science" and "empirical science", Kant regarded Physical geography—associating with space—as natural science. During his tenure in [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]], Kant offered lectures on physical geography since 1756 and published the lecture notes ''Physische Geographie'' in 1801. However, Kant's involvement in travel and geographical research is fairly limited. Kant's work on empirical and rational science influence [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and at smaller extent [[Carl Ritter|Ritter]]. Manfred Büttner asserted that is "Kantian emancipation of geography from theology."

Humboldt is admired as a great geographer, according to D. Livingstone that "modern geography was first and last a synthesizing science and as such, if Goetzmann is to be believed, 'it became the key scientific activity of the age'." Humboldt met the geographer [[Georg Forster|George Forster]] at the [[University of Göttingen]], whose geographical description and scientific writing influenced Humboldt. His ''Geognosia'' including the geography of rocks, animals, and plants is "an important model for modern geography". As the Prussian Ministry of Mines, Humboldt founded the Free Royal Mining School at Steben for miners, later regarded the prototype of such institutes. German Naturphilosophie, especially the work of Goethe and Herder, stimulated Humboldt's idea and research of a universal science. In his letter, he made observations while his "attention will never lose sight of the harmony of concurrent forces, the influence of the inanimate world on the animal and vegetable kingdom." His American travel stressed the geography of plants as his focus of science. Meanwhile, Humboldt used empirical method to study the indigenous people in the New World, regarded as a most important work in human geography. In ''Relation historique du Voyage'', Humboldt called these research a new science ''Physique du monde, Theorie de la Terre,'' or ''Geographie physique''. During 1825 to 1859, Humboldt devoted in Kosmos, which is about the knowledge of nature. There are growing works about the New World since then. In the Jeffersonian era, "American geography was born of the geography of America", meaning the knowledge discovery helped form the discipline. Practical knowledge and national pride are main components of the Teleological tradition.

Institutions such as the [[Royal Geographical Society]] indicate geography as an independent discipline. [[Mary Somerville]]'s Physical Geography was the "conceptual culmination of ... Baconian ideal of universal integration". According to Francis Bacon, "No natural phenomenon can be adequately studied by itself alone -- but, to be understood, it must be considered as it stands connected with all nature."

==19th century==
[[File:Humboldt.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859).]]
By the 18th century, geography had become recognized as a discrete discipline and became part of a typical [[university]] curriculum in Europe (especially [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]), although not in the United Kingdom where geography was generally taught as a sub-discipline of other subjects.

A holistic view of geography and nature can be seen in the work by the 19th-century polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the great works of this time was Humboldt's ''Kosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the Universe'', the first volume of which was published in German in 1845. Such was the power of this work that Dr Mary Somerville, of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] intended to scrap publication of her own ''Physical Geography'' on reading ''Kosmos''. Von Humboldt himself persuaded her to publish (after the publisher sent him a copy).

In 1877, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] published his Physiography with the philosophy of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] presented as an integrated approach in the study of the natural environment. The philosophy of universality in geography was not a new one but can be seen as evolving from the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. The publication of Huxley physiography presented a new form of geography that analysed and classified [[Causality|cause and effect]] at the micro-level and then applied these to the macro-scale (due to the view that the micro was part of the macro and thus an understanding of all the micro-scales was need to understand the macro level). This approach emphasized the empirical collection of data over the theoretical. The same approach was also used by [[Halford John Mackinder]] in 1887. However, the integration of the [[Geosphere]], [[Atmosphere]] and [[Biosphere]] under physiography was soon over taken by Davisian geomorphology.

Over the past two centuries the quantity of knowledge and the number of tools has exploded. There are strong links between geography and the sciences of [[geology]] and [[botany]], as well as [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[demographics]].

The [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in England in 1830, although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in United Kingdom geography was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.

The [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became and continues to be a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education.

==20th century==
In the West during the second half of the 19th and the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: environmental determinism, regional geography, the quantitative revolution, and critical geography.

===Environmental determinism===
{{Main article|Environmental determinism}}
'''Environmental determinism''' is the theory that a people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. Prominent [[environmental determinism|environmental determinists]] included [[Carl Ritter]], [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], and [[Ellsworth Huntington]]. Popular hypotheses{{By whom|date=November 2016}} included "heat makes inhabitants of the tropics lazy" and "frequent changes in barometric pressure make inhabitants of temperate latitudes more intellectually agile."{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Environmental determinist geographers attempted to make the study of such influences scientific. Around the 1930s, this school of thought was widely repudiated as lacking any basis and being prone to (often bigoted) generalizations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Environmental determinism remains an embarrassment to many contemporary geographers, and leads to skepticism among many of them of claims of environmental influence on culture (such as the theories of [[Jared Diamond]]). {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Regional geography===
{{Main article|Regional geography}}
'''Regional geography''' was coined by a group of geographers known as possibilists and represented a reaffirmation that the proper topic of geography was study of places (regions). Regional geographers focused on the collection of descriptive information about places, as well as the proper methods for dividing the earth up into regions. Well-known names from these period are [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany and [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France. The philosophical basis of this field in United States was laid out by [[Richard Hartshorne]], who defined geography as a study of areal differentiation, which later led to criticism of this approach as overly descriptive and unscientific.

However, the concept of a Regional geography model focused on [[Area Studies]] has remained incredibly popular amongst students of geography, while less so amongst scholars who are proponents of Critical Geography and reject a Regional geography paradigm. It can be argued that Regional Geography, which during its heyday in the 1970s through early 1990s made substantive contributions to students' and readers' understanding of foreign cultures and the real world effects of the delineation of borders, is due for a revival in academia as well as in popular nonfiction.

===The quantitative revolution===
{{Main article|Quantitative revolution}}
The '''quantitative revolution''' in geography began in the 1950s. Geographers formulated geographical theories and subjected the theories to empirical tests, usually using [[statistical methods]] (especially [[hypothesis testing]]). This quantitative revolution laid the groundwork for the development of [[geographic information system]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], [[Edward Augustus Ackerman]] and [[Torsten Hägerstrand]].

===Critical geography===
{{Main article|Critical geography}}
Though positivist approaches remain important in geography, '''critical geography''' arose as a critique of positivism. The first strain of critical geography to emerge was [[humanistic geography]]. Drawing on the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], humanistic geographers (such as [[Yi-Fu Tuan]]) focused on people's sense of, and relationship with, places. More influential was [[Marxist geography]], which applied the social theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his followers to geographic phenomena. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]] are well-known Marxist geographers. [[Feminist geography]] is, as the name suggests, the use of ideas from [[feminism]] in geographic contexts. The most recent strain of critical geography is postmodernist geography, which employs the ideas of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] and [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] theorists to explore the social construction of spatial relations.

==Identified fictional colors==
This is a '''list of fictional colors''' which were invented for a work of fiction.
*'''Actinic''' is a new use of an older word by [[Larry Niven]] in ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'' for the human sensation of color in vision-damaging ultraviolet light – for example, as seen in welding-torch light (see [[Actinism]]). The term "actinic light" was also used in E.E. Smith's [[Lensman series|''Lensmen'' series]] to describe UV light, and in the novel ''Forlorn Hope'' to describe the effect of a military laser weapon upon a cloud of mercury droplets. '''Actinic''' was also mentioned in Ambrose Bierce's short story ''[[The Damned Thing (Short Story)]]'' published in 1898. It simply referred to a color that humans cannot see.
*'''Ultra Indigo''' was a color and plot point in an episode of the television series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', possessing the power to decelerate other photons and distort time.
*'''Amarklor''' and '''Kalish''' are colors in the ultraviolet range seen by [[Klingon]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''[[Pawns and Symbols]]'' by Majliss Larson. In this story, Klingons see amarklor between violet and kalish, but see the color red as black.
*'''[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Garrow]]'''&amp;nbsp; and '''Infra-White'''&amp;nbsp; – colors invented in the ''[[Nebulous]]'' episode "Madness Is a Strange Colour". Both colors affect the human mind in odd ways, either destroying or creating sanity. Professor Nebulous claims that he discovered Infra-White by looking ''underneath and behind'' the visible spectrum.
*'''[[Fuligin]]'''&amp;nbsp;– both a color and a textile having that color, associated with the Guild of Torturers in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]''. The color is defined as "the color that is darker than black" and also as "the color of soot". In comparison, see the real colors [[super black]] and [[vantablack]].
*'''[[Grue and bleen]]'''&amp;nbsp;– colors that change after an arbitrary, but fixed time; coined by philosopher Nelson Goodman to illustrate what he calls "the new [[riddle of induction]]."&lt;ref name="Goodman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Mull and glow]]'''&amp;nbsp;– an infrared and an ultraviolet color seen by futuristic humans in Victor Emmanuel's ''The Messiah of the Cylinder'' (1917).
*'''[[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hooloovoo|Hooloovoo]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a superintelligent shade of the color blue in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]]. In ''[[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]'', Adams mentions [[Agrajag]]'s lair as being painted in "the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way."&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt by Tom Snyder of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|H2G2]], located here [http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/tomsnyder/hg-3-18.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Octarine]]'''&amp;nbsp;– the color of magic in the ''[[Discworld]]'' fantasy novels, described as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple.
*'''[[Squant]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a fourth primary color publicized by the experimental band [[Negativland]] in 1993.
*[[A Voyage to Arcturus#Names|'''Jale''', '''Ulfire''' and '''Dolm''']]&amp;nbsp;– Two new primary colors (Jale and Ulfire) and a compound color of ulfire and blue (dolm) from ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' (1920) by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]. Jale and Ulfire are described as "Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous."
*The colors [[The Stars My Destination|'''tang''' and '''burn''']] are colors in the [[infrared]] range seen by the [[albino]] [[mutant]] Olivia Presteign (whose [[Visual perception|vision]] only functions in the infrared) in the 1956 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' by [[Alfred Bester]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher, Anthony]], Editor ''A Treasury of Great Science Fiction'' Garden City, New York:1959—Doubleday Volume Two—''The Stars My Destination'' by Alfred Bester, Pages 361–522—Color reference Page 465&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Berl''', '''Crynor''', '''Nusp''', and '''Onsible''' are colors from the ''Star Wars'' universe. They are said to be somewhere in the ultraviolet spectrum, which can be seen by [[Hutts]] and [[Kaminoans]] and some others.
*'''Htun''' is a color similar to black only seen by gnomes in the book ''[[Fairest (novel)|Fairest]]'' by [[Gail Carson Levine]].
*'''Sangoire''' is a color of red 'so dark and saturated it [is] almost black', it is also described as 'the color of blood spilled in moonlight', seen in the [[Kushiel's Legacy]] Series by [[Jacqueline Carey]].
*'''Gloxym''' is a fictional color coined by [[Kibology|Kibo]] on his FAQ. He describes Gloxym as the true color of the sky.
*'''Smaudre''' is a color from the fairy world in [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Suldrun's Garden]]''. The fairy folk find it lovely, but to the human eye, it appears colorless.
*'''Rawn''' and '''Pallow''' are colors associated with circles of magic beyond white, black, purple and green in Jack Vance's ''Green Magic''.
*'''Plaid''' is one of the colors outside of the natural human spectrum visible to large intelligent [[arachnid]]s in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.
*'''Shattan''' is said to be a fourth primary color for Yalia people in ''[[Wonderland Online]]''. It is said to have calming properties and appears to humans as a combination of golden and infraviolet colors.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of Shattan at the linked page.|date=July 2014}}
*'''Flange''' is "every color of the rainbow, all at once" in the book ''[[The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles]]'' by [[Julie Andrews Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-reading.me/bookreader.php/1007836/Edwards_-_The_Last_of_the_Really_Great_Whangdoodles.html|title=Book: The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles|first=Edwards Julie|last=Andrews|date=|website=www.e-reading.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is used by the Whangdoodle to impress his bride and it is stated that it is very hard to do. The Whangdoodle is also capable of turning colors such as crash pink, some of which may or may not exist.
*'''Apocyan''', '''Cosmogone''', '''Gant''', '''Irrigo''', '''Peligin''', '''Violant''', and '''Viric''', collectively known as 'the Neathbow', are colors found only in the subterranean Neath of Failbetter Games' ''[[Fallen London]]'' universe. They are impossible shades of existing colours: apocyan is a bright pale aqua, irrigo is brilliant purple, violant has been depicted multiple ways but is usually an iridescent wine-red, cosmogene is golden yellow, gant is beige with a slight reddish tinge, peligin is an extremely dark blue-gray that's almost black, and viric is emerald green. Most of them also have supernatural properties: irrigo causes forgetfulness, violant improves memory, cosmogone and viric are heavily associated with dreams. Gant is the colour that "remains when all other colours are eaten".
*'''El Gris/Gray''' is considered the "third" and an unreal color in ''[[La Historia de los Colores|La Historia de los Colores/The Story of Colors]]'' by [[Subcomandante Marcos]]. It only exists so the black and the white don't bump into each other so hard – it does so by painting the dusks and dawns.
*'''Gloze''' and '''Flush''' are infrared colors mentioned in the book ''[[Neverness]]'' by [[David Zindell]].

==Unnamed fictional colors==
*''[[The Colour Out of Space]]''&amp;nbsp;– a vaguely described alien hue, from the story of that name by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1927).
*In ''[[The Golden Key]]'', an 1867 fairy tale by [[George MacDonald]], a boy sees additional colors in a [[rainbow]] in [[Fairy]]land: "He could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before."
*In the [[Mars|Martian]] ([[Barsoom]]) novels of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the spectrum is divided into nine colors rather than the earthly seven, and the two unearthly colors are called "the eighth ray" and "the ninth ray". [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] describes the additional colors as "... two beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless. I cannot describe them any more than you could describe red to a blind man. I only know that they were beautiful in the extreme." The eighth ray exerts an anti-gravity force and is trapped in tanks by the Red Martians to levitate and propel their flying craft. The ninth ray is processed by the great atmosphere factory to create breathable air for Barsoom.
*In the 1942 novel ''[[Perelandra]]'', [[C. S. Lewis]] describes the colors of angelic beings when they manifest themselves: "We think that when creatures of the hypersomatic kind choose to 'appear' to us, they are not in fact affecting our retina at all, but directly manipulating the relevant parts of our brain. If so, it is quite possible that they can produce there the sensations we should have if our eyes were capable of receiving those colours in the spectrum which are actually beyond their range." (Chapter 16)
*In [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] ''[[From a Buick 8]]'', the characters encounter an alien plant with an unearthly color, which the narrator describes as "corpse white".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">The '''Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image''' (MAXI) use several highly sensitive [[X-ray]] detectors, including the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) and the Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC), located at the Equipment Exchange Unit (EER) site 1 on the [[Japanese Experiment Module|Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility]] (JEF), aboard the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20180418"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=international Space Station - Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) - 04.25.18 - ISS Science for Everyone - Science Objectives for Everyone |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/603.html |date=18 April 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=3 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MAXI was developed by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Tsukuba, Japan, and is designed to continuously monitor X-ray sources and variability as the International Space Station (ISS) orbits Earth. It was launched in 2009.

MAXI conducts a full sky survey every 96 minutes searching for variations in X-ray sources.

MAXI helped discover the rapidly rotating black-hole/star system [[MAXI J1659-152]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5840 E. Kuulkers, et al. - MAXI J1659-152: The shortest orbital period black-hole transient in outburst (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
MAXI has been in operation for several years and has made several x-ray photos of nebulae and space objects while being stationed on the ISS (International Space Station).

==iWF-MAXI==
''iSEEP Wide-Field MAXI'' (iWF-MAXI) is a follow-on instrument to the current MAXI. Compared with MAXI, which can only monitor 2% of the celestial sphere instantaneously, iWF-MAXI is always capable of monitoring 10%, and can monitor up to 80% in 92 minutes. iWF-MAXI will utilize the i-SEEP (IVA-replaceable Small Exposed Experiment Platform) bus, an exposure adapter for middle-sized payloads in [[Kibo (ISS module)#Exposed Facility|JEM-EF]].

The '''Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law''' ('''Max Planck Institute for International Law''', '''MPIL''') is a legal research institute located in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. It is operated by the [[Max Planck Society]].

The institute was founded in 1924 and was originally named the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Foreign and International Public Law'' and located in [[Berlin]]. It later relocated to Heidelberg and received its current name in 1949. The institute currently employs 69 scientific staff and is led by two co-directors, [[Armin von Bogdandy]] (since 2002) and [[Anne Peters]] (since 2013).&lt;ref name=MPILorg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpil.de/ww/en/pub/research/profile/history.cfm|title=Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law - History and Organization|accessdate=2010-01-10|work=Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805001929/http://www.mpil.de/ww/en/pub/research/profile/history.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seated at [[Heidelberg University]]'s [[New Campus (University of Heidelberg)|New Campus]].

The institute is one of the most important research institutions in the [[German language in Europe|German-speaking world]] in the fields of [[international law]], [[European law]], [[comparative law|comparative]] [[public law]], and for the theoretical frameworks of [[transnational law]].

[[File:Liping Kou observes microgreens.jpg|thumb|Technicians harvesting different types of microgreens for shelf-life studies and nutrient analyses.]]
'''Microgreens''' are a [[Leaf vegetable|vegetable green]], harvested after [[sprouting]] as [[shoot]]s, that are used both as a visual and flavor component or ingredient primarily in fine dining restaurants. Fine dining chefs use microgreens to enhance the attractiveness and taste of their dishes with their delicate textures and distinctive flavors. Smaller than “baby greens,” and harvested later than [[Sprouting|sprouts]], microgreens can provide a variety of leaf flavors, such as sweet and spicy. They are also known for their various colors and textures. Among upscale markets, they are now considered a specialty genre of greens that are good for garnishing salads, soups, plates, and sandwiches.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Millard | first=E. | title=Indoor Kitchen Gardening: Turn Your Home Into a Year-round Vegetable Garden | publisher=Cool Springs Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-61058-981-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEf4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 | access-date=May 28, 2017 | page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible young greens and grains are produced from various kinds of vegetables, herbs or other plants. They range in size from {{convert|1|to|3|in|cm}}, including the stem and leaves. A microgreen has a single central stem which has been cut just above the soil line during harvesting. It has fully developed [[cotyledon]] leaves and usually has one pair of very small, partially developed true leaves. The average crop-time for most microgreens is 10–14 days from seeding to harvest.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanderlinden|first=Colleen|title=Grow Your Own Microgreens|url=http://organicgardening.about.com/od/vegetablesherbs/a/growmicrogreens.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Microgreens began showing up on chefs' menus as early as the 1980s, in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;
In Southern California, microgreens have been grown since about the mid{{nbhyph}}1990s. There were initially very few varieties offered. Those available were such as [[arugula]], [[basil]], [[beets]], [[kale]], [[cilantro]] and a mixture called Rainbow Mix. Having spread eastward from California, they are now being grown in most areas of the country with an increasing number of varieties being produced.&lt;ref name=micro /&gt; Today, the U.S. microgreens industry consists of a variety of seed companies and growers.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;

==Form==
Microgreens have three basic parts: a central stem, cotyledon leaf or leaves, and typically the first pair of very young true leaves. They vary in size depending upon the specific variety grown, with the typical size being {{convert|1|to|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} in total length.  When the green grows beyond this size, it should no longer be considered a microgreen. Larger sizes have been called petite greens.&lt;ref name=micro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshorigins.com/microgreens.html | title=MicroGreen Facts | publisher=Fresh Origins | accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microgreens are typically 2–4 weeks old from germination to harvest.&lt;ref name=waterfields&gt;{{cite web | url=http://waterfieldsllc.com/what-are-microgreens/ | title=What are Microgreens? | publisher=Waterfields | accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both baby greens and microgreens lack any legal definition. The terms "baby greens" and "microgreens" are marketing terms used to describe their respective categories. Sprouts are germinated seeds and are typically consumed as an entire plant (root, seed, and shoot), depending on the species. For example, sprouts from almond, pumpkin, and peanut reportedly have a preferred flavor when harvested prior to root development. Sprouts are legally defined, and have additional regulations concerning their production and marketing due to their relatively high risk of microbial contamination compared to other greens. Growers interested in producing sprouts for sale need to be aware of the risks and precautions summarized in the FDA publication Guidance for Industry: Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Sprouted Seeds (FDA 1999).&lt;ref name=ufl&gt;{{cite web|last=Treadwell|first=Danielle D.|title=Microgreens: A New Specialty Crop|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs1164|publisher=Univ. of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing==
Growing microgreens is relatively easy; many small "backyard" growers have sprung up selling their greens at farmers' markets or to restaurants. A shallow [[plastic container]] with drainage holes, such as a nursery flat or prepackaged-salad box, will facilitate sprouting and grow out on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galloway|first=Will|title=Growing Microgreens Indoors|url=http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/garden/growing-microgreens-indoors|publisher=Organic Gardening|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing and marketing high-quality microgreens commercially is much more difficult.&lt;ref name=ufl /&gt;

==Nutritional analysis==
[[File:Red Cabbage Microgreens.jpg|thumb|ARS scientists analyzed key nutrients in 25 different varieties of microgreens and found that red cabbage microgreens (shown here) had the highest concentrations of vitamin C. These nutritious microgreens are ready to harvest just 10 days after planting.]]
Researchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service have published, as of early 2014, several studies that identify the nutritional make-up and the shelf life of microgreens. Twenty-five varieties were tested, key nutrients measured were [[ascorbic]] acid (vitamin C), [[tocopherol]]s (vitamin E), [[phylloquinone]] (vitamin K), and [[beta-carotene]] (a vitamin A precursor), plus other related [[carotenoids]] in the cotyledons.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the 25 microgreens tested, red cabbage, cilantro, garnet amaranth, and green daikon radish had the highest concentrations of vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin K, and vitamin E, respectively. In general, microgreens contained considerably higher levels of vitamins and carotenoids—about five times greater—than their mature plant counterparts, an indication that microgreens may be worth the trouble of delivering them fresh during their short lives.&lt;ref name="ARS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contents Specialty Greens Pack a Nutritional Punch|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan14/greens0114.htm|publisher=USDA|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A nutritional study of microgreens was done in the summer of 2012 by the Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Xiao | first1 = Z. | last2 = Lester | first2 = G. E. | last3 = Luo | first3 = Y. | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q. | title = Assessment of Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations of Emerging Food Products: Edible Microgreens | doi = 10.1021/jf300459b | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 60 | issue = 31 | pages = 7644–7651 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22812633| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating promising potential that microgreens may indeed have particularly high nutritional value compared to mature vegetables. Bhimu Patil, a professor of horticulture and director of the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&amp;M University, agrees that microgreens may potentially have higher levels of nutrients than mature vegetables. But he says more studies are needed to compare the two side by side. "This is a very good start, but there can be a lot of variation in nutrients depending on where you grow it, when you harvest, and the soil medium," Patil says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barclay|first=Eliza|title=Introducing Microgreens: Younger, And Maybe More Nutritious, Vegetables|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/08/29/160274163/introducing-microgreens-younger-and-maybe-more-nutritious-vegetables|publisher=NPR|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing a microgreen, researchers say to look for the most intensely colored ones, which will be the most nutritious.&lt;ref name="Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Jennifer|title=Tiny Microgreens Packed With Nutrients|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20120831/tiny-microgreens-packed-nutrients?page=2|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Results of the microgreens research project conducted by the University of Maryland and the USDA has garnered attention from several national media outlets including National Public Radio (NPR) and The Huffington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavin|first=Sara|title=Mighty Microgreens|url=http://agnr.umd.edu/news/mighty-microgreens|publisher=AGNR|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microgreens sprout comparison==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Sprouts are germinated or partially germinated seeds. A sprout consists of the seed, root, stem, while microgreens are harvested without the roots.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Microgreens have stronger flavors compared to sprouts, and come in a wide selection of leaf shapes, textures and colors.

Microgreens are grown in soil or soil-like materials such as peat moss.  Microgreens require high light levels, preferably natural sunlight with low humidity and good air circulation.  Microgreens are planted with very low seed density compared to sprout processing. Crop times are generally one to two weeks for most varieties, though some can take four to six weeks. Microgreens are ready to harvest when the leaves are fully expanded. Harvesting is usually with scissors cutting just above the soil surface, excluding any roots. Some growers sell them while still growing, rooted in the growing trays so that they can be cut later. Once removed from their growing environment, these trays of microgreens must be used quickly or they will rapidly begin to elongate and lose color and flavor.

Sprout seeds are soaked in water for usually eight hours and then drained.  A high density of seed is placed inside of sprouting equipment or enclosed containers. The seed germinates rapidly due to the high moisture and humidity levels maintained in the enclosures. Seeds can also be sprouted in cloth bags that are repeatedly soaked in water. The sprouting process occurs in dark or very low light conditions. These dark, wet, crowded conditions are ideal for the rapid proliferation of dangerous pathogenic bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} After a few days of soaking and repeated rinsing in water (several times a day to minimize spoilage), the processing is complete and the sprouts are ready to consume.

The conditions that are ideal for properly grown microgreens do not encourage the growth of dangerous pathogens. These growing methods would not work for the production of sprouts.

However, the potential for food safety issues with microgreens may be increasing due to the number of indoor microgreen growing operations in which excessive seed density, low light intensity, low air circulation or most commonly, a lack of GAP ([[good agricultural practices]]) and GMP ([[good manufacturing practices]]) based food safety procedures. Certain provisions of the Guidance for Industry: Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards For Sprouted Seeds &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ProducePlantProducts/ucm120244.htm&lt;/ref&gt; may be beneficial and prudent for growers of microgreens to follow.

==Storage and commercial transport==
Microgreens have a short shelf life and better methods of storing and transporting microgreens are currently being studied, which at this time are mainly focusing on buckwheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=279279|title=Publication : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial microgreens are most often stored in plastic clamshell containers, which do not provide the right balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide for any live greens to breathe.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Among package materials called films, differences in permeability, (see [[Permeation]]), are referred to as the [[oxygen transmission rate]].&lt;!---Please fix this unintelligible sentence! ---&gt;

The ARS researchers found that buckwheat microgreens packaged in films with an oxygen transmission rate of 225 cubic centimeters per square inch per day had a fresher appearance and better cell membrane integrity than those packaged in other films tested. Following these steps, the team maintained acceptable buckwheat microgreen quality for more than 14 days—a significant extension, according to authors. This study was published in LWT-Food Science and Technology in 2013.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;

[[Light-emitting diodes]]. otherwise known as LEDs, now provide the ability to measure impacts of narrow-band wavelengths of light on seedling physiology. The carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] has been hypothesized to be a blue light receptor in plant physiology. A study was carried out to measure the impact of short-duration blue light on phytochemical compounds, which impart the nutritional quality of sprouting broccoli microgreens. Broccoli microgreens were grown in a controlled environment under LEDs using growing pads. Short-duration blue light acted to increase important phytochemical compounds influencing the nutritional value of broccoli microgreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kopsell|first=Dean A.|title=Increases in Shoot Tissue Pigments, Glucosinolates, and Mineral Elements in Sprouting Broccoli after Exposure to Short-duration Blue Light from Light Emitting Diodes|url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/138/1/31.abstract|publisher=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of Mathematics of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут математики Національної академії наук України}}) is a government-owned [[research institute]] in [[Ukraine]] that carries out basic research and trains highly qualified professionals in the field of mathematics. It was founded on 13 February 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imath.kiev.ua/institute/?cat=1&amp;lang=en |title=History of the Institute |language=Ukrainian |publisher=Institute of Mathematics |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable research results==
The perturbation theory of toroidal invariant manifolds of dynamical systems was developed here by academician [[Nikolay Bogolyubov|M. M. Bogolyubov]], [[Yurii Mitropolskiy|Yu. O. Mitropolsky]], academician of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|NAS of Ukraine]] and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[Anatoly Samoilenko|A. M. Samoilenko]], academician of the NAS of Ukraine. The theory's methods are used to investigate oscillation processes in broad classes of applied problems, in particular, the phenomena of passing through resonance and various bifurcations and synchronizations.

[[Sharkovskii's theorem|Sharkovsky’s order theorem]] was devised by its author while he worked for the Institute. It became the basis for the theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems that enabled the study of chaotic evolutions in deterministic systems, and, in particular, of ‘ideal turbulence’.

The school of the NAS academician [[Yurij Berezansky|Yu. M. Berezansky]] constructed the theory of generalized functions of infinitely many variables on the basis of spectral approach and operators of generalized translation.

The school of the NAS academician [[Anatoliy Skorokhod|A. V. Skorokhod]] investigated a broad range of problems related to random processes and stochastic differential equations.

Heuristic methods of phase lumping of complex systems were validated, important results in queuing theory and reliability theory were obtained, and a series of limit theorems for [[semi-Markov process]]es were proved by [[Volodymyr Korolyuk|V. S. Korolyuk]], academician of the NAS of Ukraine. He has also constructed the Poisson approximation for stochastic homogeneous additive functional with semi-Markov switching.

Antiquity is referred to as the
time period before the Middle Ages which began around 500A.D. The major
civilizations are those of the Mediterranean region, [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Rome]], and southwest Asia. Nutrition consisted of simple fresh whole foods that
were either locally grown or transported from neighboring towns during times of crisis. Physicians and philosophers studied the effect of food on the human
body and they generally agreed that food was important in preventing illness
and restoring health.

==Food of Antiquity== 
People ate various types of food, consumers
had choices from dairy (milk and cheese), fruits (figs, pears, apples, and pomegranates),
vegetables (greens and bulbs), Grains and legumes (cereal, wheat barley, millet,
beans, and chickpeas), and meat (beef, mutton, fowl, muscles, and oysters).&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history).

of food aided in the preservation for long term storage or transport to other
cities. Cereals, olives, wine, legumes, vegetables, fruit, and animal products
could all be processed and stored for later use.&lt;ref&gt;Thurmond, D. L. (2006). A handbook of food processing in classical Rome: For her bounty no winter(Technology and change in history, v. 9; Technology and change in history, v. 9). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Cereals were
often processed and stored in the form of bread, flat-cakes, and porridge.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.15&lt;/ref&gt; Legumes were also most often processed and stored as pulses
and eaten with bread to enhance the flavor.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.15&lt;/ref&gt; Cereals were

health support.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food Shortage== 
Cities depended on trade with
agricultural farmers and neighboring cities for food supply due to the lack of
land cultivation area.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P., &amp; Scheidel, W. (1998). Cities, peasants, and food in classical antiquity : Essays in social and economic history.Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 29 - 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Food supply was altered by numerous events such as climate, location, and
distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Weather drastically affected the amount of
produce harvested during a growing season. Climate often fluctuated in the Mediterranean
region with varying temperatures and volumes of precipitation; these two
factors also affected the quality of soil available to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Soil composition mainly depended on
location, but the climate affected the moisture retained within the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Thurmond, D. L. (2006). A handbook of food processing in classical Rome: For her bounty no winter(Technology and change in history, v. 9; Technology and change in history, v. 9). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; If the growing season was not prosperous then cities would
have to resort to trade as a means for food supply. This often made food
distribution difficult due to political disagreements and issues with
transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 35&lt;/ref&gt; To combat hunger due to inadequate food
supply people would eat twigs, roots of plants, bark from trees, and each other
as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Food shortages were frequent but didn’t
last long enough to generate famine.

[[Pythagoras]] (570 BC – 495 BC) was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and is also considered to be “the Father of
Ethical Vegetarianism”. He believed that in order to obtain the highest level
of spiritual and physical health it was necessary to follow a lifestyle that
included a vegetarian diet which excluded meats and other flesh foods.&lt;ref&gt;Leitzmann C. (2014). Vegetarian nutrition: past, present, future. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 100, 496S-502S. doi:10.3945/ajcn.113.071365&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anaxagoras]] (500 BC – 428 BC) was also a Greek philosopher,
he suggested that foods that we ate contained fragments that were needed for
growth in the body. His belief was that “everything is in everything, at all
times”, physical characteristics (hair, nails, flesh, etc.) were generated from
foods that contained those same substances.&lt;ref&gt;Sisko, J. E. (2010). Anaxagoras on Matter, Motion, and Multiple Worlds. Philosophy Compass, 5(6), 443-454. doi:10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00313.x&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] (460 BC –
377 BC) was a physician known as the “father of medicine”, his nutritional
advice was based on the presence of the four humors in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Ullah, M. F., &amp; Khan, M. W. (2008). Food as medicine: potential therapeutic tendencies of plant derived polyphenolic compounds. Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,9(2), 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) was a Greek philosopher and
mathematician; his idea of a healthy diet consisted of balance and moderation
of cereals, fruits, vegetables, dairy, with a strong emphasis on the moderation
of meat and wine.&lt;ref&gt;Skiadas, P., &amp; Lascaratos, J. (2001). Dietetics in ancient Greek philosophy: Plato’s concepts of healthy diet. , Published Online: 14 June 2001; | doi:10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601179, 55(7).&lt;/ref&gt; His belief is that excess food from
one source would lead to future ailments. [[Galen]] (129 AD – 216 AD) built much of
his work by challenging the writings of others. He was an admirer of
Hippocrates because of the work he had done in the field of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Jouanna, J., Eijk, P. J. v. d., &amp; Allies, N. (2012).Greek medicine from Hippocrates to Galen: Selected papers(Studies in Ancient Medicine; Studies in ancient medicine). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen believed that Hippocrates had stated all that needed to be known
about nutrition, and he would interpret his work by the presentation of his own
knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, &amp; Grant, M. (2000). Galen: on food and diet. (M. Grant, Trans.). London and New York: Routledge. P. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine== 
The [[Humorism|humoral theory]] of medicine was
central to medicine during antiquity and for centuries following. Physicians believed
that the body contained a mixture of bodily fluids, the four humors: black
bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. They assessed a patients’ degree of
health based on the balance of these four bodily fluids. Diet was the first prescribed
treatment of disease followed by drugs, then surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, &amp; Grant, M. (2000). Galen: on food and diet. (M. Grant, Trans.). London and New York: Routledge. P. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Early physicians
studied the different ways foods would affect the humors of the body by
restoring health or causing disease. Utilizing knowledge about how humors were affected
by diet physicians prescribed diets with balance, moderation, and timing in
mind. Galen worked extensively on classifying foods according to how they
interacted with the humors of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, &amp; Grant, M. (2000). Galen: on food and diet. (M. Grant, Trans.). London and New York: Routledge. P. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Galen had also noted
that some foods had drug characteristics and for that reason during food
preparation it was not uncommon to boil those foods two or three times.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, &amp; Grant, M. (2000). Galen: on food and diet. (M. Grant, Trans.). London and New York: Routledge. P. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Packaging]] engineering''', also '''package engineering''', '''packaging technology''' and '''packaging science''', is a broad topic ranging from design conceptualization to product placement.  All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product.  Package engineering includes industry-specific aspects of [[industrial engineering]],  [[marketing]],  [[materials science]], [[industrial design]] and [[logistics]].  Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on.  The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Engineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials.  Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes (sometimes resembling [[origami]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;).  Packaging involves [[extrusion]], [[thermoforming]], [[molding (process)|molding]] and other processing technologies.  Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment.  Packaging engineers use principles of [[structural analysis]] and [[thermal analysis]] in their evaluations.

==Education==
Some [[packaging]] engineers have backgrounds in other [[science]], [[engineering]], or [[design]] disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packworld.com/schools|title=Packaging Directory-Packaging Schools|access-date=14 Feb 2015 |last= |first= |publisher=Packaging  world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc.  BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available.  Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry-specific topics such as [[shelf life]] stability, [[corrugated box design]], [[cushioning]], [[engineering design]], labeling regulations,  [[project management]], [[food safety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun|authorlink= |author2=Kim, An |author3=Lyu, Lee|date=November 1998 |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |pages= 417–423|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[robotics]], [[RFID]] tags, [[quality management]], [[package testing]], packaging machinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braglia|first= Maracello|authorlink= |author2=Frosolini, Montanari|date=January 2003 |title=Fuzzy logic controller in a packaging plant|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–45 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first= A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1644">'''Planktology''' is the [[research|study]] of [[plankton]], various small drifting plants, animals and [[microorganism]]s that inhabit bodies of [[water]]. Planktology topics include [[primary production]], [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] and the [[carbon cycle]].

{{stack|[[Image:Plankton collage.jpg|thumb|300px|Composed image of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]]]]}}

Plankton drive the "[[biological pump]]", a process by which the [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]] transports [[carbon]] from the surface [[euphotic zone]] to the ocean's depths. Such processes are vital to [[carbon dioxide sink]]s, one of several possibilities for countering [[global warming]]. Modern planktology includes behavioral aspects of drifting organisms, engaging modern ''[[in situ]]'' imaging devices.

Some planktology projects allow the public to participate [[online]], such as the [[Long-term Ecosystem Observatory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1138">'''Plasmogamy''' is a stage in the [[sexual reproduction]] of [[fungi]], in which the [[cytoplasm]] of two parent cells (usually from the [[mycelia]]) fuses together without the fusion of [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]], effectively bringing two [[haploid]] nuclei close together in the same cell. This state is followed by [[karyogamy]], where the two nuclei fuse together and then undergo [[meiosis]] to produce spores.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = fungus (biology) :: Sexual reproduction | encyclopedia = Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/222357/fungus/57957/Sexual-reproduction |accessdate = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedon|first=Stephen|title=Plasmogamy|url=http://www.biologyaspoetry.com/terms/plasmogamy.html|work=Biology as Poetry|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dikaryotic state that comes after plasmogamy will often persist for many generations before the fungi undergoes karyogamy. In lower fungi however, plasmogamy is usually immediately followed by karyogamy.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5717">'''Political alienation''' refers to an individual [[citizenship|citizen]]'s relatively enduring sense of estrangement from or rejection of the prevailing [[political system]].
==Content and categories==
Political alienation is not to be confused with [[voter apathy]], which describes a person's indifference to voting and/or the voting process. Politically ''alienated'', people feel compelled to vote, but are restricted by their sense of insignificance to the system. They feel that they are underrepresented or not represented at all by those running for office; their best interest or concerns are not regarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Sociology: Oppression, Resistance, and the State|last=Glasberg|first=Davita Silfen|last2=Shannon|first2=Deric|date=November 16, 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc; 1 edition|isbn=1412980402|location=|pages=|oclc=815880812}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Political alienation falls into two broad categories: ''political incapability'' and ''political discontentment''. In the first instance, [[social alienation|alienation]] is forced upon the individual by their environment, whereas in the second case it is voluntarily chosen by them.&lt;ref name="Olsen 1968"&gt;{{Cite journal| author =  Olsen, Marvin E. | title = Two Categories of Political Alienation | year = 1968 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/josf47&amp;div=45&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals | journal = Social Forces |volume=47 |pages=288 | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least five expressions of political alienation:&lt;ref name="Finifter 1970"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Finifter, Ada W. | title = Dimensions of Political Alienation | date = June 1970 | jstor = 1953840 |journal=[[The American Political Science Review]] | volume=64 | issue = 2 | pages=389–410 | doi=10.2307/1953840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Political [[Social alienation#Powerlessness|powerlessness]]''. An individual's feeling that they cannot affect the actions of the government.
#''Political [[Social alienation#Meaninglessness|meaninglessness]]''. An individual's perception that political decisions are unclear and unpredictable.
#''Political [[Social alienation#Normlessness|normlessness]]''. An individual's perception that norms or rules intended to govern political relations are broken down, and that departures from prescribed behavior are common.
#''Political [[Social alienation#Social isolation|isolation]]''. An individual's rejection of political norms and goals that are widely held and shared by other members of a society.
#Political ''disappointment.'' An individual's disinterest to a political decision or participation because of the ruling class bad behaviors, such as, leaders having scandals by doing shameful things.

Political alienation is adversely related to [[political efficacy]].&lt;ref name="Olsen 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finifter 1970"/&gt;

The most common [[election|electoral]] consequences of political alienation are [[abstention]] and [[protest vote|protest voting]].&lt;ref name="Olsen 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finifter 1970"/&gt;

In the current election system in the United States, many voters feel that their vote will not matter in their state if they do not agree with the majority of the population. Voters who usually vote Democrat in the general election, but live in a primarily Republican state, often feel less inclined to vote. The same goes for Republicans who live in a primarily Democratic state. In these situations, voters feel as if their vote no longer matters in the electoral college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=Fall 2014|title=Political Alienation in American Society|url=https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=hcoltheses|journal=Vermont Senior Thesis|volume=|pages=48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* This idea prompted groups to propose new state boundary lines or new states in general. This idea is most notably tied to the Partition and secession in California

=== 2016 U.S. General Election ===
The 2016 U.S. General Election saw political alienation as one of the forefronts of the campaign. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made appeals to the working class in Midwestern states by pointing out that they feel as if their votes don't matter and that they've been forgotten by past candidates. Both candidates did the same with Black and Latino voters in urban areas, voicing concerns with political alienation in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electproject.org/2016g|title=2016g - United States Elections Project|website=www.electproject.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voter turnout in the 2016 election is estimated to have been 55.5% of those eligible to vote. This election also saw an increase in voters in swing states and a decrease in voters living in "locked" states. This made political alienation a primary issue during the election because of the low voter turnout in many states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electproject.org/2016g|title=2016g - United States Elections Project|website=www.electproject.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''potentiostat''' is the [[electronic hardware]] required to control a [[Voltammetry|three electrode cell]] and run most [[Electroanalytical method|electroanalytical]] experiments.  A ''Bipotentiostat'' and ''polypotentiostat'' are potentiostats capable of controlling two working electrodes and more than two working electrodes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R. '''Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications.''' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Edition, '''2000''' {{ISBN|0-471-40521-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia G. Zoski (Editor) '''[[Handbook of Electrochemistry]]'''.  Elsevier, '''2007''' {{ISBN|0-444-51958-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Kissinger, William R. Heineman '''Laboratory Techniques in Electroanalytical Chemistry'''.  CRC Press, '''1996''' {{ISBN|0-8247-9445-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Skoog, F. James Holler, Timothy A. Nieman '''Principles of Instrumental Analysis'''. Harcourt Brace College Publishers, '''1998''' {{ISBN|0-03-002078-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The system functions by maintaining the [[voltage|potential]] of the [[working electrode]] at a constant level with respect to the [[reference electrode]] by adjusting the [[electric current|current]] at an [[auxiliary electrode]]. It consists of an [[electric circuit]] which is usually described in terms of simple [[op amps]].

== Primary use ==
This equipment is fundamental to modern [[electrochemical]] studies using [[Voltammetry|three electrode systems]] for investigations of [[electrochemical reaction mechanism|reaction mechanisms]] related to [[redox]] chemistry and other [[chemistry|chemical]] phenomena.  The dimensions of the resulting data depend on the experiment.  In [[voltammetry]], [[electric current]] in [[ampere|amps]] is plotted against [[electric potential]] in [[voltage]].   In a [[bulk electrolysis]] total [[coulomb]]s passed (total [[electric charge]]) is plotted against time in seconds even though the experiment measures electric current ([[ampere]]s) over time.  This is done to show that the experiment is approaching an expected number of coulombs.    

Most early potentiostats could function independently, providing data output through a physical data trace.  Modern potentiostats are designed to interface with a [[personal computer]] and operate through a dedicated [[software]] package.  The automated software allows the user rapidly to shift between experiments and experimental conditions.  The computer allows data to be stored and analyzed more effectively, rapidly, and accurately than historic methods.

== Basic relationships ==
A potentiostat is a [[Controller (control theory)|control]] and [[measuring]] device.  It comprises an [[electric circuit]] which controls the potential across the cell by sensing changes in its  [[electrical resistance|resistance]], varying accordingly the current supplied to the system: a higher resistance will result in a decreased current, while a lower resistance will result in an increased current, in order to keep the voltage constant as described by [[Ohm's law]].

:&lt;math&gt;{R} = {E \over I}&lt;/math&gt;
As a result, the variable system [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and the controlled current are [[inversely proportional]]
:&lt;math&gt;I_o={E_c \over R_v}&lt;/math&gt;
:*''&lt;math&gt;I_o&lt;/math&gt;'' is the output electric current of the potentiostat
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_c&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[voltage]] that is kept constant
:*''&lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[electrical resistance]] that varies.

== Principles of operation ==
Since 1942, when Hickling built the first three electrode potentiostat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 38
| pages = 27–33
| last = Hickling
| first = A.
| title = Studies in electrode polarisation. Part IV.-The automatic control of the potential of a working electrode
| journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society
| year = 1942
| doi = 10.1039/TF9423800027
}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantial progress has been made to improve the instrument.  Hickling's device used a third electrode, the [[reference electrode]] to control the cell potential automatically. Up until the present day his principle has remained in use. At a glance, a potentiostat measures the potential difference between the working and the reference electrode, applies the current through the counter electrode and measures the current as an &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;  voltage drop over a series resistor (&lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m} &lt;/math&gt; in Fig. 1).

The control amplifier (CA) is responsible for maintaining the voltage between the reference and the working electrode as closely as possible to the voltage of the input source &lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm i} &lt;/math&gt;. It adjusts its output to automatically control the cell current so that a condition of equilibrium is satisfied. The theory of operation is best understood using the equations below.

Prior to observing the following equations, one may note that, from an electrical point of view, the electrochemical cell and the current measurement resistor &lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m} &lt;/math&gt; may be regarded as two impedances (Fig. 2).  &lt;math&gt; Z_1 &lt;/math&gt; includes &lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt; in series with the interfacial impedance of the [[counter electrode]] and the solution resistance between the counter and the reference. &lt;math&gt; Z_2 &lt;/math&gt;
represents the interfacial impedance of the working electrode in series with the solution resistance between the working and the reference
electrodes. 
[[File:Potentiostat4.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 2 : Schematic of a potentiostat, with electrochemical cell replaced by two impedances.]]

The role of the control amplifier is to amplify the potential difference between the positive (or noninverting) input and the negative (or inverting) input. This may be translated mathematically into the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm{out}}=A\,(E^+-E^-)=A\,(E_{\textrm i}-E_{\textrm r}) &lt;/math&gt;. (1)

where &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is the amplification factor of the CA. At this point the assumption may be made that a negligible amount of current is flowing through the reference electrode. This correlates to physical phenomenon since the reference electrode is connected to a high impedance electrometer.  Thus, the cell current may be described in two ways:

:&lt;math&gt; I_{\textrm c}=\frac{E_{\textrm{out}}}{Z_1+Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;(2)

and

:&lt;math&gt; I_{\textrm c}=\frac{E_{\textrm r}}{Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;. (3)

Combining Eqs.  (2) and (3) yields Eq. (4):

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm r}=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}\,E_{\textrm{out}}=\beta\,E_{\textrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the output voltage of the control amplifier returned to its negative input; namely the feedback factor:

:&lt;math&gt; \beta=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Combining Eqs. (1) and (4) yields Eq. (6):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{E_{\textrm r}}{E_{\textrm i}}=\frac{\beta\,A}{1+\beta\,A} &lt;/math&gt;. (6)

When the quantity &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;  becomes very large with respect to one, Eq.  (6) reduces to Eq. (7), which is one of the negative feedback equations:

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm i}=E_{\textrm r} &lt;/math&gt;. (7)

Eq. (7) proves that the control amplifier works to keep the voltage between the reference and the working close to the input source voltage.

== Software control ==
Replacing the CA, a control algorithm can maintain a constant voltage &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt; between the reference electrode and the working electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegert | first1 = M. | year = 2018 | title = A scalable multi-channel software potentiostat | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00131/full | journal = [[Frontiers in Energy Research]] | volume = 6 | page = 131 | doi = 10.3389/fenrg.2018.00131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm is based on the [[rule of proportion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{U_{\textrm m}}{E_{\textrm c}} = \frac{U_{\textrm n}}{E_{\textrm {SP}}} &lt;/math&gt;. (8)

:*''&lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the last measured cell voltage between the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE).
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the last measured electrochemical potential, i.e. the voltage between the reference electrode and WE to be kept constant.
:*''&lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the next cell voltage to be set, i.e. the controller output.
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm {SP}}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]], i.e. the desired &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the measurement intervals of Eq. (8) are kept constant, the control algorithm sets the cell voltage &lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt; so to keep &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to the setpoint &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm {SP}}&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm requires software-controllable hardware such as a [[digital multimeter]], a [[power supply]], and a double-pull double-though [[relay]]. The relay is necessary to switch polarity.

== Significant features ==
In electrochemical experiments the electrodes are the pieces of equipment that comes in immediate contact with the [[analyte]].   For this reason the electrodes are very important for determining the experimental result.  The electrode surface may or may not catalyze chemical reactions.  The size of the electrodes affects the magnitude of the currents passed which can affect signal to noise.  But electrodes are not the only limiting factor for electrochemical experiments, the potentiostat also has a limited range of operation.  The following are a few significant features that vary between instruments.
 
*''Electric potential range (measured and applied)'': while the potential window is mostly based on the solvent window the electronics can also limit the possible range.
*''Accuracy in potential (measured and applied)'': limits of deviations between the actual and reported.
*''Range of scan rate'': how slow or fast a  potential window can be scanned this is most important for experiments that require high scan rates such as those involving [[ultramicroelectrode]]s.
*''Sample rate'': the rate at which potential or voltage can be accurately sampled.  This can be important for experiments that need high scan rates such as those involving ultramicroelectrodes.
*''File size'':  a limiting factor can be the file size limit.  This would most likely affect the choice of the potential range swept or the potential sample rate.
*''Electric current range (measured and applied)'': the maximum range over which current can be sampled.  Applying large currents is important for experiments that pass a great deal of current like a large [[bulk electrolysis]].  Measuring small currents is important for experiments that pass small currents like those involving ultramicroelectrodes.
*''Current resolution'': determines the operational range of a specific experiment and the bit resolution of that data in the current dimension.
*''Accuracy in current (measured and applied)'': limits of deviations between the actual and reported.
*''Number of working channels'': how many [[working electrode]]s can the instrument control.  A ''bipotentiostat'' is necessary to controlling systems with two working electrodes like a [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].  A ''polypotentiostat'' may be important for controlling some biological experiments with three or more working electrodes.
*''Footprint'': potentiostats include small devices of about 20 x 10 x 5&amp;nbsp;cm weighing well under a kilogram or a simple board that can be installed in a desktop computer.  A large bench-top model would be on the order of 50 x 20 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm and weigh up to or more than 5 kilograms.
*''Interface'': can the instrument run independently or must they be slaved to a personal computer.
*''Sweep generator'': can the system apply an analogue sweep or does it use a digital staircase generator as an approximation.  If it does use a digital staircase then the resolution of the staircase is important.
*''Rotating electrode'': can the instrument operate a rotating electrode.  This is intrinsic for experiments that require a [[rotating disk electrode]] or [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].

'''''Principles of Criminology''''', written by [[Edwin H. Sutherland]] and [[Donald R.

July 28, 1987.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in 1934, although it was derived from a previous publication, ''Criminology'' (1924). The 1934 edition contained a paragraph claiming that crime is brought about by a conflict of behaviours that originate from different cultures. This was the seed of Sutherland's theory of [[differential association]], which was fully developed in the fourth edition, published in 1947.

Further editions of the book were published after Sutherland's death in 1950 by Cressey and D. F. Luckenbill as co-authors.

[[Provirus]] silencing, or proviral silencing, is the repression of expression of proviral genes in cells.

A provirus is a viral DNA that has been incorporated into the chromosome of a host cell, often by retroviruses such as HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooker|first1=Robert J.|title=Genetics : analysis &amp; principles|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780073525280|pages=842|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous [[retrovirus]]es are always in the provirus state in the host cell and replicate through [[reverse transcription]]. By integrating their genome into the host cell genome, they make use of the host cell's transcription and translation mechanisms to achieve their own propagation. This often leads to harmful impact on the host. However, in recent gene therapy techniques, retroviruses are often used to deliver desired genes instead of their own viral genome into the host genome. As such, we are interested in the host cell's mechanisms to silence such gene expressions to find out firstly, how the host cell manages provirus transcription to eliminate the deleterious effects of retroviruses; and secondly, how can we ensure stable and long term expression of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer.

It has been found that the level transcription of integrated retroviruses depends on both genetic and [[chromatin remodeling]] at the site of integration. Mechanisms such as [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone modification]] seem to play important roles in the suppression provirus transcription, such that proviral activity can be finally silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senigl|first1=F|last2=Auxt|first2=M|last3=Hejnar|first3=J|title=Transcriptional provirus silencing as a crosstalk of de novo DNA methylation and epigenomic features at the integration site.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=July 2012|volume=40|issue=12|pages=5298–312|pmid=22379139|doi=10.1093/nar/gks197|pmc=3384319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991 Wright has organized a series of workshop conferences known as ''The Real Utopian Project'' that model the practice of real utopian sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/RealUtopias.htm|title=RealUtopias|last=Wright|first=Erik Olin|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferences are sponsored by the A.E. Havens Center for Social Justice at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and structured around “a provocative manuscript that lays out the basic outlines of a radical institutional proposal.”&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This manuscript is then sent to 15-20 scholars, who write essays on the topic. Prior to the conference these essays are circulated to all the conference participants and then each is discussed at the conference. Following the conference, participants have the opportunity to revise their work before it’s collectively published in Verso’s ''Real Utopias Project'' series; with the exception of papers from the first 1991 conference, which were not published as a series.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

A '''score bug''' (or, in an expanded form, a '''score banner''' or '''scorebar''') is a [[digital on-screen graphic]] which is displayed at either the top or [[lower third]] bottom of the [[television screen]] during a broadcast of a sporting event in order to display the current score and other statistics.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], score bugs are commonly known as scorebars.{{fact|date=June 2013}} The first major British network to carry scorebars in their televised sports games was [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]].{{fact|date=June 2013}}.

==United States==
[[Image:DOG Football.jpg|thumb|A typical score BUG on a televised sporting event will consist of the station logo alongside the current score of game, and other information, such as time elapsed.]]
The first [[television network]] in the United States to utilize a '''score bug''' ([[digital on-screen graphic]]) was [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which used one on the telecast of the [[1994 in NASCAR|1994]] [[Atlanta 500|Purolator 500]] [[NASCAR]] event. A transparent digit counted down the number of laps remaining in the race. A similar bug was used during ABC's telecast of the 1994 [[Indianapolis 500]] and 1994 [[Brickyard 400]]. ABC also incorporated the score bug for its [[1994 World Cup]] coverage, providing the time and score of the game as well as enabling advertiser [[sponsorship]] to broadcast games without interruption. Later that fall, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] introduced a full-score bug for its [[National Football League|NFL]] [[NFL on Fox|coverage]], known as the "[[FoxBox (sports)|FoxBox]]", as did cable network [[ESPN]]. ABC expanded theirs to ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in [[1997 NFL season|1997]]. [[CBS]] introduced theirs upon reassuming broadcast rights to the NFL in the fall of [[1998 NFL season|1998]], and [[NBC]] in [[2001 in sports#Football (American)|2001]] during its coverage of the [[XFL]].

Fox used a score banner for its NASCAR coverage in 2001. Fox then expanded the scoring banner to all sports telecasts. [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] also uses a scoring banner for basketball, hockey, baseball and soccer coverage, as do many other local broadcasters of sporting events.

ABC introduced a Fox-like banner, but along the bottom of the screen, for ''Monday Night Football'' in 2005, its last year of the franchise. The network introduced a revised version on February 5, 2006, during an NBA game telecast, as well as during that day's presentation of [[Super Bowl XL]], which quickly became used for all sports broadcasts on the network. ABC returned to using a bug in September of that year when the network's sports division was [[ESPN on ABC|absorbed by ESPN]]. NBC also began using a scoring banner, along the bottom of the screen like ABC's, in 2005 for its coverage of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame football]] home game telecasts, which also quickly became used for other sports telecasts on the network.  

The networks of [[Turner Broadcasting System]] used traditional score bugs until [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] began broadcasting the [[2007 Major League Baseball Division Series]], in which they converted to a top screen banner. ESPN began using a banner starting with the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] [[Home Run Derby]], a bottom-screen banner for NBA and AFL telecasts and in 2007, a top-screen banner for NASCAR and baseball telecasts, plus a center-screen bug for its ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts in 2006 and 2007 before switching to a bottom-screen banner in 2008. Starting in 2007, the channel began using banners for its college football and college basketball telecasts. In addition, ESPN's college sports telecasts added two (lacrosse), three (college football) or five (college basketball) yellow stripes, representing the timeouts the team has left to use on the banner. Timeout indicators were also added for ESPN's ''Monday Night Football'' telecasts, beginning with Week 4 of the [[2009 NFL season]]. In 2006, CBS began using a bottom-of-the-screen banner for [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] basketball telecasts, but retained the traditional box for all NFL broadcasts, but {{As of|2009|lc=on}} uses a banner for college football and NFL games at the top of the screen. Sibling network [[CBS Sports Network|CBS College Sports]] however, began using a top-screen banner for baseball in 2008, which later expanded to other sports, duplicating the bottom screen banners for basketball. The one exception among all the networks is [[motor racing]], as all of them will use scrolling banners for these races. In 2007, TBS began using a top-screen banner for postseason baseball broadcasts, and continued into the 2008 season, returning to a longer bug in 2009.  In 2017, TBS switched to a much shorter score bug, also for its MLB postseason coverage. 

For the 2008 college football season, Fox Sports Net adopted a new graphics package and reverted to the scoring bug on the top left-hand corner of the screen for football, hockey, and baseball, while on the bottom right-hand corner for basketball. Fox then adopted these graphics for its 2009 Major League Baseball telecasts, but retained the banner for its NFL broadcasts for that year.

In 2010, NFL Network's ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' changed from a center-screen scoring bug at the top of the screen to a center-screen banner at the bottom of the screen.  TNF switched to a more traditional scoring banner in 2012. 

For the 2010 NFL season, Fox reverted to a scoring bug for its broadcasts, which also added timeout indicators.  The same scoring bug would be used for Fox Sports Net's college football broadcasts the following year (2011).

Beginning with [[CBS Sports]]'s coverage of [[Super Bowl 50]] on February 7, 2016, the score banner used for the network's [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] broadcasts was moved to the bottom of the screen.

For the [[2017 NFL season]], Fox switched to a traditional bottom-of-the-screen score bar for the league's broadcasts, thus becoming the last of the league's five broadcast partners (CBS, ESPN, Fox, NBC and NFL Network) to make the switch.  The same score bar would be used for college football coverage on both Fox and FS1 that same year.  Fox Sports Net's regional networks also implemented a similar score bar for the [[2017-18 NBA season]].

Score bugs also appear in many [[sports video game]]s, such as those in the ''[[Madden NFL]]'', ''[[NBA 2K (series)|NBA 2K]]'' and ''[[MLB: The Show]]'' series, acting the same way as their real-world television counterparts (and in some cases, as part of [[brand integration]] deals with broadcasters, utilizing the same presentation elements as specific television broadcasts).

==Coupling with tickers==
Some networks have infused the aggregation of current sports scores with the ongoing [[news ticker]], as [[ESPN2]] began with its "[[ESPN BottomLine|BottomLine]]" graphic in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''semantic feature comparison model''' is used "to derive [[prediction]]s about [[categorization]] times in a situation where a subject must rapidly decide whether a test item is a member of a particular target category".&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, E. E., Shoben. E. J., and Rips, L. J. (1974). Structure and Process in Semantic Memory: A Feature Model for Semantic Decisions. Psychological Review, 81(3), 214–241.&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[semantic model]], there is an assumption that certain occurrences are categorized using its features or attributes of the two subjects that represent the part and the group. A statement often used to explain this model is "a [[European robin|robin]] is a bird". The meaning of the words ''robin'' and ''bird'' are stored in the memory by virtue of a list of features which can be used to ultimately define their categories, although the extent of their association with a particular category varies.

==History==
This model was conceptualized by Edward Smith, Edward Shoben and Lance Rips in 1974 after they derived various observations from semantic verification experiments conducted at the time. Respondents merely have to answer "true" or "false" to given sentences. Out of these experiments, they observed that people respond faster when (1) statements are true, (2) nouns are members of smaller categories, (3) items are "typical" or commonly associated with the category (also called prototypes), and (4) items are primed by a similar item previously given ([[University of Alaska Anchorage]], n.d.). In the latter item, respondents will respond faster to the latter statement since the category bird has been primed. Based on the previous observations, the proponents were able to come up with the semantic feature comparison model.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Theory==
The cognitive approach consists of two concepts: [[information processing]] depends on [[Mental representation|internal representations]], and that mental representations undergo transformations. For the first concept, we could describe an object in a number of ways, with drawings, equations, or verbal descriptions, but it is up to the recipient to have a background understanding of the context to which the object is being described in order to fully comprehend the deliverable. The second concept explains how memory can alter the way we perceive representations of something, by determining the sequence in which the information is processed based on previous experiences.

==Features==
The main features of the model, as discussed by Smith et al. (1974), are the defining features and the characteristic features. Defining features refer to the characteristics that are essential elements of the category, the non-negotiable, so to speak. For example, the 'bird' category includes such defining features as 'they have wings', 'feathers', 'they lay eggs', etc. Characteristic features refer to the elements usually found or inherent to category members but are not found in all, or non-essentials. For example, birds 'fly', – that is characteristic because while most birds fly, there are some who cannot.

The model has two stages for [[decision making]]. First, all features of the two concepts (bird and robin, in our example) are compared to find out how alike they are. If the decision is that they are very [[similarity (psychology)|similar]] or very dissimilar, then a true or false decision can be made. Second, if the characteristics/features are in-between then the focus shifts to the defining features in order to decide if the example possesses enough features of the category, thus, categorization depends on similarity and not on the size of the category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22256">The '''Seven Sisters''' was a name given to seven [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] in the [[Northeastern United States]] that are historically [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]]. Five of the seven institutions continue to offer all-female undergraduate programs: [[Barnard College]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], and [[Wellesley College]].  [[Vassar College]] has been co-educational since 1969. [[Radcliffe College]] shared common and overlapping history with [[Harvard College]] from the time it was founded as "the Harvard Annex" in 1879. Harvard and Radcliffe effectively merged in 1977, but Radcliffe continued to be the sponsoring college for women at Harvard until its dissolution in 1999. [[Barnard College]] was [[Columbia University]]'s women's liberal arts undergraduate college until its all-male coordinate school [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] went co-ed in 1983; to this day, Barnard continues to be an all-women's undergraduate college affiliated with Columbia.

All seven schools were founded between 1837 and 1889. Four are in [[Massachusetts]], two are in [[New York (state)|New York]], and one is in [[Pennsylvania]].

==History==

===Background===
Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra note that "Independent nonprofit women’s colleges, which included the 'Seven Sisters', were founded to provide educational opportunities to women equal to those available to men and were geared toward women who wanted to study the liberal arts".&lt;ref name="Harwarth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |title=Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges |author=Irene Harwarth |author2=Mindi Maline |author3=Elizabeth DeBra |publisher=U.S. Department of Education National Institute on Post-secondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204110037/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archivedate=February 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The colleges also offered broader opportunities in [[academia]] to women, hiring many female [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members and [[academic administrator|administrator]]s.

Early proponents of education for women were [[Sarah Pierce]] ([[Litchfield Female Academy]], 1792); [[Catharine Beecher]] ([[Hartford Female Seminary]], 1823); [[Zilpah P. Grant Banister]] ([[Ipswich Female Seminary]], 1828); and [[Mary Lyon]]. Lyon was involved in the development of both Hartford [[Female seminary|Female Seminary]] and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of ''Wheaton Female Seminary'' (now [[Wheaton College, Massachusetts]])  in 1834. In 1837, Lyon founded ''Mount Holyoke Female Seminary'' ([[Mount Holyoke College]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/index.shtml| title=About Mount Holyoke| publisher=mountholyoke.edu| accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mount Holyoke received its collegiate charter in 1888 and became Mount Holyoke Seminary and College. It became Mount Holyoke College in 1893. Vassar, however, was the first of the Seven Sisters to be chartered as a college in 1861.

Wellesley College was chartered in 1870 as the ''Wellesley Female Seminary'', and was renamed  ''Wellesley College'' in 1873. It opened to students in 1875.  Smith College was chartered in 1871 and opened its doors in 1875. Bryn Mawr opened in 1885.

Radcliffe College grew out of the Women’s Education Association of Boston, founded by a group of influential women, including [[Elizabeth Cary Agassiz]], whose late husband was a famous Harvard scientist.  Radcliffe College was founded in 1879 and chartered by the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] in 1894. It was informally called ''The Harvard Annex''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-and-vision/radcliffe| title=Radcliffe Mission, Vision, and History| publisher=harvard.edu| accessdate=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;because Harvard Professors repeated the lectures they'd given to male Harvard students there until 1943.  By 1946, the majority of Harvard College courses were offered to both female Radcliffe students and male Harvard Students. The schools further integrated in the 1960's, and in 1963 the first Harvard degrees were conferred on Radcliffe women.  Despite having joint admissions, Women's degrees would continue to bear both Harvard and Radcliffe seals until 1999, when the merger of the two schools was completed. Since 1999, all undergraduate students have received diplomas bearing the seal of Harvard College, and identified as Harvard students. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/hard-earned-gains-for-women-at-harvard/| title=Hard Earned Gains for Women at Harvard| publisher=The Harvard Gazette| accessdate=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radcliffe College no longer exists as an undergraduate institution, but Radcliffe class reunions take place at Harvard each year. The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study was created following the merger in 1999, and today offers non-degree instruction and executive education programs. Barnard College has similarly been affiliated with [[Columbia University]] since its founding in 1888, but it continues to be independently governed.

Mount Holyoke College and Smith College are also members of [[Pioneer Valley]]'s [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five Colleges]] consortium. [[Bryn Mawr College]] is a part of the [[Tri-College Consortium]] in suburban Philadelphia, with its sister schools, [[Haverford College]] and [[Swarthmore College]].

===Formation and name===
Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Radcliffe were given the name "the Seven Sisters" in 1927, because of their relative affiliations with the [[Ivy League]] men’s colleges.&lt;ref name="Harwarth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/timelines/women.htm| title=Women and the Academy| publisher=Barnard College| author=Robert A. McCaughey| work=Higher Learning in America, History BC4345x| date=Spring 2003| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512031755/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/timelines/women.htm| archivedate=2006-05-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The schools are sometimes referred to as "the [[Daisy garland|Daisy Chain]]" or "the Heavenly Seven."

The name ''Seven Sisters'' is also a reference to the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of ''The [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]],'' the seven daughters of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and the sea-nymph [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]]. The daughters ([[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]], [[Taygete]], [[Alcyone (Pleiades)|Alcyone]], [[Celaeno]], [[Sterope (Pleiad)|Sterope]], and [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]]) were collectively referred to as ''The Seven Sisters''. In the field of [[astronomy]] a [[star cluster]], in the [[constellation]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], is also referred to as The ''[[Pleiades]]'' or the ''Seven Sisters.''

==Coeducation==
The seven colleges explored the issue of coeducation in a variety of ways. 

Two, Radcliffe College and Vassar College, are no longer women's colleges. Radcliffe merged completely into [[Harvard College]] in 1999, and is now a research institute and no longer an undergraduate institution. The component parts of the College's campus, the Radcliffe Quadrangle and Radcliffe Yard, retain the designation "Radcliffe" in perpetuity, and serve or house both male and female students to this day.   Vassar declined an offer to merge with [[Yale University]] and became independently coeducational in 1969.

Barnard College was founded in 1888 as a woman's college affiliated with [[Columbia University]].  However, it is independently governed, while making available to its students the instruction and the facilities of Columbia University. [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], the university's largest liberal-arts undergraduate school, began admitting women in 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard for a [[merger]] along the lines of the one between Harvard College and Radcliffe and between Brown and [[Pembroke College in Brown University|Pembroke]]. Barnard has an independent faculty (subject to Columbia University tenure approval) and board of trustees. Columbia University issues its diplomas, however, and most of Barnard's classes and activities are open to all members of Columbia University, male or female, and vice versa, in a reciprocal arrangement dating from 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnard.edu/archives/history/chronology |title=Chronology |publisher=[[Barnard College]] |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051323/http://www.barnard.edu/archives/history/chronology |archivedate=June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barnard.edu/about/columbia-partnership |title=Partnership with Columbia |publisher=[[Barnard College]] |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Bryn Mawr and [[Haverford College]] (then all-male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibility of coeducation as well but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/about/history.shtml |title=A Brief History of Bryn Mawr College |publisher=Bryn Mawr |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and Wellesley College decided against adopting coeducation. Mount Holyoke engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of [[David Truman]] over the issue of coeducation. On 6 November 1971, "after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women's college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml| title=A Detailed History| publisher=[[Mount Holyoke College]] |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also made a similar decision in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/about-smith/smith-tradition/presidents |title=Smith College Presidents |publisher=[[Smith College]] |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007102459/http://www.smith.edu/about-smith/smith-tradition/presidents |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Wellesley also announced that it would not adopt coeducation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/09/archives/wellesley-says-it-wont-go-coed-plans-drive-for-70million-over-next.html |title=WELLESLEY SAYS IT WON'T GO COED; Plans Drive for $70-Million Over Next 10 Years |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 9, 1973 |page=43 | accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 3, 2008 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussed the move by [[women's colleges in the United States]] to promote their schools in the [[Middle East]]. The article noted that in doing so, the schools promote the  work of graduates of women's colleges such as [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Diane Sawyer]], [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Madeleine K. Albright]]. The Dean of Admissions of [[Bryn Mawr College]] noted, "We still prepare a disproportionate number of women scientists [...] We’re really about the empowerment of women and enabling women to get a top-notch education." The article also contrasted the difference between women's colleges in the Middle East and "the American colleges [which] for all their white-glove history and academic prominence, are liberal strongholds where students fiercely debate political action, gender identity and issues like 'heteronormativity,' the marginalizing of standards that are other than heterosexual and cisgendered. Middle Eastern students who already attend these colleges tell of a transition that can be jarring." The article further quoted a [[Sri Lanka]]n student (who had attended a coeducational school in [[Dubai]]) who stated that she was "shocked by the presence of so many lesbians among the students" and the "open displays of affection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Sisters’ Colleges See a Bounty in the Middle East |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/education/03sisters.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 3, 2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitiveness ==
While Radcliffe no longer exists as an institution independent of Harvard College, the remaining seven sisters are considered highly competitive among liberal arts institutions in the United States. Wellesley College consistently ranks in the top 3 or 4 of national liberal arts colleges, and Smith and Vassar were most recently ranked 12 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/smith-college-2209|title=US News Rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants' GPA's tend to be over 3.6 combined with high SAT scores and strong extra-curricular leadership experience. Applicants tend to be academically driven and successful.

The Wall Street Journal recently summarized their college rankings of the seven sister colleges, including factors such as engagement, outcomes, resources and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-seven-sisters-colleges-ranked-1478888001|title=Wall Street Journal Rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender issues==
{{main|Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges}}
Since the late 2000s, there has been discussion and controversy over how to accommodate [[transgender]] inclusion at the remaining women's colleges. This has risen to attention due to a small, yet increasing number of students that have in the course of their times at the colleges transitioned from female to male ([[trans man|trans men]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/04/08/when_she_graduates_as_he/ |title=When She Graduates as He |first=Adrian |last=Brune |work=[[The Boston Globe|The Boston Globe Magazine]] |date=April 8, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[trans women]] applicants. [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]] became the first Seven Sisters college to accept transgender women in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellaway |first=Mitch |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/09/03/watch-first-seven-sisters-schools-admit-trans-women |title=WATCH: First of 'Seven Sisters' Schools to Admit Trans Women |publisher=Advocate.com |date=2014-09-03 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barnard College|Barnard]], [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Smith College|Smith]], and Wellesley College announced trans-inclusive admissions policies in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.barnard.edu/news/barnard-announces-transgender-admissions-policy |title=Barnard Announces Transgender Admissions Policy |publisher=Barnard College website |date=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.brynmawr.edu/2015/02/09/a-letter-from-bryn-mawr-board-chair-arlene-gibson/ |title=A Letter from Bryn Mawr Board Chair Arlene Gibson |first=Arlene |last=Gibson |publisher=Bryn Mawr College website |date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smith.edu/studygroup/ |title=Admission Policy Announcement |publisher=Smith College website |date=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture and the news==

In the 2003 ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]", [[Lisa Simpson]] dreams that [[personification]]s of each of the Seven Sisters colleges are attempting to woo her into attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/12812.shtml| last=| first=| title=Seven Sisters| publisher=[[Mount Holyoke College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1978 film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' satirizes a common practice (until the mid-1970s), when women attending Seven Sister colleges were connected with or to students at [[Ivy League]] schools. The film, which takes place in 1962, shows fraternity brothers from Delta House of the fictional [[Faber College#Fictional colleges and universities|Faber College]] (based on [[Dartmouth College]]) taking a road trip to the fictional [[Faber College#Fictional colleges and universities|Emily Dickinson College]] (based on [[Mount Holyoke College]]) to obtain dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview| last=Landis| first=John| subjectlink=John Landis| interviewer=Soledad O'Brien| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0308/29/se.09.html |date=August 29, 2003 |work=Live from the Headlines| publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early scene of the 1987 film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', Dr. Jake Housemann (played by Jerry Orbach) in referring to his daughter, Baby Housemann (Jennifer Grey) announces that “Baby is going to Mount Holyoke in the fall.” 

The [[Love Story (1970 film)|movie]] and [[Love Story (novel)|book]] ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' shows a relationship between a Harvard man and Radcliffe woman.

In November 2016, the presidents of the Seven Sister colleges collectively wrote an open letter to [[Steve Bannon]], an appointee of the President-elect, who spoke negatively about the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/11/21/seven-sisters-colleges-respond-to-steve-bannons-derogatory-remark-with-open-letter|title=Seven Sisters colleges respond to Steve Bannon's derogatory remark with open letter|last=DeCost-Klipa|first=Nik|date=November 21, 2016|work=Boston Globe|access-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3465">The '''''Suaire de Saint-Josse''''', the "Shroud of [[Saint Josse]]" that is now conserved in the [[Musée du Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Sheila S. Blair and Jonathan M. Bloom, "The Mirage of Islamic Art: Reflections on the Study of an Unwieldy Field", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''85'''.1 (March 2003:152-184), p. 154, fig. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; is a rich silk  [[samite]] saddle cloth that was woven in northeastern Iran, some time before 961, when Abu Mansur Bakhtegin, the "camel-prince" for whom it was woven, was beheaded. It was brought back from the [[First Crusade]] by [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Étienne de Blois]] and dedicated as a votive gift at the [[Saint-Josse|Abbey of Saint-Josse]], near [[Caen]], Normandy.  It has been described as "the major landmark in early Islamic silk weaving".&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

This fragmentary textile with elephants woven into the design is the only known surviving example of a silk textile produced in Eastern Iran, in the royal workshops of the [[Samanid dynasty]], probably at either [[Merv]] or [[Nishapur]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Museum: "The Saint-Josse Shroud".&lt;/ref&gt; The "prince" referred to in the woven [[Kufic]] inscription, though decipherable in more than one way, is most likely to refer to the general and [[emir]] Bukhtegin, active in the service of [[Abd al-Malik I (Samanid emir)|'Abd al-Malik I]], the Samanid sultan of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], 954-61.

The cloth is now in two fragments, which are regarded as comprising about half of the original piece.  They are 52 x 94&amp;nbsp;cm and 24.5 x 62&amp;nbsp;cm respectively, the first measurement being the length.  The design was somewhat like a carpet (not that any from this date survive), with a central field containing two pairs of confronted elephants, one above the other, of which one pair survive. There is then a thin border with geometric patterns, outside which the sides have friezes of repeated camels and at least the bottom (which survives) an inscription in [[Kufic]] script. In all there are five zones of border between the elephants and the edge of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 74.  The image in Jones appears to be a photo-reconstruction, as more is shown than in the Louvre's photograph.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many trophies of foreign adventure, both in the [[Middle Ages]] and in more modern times, in its new context, the rare textile was given new meaning, for it was used to wrap the bones of [[Saint Josse]] when he was reinterred in 1134.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bernus, H. Marchal, and G. Vial, "Le Suaire de St-Josse", ''Bulletin de Liaison du Centre International d'Études des Textiles Anciens'' '''33''' (1971:1-57).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Abbey of Saint-Josse was secularised just before the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;The Abbey of Saint-Josse was closed in 1772, sold and then deismantled in 1789, leaving no traces of the monumental buildings.&lt;/ref&gt; the abbey church became the parish church of the [[French commune]] of [[Saint-Josse]];  the ''suaire'' was kept there until it was transferred to the Louvre.

The '''Theology Institute of Azerbaijan''' is a [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] higher education institution specializing in theology. It operates under the direction of the [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] ({{Lang-az|Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dini Qurumlarla İş üzrə Dövlət Komitəsinin tabeliyində Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutu}}). The rector of the University is Jeyhun Mammadov.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azernews.az/nation/137676.html|title=Opening ceremony of Azerbaijan Institute of Theology held in Baku|last=|first=|date=2018-09-17|work=AzerNews.az|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, three departments and one faculty comprise the institution. Education is carried out in Azerbaijani.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Azerbaycan_Ilahiyyat_Institutunun_achilisi_olub-1195028|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun açılışı olub|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute was developed under the auspices of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan. A decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan|President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated 9 February 2018 authorized its creation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/27001|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun yaradılması haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree ensured inclusion of the faculty of Theology of the [[Baku State University]] in the Institute of Theology.

The opening ceremony took place on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Logo ==
The Institute announced a contest on 26 July 2018 to organize its logo. For this purpose, a commission was created, consisting of:

* Yagut Aliyeva, the Director of the Public Relations Department of the State Committee for Religious Organizations
* Eldar Mikayilzade, the People's Artist of Azerbaijan
* Zaur Orujov, the scientific worker of the [[Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan]]
* Kevser Tagiyev, the teacher of the Azerbaijan Institute of Theology

106 different logos were presented. On 8 August the submission of Konul Mammadzadeh was chosen. According to the unanimous opinion of the commission, the logo reflected the purpose and mission of the Institute. Specifically, the human symbol whose hands are turned toward the sky reflects how multiculturalism and tolerance communicate with God, the book represents the main source of knowledge, and the olive branch expresses peace and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.az/din/i-lahiyyat-i-nstitutunun-loqosu-mueyyenlesib/|title=İlahiyyat İnstitutunun loqosu müəyyənləşib|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the institute is to ensure the preservation and development of the religious and spiritual environment, based on the historical traditions of the Azerbaijani people. Philosophy, sociology, psychology, multiculturalism, informatics and other social and humanitarian sciences are to be taught along with religious sciences. 35 places for Islamic studies and 25 places for Religious studies were approved for the academic year 2018-2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Conservation status}}
'''Threatened species''' are any species (including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.) which are vulnerable to [[Species endangerment|endangerment]] in the near future.  Species that are threatened are sometimes characterised by the [[population dynamics]] measure of ''[[critical depensation]]'', a mathematical measure of [[biomass]] related to [[population growth rate]]. This quantitative metric is one method of evaluating the degree of endangerment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liermann|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Depensation: evidence, models and implications|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/LiermannM_2001_FishFish.pdf|journal=Fish and Fisheries|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==IUCN definition==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) is the foremost authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened:

*[[Vulnerable species]]
*[[Endangered species]]
*[[Critically endangered species]]

Less-than-threatened categories are [[near threatened]], [[least concern]], and the no longer assigned category of [[conservation dependent]]. Species which have not been evaluated (NE), or do not have sufficient data ([[data deficient]]) also are not considered "threatened" by the IUCN.

[[File:Status iucn3.1 threatened.svg|thumb|left|The three categories of the threatened species [[IUCN Red List]].]]

Although ''threatened'' and ''vulnerable'' may be used interchangeably when discussing IUCN categories, the term ''threatened'' is generally used to refer to the three categories (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable), while ''vulnerable'' is used to refer to the least at risk of those three categories. They may be used interchangeably in most contexts however, as all vulnerable species are threatened species (''vulnerable'' is a category of ''threatened species''); and, as the more at-risk categories of threatened species (namely ''endangered'' and ''critically endangered'') must, by definition, also qualify as vulnerable species, all threatened species may also be considered vulnerable.

Threatened species are also referred to as a [[red-listed]] species, as they are listed in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

[[Subspecies]], populations and stocks may also be classified as threatened.

==United States definition==
[[File:Status ESA LT.svg|left|thumb|"Threatened" in relation to "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act|ESA]].]]

Under the [[Endangered Species Act]] in the United States, "threatened" is defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Laws &amp; Policies - Endangered Species Act - Section 3 Definitions|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species|last=Program|date=|website=www.fws.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429155642/https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|archivedate=29 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the less protected of the two protected categories. The [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha bayensis'') is an example of a threatened subspecies protected under the ESA.

Within the U.S., state wildlife agencies have the authority under the ESA to manage species which are considered endangered or threatened within their state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species.  For example, the [[trumpeter swan]] (''Cygnus buccinator'') is threatened in the state of [[Minnesota]], while large populations still remain in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|title=Minnesota Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List|author=|date=|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114000/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian definition==
The Commonwealth of Australia has legislation for categorising and protecting endangered species, namely the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]], which is known in short as the EPBC Act.  This act has six categories;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html#categories Threatened species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072705/http://environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and conservation dependent, defined in Section 179 of the act, and could be summarised as;
*"Extinct" - "no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died",
*"Extinct in the wild" - "known only to survive in cultivation" and "despite exhaustive surveys" has not been seen in the wild,
*"Critically endangered" - "extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future",
*"Endangered" - "very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future",
*"Vulnerable" - "high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term future", and
*"Conservation dependent" - "focus of a specific conservation program" without which the species would enter one of the above categories.

The EPBC Act also recognises and protects threatened ecosystems such as plant communities, and [[Ramsar Convention]] wetlands used by migratory birds.

Individual states and territories of Australia are bound under the EPBC Act, but may also have legislation which gives further protection to certain species, for example Western Australia's [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950]].  Some species, such as [[Lewin's rail]] (''Lewinia pectoralis''), are not listed as threatened species under the EPBC Act, but they may be recognised as threatened by individual states or territories.

====Threatening Processes====
Pests and weeds, climate change and habitat loss are some of the key threatening processes facing native plants and animals [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/about-threatened-species/key-threatening-processes listed by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22682">'''Uncertainty quantification (UQ)''' is the science of quantitative characterization and reduction of [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in both computational and real world applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.

Many problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. [[Computer experiment]]s on [[computer model|computer simulation]]s are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Sacks, William J. Welch, Toby J. Mitchell and Henry P. Wynn, ''Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments'', Statistical Science, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Nov., 1989), pp. 409-423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Iman, Jon C. Helton, ''An Investigation of Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis Techniques for Computer Models'', Risk Analysis, Volume 8, Issue 1, pages 71–90, March 1988, DOI: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01155.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Walker, P. Harremoës, J. Rotmans, J.P. van der Sluijs, M.B.A. van Asselt, P. Janssen and M.P. Krayer von Krauss, ''Defining Uncertainty: A Conceptual Basis for Uncertainty Management in Model-Based Decision Support'', Integrated Assessment, Volume 4, Issue 1, 2003, DOI: 10.1076/iaij.4.1.5.16466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of uncertainty==
Uncertainty can enter [[mathematical model]]s and experimental measurements in various contexts. One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:&lt;ref name="KennedyOHagan"&gt;Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, ''Bayesian calibration of computer models'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B Volume 63, Issue 3, pages 425–464, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

; Parameter uncertainty: This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by [[statistical methods]]. Some examples of this are the local [[free fall|free-fall]] acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and [[multiplier uncertainty]] in the context of [[macroeconomic policy]] optimization.
; Parametric variability: This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.
; Structural uncertainty: Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.
; Algorithmic uncertainty: Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the [[finite element method]] or [[finite difference|finite difference method]] may be used to approximate the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation.
; Experimental uncertainty: Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables.
; Interpolation uncertainty: This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses.

===Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty===
Uncertainty is sometimes classified into two categories,&lt;ref&gt;Armen Der Kiureghiana, Ove Ditlevsen, ''Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?'', Structural Safety, Volume 31, Issue 2, March 2009, Pages 105–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann G. Matthies, ''Quantifying uncertainty: modern computational representation of probability and applications'', Extreme Man-Made and Natural Hazards in Dynamics of Structures, NATO Security through Science Series, 2007, 105-135, DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4020-5656-7_4&lt;/ref&gt; although the validity of this categorization is open to debate.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} These categories are prominently seen in medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Abhaya Indrayan, "Medical Biostatistics, Second Edition", Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press, 2008, pages 8, 673&lt;/ref&gt;

; Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. For example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points.  The argument here is obviously in the definition of "cannot".  Just because we cannot measure sufficiently with our currently available measurement devices does not preclude necessarily the existence of such information, which would move this uncertainty into the below category.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
; Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but doesn't in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration.

In real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward to perform, depending on the application. Techniques such as the [[Monte Carlo method]] are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] (in the [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] case, the [[mean]] and [[covariance]] suffice, although it should be noted that, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as [[Karhunen–Loève theorem|Karhunen–Loève]] and [[polynomial chaos]] expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as [[probability bounds analysis]], [[fuzzy logic]] or evidence theory ([[Dempster–Shafer theory]] – a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.

==Two types of uncertainty quantification problems==
There are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the '''forward''' propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the '''inverse''' assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.

===Forward uncertainty propagation===
{{See also|Propagation of uncertainty}}
Uncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the ''parametric variability'' listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be:
* To evaluate low-order moments of the outputs, i.e. [[mean]] and [[variance]].
* To evaluate the reliability of the outputs. This is especially useful in [[reliability engineering]] where outputs of a system are usually closely related to the performance of the system.
* To assess the complete probability distribution of the outputs. This is useful in the scenario of [[utility]] optimization where the complete distribution is used to calculate the utility.

===Inverse uncertainty quantification===
{{see also|Inverse problem}}
Given some experimental measurements of a system and some computer simulation results from its mathematical model, inverse uncertainty quantification estimates the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model (which is called '''bias correction'''), and estimates the values of unknown parameters in the model if there are any (which is called '''parameter calibration''' or simply '''calibration'''). Generally this is a much more difficult problem than forward uncertainty propagation; however it is of great importance since it is typically implemented in a model updating process. There are several scenarios in inverse uncertainty quantification:
[[File:Bias Correction.png|thumb|right|300px|The outcome of bias correction, including an updated model (prediction mean) and prediction confidence interval.]]

====Bias correction only====
Bias correction quantifies the ''model inadequacy'', i.e. the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model. The general model updating formula for bias correction is:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x})+\delta(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the experimental measurements as a function of several input variables &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the computer model (mathematical model) response, &lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the additive discrepancy function (aka bias function), and &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; denotes the experimental uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the discrepancy function &lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;, and as a by-product, the resulting updated model is &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x})+\delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. A prediction confidence interval is provided with the updated model as the quantification of the uncertainty.

====Parameter calibration only====
Parameter calibration estimates the values of one or more unknown parameters in a mathematical model. The general model updating formulation for calibration is:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^*)+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the computer model response that depends on several unknown model parameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt; denotes the true values of the unknown parameters in the course of experiments. The objective is to either estimate &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt;, or to come up with a probability distribution of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt; that encompasses the best knowledge of the true parameter values.

====Bias correction and parameter calibration====
It considers an inaccurate model with one or more unknown parameters, and its model updating formulation combines the two together:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^*)+\delta(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
It is the most comprehensive model updating formulation that includes all possible sources of uncertainty, and it requires the most effort to solve.

==Selective methodologies for uncertainty quantification==
Much research has been done to solve uncertainty quantification problems, though a majority of them deal with uncertainty propagation. During the past one to two decades, a number of approaches for inverse uncertainty quantification problems have also been developed and have proved to be useful for most small- to medium-scale problems.

===Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation===
Existing uncertainty propagation approaches include probabilistic approaches and non-probabilistic approaches. There are basically five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation:&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Lee and W. Chen, ''A comparative study of uncertainty propagation methods for black-box-type problems'', Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization
Volume 37, Number 3 (2009), 239-253, DOI: 10.1007/s00158-008-0234-7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simulation-based methods: [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulations]], [[importance sampling]], adaptive sampling, etc.
* Local expansion-based methods: Taylor series, [[Perturbation theory|perturbation method]], etc. These methods have advantages when dealing with relatively small input variability and outputs that don't express high nonlinearity. These linear or linearized methods are detailed in the article [[Uncertainty propagation]].
* Functional expansion-based methods: Neumann expansion, orthogonal or Karhunen-Loeve expansions (KLE), with [[Polynomial chaos|polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)]] and wavelet expansions as special cases.
* Most probable point (MPP)-based methods: first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM).
* Numerical integration-based methods: Full factorial numerical integration (FFNI) and dimension reduction (DR).
For non-probabilistic approaches, [[Interval arithmetic|interval analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Kieffer|first2=M.|last3=Didrit|first3=O.|last4=Walter|first4=E.|title=Applied Interval Analysis|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=1-85233-219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy theory]], possibility theory and evidence theory are among the most widely used.

The probabilistic approach is considered as the most rigorous approach to uncertainty analysis in engineering design due to its consistency with the theory of decision analysis. Its cornerstone is the calculation of probability density functions for sampling statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.npl.co.uk/npl_web/pdf/tqe2.pdf Arnaut, L. R. Measurement uncertainty in reverberation chambers - I. Sample statistics. Technical report TQE 2, 2nd. ed., sec. 3.1, National Physical Laboratory, 2008.]
&lt;/ref&gt; This can be performed rigorously for random variables that are obtainable as transformations of Gaussian variables, leading to exact confidence intervals.

===Methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification===

====Frequentist====
In [[regression analysis]] and [[least squares]] problems, the [[standard error]] of [[parameter estimate]]s is readily available, which can be expanded into a [[confidence interval]].

====Bayesian====
Several methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification exist under the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]]. The most complicated direction is to aim at solving problems with both bias correction and parameter calibration. The challenges of such problems include not only the influences from model inadequacy and parameter uncertainty, but also the lack of data from both computer simulations and experiments. A common situation is that the input settings are not the same over experiments and simulations.

=====Modular Bayesian approach=====
An approach to inverse uncertainty quantification is the modular Bayesian approach.&lt;ref name="KennedyOHagan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, ''Supplementary Details on Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models'', Sheffield, University of Sheffield: 1-13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The modular Bayesian approach derives its name from its four-module procedure. Apart from the current available data, a [[prior distribution]] of unknown parameters should be assigned.

;'''Module 1:''' Gaussian process modeling for the computer model

To address the issue from lack of simulation results, the computer model is replaced with a [[Gaussian process|Gaussian Process (GP)]] model
:&lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta})\sim\mathcal{GP}\big(\mathbf{h}^m(\cdot)^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^m,\sigma_m^2R^m(\cdot,\cdot)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; R^m\big((\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}),(\mathbf{x}',\boldsymbol{\theta}')\big)=\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^d \omega_k^m(x_k-x_k')^2\right\}\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^r \omega_{d+k}^m(\theta_k-\theta_k')^2 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of input variables, and &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of unknown parameters.While &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h}^m(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is pre-defined, &lt;math&gt; \left\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^m, \sigma_m, \omega_k^m, k=1,\ldots,d+r\right\} &lt;/math&gt;, known as ''[[hyperparameter]]s'' of the GP model, need to be estimated via [[Maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)]]. This module can be considered as a generalized [[Kriging]] method.

;'''Module 2:''' Gaussian process modeling for the discrepancy function
Similarly with the first module, the discrepancy function is replaced with a GP model
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x})\sim\mathcal{GP}\big(\mathbf{h}^\delta(\cdot)^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^\delta,\sigma_\delta^2R^\delta(\cdot,\cdot)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; R^\delta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^d \omega_k^\delta(x_k-x_k')^2 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
Together with the prior distribution of unknown parameters, and data from both computer models and experiments, one can derive the maximum likelihood estimates for &lt;math&gt; \left\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^\delta, \sigma_\delta, \omega_k^\delta, k=1,\ldots,d\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta}^m &lt;/math&gt; from Module 1 gets updated as well.

;'''Module 3:''' Posterior distribution of unknown parameters
[[Bayes' theorem]] is applied to calculate the [[posterior distribution]] of the unknown parameters:
:&lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\rm{data},\boldsymbol{\phi})\propto p(\rm{data}|\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi})p(\boldsymbol{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; includes all the fixed hyperparameters in previous modules.

;'''Module 4:''' Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function

=====Fully Bayesian approach=====
Fully Bayesian approach requires that not only the priors for unknown parameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; but also the priors for the other hyperparameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; should be assigned. It follows the following steps:&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;F. Liu, [[M. J. Bayarri]] and J.O.Berger, ''Modularization in Bayesian Analysis, with Emphasis on Analysis of Computer Models'', Bayesian Analysis (2009) 4, Number 1, pp. 119-150, DOI:10.1214/09-BA404&lt;/ref&gt;

# Derive the posterior distribution &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt;;
# Integrate &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; out and obtain &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt;. This single step accomplishes the calibration;
# Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function.

However, the approach has significant drawbacks:
* For most cases, &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt; is a highly intractable function of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the integration becomes very troublesome. Moreover, if priors for the other hyperparameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; are not carefully chosen, the complexity in numerical integration increases even more.
* In the prediction stage, the prediction (which should at least include the expected value of system responses) also requires numerical integration. [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)]] is often used for integration; however it is computationally expensive.

The fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

==Known issues==
The theories and methodologies for uncertainty propagation are much better established, compared with inverse uncertainty quantification. For the latter, several difficulties remain unsolved:
# Dimensionality issue: The computational cost increases dramatically with the dimensionality of the problem, i.e. the number of input variables and/or the number of unknown parameters.
# Identifiability issue:&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, P., W. Chen, and D. Apley, ''Improving Identifiability in Model Calibration Using Multiple Responses'', DETC2011-48623, ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences, August 28–31, Washington, D.C., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple combinations of unknown parameters and discrepancy function can yield the same experimental prediction. Hence different values of parameters cannot be distinguished/identified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7834">[[Explosive material]]s are produced in numerous physical forms for their use in mining, engineering, or military applications.  The different physical forms and fabrication methods are grouped together in several '''use forms of explosives'''.

Explosives are sometimes used in their pure forms, but most common applications transform or modify them.

These use forms are commonly categorized as:&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;

== Castings ==
Castings, or castable explosives, are explosive materials or mixtures in which at least one component can be safely melted at a temperature which is safe to handle the other components, and which are normally produced by casting or pouring the molten mixture or material into a form or use container.

In modern usage, '''[[Trinitrotoluene]]''' or '''TNT''' is the basic meltable explosive used in essentially all castable explosives.

Other ingredients found in modern castable explosives include:&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;
* Active, energetic or explosive ingredients:
** [[Aluminum powder]]
** [[Ammonium nitrate]]
** [[Ammonium picrate]]
** [[Barium nitrate]]
** [[Ethylenedinitramine|EDNA]]
** [[HMX]]
** [[Lead nitrate]]
** [[PETN]]
** [[Sodium picrate]]
** [[RDX]]
** [[Tetryl]]
* Inert ingredients
** [[Boric acid]]
** [[Calcium chloride]]
** [[Wax]]
** [[Silica]], often in the form of [[silica fume]] ([[Cab-o-sil]] for example)

Common castable explosives include:
* [[Amatol]]
* [[Baratol]]
* [[Boracitol]]
* [[Composition B]]
* [[Cyclotol]]
* [[Octol]]
* [[Pentolite]]
* [[Plumbatol]]
* [[Tritonal]]
* [[Torpex]]
* [[IMX-101]]

== Polymer bonded ==
Polymer-bonded explosives, also known as Plastic-bonded explosives or simply '''PBX''', are a relatively solid and inflexible explosive form containing a powdered explosive material and a polymer (plastic) binder.  These are usually carefully mixed, often with a very thin coating of the polymer onto the powder grains of the explosive material, and then hot pressed to form dense solid blocks of PBX material.

There are numerous PBX explosives, mostly based on [[RDX]], [[HMX]], or [[TATB]] explosive materials.  An extensive but by no means complete list of PBX materials is in the main [[Polymer-bonded explosive]] article.  The major naming systems for PBX use:
* LX-# ([[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] developed PBXes)
* PBX #### ([[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] developed PBXes)
* PBXN-# ([[United States Navy]] developed PBXes)

LX numbers range from 1 to 17.  PBX system numbers start around 9000 and use numerous scattered numbers between there and 9700.

Some commonly known PBXes are:
* [[LX-17]]
* [[PBX 9502]]
* [[PBX 9404]]
* [[LX-11]]
* [[LX-14]]

PBXes are notable for their use in modern [[Nuclear weapons]].  Modern US and British nuclear warheads nearly all use [[Insensitive munitions|insensitive]] PBX types using only [[TATB]] explosive, to increase safety in case of accidents.

== Putties, aka Plastic explosives ==
Technically known as '''putties''', but more commonly '''[[Plastic explosives]]''', these mixtures are a thick, flexible, moldable solid material that can be shaped and will retain that shape after forming, much like [[clay]].  Putties normally contain mostly [[RDX]] explosive, but may include some [[PETN]] (Semtex, for example).

Some common putties are:
* [[C-4_(explosive)|C4]]
* (Now-obsolete) [[Composition C]]
* [[Semtex]]
* [[PE-4]]

== Rubberized ==
Rubberized explosives are flat sheets of solid but flexible material, a mixture of a powdered explosive (commonly [[RDX]] or [[PETN]]) and a synthetic or natural rubber compound.  Rubberized sheet explosives are commonly used for [[Explosion welding|explosive welding]] and for various other industrial and military applications.  Rubberized explosives can be cut to specific shape, bent around solid surfaces, glued or taped in place, or simply laid on relatively flat surfaces.

Some common rubberized explosives include:&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;
* '''[[Detasheet]]''' - a discontinued [[DuPont]] product
** '''Deta Flex''' - a DuPont military version of Detasheet
** '''LX-02-1''' - a DuPont Deta Flex variant used by the [[US Department of Energy]] nuclear weapons programs
* '''[[Primasheet]]''' - current [[Ensign-Bickford Company|Ensign-Bickford]] product line
** '''[[Primasheet#Primasheet 1000|Primasheet 1000]]''' - Primasheet 1000 using [[PETN]]
** '''[[Primasheet#Primasheet 2000|Primasheet 2000]]''' - Primasheet 2000 using [[RDX]]

== Extrudable ==
Extrudable explosives are an extremely viscous liquid, similar in properties to [[silicone]] based [[caulk]]ing materials used in construction.  It is used in similar ways - stored in a container, then extruded out a nozzle into thin cracks, holes, or along surfaces.

Some extrudable explosives can then be hardened using a heat curing process.  Others will remain a viscous fluid permanently.

Common extrudable explosives include:
* Setting extrudables
** [[LX-13]]
** [[XTX-8003]]
** [[XTX-8004]]
* Non-setting extrudables
** [[Demex-400]]

== Binary ==
[[Binary explosives]] are '''cap-sensitive''' (detonatable with a standard #8 [[blasting cap]]) two-part explosives mixtures, shipped separately and combined at the use site.

Many of these mixtures are based on [[Ammonium nitrate]] as an oxidizer plus a volatile fuel, but unlike [[ANFO]] (ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosive) these binaries can be detonated by blasting caps.  ANFO requires high explosive boosters to detonate it.

Most binary explosives are a slurry after mixing, but some form a fluid with solid components dissolved into liquid ones.

Some common binary explosives include:
* Kinestik (ammonium nitrate/nitromethane)
* Tannerite (ammonium nitrate/aluminum)
* [[Kinepouch]]
* [[Kinepak]]
* Boulder-Busters
* Marine Pac
* [[ASTRO-PAK]]

The historical but now uncommon [[Astrolite]] explosive is also a binary explosive.

This category is somewhat unusual in that a single explosives researcher, [[Gerald Hurst]], was responsible for inventing and developing most of the explosive mixtures now in use.&lt;ref name="Yarchive"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blasting agents ==
Blasting agents are explosive materials or mixtures which are not detonatable by standard #8 [[blasting cap]]s.

The best known blasting agent is [[ANFO]] explosive, a mixture containing primarily [[ammonium nitrate]] with a small quantity (typically around 6%) of fuel oil, most commonly [[diesel fuel]].  Other fuels and additives are used as well.

While ANFO is often made on-site using fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate, blasting agents can also be purchased in prepackaged form, usually in metal or cardboard cylinders.  Some brand names of packaged blasting agents include:
* Nitramon
* Nitramite
* Pellite
* Carbomite
* Vibronite
* Dynatex
* Hydratol
* Anoil

== Dynamites ==
It is usually sold in the form of a stick roughly eight inches (20 cm) long and one inch (2.5 cm) in diameter but other sizes also exist.

Dynamite is considered a "high explosive", which means it detonates rather than deflagrates.

The chief uses of dynamite used to be in construction, mining and demolition.

However, newer explosives and techniques have replaced dynamite in many applications.

Dynamite is still used, mainly as bottom charge or in underwater blasting.
